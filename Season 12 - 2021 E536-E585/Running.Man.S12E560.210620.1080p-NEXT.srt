1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,450
(Summer has already arrived.)

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,740
I came out of the house after a long time.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,040
(And there's a girl
who doesn't seem easy to deal with.)

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,710
I had cup noodles
before going to sleep last night.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,920
So Min, you're the president
of the Running Game Club.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,830
Today is the first get-together
of the game club.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,290
You will open a group chat room...

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,760
and invite the members
to the get-together.

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,900
First, I'll meet the members...

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,100
of the club.

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,630
(Killer So Min has joined the chat.)

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,670
(Kwang Soo Is No Fool has joined the chat)

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,540
There's a nickname,
"Kwang Soo Is No Fool."

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,830
(Kwang Soo Is No Fool has joined the chat)

15
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,840
Who's that?

16
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,770
(Hurry and join the chat.)

17
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,580
Killing So Min?

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,010
(Dark Tornado has joined the chat.)

19
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,150
Who's Dark Tornado?

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,550
(I hate the nickname, "Dark Tornado.")

21
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,080
Dark Tornado?

22
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,190
He says he hates it. Has it begun?

23
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,550
(Push Ahead No Matter What
has joined the chat.)

24
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,620
Who's Push Ahead No Matter What?
That's just lame.

25
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,660
(Hello.)

26
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,660
(Kwang Soo Is No Fool,
you might be in trouble.)

27
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,140
Dark Tornado?

28
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,230
Kwang Soo Is No Fool.

29
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,460
Who's Pink Princess?

30
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,510
Who is Pink Princess?

31
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,270
Pink...

32
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,650
Hey, guys.

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,240
Let's meet in person.

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,470
(Hey, guys. Let's meet in person.)

35
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,320
Meet in person.

36
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,120
(ID, Pink Princess)

37
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,160
In person...

38
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,160
(Mustache Bomber has joined the chat.)

39
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,220
Mustache Bomber? It must be Haha.

40
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,990
I'm sure it's Haha.

41
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,960
Okay. I did it.

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Hi.

43
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,660
(ID, Mustache Bomber)

44
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,770
Kwang Soo Is No Fool? Who's that?

45
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,830
(Guys, calm down.)

46
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,410
(I'm quite tough.)

47
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,930
(The 6 members of Running Game Club
have joined the chat.)

48
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,940
(But there's one member missing.)

49
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,970
(The last member is coming
with an extraordinary aura.)

50
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,080
Hello.

51
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,660
(Giggling)

52
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,850
So cute.

53
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,380
What's that thing?

54
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,990
This is my friend, Kwang Jjang.

55
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,350
I miss my friend, Kwang Jjang.

56
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,370
(The stuffed doll in the giraffe
costume is Kwang Jjang.)

57
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,520
Kwang Jjang.

58
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,030
What's this?

59
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,900
This is my friend, Kwang Jjang.
Say hello, Kwang Jjang.

60
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,480
Hello.

61
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,610
He's so cute.

62
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,340
I bet he's a close friend
if you brought him here.

63
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,150
But I lost my friend.

64
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,990
So I brought someone else
who's Kwang Jjang.

65
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,450
Right, Kwang Jjang?

66
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,080
(While a member has gone insane
after losing his friend...)

67
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,360
(All right.)

68
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,460
(Hello, guys.)

69
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,120
(I'm the president.)

70
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Who's Touch and Explode?

71
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,370
(Touch and Explode has joined the chat.)

72
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,370
(Touch and Explode,
I really want to make you explode.)

73
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,170
(You're going to explode,
Touch and Explode.)

74
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,270
Explode?

75
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,670
(Let's meet in person,
Touch and Explode.)

76
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,930
They say I'll explode.

77
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,400
(All 7 members have joined the chat.)

78
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,650
(These are crocodile tears.)

79
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,270
(They suddenly start
criticizing each other.)

80
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,680
(He's a crybaby.)

81
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,950
(He goes around weeping.)

82
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,650
(Dark Tornado was born in 1966.)

83
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,490
What? It's up.

84
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,580
"Everyone, before our get-together..."

85
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,750
(Everyone, before our get-together,
we should be divided into teams.)

86
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,520
(Meet up with the members
you want as your teammates...)

87
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,930
(and come to the meeting place.)

88
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,300
Select the members you want
by chatting with them.

89
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,670
(They must choose the members
they want as teammates...)

90
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,800
(and begin the get-together.)

91
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,830
(Kwang Soo Is No Fool,
where are you now?)

92
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,680
(Who wants to team up with me?
Dark Tornado, you shouldn't cry.)

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,480
(I'm curious about the crybaby.
Let's meet in person.)

94
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,580
(I want you to use honorifics
and not ask common-sense questions.)

95
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,680
(They should team up with members
they like before the get-together.)

96
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,310
I'm curious about the other members.

97
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,450
I'm finally meeting with the members.

98
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,080
This is our first get-together.

99
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,080
I've never done this before.

100
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,390
I want to meet everyone.
Pink Princess,

101
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,460
Kwang Soo Is No Fool, and Dark Tornado...

102
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,900
I want to meet them.

103
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,460
I'm excited.
What would they be like?

104
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,830
(Even Dark Tornado is excited
to attend the meeting.)

105
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,460
Fasten your seat belt, Kwang Jjang.

106
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,000
Kwang Jjang.

107
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,240
Done. Let's go.

108
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,480
I don't know how they look.

109
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,480
I'm nervous to see
what they would be like.

110
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
(The meeting place is full
of board games...)

111
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,360
(loved by a lot of game fans.)

112
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,150
(ID, Dark Tornado,
ID, Push Ahead No Matter What)

113
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,360
- Let's sit.
- Are we the first ones to arrive?

114
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,650
- Have a seat.
- Push Ahead No Matter What.

115
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,320
Dark Tornado.

116
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,630
I'm so excited to meet the other members.

117
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,870
This is our first get-together, isn't it?

118
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,060
Yes. This is our first time.

119
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,060
(He's too into his stuffed doll.)

120
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,800
- I guess someone's coming.
- I heard something.

121
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,870
This is our first meeting,
so we should greet them standing up.

122
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,640
- Stay quiet.
- Welcome.

123
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,140
Did you open a cafe here?

124
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,440
No.

125
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,120
- Are you Pink Princess?
- Pink Princess?

126
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,290
I'm Pink Princess.

127
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,750
Yes, hello.
I'm Push Ahead No Matter What.

128
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,290
You are nothing like what I expected.

129
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,750
- You think?
- Yes.

130
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,170
The thing is, he used to be a gangster.

131
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,870
What do you mean, a gangster?

132
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,100
Are you from "Countryside Diary" then?

133
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,840
- Me?
- It looks like "Countryside Diary."

134
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,910
- I know.
- You're not sophisticated at all.

135
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,170
The way you're dressed.

136
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,180
Why are you holding that?

137
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,070
- It's his friend.
- This is my family.

138
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,780
- Seriously?
- This is my younger brother.

139
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,200
- Don't be afraid, Mini.
- Really?

140
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,920
It's all right.
They are good people.

141
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,290
If you do that for weeks,
you'll end up on "What on Earth."

142
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,250
You should change your hair color.

143
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,360
- Change it to yellow.
- If you...

144
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,360
- do this for weeks...
- Mini, don't be upset. It's okay.

145
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,930
Keep doing this for weeks
and give them a call.

146
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,100
- Then they will want to meet you.
- Right.

147
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,190
They are not bad guys.
They're just saying that.

148
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,060
It's all right.

149
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,170
- Hello.
- What?

150
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,110
- Hello.
- Hello.

151
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,200
You guys are wearing glasses.

152
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,480
- Are you Dirty Mustache?
- Yes.

153
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,310
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, hey.

154
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,240
- Hello.
- Hello.

155
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,310
(Trying to figure out what's going on)

156
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,250
- Are you Touch and Explode?
- Yes.

157
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,620
Yes. If you touch me, I'll explode.

158
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Hello.

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,820
He's a bit sensitive,

160
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,320
so you shouldn't stare at him
for over three seconds.

161
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,030
- You should be careful.
- Wait. Look.

162
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,690
Those who are weak use intense nicknames.

163
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,260
(Dark Tornado, Touch and Explode,
Mustache Bomber)

164
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,040
- Think about that.
- You're right.

165
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,930
Strong guys use nicknames like this.

166
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,560
Look at the weak guys.
They have nicknames...

167
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,480
- like exploding and dynamite.
- And bomber.

168
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,300
Should I come up with something stronger?

169
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,410
What's Push Ahead No Matter What?

170
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,940
- He's on my team.
- That's right.

171
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,310
Is he your right-hand man?

172
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,350
Pink Princess,
are you his right-hand man?

173
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,450
I'm his left-hand man.
I'm on the left.

174
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,090
Excuse me. Are you his minion?

175
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,550
- Minion?
- Yes.

176
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,750
- Look.
- Pink Princess.

177
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,680
- Teach them a lesson.
- Okay.

178
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,300
Gosh, Pink Princess...

179
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,250
(He steps up to discipline them.)

180
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,370
Gosh, what's that? What is going on?

181
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,130
Isn't this "Three Meals for Jae Suk?"

182
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,170
- Pink Princess, talk to them.
- Look at you.

183
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,300
- You guys...
- Can you do that?

184
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,280
What? Let's just have a seat.

185
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,410
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

186
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,550
What do you guys do for a living?

187
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,440
- Do you even have jobs?
- I do.

188
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,680
Touch and Explode can't look me
in the eyes for over three seconds.

189
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,620
Right. I can't look people
in the eyes for over three seconds.

190
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,180
- If I do...
- What will happen then?

191
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,290
- Will you explode?
- What happens?

192
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,360
- Three seconds.
- What happens?

193
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
(As Dark Tornado looks
at his eyes for 3 seconds,)

194
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,890
(Touch and Explode explodes.)

195
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,260
I said 3 seconds. Only 3 seconds.

196
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,760
(He's punished right away.)

197
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,110
He has anger management issues.

198
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,300
- I see.
- Gosh, I'm sorry.

199
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,300
- My apologies.
- I see.

200
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,480
He was just fine.

201
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,550
- But if you stare for too long,
- I'm fine...

202
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,410
- he explodes.
- until I lose my temper.

203
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,570
The thing is,

204
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,870
now that Kwang Soo isn't here,

205
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,850
- you're playing his role.
- That's what we said.

206
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,240
- They're sharing his roles.
- That's what they're doing.

207
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,010
Right. I'm playing his role.

208
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,750
Everyone seems scary.

209
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,880
Today is...

210
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,430
the first get-together...

211
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,800
of the famous game club,
Running Game Club.

212
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,550
And you will win points
from two different games.

213
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,430
The two members with
the highest points will get prizes.

214
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,870
And the two with the lowest points
will get a penalty.

215
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,870
- All right.
- Two people?

216
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,470
The club president, Killer So Min,
will get the first game.

217
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,500
Please read it for us.

218
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,130
All right. We will be divided
into three teams...

219
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,180
to play Option Snake Ladders.

220
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,570
To play Option Snake Ladders,

221
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,140
you will start at the end
of the snake tail.

222
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,290
And the first team to reach
the snakehead wins the game.

223
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,420
Each team will spin the roulette
to move your pieces.

224
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,250
But you can...

225
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,360
lie about the numbers
you get from the roulette.

226
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,750
For example, you can say your
number is 7 when it's actually 1.

227
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,260
But if the other teams...

228
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,890
catch you in a lie,

229
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,870
your piece will go back
to the starting point.

230
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,370
If the other teams accuse you
of lying when you told the truth,

231
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,130
you get to spin
the roulette one more time.

232
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,980
So you should try reading
your opponents' minds...

233
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,110
and use it against them.

234
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,810
What if the roulette stops at "lie?"

235
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,480
In that case, you must lie.

236
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,620
- We lie?
- Yes.

237
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,590
There's more.

238
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,220
While you play this game,
if you use English words,

239
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,620
your piece goes
back to the starting point.

240
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,730
- English words?
- Yes.

241
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,990
We use quite a lot of English words.

242
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,490
I've done this before.

243
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,120
That's not fair for someone from abroad.

244
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,470
Jackson? Are you Jackson?

245
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,830
What about our nicknames?

246
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,290
Do words like Tornado and Pink count?

247
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,790
- We shouldn't call them.
- You shouldn't call them.

248
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,070
Just don't call them.

249
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,000
Or we can make the names short.

250
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,630
- Like DT.
- You can do that.

251
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,270
Each team should get a roulette.

252
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,610
I'm glad that our team doesn't
have English nicknames.

253
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,450
- Good.
- We don't know English words.

254
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,770
We don't know any, so we don't use it.

255
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,240
Those who don't speak English...

256
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,620
- use a lot of English words.
- Right.

257
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,380
- This team will go first.
- Okay.

258
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,960
The rest of you should close
your eyes then.

259
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,090
- Okay.
- All right.

260
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,460
Show us the roulette.

261
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,230
It's not easy to get "lie" from the start.

262
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,520
(What's the first number?)

263
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,490
- Nice!
- Okay.

264
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,120
He said "nice."

265
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,790
You didn't move your piece yet,
so it's okay.

266
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,990
What?

267
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,610
Don't say that.
Why do you speak English?

268
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,810
I'm sorry.

269
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,940
- I...
- Use a Korean word.

270
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,500
- That's my habit.
- Great.

271
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,950
- That's my habit.
- See?

272
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,740
Those who don't speak English
use a lot of English words.

273
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,770
Hang on.

274
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,120
- I got a call from Kwang Soo.
- Really?

275
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,320
- Answer it.
- Tell him to come right away.

276
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,090
- Kwang Soo.
- Hello, Jae Suk.

277
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,350
We're filming right now,
so I'm hanging up.

278
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,150
We're filming right now,
so I'm hanging up.

279
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,230
(He manages to cut Kwang Soo off again.)

280
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,750
I thought he wouldn't get
to cut Kwang Soo off again,

281
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,100
but he's doing it over the phone.

282
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,990
- I'm working now.
- That's unbelievable.

283
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,120
You're working?

284
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,420
You can announce the number now.

285
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,660
We got...

286
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,660
- 6.
- 6.

287
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,700
(Team Haha's number is 6.)

288
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,340
- It's perfect.
- Gosh, this is...

289
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,710
They got six?

290
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,370
- I'm moving our piece. Be careful.
- Go ahead.

291
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,530
- They're...
- Move it to number 11.

292
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,350
- Look at that.
- To number 11?

293
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,870
It's perfect.

294
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,540
- Gosh, this is...
- Hang on.

295
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,910
It's strange, isn't it?

296
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,980
Move it.

297
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,990
That's the best...

298
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,410
- We should catch him.
- You want?

299
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,640
- Let's catch them.
- Catch them.

300
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,320
1, 2, 3.

301
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,490
- It's a lie.
- It's a lie.

302
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,490
All right.

303
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,920
The fact that they got six...

304
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,420
(What's the real number
Team Haha got from the roulette?)

305
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,600
was true.

306
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,730
(True)

307
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,870
- One more time!
- Okay!

308
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,630
He just said "okay."

309
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,630
You just said "okay,"

310
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,940
so you will go back to the starting point.

311
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,630
Hey, TE!

312
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,370
My gosh.

313
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,080
- You don't even speak English.
- Did you say an English word?

314
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,110
- Did I say that?
- Was it you?

315
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,770
I said that. I'm sorry.

316
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,740
My gosh.

317
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,620
- You don't even speak English.
- This is crazy.

318
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,350
- Just say great.
- Did I say that?

319
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,650
Okay. I'm sorry.

320
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,780
- Great.
- Darn.

321
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,990
Good.

322
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,090
Here we go. Close your eyes.

323
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,250
(Next up is Team Jae Suk.)

324
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,790
You shouldn't say okay.

325
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,390
Good.

326
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,230
(The number from the roulette is...)

327
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,370
(6.)

328
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,240
(Trying to keep a straight face)

329
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,630
This is tricky.

330
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,610
(They expect Team Jae Suk to lie.)

331
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,630
All right.

332
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,130
- Good.
- Make sure not to speak in English.

333
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,640
- I bet they got something bad.
- Good.

334
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,370
- It's 6.
- 6.

335
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,500
Six?

336
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,120
(Did they get 6 again?)

337
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,740
- It's a lie.
- It must be a lie.

338
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,880
- Is it six again?
- It's a lie.

339
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,510
- It's a lie.
- I bet they're lying.

340
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,510
It's a lie.

341
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,150
1, 2, 3.

342
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,560
- It's a lie.
- Good.

343
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,650
It's true...

344
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,600
- they got six.
- Good!

345
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,650
Good.

346
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,120
The thing is,

347
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,600
my talk is so limited.

348
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,870
I can't believe this.

349
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,760
(My talk is limited.)

350
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,240
Darn it!

351
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,080
(He can't help but use English words.)

352
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,480
What should I say then?

353
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,620
- What else could I say?
- Use a Korean word.

354
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,010
Use a Korean word.

355
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,240
Don't even say "comment."

356
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,220
(Okay.)

357
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,220
- All right.
- Hey.

358
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,780
- My gosh.
- This is crazy.

359
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,750
- This is driving me crazy.
- What do we do now?

360
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,230
Okay. Let's go!

361
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,420
I shouldn't say anything.

362
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,730
Why do you use English words?

363
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,860
I shouldn't talk at all.

364
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,920
Let's go.

365
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,160
(Team Suk Jin has seen
a lot of bad examples.)

366
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,890
I don't think this game will end.

367
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,070
(They must lie this time.)

368
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,570
Put it down.

369
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,760
Put it down.

370
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,970
Announce the number now.

371
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,130
(Pushing)

372
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,870
(Pushing and pulling)

373
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,170
(The team is fighting a war of nerves.)

374
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,670
It's a war of nerves.

375
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,510
Why would you...

376
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,720
This is true, and that's false.

377
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,040
One is telling the truth,
and the other is lying.

378
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,250
True or false?

379
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,860
It's a lie!

380
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,520
True and false.

381
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,830
True or false?

382
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,200
I can't be on the same team as him.

383
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,250
- Gosh, DT.
- We need to talk.

384
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,250
Are you ready?

385
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,260
Do as you want.

386
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,620
- Shall we go?
- Move the piece.

387
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,700
(She moves her piece 2 spaces
when she has to lie.)

388
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,940
- Let's move on.
- Okay.

389
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,760
- Leave it be.
- Just move on.

390
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,710
Even if it's a lie,
we should leave it there.

391
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,630
- That was a lie.
- I see.

392
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,310
- Just leave it there.
- 1 and 2...

393
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,770
- Is it our turn?
- Yes.

394
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,370
Close your eyes.

395
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,580
Okay.

396
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,980
Okay.

397
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,380
- We don't have any pieces yet.
- Okay.

398
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,850
- Great.
- Okay. We're playing board games.

399
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,960
Cameras.

400
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,490
There are cameras.

401
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,960
- This is SBS.
- Good.

402
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,860
- Okay.
- Jae Suk will speak in English.

403
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,960
- Come on.
- You really use a lot of English.

404
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,620
Close your eyes.

405
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,660
Let me spin it.

406
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,260
(What's the number from the roulette?)

407
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,870
(It's 7.)

408
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,610
- Good.
- What color is our piece?

409
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,030
- Yellow.
- 1, 2,

410
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,500
- 3, 4, 5...
- Is it 7?

411
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,610
- It's 7.
- It's 7.

412
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,740
I'll give you three seconds.

413
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,370
- This is...
- Don't say anything.

414
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,410
- Why not?
- Don't say a word.

415
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,510
Stay quiet.

416
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,820
- I can't keep my mouth shut.
- Stay quiet.

417
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,140
I bet it's true. 1, 2, 3.

418
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,280
- True.
- True.

419
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,590
All right. It's true.

420
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,860
I knew it.

421
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,120
Close your eyes.

422
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,280
I bet he will get seven.

423
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,420
(It's Team Jae Suk's turn.)

424
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,390
I bet the team will use
an English word at the end...

425
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,750
What did you say?

426
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,520
- I heard it.
- What did you say?

427
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,700
Move your piece back.

428
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,740
Go back. Go ahead.

429
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,290
- All right.
- I shouldn't talk.

430
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,610
- Go back.
- Darn it.

431
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,970
Move it.

432
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,440
- Move it back.
- That's why you shouldn't talk.

433
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,840
I shouldn't say anything. I'm sorry.

434
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,770
We got a number.

435
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,210
- Announce your number.
- 1, 2, 3.

436
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,580
- 6.
- 6.

437
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,740
- This is...
- What?

438
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,510
- Let's go with a lie.
- It's a lie.

439
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,820
- He keeps lying.
- We should catch them.

440
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,620
Is it a lie?

441
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,690
But... PP.

442
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,990
Look at his eyes.

443
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,390
- Let's not talk.
- Who said that?

444
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,490
Who said the number six?

445
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,020
Then shall we say it's a lie...

446
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,660
and give them another chance?

447
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,890
They will speak English after all.

448
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,260
- No.
- I bet they will speak English.

449
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,070
We will never do that.

450
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,260
If he speaks English,

451
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,370
I'll beat him to death.

452
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,810
- We will say it's true.
- This guy can rip...

453
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,210
a cell phone apart.

454
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,370
I saw him rip it apart.

455
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,280
- Lie?
- True?

456
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
What is it?

457
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,910
- Let's go with truth.
- Truth.

458
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,220
- It's true.
- It's true.

459
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,690
(It's true that they got 6.)

460
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,280
- Who's next?
- I'll do it.

461
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,490
Spin it.

462
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,290
(Team Suk Jin's roulette...)

463
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,070
(shows number 3.)

464
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,100
(They will lie and say they got 4.)

465
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,700
- Are you ready?
- Yes. We're ready.

466
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,130
- Let's go.
- Catch them.

467
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,500
Let's go.

468
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,900
Okay. This is what we got.

469
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,130
- It's a lie.
- What?

470
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,840
Okay. This is what we got.

471
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,270
- It's a lie.
- What? He said that.

472
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,640
Okay.

473
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,140
(Team Suk Jin is going through
the worst time.)

474
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,490
- He got it.
- Good.

475
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,220
The word "okay" is driving me crazy.

476
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,120
What's wrong with me?

477
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,250
- Is there any tape?
- We shouldn't be like him.

478
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,420
- Good.
- Here we go.

479
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,420
Let's go.

480
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,230
It's okay to say that.
We don't have pieces on the board.

481
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,970
Good.

482
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,130
(The roulette shows 5.)

483
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,130
This is hard.

484
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,160
I'm so mad.

485
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,970
All right. Here we go.

486
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,030
- Good.
- Go.

487
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,130
1, 2,

488
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,710
3, 4,

489
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,770
- 5.
- 5?

490
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,310
It should go all the way up.

491
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,820
Then we will get to number 33.

492
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,140
It should go up.

493
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,220
(They take a shortcut to number 33.)

494
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,510
Can you believe this?

495
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,060
- Good.
- Nice.

496
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,150
Why aren't you talking?
You're being too quiet.

497
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,750
So Min just spun it.

498
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,560
And we got five.

499
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,970
Please save your breath.

500
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,120
Isn't that amazing?

501
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,630
- Right?
- But...

502
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,870
Should we give them a chance?

503
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,940
- This is too good though.
- We should risk it.

504
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,940
- Shall we?
- We have to say it's a lie.

505
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,580
Because there's a snake?

506
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,130
Even if they spin it again,

507
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,240
they might get the snake
and fall back down.

508
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,350
Right?

509
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,510
If they get the snake,
they will lie again.

510
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,820
1, 2, 3.

511
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,820
- It's a lie.
- Lie.

512
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,410
1, 2, 3.

513
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,410
- It's true.
- It's true.

514
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,410
I knew it was true.

515
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,090
I thought it was true.

516
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,330
Since it was true,
you get to spin it again.

517
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,730
Close your eyes.

518
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,830
You just spin it.

519
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,490
When they are watching?

520
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,200
You just spin the roulette
in the extra round.

521
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,620
But that's disadvantageous to us.

522
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,130
We have our patterns.

523
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,260
There are a lot of snakes.

524
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,760
We have to lie.

525
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,370
(We have our patterns.)

526
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,850
(I'm doomed.)

527
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,580
(Despite Haha's efforts...)

528
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,190
Did you say an English word?
What did you say?

529
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,220
- What did you say?
- What did he say?

530
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,410
See?

531
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,730
- What did you say?
- I'm sorry.

532
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,060
"We have our patterns."

533
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,230
(We have our patterns.)

534
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,420
I don't even know...

535
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,830
many English words.

536
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,830
How dare you!

537
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,570
Good.

538
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,430
- Well done.
- I'm sorry.

539
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,400
- My gosh.
- I only know a few words.

540
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,540
(He's going to say
all the English words he knows.)

541
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,280
- This is it.
- This is...

542
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,310
- what I want.
- What I want.

543
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,340
- If they don't speak English...
- Good.

544
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,440
- Let's never use any English words.
- Okay.

545
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,440
(I'll teach you a lesson!)

546
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,520
I don't even know how to spell
the word "pattern."

547
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,750
- Nice!
- I'm sorry.

548
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,320
- This is what I'm talking about.
- Let's...

549
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,350
- Let's start over again.
- We got this.

550
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,210
- Let's start over. I'm sorry.
- This is great.

551
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,620
- Let it slide just this once.
- Gosh. I'm so angry.

552
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,650
- This is what I'm talking about.
- They were almost there.

553
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,720
This is what I'm talking about.

554
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,120
Why did you say the word "pattern?"

555
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,770
- Gosh. Why did I do that?
- Close your eyes.

556
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,570
The roulette...

557
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,800
(Next up is Team Jae Suk,
the current winning team.)

558
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,930
It must be a small number.

559
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,630
Could it be a small number?

560
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,070
Are you done?

561
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,610
Can we open our eyes now?

562
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,670
- All right.
- Yes.

563
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,130
One.

564
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,280
- Pardon?
- One.

565
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,780
- One?
- Hold on.

566
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,470
They might have gotten two...

567
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,580
but said it was one
not to go back down here.

568
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,290
- Okay, okay.
- Right? Look here.

569
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,360
- Okay! I agree.
- Okay!

570
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,760
(Dark Tornado's theory sounds plausible.)

571
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,980
(It's hard to read
Jae Suk and Jong Kook's faces.)

572
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,800
(Did they say the truth or a lie?)

573
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,890
- Am I right?
- Let's conclude that they lied.

574
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,150
- 1, 2, 3.
- Okay. Let's do that.

575
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,370
- It's a lie!
- It's a lie!

576
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,100
Okay. We caught them.

577
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,390
- All right.
- I can't trust him.

578
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,660
2, 3.

579
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,900
- It's the truth.
- It's the truth.

580
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,510
(They told the truth.)

581
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,110
- It's the truth.
- What?

582
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,930
- It's okay. It's only one time.
- Right. It's okay.

583
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,080
- Okay.
- Please go ahead.

584
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,370
- I will...
- You can speak English now.

585
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,510
- spin it.
- That's right.

586
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,120
- I hope they get one.
- What could it be?

587
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,140
- Three?
- Oh, gosh.

588
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,140
- That's nice.
- Is it three?

589
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,380
- 1, 2, 3. What?
- That's nice.

590
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,320
- Oh, wow.
- Shout "Good!" Or "Nice!"

591
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,650
- Shout "Nice!"
- Okay!

592
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,030
- This is it!
- This is it!

593
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,100
- This is what we wanted.
- Right.

594
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,760
That team is doing so well.

595
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,460
They have great teamwork, right?

596
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,600
Let's move on.

597
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,300
- Please close your eyes, everyone.
- That's...

598
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,340
- a really good strategy.
- As you all must know,

599
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,130
- you can lie to move far at once.
- Okay.

600
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,580
Aren't we allowed to tell a lie
only when it stops on "lie?"

601
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,670
- You're wrong.
- You're wrong.

602
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,310
- We can lie whenever we want...
- It doesn't matter?

603
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,080
- I didn't know that.
- It doesn't matter.

604
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,850
Jae Suk, you can lie any time you want.

605
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,940
- Don't say any English words.
- I won't.

606
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,020
- Let's catch them lying.
- Any time we want? Okay.

607
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,940
(Team Suk Jin, which is still
at the starting point, got 6.)

608
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,450
- Are you done?
- Okay. We'll move.

609
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,760
Let's just let them go.

610
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,330
We'll be okay.
Let's let them go for now.

611
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,330
That's a lie.

612
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,600
- 1, 2, 3. It's a lie!
- It's a lie!

613
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,620
(They suspect it's a lie.)

614
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,460
Since I said we should let them go,

615
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,000
he thought we would actually let them go.

616
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,700
- All right.
- Oh, yes!

617
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,610
It's the truth.

618
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,230
- Great job.
- We told the truth.

619
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,310
- By the way...
- Really?

620
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,440
- By the way, he just said...
- Is it not?

621
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,940
- An exclamation like that is okay.
- Is that so?

622
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,050
- Yes.
- That's a universal exclamation.

623
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,120
- It's not exactly an English word.
- Dark Tornado...

624
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,290
- But...
- To be exact,

625
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,120
- it's an English expression.
- We're just letting this slide.

626
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,210
- What do you mean by that?
- You know that, right?

627
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,210
- Thank you.
- Is that even possible?

628
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,560
We're letting it slide.

629
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
- Stop it.
- I mean...

630
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,330
Just apologize to him right now.

631
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,100
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- He said "Okay."

632
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,620
- "Okay."
- Great!

633
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,000
(Okay. We got him!)

634
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,130
(Team Suk Jin is devastated
while the other teams are happy.)

635
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,510
Okay!

636
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,580
- That was good.
- We all say "okay" so often.

637
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,140
- I told you not to speak at all!
- That was good.

638
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,400
Jae Suk, good job.

639
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,820
- What's wrong with me?
- That was good.

640
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,850
- Good job.
- Nice tiki-taka.

641
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,440
I must have lost my mind.

642
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,820
What is wrong with me?

643
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,350
He's dancing. Why are you dancing?

644
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,950
Are you in a good mood?

645
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,210
- What is that?
- Don't act up.

646
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,590
Don't act up.

647
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,790
Don't act up.

648
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,120
Are you very happy?

649
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,760
- Don't act up.
- I'm really...

650
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,620
- Are you very happy?
- I am very happy.

651
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,390
- They'll win at this rate.
- No. We should stop them.

652
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,630
- I'll spin it. Close your eyes.
- Close your eyes.

653
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,870
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

654
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,310
(It's Team Haha's turn.)

655
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,230
If we push ahead...

656
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,970
We're going to say the truth.

657
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,050
(They got 7.)

658
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,140
- Move it, So Min.
- Go with the truth.

659
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,350
Let's stick to the truth.

660
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,620
(They moved 7 spaces.)

661
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,480
(Now they look suspicious
whatever they do.)

662
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,710
- It's okay.
- I think...

663
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,260
- We have no problem.
- Oh, my.

664
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,860
In this case... Since they're
near the starting point,

665
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,180
- Right.
- let's stop them.

666
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,500
- Let them be.
- Really?

667
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,060
- Should we stop them?
- I think we should...

668
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,420
- Okay. 1, 2, 3.
- Even if they move again...

669
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,660
- It's a lie.
- It's a lie.

670
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,960
- Do they have no say in it?
- That's right.

671
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,770
Who are you guys?

672
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,200
- We are...
- They got them.

673
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,970
- a special investigation team.
- What?

674
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,870
What did you say
after "special investigation?"

675
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,970
(He said "team" in English.)

676
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,520
(What?)

677
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,620
Oh, right.

678
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,380
(Jong Kook finally realized
what Jae Suk did wrong.)

679
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,860
- He said "team," right?
- This won't end.

680
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,260
This won't end.

681
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,500
- Gosh, that was funny.
- This won't end.

682
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,830
- "A special investigation..."
- I don't think...

683
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,460
- this game will ever end.
- Hey, come with me.

684
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,390
Come with me.

685
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,570
I can't.

686
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,340
- No! No!
- He said "team."

687
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,160
A special investigation team!

688
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,400
- SBS!
- This is driving me nuts.

689
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,170
He's driving me crazy.

690
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,870
Today is Monday!

691
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,900
- We said the truth.
- We even said...

692
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,280
- the truth!
- The truth!

693
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,320
One more time!

694
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,470
It's never-ending.

695
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,580
Seven!

696
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,090
Seven.

697
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,380
- Go, go.
- We can catch them.

698
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,480
- We need four.
- Yes, then we can catch them.

699
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,760
We can catch them if we get four.

700
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,560
(Team Jae Suk got 3.)

701
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,590
Can we open our eyes now?

702
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,030
- Are you done?
- Four.

703
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,450
Sorry?

704
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,120
(You got 4?)

705
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,800
- Is he lying?
- I said, four.

706
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,230
- It's 4.
- Is it 4, really?

707
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,230
(It's the best scenario
where they can catch Team Haha.)

708
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,610
- We were so surprised.
- What?

709
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,010
- We'll catch them.
- You'll catch us?

710
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,110
- Yes.
- Then will they go back?

711
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,130
We'll let you decide.

712
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,870
- We should stop them.
- Definitely.

713
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,310
- 1, 2, 3. It's a lie.
- It's a lie.

714
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,310
(They suspect it's a lie.)

715
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,520
- It was a lie.
- Okay.

716
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,820
- Okay!
- Okay.

717
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,320
- That was good.
- Good.

718
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,210
- It was good.
- Indeed. Okay.

719
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,680
He lied as soon as he learned
about the rules.

720
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,420
- Even if we get caught, it's okay.
- We should keep moving.

721
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,090
- I mean...
- That's enough.

722
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,950
We might get into trouble.

723
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,100
(Se Chan said "rule" in English.)

724
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,660
I would've lied every time.

725
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,830
Se Chan, what did you just say?

726
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,390
- What did you say? Come here.
- What did he say?

727
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,500
- You can't do this.
- He's impossible.

728
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,070
- What did you say?
- He's impossible.

729
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,770
- What did you say? Tell us!
- What did you say?

730
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,200
- I said that Jae Suk lied...
- What did you say?

731
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,470
as soon as he learned the rules.

732
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,810
- I said "rule" in English.
- Hey!

733
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,940
- I mean...
- He can't seem to fix it.

734
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,370
You stone gold!

735
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,980
What's "stone gold?"

736
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,980
- Doesn't it mean "stupid?"
- You mean, stone head.

737
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,380
Oh, I should've said "stone head."

738
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,650
- They haven't moved in an hour.
- This is not acceptable.

739
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,950
- I'll leave.
- You have to start over again.

740
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,450
It's been an hour, and they're still here.

741
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,920
- That was funny.
- Why?

742
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Don't use any English words.

743
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,800
- Never do that again.
- I didn't know they'd hear it.

744
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,770
I told you not to speak at all.

745
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,770
Exactly. Why did you...

746
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,460
It's not like you use
some difficult English words.

747
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,570
I don't even know how to spell
the words I said.

748
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,340
But you know what?

749
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,470
We made it this far...

750
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,400
- because Kwang Soo isn't here.
- True.

751
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,550
We couldn't have continued
if Kwang Soo was here.

752
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,670
- Gosh, I'm so frustrated.
- We'll spin it.

753
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,710
Please close your eyes.

754
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,020
(All teams are starting over again.
What number will Team Suk Jin get?)

755
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,710
- I think they spun it twice.
- Exactly.

756
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,940
The blue one is ours, right?

757
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,450
Here we go.

758
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,620
(They took the shortcut
and moved straight to 14.)

759
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,120
- Ji Hyo?
- They're talking too much.

760
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,260
- But Ji Hyo...
- 1, 2, 3.

761
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,330
- It's a lie.
- It's a lie.

762
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,920
We said the truth.

763
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,060
It's the truth.

764
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,390
- Let's move on.
- I didn't...

765
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,130
(Team Suk Jin got 2 this time
and moved to 16!)

766
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,630
- Hurry up.
- Hurry.

767
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,570
- We need 4.
- We should get 4 no matter what.

768
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,700
- Okay. Let's go with this number.
- This number?

769
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,700
(Team Haha got 7.)

770
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,010
(They're moving to 7
pretending they're lying.)

771
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,780
Yes. Right. Wait, no.

772
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,350
- Okay. Good.
- Yes. That's it.

773
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,020
- It's a lie.
- 1, 2, 3.

774
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,370
- It's the truth!
- Really?

775
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,520
- I knew it.
- Why did you do that?

776
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,590
I knew it was the truth.

777
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,850
- I thought it was the truth.
- I'll do it.

778
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,120
Four. That's good.

779
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,760
(Only they're at the starting point
when they don't have much time.)

780
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,360
If we get lucky, we can go
straight there with 4 and then 1.

781
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,190
- We need 4 and then 1.
- Or we can catch them with 6.

782
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,460
Or we can catch them with six.

783
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,870
Right? We have many options.

784
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,340
- Close your eyes.
- Don't say a word.

785
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,960
- Close your eyes.
- Close your eyes!

786
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,230
Close your eyes!

787
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,430
That team is angry.

788
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,550
It'd be awesome if we get this number.

789
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,670
(Se Chan said "team" in English.)

790
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,710
- What did you just say?
- Hey!

791
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,970
- He did it again.
- What did he say?

792
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,440
He said "team"
when he said, "That team is angry."

793
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,980
- Come on.
- Gosh, you stupid punk!

794
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,530
My gosh. I'm so furious right now.

795
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,330
Get out, you punk!

796
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,720
- Leave!
- I'm sorry.

797
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,190
- I said, leave!
- I'm sorry.

798
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,570
- Close your eyes!
- Darn it.

799
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,460
- Close your eyes.
- Why did I say that?

800
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,840
- Close your eyes.
- I'm sorry.

801
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,000
Close your eyes!

802
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,700
Okay. It's four.

803
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,370
Wait.

804
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,340
- What?
- 1, 2, 3.

805
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,440
- It's a lie.
- It's a lie.

806
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,470
(They suspect it's a lie
as they took the shortcut.)

807
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,640
- It's a lie.
- You're right.

808
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,910
Come with me.

809
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,780
Hold on.

810
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,020
Come out.
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

811
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,590
I can't believe this. Hold on.

812
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,410
I'm sorry, sir! I'm sorry.

813
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,860
- I mean...
- I apologize!

814
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,620
This is driving me nuts. I mean...

815
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,920
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir!
- We got five.

816
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,760
- Five moves are not so bad...
- I was wrong.

817
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,890
If we moved five spaces,
we would've been safe...

818
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,890
- I mean, we don't have much time.
- I'm sorry. I was wrong.

819
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:35,870
I'm sorry, PP.

820
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,230
Or you could've lied it was six.

821
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,370
- I'm sorry.
- Why would you say it was four?

822
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,900
- We'll be in 2nd place.
- Since we have 3 minutes left,

823
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,400
we'll end the game
after just one more round.

824
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,550
(They'll end the game after this round.)

825
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,020
- Good.
- Let's win this game.

826
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,250
- Now...
- We can do this.

827
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,440
- Suk Jin.
- I will be careful.

828
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,640
- Suk Jin, bite this.
- I think...

829
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,820
I will do that.

830
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,180
Gosh, I'm so angry.

831
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,210
(Suk Jin is biting his name tag
to be careful.)

832
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,480
We were almost there.

833
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,860
(They got the biggest number 7.)

834
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,330
- Then we can move...
- We should...

835
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,420
move at the right time.

836
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,300
You got seven?

837
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,190
- Suk Jin, did you get seven?
- Yes.

838
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,460
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

839
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,630
2, 3.

840
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,690
- It's a lie.
- It's a lie?

841
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,270
- We should stop them.
- We should say it's a lie.

842
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,770
- We should say it no matter what.
- Got it.

843
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,930
- We actually got...
- Is it the truth?

844
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,370
(They get to spin the roulette again
because it's the truth!)

845
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,970
- Suk Jin, they want...
- Just hurry up.

846
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,550
Suk Jin, the cameraman wants you...

847
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,280
to count down from three
before you spin it.

848
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,590
- What do you want me to say?
- "3, 2, 1."

849
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,850
You little...

850
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,450
Hey, I'm not stupid.

851
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,030
- Gosh, that made me so upset.
- Say, "3, 2, 1."

852
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,030
- We'll make sure to win.
- Hurry up and spin it.

853
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,300
- Go ahead.
- Okay!

854
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,530
- All right.
- Wait.

855
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,920
- Go ahead.
- Okay!

856
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,500
- All right.
- He said "okay."

857
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,230
- We did it! We did it!
- Good job!

858
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,930
- We did it!
- Yes!

859
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,810
- We did it!
- We did it!

860
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,730
- It was recorded!
- All right. Okay.

861
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,010
Let's keep going.

862
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,470
- We did it.
- We did it.

863
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,010
Okay!

864
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,620
- Fine. Go ahead.
- Good!

865
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,120
- We did it.
- Okay. This is great.

866
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,250
- How did you make him say that?
- Okay!

867
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,350
- We stopped them.
- We'll push ahead no matter what.

868
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,790
They really are investigators.
They caught him.

869
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,790
We did it.

870
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,980
Okay!

871
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,450
How could you distract me
when my team was doing well?

872
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,260
- Okay, okay.
- I can't believe this.

873
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,950
- Okay. That was great.
- Okay.

874
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,800
Let's just play rock-paper-scissors.

875
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,500
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Here we go, here we go

876
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,000
- Okay.
- Let's sit down.

877
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,700
- Let's give it a try.
- Okay.

878
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,310
- He got excited to speak freely.
- Okay.

879
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,730
Here we go

880
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,200
- Okay!
- Here we go

881
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,750
- He got excited to speak freely.
- Okay.

882
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,750
Here we go

883
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,250
- He's usually such a cheerful man,
- Let's go!

884
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,880
- but Ji Hyo wouldn't let him speak.
- I wanted to say "okay" so much.

885
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,380
- He says that all the time.
- Yes, we're back at the start.

886
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,260
Each team has one more chance
from now on, right?

887
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,620
Only these two teams. They're over.

888
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,030
- They're over?
- Okay. They're over.

889
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,480
- Be careful not to say "okay."
- I knew it this time.

890
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,190
- Yes. Yes. That's right.
- Okay. Let's go.

891
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,720
Please close your eyes.

892
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,160
- Okay. Good.
- Good.

893
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,270
(What number will Team Haha get
on their last attempt?)

894
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,370
(The highest number 7)

895
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,370
Go with the number.

896
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,930
3, 4, 5, 6. Yes.

897
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,370
- Yes. Good.
- They moved too far.

898
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,870
- How many moves?
- That's...

899
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,810
- We got 7.
- We moved 7 spaces.

900
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,440
Don't you think they moved too far?

901
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,550
- Shall we?
- You got seven?

902
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,250
- 1, 2, 3. It's a lie.
- It's a lie.

903
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,090
- 1, 2, 3. It's the truth.
- It's the truth.

904
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,860
- Go ahead and spin it.
- One more time.

905
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,820
- Haha.
- This could be better.

906
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,920
- I know! Don't speak!
- Be quiet.

907
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,800
- It's awesome.
- Shut it.

908
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,220
Can you turn off Se Chan's mic...

909
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,330
- It's okay.
- We can catch them with six.

910
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,300
So Min.

911
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,430
- What did she say?
- Did she say something?

912
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:23,770
What did she say?

913
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,610
She said "mic" when she asked us
to turn off his mic.

914
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,310
Darn it. Hey!

915
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,630
Hey, why...

916
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,140
- I won't play this game anymore.
- Haha.

917
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,910
- Move!
- Come back, please.

918
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,080
- I'm not doing this.
- Mustache Bomber, please.

919
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,880
- I won't do this! Let go of me.
- Come on.

920
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,180
- Please come back. Just this once.
- What is going on?

921
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,720
- Having many members isn't good.
- Exactly.

922
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,030
- Please sit down.
- There's a lot of pressure on him.

923
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,950
Mustache Bomber, we're really sorry.
My goodness.

924
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,870
- I'm sorry, Mustache Bomber.
- I'm sorry.

925
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,840
- This is unbelievable.
- We're almost there.

926
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,960
- It's the truth.
- It's the truth.

927
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,510
Now, the game is over.

928
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,400
Team Jae Suk wins.

929
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,610
Okay!

930
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,550
- Okay!
- Okay!

931
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,850
- Okay, we won!
- Okay. Nice!

932
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,640
The team that gets a bigger number
will be in second place.

933
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,290
- I hope they get a small number.
- Seven.

934
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,150
- Okay.
- Oh, no.

935
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,560
- The winning team gets five points.
- Great.

936
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,090
The team in 2nd place gets 3 points.

937
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,590
The team in 3rd place gets 1 point.

938
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,760
One point? Okay. That's not bad.

939
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,330
So Min, as the president,
please explain the next game.

940
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,690
- President Jeon.
- I get no benefits.

941
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,770
- The president gets no benefits.
- What could that be?

942
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,600
(What game could be in this box?)

943
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,660
(You've been invited
to the gangsters' world.)

944
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,610
(Jump together hand in hand
to enter the place.)

945
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,900
Everyone, please gather around
and hold each other's hands.

946
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,970
- What? Why?
- Hold each other's hands.

947
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:42,970
Do we need to jump?

948
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,250
Yes, we're going to jump together.

949
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,480
- Then we'll be there?
- Like what we did back in the day?

950
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,450
- Yes. Let's begin. 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

951
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,480
(Jumping)

952
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,680
Why didn't you jump?

953
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,920
We need to jump at once.

954
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,290
Jong Kook, grab his hand tightly.

955
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,920
- Gosh, he drives me crazy.
- Break his fingers.

956
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,770
- Ready. 1, 2, 3.
- Jump.

957
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,690
What? What is this?

958
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,070
What's with our clothes?

959
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,230
- Where are we?
- We're gunmen. Bang, bang, bang.

960
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,610
(The members entered
the real-life version of a game.)

961
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,460
- Bang, bang, bang.
- Oh, my.

962
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,340
- We all look so cool.
- Somehow...

963
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,870
- You look great in the costume.
- I know.

964
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,440
- Smoke keeps coming out of there.
- Why is there smoke here?

965
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,250
(The world that they entered is...)

966
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,880
This place is so cool.

967
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,750
- Hey, stop talking and sit down.
- Oh, my.

968
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:23,650
(A large budget was spent
to build the studio.)

969
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,980
- That's state-of-the-art.
- Great.

970
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,030
(The wild west gangsters will fight
one another here.)

971
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,560
Oh, my. It's sophisticated.

972
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,800
- It's fabulous.
- It's so cool.

973
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,960
- I see you spent a lot of money.
- Exactly.

974
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
That's funny.

975
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,500
Suk Jin,
Bo Pil didn't spend his own money.

976
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,770
"You spent a lot of money."

977
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:39,510
- He doesn't use his own money.
- Anyway...

978
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,280
- He's the one who gets approval.
- Choose your words carefully.

979
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,440
- People might get the wrong idea.
- Suk Jin.

980
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,350
They spent the money
they would've paid Kwang Soo with.

981
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,710
- Was he paid that much?
- He must've been paid a lot.

982
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,590
- He must've been paid a lot.
- As Kwang Soo left the show...

983
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,640
Now that Kwang Soo left the show...

984
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,980
- They got a bigger budget.
- I can see that we have more money.

985
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,150
I see that.

986
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,880
We filled Kwang Soo's absence
with a nicer filming set.

987
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,300
- Kwang Soo, thank you.
- Kwang Soo!

988
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,800
- Bang, bang, bang!
- There it is.

989
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,370
Thanks to you, we're shooting
on such a sophisticated set.

990
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,500
This is nice.

991
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,540
From now on, you are...

992
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,700
seven gangsters who must complete
the missions given by the boss.

993
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,430
- Are we gangsters?
- We're gangsters.

994
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,700
- We're gangsters.
- That's cool.

995
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,370
If you get the items
written on the letter of request...

996
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,470
from the boss before the others do,

997
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,140
you will get points.

998
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,640
The top two will get a prize.

999
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,360
And the bottom two will get a penalty.

1000
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,380
I just have to avoid a penalty.

1001
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,380
- Good. I'll just avoid a penalty.
- Yes.

1002
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,620
In this game, you have to bring
the items that the boss requested.

1003
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,120
If you look at the board,
in order to get ten points,

1004
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,890
you need 3 bottles of drink, 2 gems,

1005
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,630
- and two dollars.
- Okay.

1006
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,660
You get it, right?

1007
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,460
Now I'll tell you how you get these items.

1008
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,080
At the beginning of each round,

1009
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,700
we'll randomly pick one of you
to be the police officer.

1010
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,550
The chosen person will be
the police officer in that round...

1011
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,520
whereas the other six are gangsters.

1012
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,750
When the game begins...

1013
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,020
There are rooms
numbered from 1 to 5 in the back,

1014
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,150
and there are different items
in each of those rooms.

1015
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,150
In rooms numbered 1 to 4,

1016
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,620
you can get a different number
of bottles and gems.

1017
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,620
But room number five is a pawn shop
where you can exchange...

1018
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,190
the item you have with the item you want.

1019
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,070
You will enter the room
of your choice and wait there.

1020
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,010
All six gangsters go into a room.

1021
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,870
- And then the police officer...
- The police officer will enter too.

1022
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,580
gets to search only two rooms
for gangsters.

1023
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,610
- Two rooms?
- Yes.

1024
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,020
- It'll be easy to catch gangsters.
- Two rooms?

1025
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,170
Gangsters will get caught so easily.

1026
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:31,020
The gangsters who didn't get caught
by the police officer...

1027
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,650
- share all the items in the room.
- They get the items in there.

1028
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,290
Yes. But...

1029
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:39,180
every gangster gets as many bottles
and gems as they find in the room.

1030
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,190
(They get all the bottles and gems.)

1031
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,760
But they have to divide the money equally.

1032
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,830
(They have to divide the money equally.)

1033
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,340
It's important to choose a room
where there aren't many gangsters.

1034
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,770
That's important too.
Do the ones who get caught...

1035
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:49,800
lose their items?

1036
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,460
The gangster who gets caught
while being alone in the room...

1037
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,840
doesn't get any items,

1038
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:58,280
and on top of that,
loses all the items he or she has.

1039
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,710
If there is more than one gangster
in the room...

1040
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,290
Do you see the cards with "silence,"
"snitch," and "bribe" on them?

1041
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,320
- Yes.
- Yes.

1042
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,060
You have to decide
whether you will stay silent,

1043
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,150
snitch, or bribe the officer.

1044
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,450
If all the gangsters choose
to stay silent,

1045
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,760
the police officer will leave
without getting anything,

1046
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,690
and the gangsters will share
the items in the room.

1047
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,760
Sounds good.

1048
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,300
But if some of them choose to snitch,

1049
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,890
the ones who snitched can get
all the items...

1050
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,270
whereas the ones who stayed silent
lose all they have.

1051
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,700
- Of course.
- Yes.

1052
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,780
- It's all about snitching.
- It's a psychological game.

1053
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,870
However, if all the gangsters choose
to snitch,

1054
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,640
the police officer will take
all the items...

1055
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,750
that belong to the gangsters in the room.

1056
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,140
If you choose to bribe the officer,

1057
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,760
regardless of the result,

1058
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,360
you have to give one bottle
to the police officer...

1059
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,330
and leave the room.

1060
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,560
- You don't lose much.
- I don't get any items.

1061
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,890
- What do I lose?
- I guess I can keep what I have.

1062
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,160
You just have to give one bottle
to the officer.

1063
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,160
- It's just a small loss.
- I don't lose it all?

1064
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,870
Exactly. It's just a small loss.

1065
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,730
- It's a small loss.
- It's like a tax.

1066
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,230
- Yes. You can say that.
- That sounds reasonable.

1067
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,770
- You can keep your gems.
- It costs you only one bottle.

1068
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,170
- That won't be a bad choice.
- Right.

1069
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,640
- But the other gangsters...
- Okay!

1070
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,280
may get all the items in the room.

1071
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,640
Do we get any items before we begin?

1072
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,250
There are 1 gem, 1 bottle,
and 1 dollar in your bag.

1073
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,680
- 1 of each? I get it.
- 1 of each.

1074
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,290
We're not allowed to steal items
from other gangsters, right?

1075
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,290
That's not allowed.

1076
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,020
Hey, he left, you know.

1077
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,520
Still, many of us would choose to snitch.

1078
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,250
The one in the end and...

1079
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,690
- Not if we come to an agreement.
- I wouldn't do that either.

1080
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,500
The police officer will be changed
in every other round.

1081
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,330
Do you want to practice first
or just begin the game?

1082
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,770
- Let's begin right away.
- Okay then.

1083
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,100
- Pick the police officer.
- Let's get it started now.

1084
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,400
Bang, bang. I'll catch them all.

1085
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,310
All right.
The first police officer is...

1086
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,900
(Who could be the 1st police officer
to set the mood?)

1087
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,270
The first police officer is...

1088
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,290
(Who could be the 1st police officer
to set the mood?)

1089
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,880
- Se Chan.
- Oh, my.

1090
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,750
(It's Se Chan!)

1091
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,060
- It doesn't suit him.
- Bang!

1092
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,480
- Bang, bang.
- Yang Ssaebssaeb?

1093
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,920
Please choose a room 1 by 1...

1094
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,960
starting from the ones
on the police officer's right side.

1095
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,900
- Okay. Then...
- Gosh, seriously.

1096
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,600
- I'll go first.
- Go ahead.

1097
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:05,130
(He can get different items in each room.)

1098
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:09,670
(From the left, room numbers 1 to 5)

1099
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:13,920
(Room number 5,
they can exchange their items here.)

1100
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,750
You can see that there's a lot
of items in room number one, right?

1101
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,980
I hope at least one of you goes
into that room.

1102
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,920
- I promise I won't enter that room.
- Are you serious?

1103
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
I won't enter room number one.

1104
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,080
He might not choose the room
thinking many of us would go there.

1105
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,790
I won't choose room number one.
You can trust me.

1106
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,790
(Room number 1)

1107
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,460
(Jae Suk is hesitating
in front of room number 1.)

1108
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,730
Wait. I can exchange...

1109
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,170
what I have with anything I want, right?

1110
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,440
(Room number 4, room number 5)

1111
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,440
Okay.

1112
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,540
(Jae Suk picked room number 4!)

1113
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,810
(Room number 4)

1114
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,710
Oh, there's a lot of food in here.

1115
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,210
(The hungry gangster
with a protruding mouth...)

1116
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,560
(starts to steal food.)

1117
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,560
(He chose room number 4...)

1118
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,600
(with only a few items in it
that not many would choose.)

1119
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,330
Next up is Suk Jin.
Please choose a room.

1120
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,730
- Okay. I'll go.
- I won't go into room number one.

1121
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,960
I bet Suk Jin will choose that room
because of what he said.

1122
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,210
No, I won't. I'm off.

1123
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,540
That's not the entrance.

1124
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,380
He's so bad at role-playing.

1125
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,500
- Please close the curtain.
- Close it.

1126
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,980
- Close the other one too.
- Make sure you don't see.

1127
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,790
(He's enjoying the solo shot on camera.)

1128
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,790
Which room did Jae Suk choose?

1129
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,650
I have to enter a different room.

1130
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,980
(It'll get complicated
if another gangster is in the room.)

1131
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,000
(Jae Suk is staying alert
while eating hardtack.)

1132
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:39,370
I wonder which of the five rooms
he went into.

1133
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,630
(Jae Suk is in room number 4.
Which room did Suk Jin choose?)

1134
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,460
I bet So Min will choose room number one.

1135
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,940
Me? Do you think I'm stupid?

1136
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,480
"Do you think I'm stupid?"

1137
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,980
You don't think...

1138
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,600
that I can seduce a police officer
with my beauty?

1139
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,020
I'm married.

1140
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,250
- Since when?
- Next up is So Min.

1141
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,790
(So Min, who got rejected
by the officer, will choose a room.)

1142
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,250
(She chooses carefully.)

1143
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,790
(And the room she chose is...)

1144
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,750
(room number 4 where Jae Suk is.)

1145
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,460
Why did you come here?

1146
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,000
Why are you here?

1147
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,670
- Why are you here?
- Why did you choose this room?

1148
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,560
Why did you choose this one of all rooms?

1149
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,870
It's because we're both timid.

1150
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,830
- We're both timid.
- That's not the case.

1151
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:25,040
(Suk Jin silently hides
in one of the rooms.)

1152
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,520
- This isn't easy.
- This is driving me crazy.

1153
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,880
- Se Chan thinks way too much.
- I do.

1154
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,120
As you all know,

1155
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,380
I stick to the basics.

1156
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,420
There are many items
to share in room number one,

1157
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,830
so that will probably be
one of the rooms I choose.

1158
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,060
I must, you know.

1159
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,330
I can't risk anyone getting those goods.

1160
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,790
If the gangsters in room number one
choose to be silent,

1161
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,790
- they'll keep the goods.
- You're right.

1162
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,790
- If they all choose to stay quiet?
- Of course.

1163
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,830
It's not a bad deal then.

1164
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,810
- Then at first...
- It's not a bad choice then.

1165
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,370
If the gangsters in room number one...

1166
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,440
- agree to stay silent.
- Yes, exactly.

1167
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,830
- Can you trust anyone though?
- For everyone to be silent?

1168
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,210
The next gangster will enter.

1169
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,940
- I already have a plan.
- Okay.

1170
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,120
Go ahead.

1171
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,710
- Sure.
- We can go into any room.

1172
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,940
(Ji Hyo's next to choose a room.)

1173
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,060
I already have a bottle.

1174
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,750
I'll give you one right now...

1175
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,330
if you promise
not to enter room number one.

1176
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,920
I won't go in there.

1177
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,000
(Whispering)

1178
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,060
Jong Kook.

1179
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,460
Hear me out.

1180
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,170
I'll promise not to go in there...

1181
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,560
if you give me a bottle each.

1182
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,870
- I won't go in there.
- One each.

1183
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,370
- Do you promise?
- Yes.

1184
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,710
What if you turn on us?

1185
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,810
I stay true to my word.

1186
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,230
I'll hit you for real.

1187
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,170
- What?
- That's a given.

1188
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,380
- Right?
- Of course.

1189
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,120
- Will you do that for a bottle?
- Must you even ask?

1190
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,580
I won't go in there.

1191
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,710
- Are you sure?
- For a bottle each?

1192
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,850
(The two gangsters
bribe the police officer.)

1193
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,290
Okay, Haha, you're next.

1194
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,690
Do you promise?

1195
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,330
I already did. Now, hand it over.

1196
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,830
Then...

1197
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,880
I won't go in there.

1198
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,150
For two bottles.

1199
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,000
- So...
- Haha?

1200
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,460
Hold on a second.
Once I go in, they might...

1201
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,560
- What?
- I'm worried...

1202
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,690
that he'll change his mind.

1203
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,540
It's why I don't want to leave this room.

1204
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,060
(Even in the wild west,
they highly doubt each other.)

1205
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,480
- Here I go.
- It's only the first round.

1206
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,630
- You...
- All right.

1207
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,270
- You...
- Yes, I hear you.

1208
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,850
You've already crossed me many times.

1209
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,310
Don't point it at me like that.

1210
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,420
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1211
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,250
Get going or the others might hear you.

1212
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,020
(Haha and Jong Kook bribe
the officer with a bottle each.)

1213
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,960
- Don't you dare.
- I won't.

1214
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,080
Let's trust him this once.

1215
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,420
- Trust me this once.
- We have a long way to go anyway.

1216
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,460
- I won't.
- Don't you dare.

1217
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,690
(Haha heads to the rooms
with doubt in his mind.)

1218
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,750
What will you do?

1219
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,000
Are you really going to keep your word?

1220
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,040
(Are you really not going to enter
room number one?)

1221
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,100
(Winking)

1222
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,770
(The dirty cop is willing
to go against his word.)

1223
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,150
(He gives the muscular gangster
his bottle back.)

1224
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:48,350
(Got you!)

1225
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:54,960
(The pathological doubter
catches the police red-handed.)

1226
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,960
- Why?
- What's wrong?

1227
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,900
What's the matter with you?

1228
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,900
- Why?
- What is it?

1229
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,460
We were keeping quiet.

1230
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,060
I'm seriously angry right now.

1231
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,460
Don't you like
that we're keeping our silence?

1232
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,770
- Just get going.
- I meant it.

1233
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,170
- I won't go in that room.
- Why...

1234
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,380
Haha, you can't come back out here.

1235
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,500
- Just go.
- You can't come back out here.

1236
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,420
(I have a bad feeling about this.)

1237
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,520
The worst scenario for me
is when the gangsters keep quiet.

1238
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:25,230
(He puts his trust in Detective Yang
and enters room number one.)

1239
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,460
(Hi!)

1240
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,000
(In room number 1 filled with items,)

1241
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,290
(he's greeted by Suk Jin and Ji Hyo.)

1242
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,900
If we all stay quiet
even after we're caught,

1243
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,330
- we'll keep all the items.
- Right.

1244
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,400
I don't know what I should do.

1245
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,520
I have a plan though.

1246
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,670
I have one in mind.

1247
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,380
- Why here?
- Did you have to choose this room?

1248
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,650
- I heard a sound.
- I thought you'd go...

1249
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,690
into the next room.

1250
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,980
- Why this room?
- I knew I heard something.

1251
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,480
(A few gangsters
have gathered in room number 4.)

1252
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,520
- Jong Kook...
- Why did you choose this room...

1253
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,690
when there's nothing in here?

1254
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,690
- That's exactly the reason.
- You two...

1255
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:05,870
always go big, so...

1256
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,600
(The siren wails to signal that
the officer is making his move.)

1257
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,440
The search has begun.

1258
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,540
All right.

1259
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,400
How dare you steal what's mine.

1260
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,980
Let me see.

1261
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,290
(The gangsters are
in rooms number 1 and 4.)

1262
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,210
Maybe you're in room number four...

1263
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,150
which you swore that had nothing to take.

1264
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,380
There's only one bottle.

1265
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,790
(Room number 4)

1266
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,730
Or maybe you went for the gems.

1267
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,920
Or maybe...

1268
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,040
you went for the 2 gems and 2 bottles...

1269
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,310
to turn the tables of this game.

1270
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:49,400
(Room number 1)

1271
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,310
(There are 5 rooms and he can search 2.)

1272
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,480
Here I go.

1273
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:01,150
(The gangsters hold their breaths
as they wait.)

1274
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,960
(Which room will Detective Yang search?)

1275
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,230
Got you!

1276
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,750
(Startled!)

1277
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,190
Get over here.

1278
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:15,230
(Yang Se Chan, darn you!)

1279
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,790
There were three of you here.

1280
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,710
(Those in room number 4
live to fight another day.)

1281
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,480
- Ouch.
- I can't believe you.

1282
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,770
How can you go back on your word?

1283
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,310
Unbelievable.

1284
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:31,650
(Detective Yang broke his promise
even after taking the bribe.)

1285
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,040
You've got to be kidding me.

1286
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,560
- What you are is a thug.
- I'm done talking to you.

1287
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,790
Don't you dare speak like that
to the police.

1288
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,230
Get over here.

1289
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,330
Unbelievable.

1290
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,020
(The 3 arrested will shortly choose
to stay quiet, snitch, or bribe.)

1291
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,130
Get over here.

1292
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,690
Unbelievable.

1293
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,560
- Silence is our only way out.
- Watch your heads.

1294
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,060
- Get out here.
- Don't touch me.

1295
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,400
- You...
- Seriously?

1296
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,440
Why can't any of you
think outside the box?

1297
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,040
You can now choose
the second room to search.

1298
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,710
- Right away?
- Yes.

1299
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,380
Se Chan...

1300
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,940
Okay, fine. Just see what I do.

1301
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,810
- You'll pay for this.
- Okay.

1302
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:00,880
You obviously...

1303
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,480
can't keep your "world."

1304
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,540
His world?

1305
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,290
What's that supposed to mean?

1306
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,790
- His world?
- His world?

1307
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,460
As if that makes any sense.

1308
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,850
(Suk Jin's too stunned
to even speak properly.)

1309
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,730
You went back on your word.

1310
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:12,880
(Detective Yang
conducts his second search.)

1311
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,920
Will it be 2 gems and 2 bottles?

1312
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,900
Or will you safely take
just a bottle each?

1313
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,190
My second search.

1314
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,960
- Here I go.
- Sure thing.

1315
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,500
(I'll catch you during my second search!)

1316
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:31,440
(Will he be able to catch
the gangsters in room number 4?)

1317
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,500
Got you!

1318
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,710
No one's here.

1319
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,210
Got you!

1320
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:37,790
No one's here.

1321
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:40,150
(He failed to catch the gangsters.)

1322
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,250
Okay. That concludes round one.

1323
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,960
- No one was there.
- No one?

1324
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,980
- That was close.
- I almost went in there.

1325
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,060
Jae Suk, where were you?

1326
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,520
- Was he in room four?
- Yes.

1327
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,790
Was no one in room two?

1328
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,230
(Jae Suk, So Min, Jong Kook)

1329
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,500
No one was in room 2 or 3.

1330
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,460
Hold on a second.

1331
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,540
I apprehended three gangsters.

1332
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,460
If you think about it,

1333
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,330
- it's all about working as a team.
- Right.

1334
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,310
Let's begin the round like this.

1335
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,620
We agreed not to play tricks
in the first round.

1336
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,120
- I can't believe what he did.
- Look at his face.

1337
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,120
- His expression.
- Wait.

1338
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,520
- He's that upset.
- Haha.

1339
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,790
- We have to stay silent.
- Only a fool wouldn't.

1340
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:17,850
- Round one has ended.
- Got you!

1341
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,830
The three gangsters will decide...

1342
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,600
whether to stay silent,
snitch, or bribe the officer.

1343
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,100
Hold up your choice on the count of three.

1344
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,330
Someone will definitely snitch.

1345
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,100
Snitching is how you'll win this game.

1346
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,960
If all three choose to stay silent,

1347
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,540
you'll share the items in room one.

1348
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,810
If one of you decides to snitch,

1349
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,730
the items will be that person's to take.

1350
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,210
Those who stay silent
will lose their share.

1351
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,600
If all three snitch,

1352
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,310
you'll all lose your items.

1353
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:43,850
(Police, Se Chan)

1354
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,440
If you would like to play it safe,

1355
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,420
you can bribe the officer
with a bottle and keep the rest.

1356
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,810
(Police, Se Chan)

1357
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,630
I think all three
will choose to stay silent.

1358
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,750
- Only a fool wouldn't stay silent.
- Exactly.

1359
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,420
- Have you made up your minds?
- Yes.

1360
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,690
Let's start with some items in our bags.

1361
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:01,000
All three of us.

1362
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,460
- That's better.
- Let's please do that.

1363
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,600
That's exactly what I want.

1364
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,770
- All right.
- Please...

1365
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,560
- One.
- Haha.

1366
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,770
- Make it fun.
- Please.

1367
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,330
- One...
- Ji Hyo, please.

1368
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,150
- Hold them up simultaneously.
- Kwang Soo would betray us, but...

1369
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:13,250
I can be trusted, but not you two.

1370
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,580
- No way.
- Why won't you trust me?

1371
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,650
Only a fool wouldn't stay silent.
Isn't that obvious?

1372
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,310
- Let me get So Min and Se Chan.
- Okay.

1373
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,080
- Okay, let's stay silent.
- Stay silent.

1374
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,650
- 1, 2, 3.
- Of course.

1375
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:23,710
I'll stay silent!

1376
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:28,650
(He snitches.)

1377
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:29,790
- They snitched.
- They all snitched.

1378
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,190
- Unbelievable.
- Those three.

1379
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,670
That gave me goosebumps!

1380
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:35,400
A chill was sent down my spine.

1381
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,960
All three of you...

1382
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,370
will lose your gems and bottles,
but not your money.

1383
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,540
- Haha, that was solid acting.
- What did I tell you?

1384
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:42,710
Don't I get anything?

1385
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:43,940
You'll be confiscating what they have.

1386
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,170
Right. They're mine to keep.

1387
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:47,940
No way.

1388
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,580
Gems and bottles.

1389
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,210
He already took my bottle.

1390
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,850
- What if he doesn't have any?
- Then there's nothing to give you.

1391
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,040
- Shouldn't he give me one later?
- Only give what you have.

1392
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,190
- What?
- You know...

1393
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,480
- Come on.
- This is why I didn't choose to...

1394
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,230
This was pretty obvious.

1395
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,630
This is why I didn't choose to stay quiet.

1396
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,350
We'll now begin the second round.

1397
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,460
Off you go.

1398
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,500
You play the cop for two rounds.

1399
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,870
- Am I the cop again?
- Yes.

1400
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:06,960
Choose your rooms!

1401
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,230
Please note...

1402
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:10,170
that there's a dollar more in each room.

1403
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,560
(There's a dollar more in each room.)

1404
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,810
Off you go.

1405
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:13,960
Suk Jin will go first.

1406
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,580
All right.
I don't know what to choose,

1407
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,480
so I'll let the stars decide.

1408
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:21,440
I'll enter the room my gun points at.

1409
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,020
(Suk Jin chooses the room
the gun points at.)

1410
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,150
Who's next?

1411
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,080
- Jae Suk will go next.
- Okay!

1412
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:32,130
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

1413
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,560
Can you give me one last chance?

1414
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:36,750
If I betray you,
you can cut me from your life.

1415
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,190
You said that the last time
and then betrayed me.

1416
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,000
I mean it this time.
I'll choose room number one...

1417
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,690
- and stay silent.
- Okay, I'll take that deal.

1418
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,870
Okay, then I promise...

1419
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:46,370
not to enter room number one.

1420
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,130
(Seriously?)

1421
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,830
Please don't throw that at me.

1422
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,100
Haha almost...

1423
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,900
To me, Se Chan is...

1424
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,020
I won't go in there.
Not room number one.

1425
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:58,350
Jong Kook, you and me.

1426
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,150
Sounds good.

1427
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,420
Who's next?

1428
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,560
(Jong Kook's next.)

1429
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,230
(Room number 4?)

1430
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,150
This? Really?

1431
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,100
(The alliance agrees on room number 4.)

1432
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,420
So Min.

1433
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:12,370
How about we join forces?

1434
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,870
Call.

1435
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:15,690
That offer...

1436
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:17,940
I'll accept that offer.

1437
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,730
(Acting cool
as if they're in a cowboy movie)

1438
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:24,130
- Do you mean it?
- Yes.

1439
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:25,380
You actually spilled it on you.

1440
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,980
(Playing cowboy using a miniature bottle)

1441
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,020
It's water.

1442
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,650
So Min will enter first.

1443
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,210
- Why?
- Go in, So Min.

1444
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,040
(So Min enters as per Se Chan's order...)

1445
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,710
(to room number 1
that has the most stuff.)

1446
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,060
This is driving me crazy.

1447
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,920
(Jae Suk is in the room again?)

1448
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,000
(The tiger moth siblings
are on the same level.)

1449
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,130
Why are you in here?

1450
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,060
My gosh, seriously.

1451
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:49,940
Jae Suk, why are you in here?

1452
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,310
(The two of them are drawn
to each other like magnets.)

1453
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:52,900
Why are you here?

1454
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,480
See you in there if we can.

1455
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,770
(Ji Hyo is next to go.)

1456
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,400
(Ji Hyo and Jong Kook
agreed to meet in room number 4.)

1457
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,620
I have nothing in my hands.

1458
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,290
(Room number 4)

1459
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:06,380
(It's packed with Jong Kook and Suk Jin.)

1460
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,850
Come here. Let's just hope
that no one else comes in.

1461
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,460
Let's decide on what to do.

1462
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:15,150
- There are three of us here.
- Let's hope no one else comes in.

1463
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:16,330
No one will come in anymore.

1464
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,830
(No one should come in
for them to earn a dollar each.)

1465
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,100
(Haha chose room number 4 too.)

1466
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,370
What's wrong with you?

1467
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:28,330
(Room number 1, number 4)

1468
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,310
(The 6 gangsters are gathered
in rooms number 1 and 4.)

1469
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:32,310
You punks!

1470
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,650
The search has begun.

1471
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,620
(Will he succeed in rounding up
all the gangsters?)

1472
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,750
Those punks.

1473
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,940
(Will he succeed in rounding up
all the gangsters?)

1474
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,750
These punks must be hiding well.

1475
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,400
I can tell they tried so hard to run.

1476
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,690
All right, then!

1477
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:52,790
You're taking a bottle each again?
That's so predictable.

1478
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,560
I'll go to room number four.

1479
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,440
Or...

1480
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,210
All right.

1481
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,400
(The cop seems to have made up his mind.)

1482
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:05,600
(He slowly approaches.)

1483
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:06,880
You punk!

1484
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,480
(He chose an empty room.)

1485
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,040
(There's no one in here.)

1486
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:15,810
(He has only one chance left.)

1487
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:19,560
(If they don't get caught,
they can win all the items.)

1488
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:26,670
I can smell people trembling in fear.

1489
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,290
The rooms are reeking of sweat.

1490
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:31,630
That means someone is nervous.

1491
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,830
I should go easy on them this time.

1492
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:38,080
Tip-tap, tip-tap.

1493
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:40,980
Not a chance!

1494
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,080
(Right then)

1495
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,540
Not a chance!

1496
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,190
(Se Chan suddenly raids room number 1.)

1497
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,750
I got you, you punks.

1498
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:47,880
Come here!

1499
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,960
- This is driving me crazy.
- Come here.

1500
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,020
I got you.

1501
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,290
(We're safe.)

1502
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,560
- Here you go.
- My gosh.

1503
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,750
We're getting everything.

1504
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,020
We're not getting any money.

1505
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,370
Otherwise, more people would've come in.

1506
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,690
Why did you choose this room?

1507
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:01,770
(They can't win the money
since they can't divide it evenly.)

1508
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:03,100
- Why can't we take the money?
- We need to survive.

1509
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,710
Because there's only three dollars.

1510
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,730
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1511
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:08,810
(Officer Yang successfully arrests
gangsters in both rounds.)

1512
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:10,230
Here's the result of Round Two.

1513
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:13,440
Jae Suk and So Min, who were
in room number one, were arrested.

1514
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,540
- It'll be fun to watch.
- They need to decide.

1515
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,020
Jae Suk, I'm in last place.

1516
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,210
- I'm in last place.
- This is...

1517
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:20,480
This doesn't go the way you want it to.

1518
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,150
(Will they choose to stay quiet,
snitch, or bribe?)

1519
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:25,480
Your heart tells you to stay quiet.

1520
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,350
You're not going to bribe?

1521
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,400
No, I won't.

1522
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,730
- She doesn't even need that card.
- I really don't.

1523
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:31,920
We need just one of the two.

1524
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,170
(Jae Suk also throws away
the bribe card.)

1525
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,960
I'm going to throw away the snitch card.

1526
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,540
(He threw both cards away?)

1527
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,000
I'm showing how determined I am
to stay quiet.

1528
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,480
I threw away the bribe and snitch cards.

1529
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,600
This is...

1530
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,150
- Okay.
- They're pretty intense.

1531
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,850
All right, then.

1532
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,170
Lift your card on the count of three.

1533
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:51,080
1, 2...

1534
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,980
(If they choose to remain quiet,
they'll earn a bottle and 2 gems.)

1535
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,020
Three!

1536
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,290
(Snitch?)

1537
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:01,350
(And she chose to bribe.)

1538
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,170
- Snitch and bribe. Jae Suk...
- I knew you'd do this.

1539
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:06,560
(Jae Suk is the only one
who snitched on So Min.)

1540
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,270
(All his belongings will be confiscated.)

1541
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,210
- At least I chose to bribe.
- Jae Suk...

1542
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,600
I handed him my card,

1543
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:17,270
and he accepted it without hesitating.

1544
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:19,400
You're unbelievable.

1545
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:23,250
He and I had a connection.

1546
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,540
(Se Chan offered his snitch card
to Jae Suk.)

1547
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:27,750
I'm going to throw away the snitch card.

1548
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,650
(He threw away his snitch card
and took Se Chan's.)

1549
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:32,230
- At least I chose to bribe.
- That was wise of you, So Min.

1550
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,460
That was a good choice.

1551
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,850
At least bribing is better
than losing everything.

1552
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:38,770
- It's way better.
- So Min, turn in one bottle.

1553
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,870
Jae Suk, you need to turn in
everything except for the money.

1554
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:42,330
- To me?
- I'm so relieved.

1555
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,690
- We...
- Bring them to me.

1556
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,040
We weren't born to stay quiet.

1557
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,540
I didn't take anything.

1558
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,480
You're supposed to hand in everything.

1559
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,830
My gosh, this is harsh.

1560
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,750
- He even had gems?
- We have one less competitor now.

1561
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,980
You can buy stuff now if you want to.

1562
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,850
- Now?
- Yes, you can buy them if you want.

1563
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,210
I'll buy some first then.

1564
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:58,380
(The Boss's Request)

1565
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,920
- That way, they can't be taken.
- That's right.

1566
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,750
You can take them after paying.
Ten points?

1567
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:03,060
Three bottles.

1568
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,420
Two gems.

1569
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:07,850
Wait, I don't have money.

1570
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:09,790
- Did you put in yours?
- I don't have money.

1571
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,830
How dumb of me.

1572
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,690
I don't have money.

1573
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:17,130
How come I have just one dollar?

1574
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:18,630
You need money too?

1575
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,770
I'm sorry.
I have plenty of bottles and gems,

1576
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:21,770
but I have no money.

1577
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:24,330
That's because you took bribes
so many times!

1578
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:25,500
I don't have money.

1579
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,940
- You don't?
- No.

1580
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:30,250
Then Se Chan is definitely going to
take the money.

1581
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,250
We'll draw a ball to decide
who'll play the cop.

1582
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,520
My goodness.

1583
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,350
He'll go into room number five.

1584
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:38,480
- Please pick me.
- All right.

1585
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,920
- The second person to play cop...
- Please...

1586
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,920
Haha.

1587
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,000
(Who will be the second member
to play cop?)

1588
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,130
Jae Suk.

1589
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:46,460
(The 2nd cop is Jae Suk.)

1590
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,600
It's Jae Suk.

1591
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,940
(I'm in trouble.)

1592
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,540
(They can't help but sigh
as Jae Suk is more oppressive.)

1593
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,940
But I think it's better
to play cop second.

1594
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,770
All right, then. Firstly,

1595
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,940
Suk Jin...

1596
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,440
Am I going first again?

1597
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,250
All right.

1598
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:02,750
- It doesn't matter.
- Right.

1599
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:03,940
Let's go!

1600
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,850
He uses so much English
if you listen to him.

1601
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:08,620
Hang on. Come back, Suk Jin.

1602
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,210
- What is it?
- I changed my mind.

1603
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:11,520
He changed his mind.

1604
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,480
- Haha, you go in first.
- He's so mischievous.

1605
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,900
- Why are you doing this?
- I changed my mind.

1606
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,150
It was as if he was
waiting for this moment.

1607
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:17,350
He's so mischievous.

1608
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:18,870
- Haha, you go first.
- This is...

1609
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,330
Sit down.

1610
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,770
The Shooter of Mapo.

1611
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:24,000
(The Shooter of Mapo
leaves while acting cool.)

1612
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,230
- The Mapo Cowboy.
- Which room are you choosing?

1613
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:26,440
The Mapo Cowboy.

1614
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:30,480
(Each room has 1 more dollar now.)

1615
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,380
(Room number 5,
they can exchange their items here.)

1616
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:35,440
(He chose room number 5
where he can exchange items.)

1617
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,040
Jong Kook.

1618
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,920
Which room are you going to?

1619
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,520
(Room number 1)

1620
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,290
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo agree to meet
in room number 1 with hand signals.)

1621
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,850
If I get caught this time,
I'll be destroyed.

1622
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,290
It's okay.

1623
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:50,920
I have a bad feeling.
If I get caught alone...

1624
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,790
I can picture Jae Suk staring at me.

1625
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,790
It's terrifying.

1626
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,960
- But if you...
- If I'm alone in the room...

1627
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,310
If you're alone in the room,
you'll need to hand in everything.

1628
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,600
So I need to...

1629
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,040
Gosh, you startled me!

1630
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,270
You startled me!

1631
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:04,580
Officer, please don't kill me.

1632
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,650
You must go to a room...

1633
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:06,770
- with many people.
- I should.

1634
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:07,770
(So Min tries to become allies
with Suk Jin.)

1635
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:08,980
I need to go to a room with many people.

1636
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,170
(So Min tries to become allies
with Suk Jin.)

1637
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:11,520
- Here.
- Gosh, that startled me.

1638
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,020
(Suk Jin gets scared
when he knows what's coming.)

1639
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,380
Please pick the next person.

1640
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,650
So Min will go next.

1641
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:19,730
You're incredible.

1642
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:23,630
(So Min goes into the room
she promised with Suk Jin.)

1643
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,420
You can go next, old man.

1644
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,060
Who are you calling an old man?

1645
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,230
TikTok Grandpa.

1646
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:32,060
Even foreigners write comments
on my posts.

1647
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,400
- Saying what?
- "Nice, TikTok Grandpa."

1648
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:37,540
It's driving me crazy.

1649
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,210
"Nice, TikTok Grandpa?"

1650
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:41,620
Why would you call me that?

1651
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,650
- I'm not...
- "Grandpa."

1652
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,480
I'm not that old.

1653
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,190
- "TikTok Grandpa."
- It's driving me crazy.

1654
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,480
- You!
- It's funny.

1655
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:50,380
- Nice.
- It is funny.

1656
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:52,630
- Let's go!
- Let's go, let's go!

1657
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,630
I'm a loyal man.

1658
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:56,650
I made a promise to someone.

1659
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:58,600
I'm running toward that person!

1660
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,500
And that person is her!

1661
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,940
(Shouting loudly)

1662
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,000
- He's not good at skits.
- Indeed.

1663
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,830
He was scolded a lot for that.

1664
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,000
He doesn't sound like a pro comedian.

1665
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,270
(As soon as Suk Jin leaves,
they talk about skits.)

1666
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,600
There's a certain tone
that comedians use for skits.

1667
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,920
(As soon as Suk Jin leaves,
they talk about skits.)

1668
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,480
I'm bribing you in advance.

1669
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,850
(His fellow comedian
secretly hands him a gem.)

1670
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:23,290
I'll go to room number one,

1671
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,750
so don't come into that room.

1672
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,380
If I earn two gems,

1673
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:28,750
I'll give you one later.

1674
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,020
We have another chance to go in anyway.

1675
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,130
You got it, right?

1676
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,560
If you decline,

1677
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,100
I won't be giving you any gems next time.

1678
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,690
- Off you go.
- You got it, right?

1679
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:37,460
- Okay, go now.
- I'm going to room number one.

1680
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,310
- But...
- I heard a loud noise just now.

1681
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:42,940
There's a lot of stuff in here.

1682
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,480
There's a lot of stuff...

1683
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,540
in here.

1684
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,040
Don't take them.
I'll give them to you later.

1685
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,850
- Just give me one more.
- No.

1686
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,650
Give me a bottle and a gem. Okay?

1687
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:52,250
You're just robbing me.

1688
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,480
Jae Suk, if you...
Haha tricked me using the same way.

1689
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:58,850
Those with protruding mouths
are like that.

1690
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,460
- Go now.
- Okay.

1691
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,630
I won't go into that room.

1692
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,650
- Okay.
- Okay.

1693
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,690
(The gangster with a protruding mouth...)

1694
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:04,750
(enters the room after making a promise.)

1695
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,230
(He carefully enters room number 1.)

1696
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,040
(Room number 1)

1697
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,960
(It's already filled with people.)

1698
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,730
(Everyone except Haha
is gathered in this room.)

1699
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:18,580
(Suk Jin, So Min, Jong Kook,
and Ji Hyo all decided...)

1700
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,580
(to gather in room number 1.)

1701
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,620
- Listen. I told him...
- Suk Jin.

1702
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,620
(Number 1 is a popular spot
as there are many items.)

1703
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,020
The search has begun.

1704
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,650
(Thanks to Se Chan who bribed him,
they might not be caught.)

1705
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:35,830
(The search begins.)

1706
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,920
I'll start arresting them now.

1707
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:40,830
(Vocalizing)

1708
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:48,480
(He enjoys playing
an outlaw of the Wild West.)

1709
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:53,480
(Showing how a comedy skit is done)

1710
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:58,380
(The 6 gangsters are more nervous
after hearing Jae Suk singing.)

1711
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,080
You punks!

1712
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:04,480
Why is no one in here?

1713
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,560
(He fails to catch them
in his 1st attempt.)

1714
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,920
Please begin your second search.

1715
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,400
(There are 4 rooms left
for him to search.)

1716
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,400
(He promised to not enter
room number 1 after getting bribed.)

1717
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:21,440
(He's left with rooms number 2, 4, and 5.)

1718
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,810
(He has only one chance left.)

1719
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:28,000
(Which room will the comedian cop pick?)

1720
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:30,920
There you are!

1721
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,350
- Darn it!
- Everyone's gathered here!

1722
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:33,380
Darn you!

1723
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,880
(Officer Yoo manages to arrest
5 people in room number 1.)

1724
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,880
- All right!
- Too bad.

1725
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:37,250
I got you all.

1726
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,650
- Darn it.
- Officer!

1727
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:41,650
- What?
- Are you serious?

1728
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,460
I got nothing from the first room I chose.

1729
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,690
Okay, okay.

1730
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:45,900
(Room number 5,
they can exchange their items here.)

1731
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,290
Where did Haha go?

1732
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:50,500
(Haha survived alone
and took 4 dollars for himself.)

1733
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:53,230
Haha went to room number five alone,

1734
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:55,310
so you can exchange your items.

1735
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:57,310
I'll exchange my money for a gem.

1736
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:59,710
Money for a gem?

1737
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,620
- Are you going to snitch?
- No, I am...

1738
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,620
(The rest of them need to pick
a card to play.)

1739
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,670
Who got caught?

1740
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:06,210
Everyone except you.

1741
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,650
- All 5 of them.
- All 5?

1742
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,980
We were in the same room.

1743
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:12,650
- Room number one?
- Yes.

1744
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,650
- I'll stay quiet.
- Okay.

1745
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:16,150
Do you really want to try that?

1746
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,730
- No, no.
- Staying quiet.

1747
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:18,830
(Staying quiet together)

1748
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,600
(No, no.)

1749
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,060
(No.)

1750
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,600
(He has no intention of trusting anyone.)

1751
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,770
If you choose to stay quiet,

1752
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:28,170
- we can get the gems and bottles.
- No, no.

1753
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,000
No, I'm never going to choose
to stay quiet.

1754
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,080
He's ridiculous.

1755
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,980
- What did you say?
- Besides,

1756
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:36,080
- I'm sure you...
- Can't you use your head?

1757
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,080
You'll choose to snitch for sure.

1758
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,790
I said I'll choose to stay quiet.

1759
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,080
All right. Make your decisions now.

1760
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,920
(Which card will the 5 gangsters choose?)

1761
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,520
- Let's do it.
- Se Chan.

1762
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,750
- I'm staying quiet.
- Do you agree to stay quiet?

1763
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:49,900
- Ji Hyo, you agree to stay quiet?
- Yes.

1764
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,000
I'll stay quiet.

1765
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,400
(If anyone snitches, those who chose
to stay quiet will suffer losses.)

1766
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,400
Two...

1767
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,690
(If anyone snitches, those who chose
to stay quiet will suffer losses.)

1768
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:58,540
(They're done choosing their cards.)

1769
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,540
- Snitch.
- That's bribing.

1770
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,080
Two chose to snitch
and three chose to bribe.

1771
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:04,270
Those who chose to bribe
will give their bottles away.

1772
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:06,400
The two of you need to turn in everything.

1773
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,600
(Only these two will have
their belongings confiscated.)

1774
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,080
Oh, I forgot that bribing is an option.

1775
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,210
My goodness.

1776
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:12,540
This is quite a gain.

1777
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,880
- You see? We...
- This is quite a gain.

1778
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,210
- Give them to me.
- I mean...

1779
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:17,710
- You learn from your experience.
- This is quite a gain.

1780
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:19,520
If I told you to stay quiet,

1781
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,130
- you should've all stayed quiet.
- All right now.

1782
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:23,920
By now,
we'll be happily going home...

1783
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,230
- with 2 gems and 2 bottles!
- Give them to me.

1784
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:26,870
We still have another round to play.

1785
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:28,790
- Give me everything you've got.
- This is frustrating!

1786
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:29,790
Give them to me.

1787
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:32,440
Choose the person who'll go first
for the next round.

1788
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,600
- Jong Kook should go first.
- Me?

1789
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,480
Next. Ji Hyo.

1790
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:37,900
Mr. Officer.

1791
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,310
(Mr. Officer.)

1792
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:40,880
Is there anything I can do for you?

1793
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,880
(Is there anything I can do for you?)

1794
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,880
(Haha tries to make a deal
when there are fewer people.)

1795
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,810
I promise not to go into the room
you choose.

1796
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:46,520
- Please, I beg of you.
- You should go ahead.

1797
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,920
(He sends Se Chan first.)

1798
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,650
I'll trust you one last time.

1799
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,650
Tell me the room you'll go into.

1800
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:55,630
(Their negotiation starts
when there's no one around.)

1801
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:57,630
I won't go into the room you're in
if you give me a dollar.

1802
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,690
All right now.
Which room are you going to?

1803
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,730
Okay. I won't go into room number two.

1804
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,370
Please keep your promise.

1805
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:10,810
- I won't go into room number two.
- I'll trust you.

1806
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,440
- Please keep your promise.
- Okay.

1807
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,710
Can't you trust me?

1808
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:16,270
You already earned so much.

1809
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:17,310
Okay.

1810
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,190
Please go in now.

1811
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,420
(Quietly and quickly, they strike a deal.)

1812
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,520
(The last person,
Haha, enters a room.)

1813
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,650
Mr. Officer.

1814
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:23,810
(The last person,
Haha, enters a room.)

1815
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:26,830
("Infinite Challenge")

1816
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:30,630
(Haha asks for his help
for old times' sake.)

1817
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:33,770
Barely.

1818
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:34,900
(That won't work on me.)

1819
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:40,810
I won't go into room number two.
I promise you.

1820
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:46,250
(Haha went straight into room number 2.)

1821
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,400
I...

1822
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,650
I bribed Jae Suk.

1823
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,480
- The search has begun.
- He won't come into this room.

1824
01:00:55,810 --> 01:01:00,350
(Meanwhile, the rest of them
are gathered in room number 1.)

1825
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:05,130
(The search begins.)

1826
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:09,770
Should I pick a small store
or a pawn shop?

1827
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:14,230
(Room number 1
where 4 of them are gathered)

1828
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:17,130
(Room number 2 where Haha
bribed Jae Suk not to come in)

1829
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,540
Despite all that,
the tiger moths gathered here.

1830
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:23,380
(Despite all that,
the tiger moths gathered here.)

1831
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:26,620
Goodness. Why is no one here?

1832
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:27,920
(His 1st search fails.)

1833
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:29,920
I cleared one room.

1834
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,460
(The room is full of tension
after the 1st crisis.)

1835
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,730
I'll pick the next room.

1836
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:34,730
(The room is full of tension
after the 1st crisis.)

1837
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,830
(Did you bribe him not to come in?)

1838
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:38,290
(I see.)

1839
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,230
Darn you! You fraud!

1840
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,900
(Officer Yoo betrayed them again.)

1841
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,710
- You fraud!
- Come here!

1842
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:48,330
- You fraud!
- Come out here!

1843
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,210
Don't talk back.

1844
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,150
- I thought Haha bribed you.
- You fraud.

1845
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:53,150
(Haha only ended up losing his gem.)

1846
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:54,480
I thought Haha bribed you.

1847
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,540
- Let's see how it'll turn out.
- Yes!

1848
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,980
Have a seat. Have a seat.

1849
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,620
The cop is clearly at an advantage.

1850
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,650
Those who were in room number one...

1851
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:06,080
get 2 bottles, 2 gems, and a dollar each.

1852
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,520
- My gosh.
- I wasn't in that room.

1853
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,150
2 bottles, 2 gems

1854
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:12,630
Next, Haha and Suk Jin
will pick their cards.

1855
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:14,520
- Let's throw one to the center.
- Okay.

1856
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,540
(It's time for Haha and Suk Jin
to pick their cards.)

1857
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,770
- One...
- Wait a minute. Suk Jin...

1858
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:19,960
Why are you laughing?

1859
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,000
I'm not concerned about them.

1860
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
(Officer Yoo is looking forward
to collecting more items from them.)

1861
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,600
- Get up.
- I'm not concerned about them.

1862
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,810
Please count to three.

1863
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:27,810
1, 2...

1864
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:28,810
(They'll choose their cards right away.)

1865
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:29,810
Three!

1866
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:32,810
- What?
- What is it?

1867
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:36,460
(Haha chose to stay quiet,
and Suk Jin's card is facing down.)

1868
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:40,730
(If Suk Jin chose to stay quiet,
they can earn all the items.)

1869
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:41,730
(What did Suk Jin choose?)

1870
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:42,730
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1871
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:44,630
(What did Suk Jin choose?)

1872
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,290
Yes!

1873
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:02,970
(He chose to stay quiet!)

1874
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:04,330
(It's the first time
they all chose to stay quiet.)

1875
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:05,810
- We got it.
- We needed this.

1876
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,640
They're advancing ahead of us.

1877
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,470
My goodness.

1878
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:12,540
(When Suk Jin and Haha were arrested...)

1879
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,220
- If you don't stay quiet...
- Let's both stay quiet.

1880
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:16,390
- I can't... What will you choose?
- Okay, okay.

1881
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:18,910
You should swear on Dream.

1882
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:21,350
- "Dream, I won't betray your dad."
- Dream.

1883
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:25,080
Dream, if I betray your dad,
I won't be able to face you.

1884
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,830
I promise you.
You promise Hyun Woo too.

1885
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:29,220
- Promise Hyun Woo.
- Hyun Woo, if I betray your dad,

1886
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,700
you don't need to call me uncle,
and I won't go near your house.

1887
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,100
- But...
- Dream, I promise to stay quiet.

1888
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,370
- Hyun Woo, you got it, right?
- Dream, I promise you.

1889
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,240
- Married men, cross!
- Married men, cross!

1890
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,240
(Married men, cross!)

1891
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:43,450
(Their loyalty came to fruition.)

1892
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:45,540
(Officer Yoo gains nothing,
and Round 4 ends.)

1893
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:46,720
I should buy some items too.

1894
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,250
I'll exchange these.

1895
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,640
(Officer Yoo buys points.)

1896
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:50,850
That's seven points.

1897
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:53,750
- Here you go.
- Haha, you should...

1898
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:55,350
My gosh.

1899
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:58,250
(If someone buys off points,
a new card takes its place.)

1900
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:01,100
I'm going to buy ten points.

1901
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,950
There you go.

1902
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:04,720
(Jong Kook buys off 10 points,
and the card is replaced.)

1903
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,060
Se Chan.

1904
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:08,540
(Se Chan buys off points too.)

1905
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:13,430
(The three of them take the lead.)

1906
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:15,370
I'll pick a new ball now.

1907
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:18,100
(They draw a new ball to pick a new cop.)

1908
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:19,580
(Haha)

1909
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,220
- It's me.
- Haha.

1910
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:22,910
(The 3rd cop is Haha.)

1911
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,040
Thank goodness.
I used all of my items.

1912
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,180
Here you go.

1913
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,220
(Haha got a golden opportunity.)

1914
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,850
Please decide the order.

1915
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:30,290
Ji Hyo should go first.

1916
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,220
(The 6 gangsters entered the rooms.)

1917
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:39,600
(Haha begins the search.)

1918
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,330
2 bottles and 6 dollars.

1919
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:43,370
(Haha contemplated a lot.)

1920
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:45,140
Get out, you punks!

1921
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:46,430
(He manages to catch 4 gangsters.)

1922
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:47,910
(Room number 5,
they can exchange their items here.)

1923
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:50,200
No one was in room number 1.
No one goes in there.

1924
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,600
(After Round 5,
only So Min and Jae Suk remain.)

1925
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,180
(They finally get a chance
to take the items.)

1926
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:57,720
My gosh, this is...

1927
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,220
(Despite that,
Officer Haha seems relaxed.)

1928
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:00,290
Let's pick one, everyone.

1929
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:02,120
We can choose to stay quiet.

1930
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,160
But Se Chan could choose to snitch.

1931
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,620
- No, he won't.
- I...

1932
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,350
- It's because...
- I have too many bottles.

1933
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:08,350
He has too many bottles.

1934
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:10,060
- I'll choose to bribe.
- Okay, you should do that.

1935
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,660
Those who are going to bribe can do that.

1936
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:13,060
Let's go with either bribing
or staying silent.

1937
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:14,700
- Go.
- One,

1938
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:16,660
two,

1939
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,500
(Not many rounds remain now.)

1940
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,500
three.

1941
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,240
(Which gangsters will acquire the items?)

1942
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,240
Show your card.

1943
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:25,200
Snitch, snitch, bribe.

1944
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:28,620
(Snitch, snitch, snitch)

1945
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:29,750
Now,

1946
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,720
the three members who snitched
will lose all their belongings.

1947
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,060
(The three members who snitched
lost all their belongings.)

1948
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:36,180
I knew it.

1949
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,490
What?

1950
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:38,950
The three members who snitched
will lose all their belongings.

1951
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:41,160
The member who bribed the officer
will turn in one bottle.

1952
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:44,500
(Jong Kook avoids the situation
by turning in one bottle.)

1953
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:46,220
I am rich!

1954
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:47,330
(I am rich!)

1955
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,870
- I am rich!
- That's unbelievable.

1956
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,930
- I knew it.
- They will lose all the gems.

1957
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:53,930
My goodness.

1958
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:55,540
- Give me everything you've got.
- Here is my bribe.

1959
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:56,850
All right.

1960
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:59,080
Can't you stay silent?

1961
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:01,370
I lost everything.

1962
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:03,680
This is incredible!

1963
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,910
(Officer Haha goes around
to collect the items.)

1964
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,060
The next officer...

1965
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,450
should get ready to accept bribes from me.

1966
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:10,080
(The next officer should get ready
to accept bribes from me.)

1967
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:12,830
I will be able to sell these bottles
and construct a building.

1968
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:14,350
(Suk Jin)

1969
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:16,330
- We don't lose the dollars, right?
- That's right.

1970
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,970
For goodness' sake.

1971
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:19,290
Why did I take a risk?

1972
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:20,500
(Ji Hyo)

1973
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:24,270
- It's best...
- I am no longer at the bottom.

1974
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:25,470
to be the officer.

1975
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,180
Choose the next order.

1976
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:28,600
It's Round Six.

1977
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:31,310
- This time...
- He is finally smiling.

1978
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:33,620
- Jae Suk, go in first.
- Okay.

1979
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:36,580
Officer Haha finally smiles
after getting conned twice.

1980
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:37,990
I confiscated so much.

1981
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:39,390
I tasted sweet success.

1982
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,160
We gave you that success.

1983
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,160
(Officer Haha smiles from ear to ear.)

1984
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:47,290
(He displays his items
as he breathes heavily.)

1985
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:49,060
(My goodness.)

1986
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:50,660
You have everything.

1987
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:52,500
You have everything.

1988
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:54,770
- Officer Haha, are you happy?
- Yes.

1989
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,290
Pick the next person.

1990
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:57,540
Anyone can go.

1991
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,810
I must be at the bottom.

1992
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:00,830
(The gangster
who lost everything is bitter.)

1993
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:02,580
- Go, Se Chan.
- I will go next.

1994
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:04,000
So Min, go.

1995
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,350
(The gangsters begin to enter.)

1996
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:06,500
I will go next.

1997
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:07,620
(The gangsters begin to enter.)

1998
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:09,870
(After deciding the order,)

1999
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:11,020
You found composure.

2000
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:12,310
(he enjoys some free time with a snack.)

2001
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:13,750
You designed this game so well.

2002
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,180
It's so much fun.

2003
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:16,830
I am so absorbed.

2004
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:18,990
Is it room number four?

2005
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:21,200
(Officer Haha begins
to search the rooms excitedly.)

2006
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,200
Is it?

2007
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,720
Shall I enter?

2008
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:26,520
Shall I?

2009
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,430
Shall I open the curtain?

2010
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:29,640
(He is overly absorbed.)

2011
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:32,060
(Officer Haha's voice becomes loud
after tasting success.)

2012
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:33,060
Come on out!

2013
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:35,580
(He barges into room number two.)

2014
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:36,680
For goodness' sake!

2015
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:37,810
(For goodness' sake!)

2016
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:39,270
(Suk Jin gets apprehended.)

2017
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:40,680
Why did you come to this room?

2018
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:43,350
(He gets apprehended in a 1-dollar room.)

2019
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,410
Hey.

2020
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,580
Hey.

2021
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:48,910
Why did you check the room
with so few items?

2022
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:52,160
I thought no one would enter
a one-dollar room.

2023
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:55,890
(The poor gangster doesn't have
anything to turn in.)

2024
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:57,220
Come on out! Gosh, it's empty.

2025
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,620
The room is completely empty.

2026
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:00,240
(He checks room number 3,
but fails to apprehend more people.)

2027
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:05,140
(Jae Suk and So Min
can't divide 1 dollar.)

2028
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:06,560
(Room number 5,
they can exchange their items here.)

2029
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:12,500
(The 3 members in room number 4 get
1 bottle and 2 dollars each.)

2030
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,770
All right.

2031
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:16,270
Haha, you can buy what you want.

2032
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:17,990
Haha will get many points.

2033
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:19,580
- Haha will get many points.
- Seriously.

2034
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:22,020
- Haha is excited right now.
- 2, 3.

2035
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,750
Now, two rounds remain.

2036
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,290
In the last two rounds,

2037
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:30,430
all the rewards are doubled.

2038
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:31,720
- That's incredible.
- Increase the rewards.

2039
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,470
The gems and bottles will be doubled...

2040
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:35,670
and two dollars will be added
to each room.

2041
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:37,600
- We can turn the tables.
- Rounds 7 and 8...

2042
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,340
will each have different officers.

2043
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,430
Let's turn the tables.

2044
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:43,240
The officer for Round Seven is...

2045
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,250
- Let me be the officer.
- I want to be the officer.

2046
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,550
Let me be the officer.

2047
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:48,470
(Who will be the officer
for this important round?)

2048
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:49,510
Suk Jin.

2049
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:51,510
So Min.

2050
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:54,350
- All right.
- Can we see the current scores?

2051
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:57,130
We need to do well in this round.

2052
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:58,680
I am at the bottom.

2053
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,590
You don't need to be wary of me.

2054
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:01,590
- Okay.
- I am at the bottom.

2055
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:02,700
So Min, I am at the bottom.

2056
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,300
I am the third from the bottom.
My ranking is pretty low.

2057
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:07,240
Ji Hyo, go first.

2058
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:10,460
You are sending the bottom ones first.

2059
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:12,510
I will send the bottom ones first.

2060
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:14,340
In every single round,

2061
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:15,880
I was apprehended.

2062
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:19,170
What could be the reason?
What's the reason?

2063
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:21,210
It's not like I entered
room number one all the time.

2064
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,010
I tried entering the room
with the smallest reward.

2065
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:24,750
- Do you breathe loudly?
- What could be the reason?

2066
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:26,290
- What could be the reason?
- You must breathe loudly.

2067
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:27,460
Do I breathe loudly?

2068
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,120
Please send the next person.

2069
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:30,330
I need to do well.

2070
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,590
I know which rooms
the gangsters will enter.

2071
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,260
(It's Officer Jeon's turn.)

2072
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:37,870
The search has begun.

2073
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:43,540
(She begins the search
as she pretends to be cool.)

2074
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,910
(Let's see here.)

2075
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:49,710
I will catch them without hesitation.

2076
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:54,270
(Which rooms will So Min choose?)

2077
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,970
I will choose...

2078
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:57,840
these rooms.

2079
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:01,010
These rooms.

2080
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,590
(She chooses rooms number 1 and 5.)

2081
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:07,200
(Will there be gangsters
inside the rooms So Min chose?)

2082
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,720
(She checks room number 1.)

2083
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,300
(She apprehends
Jae Suk, Haha, and Ji Hyo.)

2084
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,670
I got you, you punks.

2085
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:17,340
And I will go to...

2086
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,510
And I will go to...

2087
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:21,040
(She walks over to room number 5.)

2088
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,140
(Suk Jin gets apprehended again.)

2089
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,600
I got Suk Jin!

2090
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,010
Why did she enter this room?

2091
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:29,950
I got Suk Jin!

2092
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:33,310
He got apprehended again!

2093
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:34,510
Suk Jin, come on out.

2094
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:36,460
- What?
- I can't believe it.

2095
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:38,160
Hey.

2096
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:40,090
Room number five never got checked before.

2097
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:41,220
Did he get caught again?

2098
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,420
- Did he get caught again?
- Hey.

2099
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:45,500
- You entered that room!
- Of course.

2100
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,500
- That room...
- Why did you enter that room?

2101
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,670
I felt like someone would be inside.

2102
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:51,540
How did I get caught in room number five?

2103
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:53,240
Where are Se Chan and Jong Kook?

2104
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:55,010
They were in that room.

2105
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:57,880
In room number one were...

2106
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:00,340
three people, Ji Hyo, Haha, and Jae Suk.

2107
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,470
(Haha, Jae Suk, and Ji Hyo
got apprehended.)

2108
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:03,050
- Please decide.
- How many rounds remain?

2109
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:04,290
One round remains after this one.

2110
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:05,990
- It will be the last round.
- That's right.

2111
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:09,010
Then Ji Hyo has no reason to snitch.

2112
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:10,260
She needs items to buy points.

2113
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,090
- Of course.
- She will go silent.

2114
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:14,390
That's what I have been telling you.

2115
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,590
You have no reason to snitch either.

2116
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:18,200
- You have many points.
- I am holding the card.

2117
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,760
Please help me out, just this once.

2118
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,800
We should stay silent for Ji Hyo.

2119
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:25,870
All right. One,

2120
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:26,930
(Then Ji Hyo won't be at the bottom.)

2121
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:28,100
two,

2122
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:29,800
three.

2123
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,510
(What will be the three member's choices?)

2124
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,080
(Both Jae Suk and Ji Hyo
decided to snitch.)

2125
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:38,450
Look at that.

2126
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:39,510
(What is Haha's card?)

2127
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:40,660
I knew this would happen.

2128
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:41,960
(Bribe!)

2129
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,680
- Haha is good.
- I knew this would happen.

2130
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,130
- I chose to bribe her.
- Jae Suk.

2131
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:47,330
- Ji Hyo!
- I knew this would happen.

2132
01:11:47,330 --> 01:11:49,520
- What happened?
- I knew this would happen.

2133
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:51,460
I can't believe you.

2134
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,840
Jae Suk,
I told you I'm at the bottom.

2135
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,340
I couldn't let So Min confiscate
my belongings.

2136
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,340
- I had too much to lose.
- Put them in here.

2137
01:11:58,430 --> 01:11:59,910
Here is one bottle.

2138
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:01,130
I don't have any items.

2139
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:02,930
- Gosh.
- Why don't you have more?

2140
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,770
I will give you a bribe.

2141
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:07,170
I will be at the bottom anyway.

2142
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:08,550
Is there a chance to turn the tables?

2143
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,120
I will choose the last officer,

2144
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,140
which will give you a chance
to turn the tables.

2145
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:14,260
(Please let me be an officer this time.)

2146
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:15,590
- Here it comes.
- Okay.

2147
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:18,590
(Who will be the last officer?)

2148
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,390
Ji Hyo.

2149
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:22,700
(The last officer is Ji Hyo!)

2150
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:24,090
- Oh, no.
- Gosh!

2151
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,830
Let's go.

2152
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,630
I am so absorbed in the game.

2153
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:31,010
Hey, that's because
things are going well for you.

2154
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:33,010
I am so bored right now.

2155
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:34,600
I get caught in every room.

2156
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,770
No one goes silent.

2157
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:37,050
- You know,
- I lose everything when I snitch.

2158
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:38,340
you are just bad at the game.

2159
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,010
I have no items for a bribe.

2160
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:41,340
(He gets apprehended
100 percent of the time.)

2161
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:42,450
Six points.

2162
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:43,920
Suk Jin.

2163
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:46,510
Suk Jin, room number 5
lets you do a 1-on-1 exchange.

2164
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:48,920
You should turn in your glasses and hat...

2165
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,380
for items.

2166
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:52,660
I could get ten points.

2167
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:55,050
- Hey.
- What? Excuse me!

2168
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:56,700
Would you give me a chance...

2169
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,500
to enter room number five by myself?

2170
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,500
- Sure.
- Room number five?

2171
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,670
- Yes.
- Will that help you?

2172
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:02,300
I could get ten points.

2173
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,560
Okay, okay.

2174
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:04,760
But you can't buy 10 points.

2175
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,840
Is that your plan?

2176
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,130
- Why are you sharing your plan?
- Well, no matter what I do,

2177
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:10,410
- I get apprehended anyway.
- You have nothing.

2178
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:12,340
Even when I don't share my plan,
I get caught.

2179
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:13,770
- All right.
- What choice do I have?

2180
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:15,770
I will enter room number five...

2181
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,840
- if no one wants to enter it.
- I won't enter it.

2182
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,810
- I can't divide the money.
- Ji Hyo is sitting right here.

2183
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:20,380
She will do what she wants.

2184
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:22,680
You won't enter room number five, right?

2185
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,520
- Room number 5? Okay.
- Room number 5.

2186
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,220
- That room has a small reward.
- Okay.

2187
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:27,960
You don't need to come, okay?
I'm off.

2188
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:29,390
Keep your promise, guys.

2189
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:31,590
Who is next?
Please pick the next person.

2190
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:33,870
- Shall I go next?
- Yes.

2191
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:36,000
I will go in search of Suk Jin.

2192
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,040
He should be in room number 1 or 5.

2193
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,410
- Room number 1 or 5.
- Yes.

2194
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:41,210
(Will Jae Suk enter room number 5
after Suk Jin?)

2195
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:42,410
He is a hunter.

2196
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:44,210
- A hunter for Suk Jin.
- A hunter for Suk Jin.

2197
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:46,410
Let's catch Suk Jin

2198
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:47,880
Yes, yes, yes

2199
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,920
Let's catch Suk Jin

2200
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,340
- Yes, yes, yes
- Yes, yes, yes

2201
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:52,880
In which room is Suk Jin?

2202
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:54,120
Room number five!

2203
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,010
Is he in room number one?

2204
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:58,630
(Where is Suk Jin?)

2205
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:00,520
It won't be good for you
to choose a room with one person.

2206
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,720
You should catch someone with items.

2207
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:03,660
You should catch Haha.

2208
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:04,830
No, Haha...

2209
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,460
- You are right.
- You just need his belongings.

2210
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:08,260
(For Ji Hyo to avoid being the bottom,)

2211
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,000
For goodness' sake.

2212
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:12,040
This is a tricky situation.

2213
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,460
(she needs to catch Haha,
the member with lots of items!)

2214
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:17,970
(Haha chose room number 4.)

2215
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:26,710
The search has begun.

2216
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:31,380
(For Ji Hyo to beat So Min and Suk Jin,)

2217
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:36,000
(she needs to apprehend Haha,
the member who has the most stuff!)

2218
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:39,560
(The one who must avoid the search)

2219
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:40,760
If it were me...

2220
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,090
I will put myself in his shoes.

2221
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:43,930
(The one who must catch the gangster)

2222
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:46,410
If it were me...

2223
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:48,970
If it were me...

2224
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:50,410
(She puts herself in Haha's shoes.)

2225
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:54,640
(Haha is in room number 4.)

2226
01:14:57,950 --> 01:14:59,380
Room number four.

2227
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,420
Room number four.

2228
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:03,090
(Oh, no.)

2229
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:04,180
Room number three.

2230
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:06,050
Room number two. Hold on.

2231
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:07,590
(What will be Ji Hyo's first choice?)

2232
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:09,050
You are here!

2233
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:11,500
For goodness' sake.

2234
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,370
(But Jae Suk doesn't have any items.)

2235
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:16,170
Apprehending me
would be meaningless for you.

2236
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,740
For goodness' sake.

2237
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,540
You need someone with items.
You need to catch Haha.

2238
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:24,250
You need to catch Haha, Ji Hyo.

2239
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:25,770
Haha.

2240
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:28,950
(Is she heading to room number 4?)

2241
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:34,490
Room number four.

2242
01:15:36,710 --> 01:15:40,180
(A fierce game of wits
between the chaser and the chased)

2243
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:41,330
There you are!

2244
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:42,830
(Who will be the winner?)

2245
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:45,170
There you are!

2246
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:51,340
(Jong Kook, Suk Jin, and Se Chan
get apprehended.)

2247
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:52,460
There you are!

2248
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:54,380
(I'm safe!)

2249
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:58,880
(Haha gets 2 bottles and 5 dollars!)

2250
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,410
All right.

2251
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:04,790
(So Min gets an exchange card
and 5 dollars.)

2252
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:07,620
I was so scared that you would come.

2253
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:10,180
- Were you in room number 5?
- Haha was in room number 4.

2254
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:11,260
Which rooms did you check?

2255
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:13,160
I have nothing to give you.

2256
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:15,660
Jae Suk, do you have any belongings?

2257
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:16,800
No, I don't.

2258
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:18,760
- Jong Kook and Se Chan.
- Yes?

2259
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,670
This is a good time for us
to come together.

2260
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:23,430
It's only a matter of obtaining
a few more dollars.

2261
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:26,170
What's the point of snitching
to obtain a few more dollars?

2262
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,510
Let's think about the rankings then.

2263
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:29,670
What will happen?

2264
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:32,210
For example,
Jong Kook could be in first place.

2265
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:34,420
I could beat the two of them...

2266
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,950
and be in fifth place.

2267
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:38,050
- It's plausible.
- Really?

2268
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:39,990
- That's a big reward.
- With those goods,

2269
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:41,920
- I could win so many points.
- There are dollars too.

2270
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:44,790
I could buy over ten... Ten points.

2271
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,260
(His voice cracks.)

2272
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:50,300
- Dr. Hwang Soo Kwan.
- What's up with your voice?

2273
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,370
- "I could buy over ten points."
- Dr. Hwang Soo Kwan.

2274
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:53,560
Over ten points.

2275
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,090
I could buy over ten points.

2276
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:56,200
What's up with your voice?

2277
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,630
- He is flustered.
- I could buy...

2278
01:16:57,630 --> 01:16:59,040
17 to 18 points.

2279
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,100
He is nervous.

2280
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,410
I need to stay silent
if I want to place second.

2281
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:03,950
- Will you stay silent?
- I will stay silent.

2282
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,670
I will stay silent.
It's meaningless for me to snitch.

2283
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:08,380
Why... Do you believe Suk Jin?

2284
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:10,510
You can believe me.
I have no reason to snitch.

2285
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:11,950
Even if you snitch...

2286
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:13,120
It won't do me any good...

2287
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,120
because your belongings will go to Ji Hyo.

2288
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:17,180
It won't do me any good. I can't snitch.

2289
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:18,660
I can't snitch even if it's entertaining.

2290
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:20,180
Then you won't be entertaining today.

2291
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:22,020
- No. It's unfortunate.
- It's unfortunate.

2292
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,550
Think about it.

2293
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:25,370
- Please make up your mind.
- It won't do me any good...

2294
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,590
to give items to my competitor, Ji Hyo.

2295
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:29,200
I have no interest in beating you guys.

2296
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,430
I have an interest
in beating the two of them.

2297
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:34,270
Let's go. It's a competition.

2298
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:37,380
I have no interest in beating you guys.

2299
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:39,670
I have an interest
in beating the two of them.

2300
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:40,770
(Suk Jin must beat So Min
and Ji Hyo to avoid the penalty.)

2301
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:41,840
One,

2302
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:43,550
two,

2303
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:45,680
- three.
- Did someone snitch?

2304
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,750
What?

2305
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:47,810
(Jong Kook chose to be silent!)

2306
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:49,090
- Did someone snitch?
- What?

2307
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:50,790
(Suk Jin chose to be silent too!)

2308
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:52,130
(Se Chan chose to snitch!)

2309
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:53,960
- Hey.
- He snitched.

2310
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,020
(Se Chan chose to snitch!)

2311
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:57,630
(Upset)

2312
01:17:58,060 --> 01:17:59,370
Okay. That's it.

2313
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:01,060
(Se Chan, in 4th place,
suddenly snitched.)

2314
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:02,500
Hey, you...

2315
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,840
This is how I become second place!

2316
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,370
- Hey.
- He is in second place.

2317
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:06,960
I saw the possibility.

2318
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,210
(There is a reason
why Se Chan snitched in the end.)

2319
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,800
Snitch, snitch.

2320
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,510
(Se Chan had given up on winning
after Haha took all of his items.)

2321
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:15,010
(No, you can take 2nd place.)

2322
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:18,790
(He belatedly realized
that he can take 2nd place.)

2323
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:21,010
(He saw the possibility of taking
2nd place,)

2324
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:23,960
(but he feigned ignorance
to catch Suk Jin off guard.)

2325
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,500
(He took all the items,
thanks to his poker face.)

2326
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:30,200
We don't know the result yet. Let's see.

2327
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:32,830
It was a mistake to trust you.

2328
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:34,300
For goodness' sake.

2329
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:35,760
(Se Chan ripped off Suk Jin.)

2330
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:36,870
Until the end...

2331
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:38,370
I had no intention
to enter room number one.

2332
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:40,300
I had my hopes up until the end.

2333
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,380
Why did you trust Ssaebssaeb?

2334
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:43,800
Jong Kook and Suk Jin,
give all of your belongings...

2335
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,840
except for the money to Ji Hyo.

2336
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,010
Se Chan will receive seven dollars...

2337
01:18:50,010 --> 01:18:51,550
as well as 4 gems and 4 bottles.

2338
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,590
- That's incredible.
- He will be in second place.

2339
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:56,990
Thank you.

2340
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:58,920
(Heavy)

2341
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,590
- I shouldn't have...
- Justice lives!

2342
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:03,000
- "Justice lives?"
- Justice lives!

2343
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,220
(He thinks it's justice when he wins.)

2344
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:06,520
It's time for the final purchase.

2345
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,460
Ji Hyo can go first.

2346
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:10,670
Shall I purchase ten points?

2347
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:12,430
Don't I have enough items?

2348
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:13,840
- Both?
- Yes.

2349
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:15,470
(Which gangsters will win the prizes?)

2350
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:17,510
I will reveal the prizes.

2351
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:19,750
It's the luxurious tomahawk steak.

2352
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:20,810
What is that?

2353
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:22,810
- The second place will get melons.
- I love melons.

2354
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:25,680
I will reveal the final scores.

2355
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:26,680
Okay.

2356
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:29,160
1st place has 39 points.

2357
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,490
It's Haha.

2358
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:32,380
2nd place has 35 points. It's Se Chan.

2359
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,090
Is it me? Okay!

2360
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:36,830
Bang, bang, bang!

2361
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:40,520
3rd place is Jae Suk with 23 points.

2362
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,960
4th place is Jong Kook with 22 points.

2363
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,000
Fifth place is...

2364
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,010
(Only one of them will avoid the penalty!)

2365
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:47,340
So Min with 20 points.

2366
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:49,380
- 20 points.
- Thank goodness.

2367
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:51,580
6th place is Ji Hyo with 10 points.

2368
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,050
7th place is Suk Jin with 4 points.

2369
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,840
- What did you do today?
- Four points?

2370
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:56,950
- Four points!
- What did you do today?

2371
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:58,840
- That's too much.
- Four points?

2372
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,450
Didn't you work today?

2373
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:02,180
- What did you do?
- How did you get four points?

2374
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:03,590
How did you get four points?

2375
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,260
That's so funny. What a cute score.

2376
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:06,830
The officer followed me
every time I entered a room.

2377
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:08,760
Suk Jin with four points.

2378
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,800
I will now reveal the penalty.

2379
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,300
Give us something easy.

2380
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,540
A single decision will change your fate...

2381
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:17,000
in the Random Gun Game.

2382
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:19,510
One water gun has ink
and the other one has water.

2383
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:21,840
That's nice. It's a doable penalty.

2384
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:22,970
Okay.

2385
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:24,640
Have your backs against each other.

2386
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,450
(They have a cute water gun match
on an expensive set.)

2387
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:28,710
(There is no special equipment.)

2388
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:30,210
It's cool. It's like a music video.

2389
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:31,810
(Cameraman Kang Chan Hee moves
the camera himself.)

2390
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:35,990
(Too much money was spent on the set
to borrow special equipment.)

2391
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:38,380
One.

2392
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:39,550
(Since there is no special equipment,)

2393
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:41,130
- 2.
- 2.

2394
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:43,220
(their steps create tension.)

2395
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:44,760
Three.

2396
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,430
(Which gangster will get hit with ink?)

2397
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:49,630
Three.

2398
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:51,170
Turn around and shoot.

2399
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:53,840
(She gets covered in ink.)

2400
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,710
Bye, Suk Jin.

2401
01:20:56,710 --> 01:21:00,270
Don't come near me.

2402
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:03,880
- Suk Jin won.
- I can't believe I won.

2403
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,310
(Thus, the outlaws of the Wild West...)

2404
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:10,050
(remained in that world.)

2405
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,830
(The 7 members' 1st vacation
and the 2 energetic girls)

2406
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:15,760
(Han Chae Young and Hur Young Ji)

2407
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,000
- It's a creek.
- It has been a while.

2408
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:20,420
(They enjoy delicious food in nature,)

2409
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:22,370
(but right then...)

2410
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,410
(The vacation turns unpleasant.)

2411
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:25,630
(You are so unpleasant.)

2412
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:26,800
How am I unpleasant?

2413
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:30,470
(The high level of discomfort...)

2414
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:33,170
(makes the members sensitive.)

2415
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:35,420
(You are bound to be voted
Unpleasant Man today.)

2416
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:40,050
(Unpleasant Man ruins the vacation.)

2417
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:42,350
(Despite the presence of Unpleasant Man,)

2418
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:44,120
(they must have fun.)

2419
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:46,590
(Somewhere between unpleasantness
and pleasantness...)

2420
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:48,920
(lies their vacation of 2021.)

2421
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,830
- I am so upset.
- You are upset, right?

2422
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:52,370
- How about you?
- I am upset.

2423
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:54,200
- How about you?
- I am happy.

2424
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:57,340
(How will the vacation
of the energetic 9 turn out?)
