1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,760
(Please dress
for a vacation this week.)

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,260
(2 days before the shoot)

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,360
(Jae Suk's stylist says, "Okay."
Jong Kook's stylist says, "Okay.")

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,690
(Suk Jin's stylist says, "Okay."
Haha's stylist says, "Okay.")

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,730
(Ji Hyo's stylist says, "Okay."
So Min's stylist says, "Okay.")

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,730
(Se Chan's stylist says, "Okay.")

7
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,270
(And on the day of the shoot,)

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,170
(the weather forecast said
it would rain.)

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,860
(Summer rain wets Namhansanseong
as the weather forecast said.)

10
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,910
- Hello.
- Hello.

11
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,210
The rain feels refreshing.

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,680
Good morning.

13
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,610
- It's early summer.
- I'm doing this for Kwang Soo.

14
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,140
Seok Sam, you come here.

15
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,250
- Why am I Seok Sam?
- Hello.

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,550
Seok Sam. Aren't you a kid?

17
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,620
- I'm not a kid.
- Hello.

18
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,950
I thought you were a kid.

19
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,520
- Today...
- Vacation?

20
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,760
- We are going on a vacation,
- Yes.

21
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,120
but I guess
there was a misunderstanding.

22
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,350
Why? This is for a vacation.

23
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,330
Come here. I'll hold you.
I'm good at holding babies.

24
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,050
- There, there.
- There, there.

25
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,730
Good boy. You're such a good boy.

26
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,970
- He's a good boy.
- He looks lovely.

27
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,900
- You are strong.
- What?

28
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,230
I'm strong enough
to hold you upside down.

29
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,510
- And I can even spin you.
- I'm very impressed.

30
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,040
I thought you were our new member.

31
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,100
- I know.
- Will you join us?

32
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,950
- Join us.
- We're looking for new members.

33
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,450
I'm not cutting the hair
on the back of my neck.

34
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,450
- Why not?
- To replace Kwang Soo?

35
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,040
Someone has to do it.

36
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,710
That's right.
I should grow a mustache then.

37
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,180
- It looks like So Min is...
- I know.

38
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,930
- Is this a sheep ranch or what?
- She's doing a photoshoot.

39
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,230
- She's all dressed up.
- She's serious about this.

40
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,630
Are you shooting a drama here?

41
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,370
(A delusional girl
who wore a sundress on a rainy day.)

42
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,570
I thought you guys
would all dress up.

43
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,260
But I was surprised that
you all dressed normally.

44
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,840
- You know we never dress up.
- Hey.

45
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
- What?
- You're dressed to go to a gym.

46
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,100
This is how I look
when I go on a picnic.

47
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,600
His shirt has yellow on it.

48
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,400
- See? It's bright.
- This is how he always looks.

49
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,910
- It's bright, isn't it?
- Let me be honest.

50
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,450
I must say this...

51
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,010
as an entertainer.

52
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,590
- It's a cliche created by TV shows.
- I agree.

53
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,380
- Our stylists...
- Right.

54
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,010
- should think about that.
- Sure.

55
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,430
Just look at her.

56
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,380
- We don't dress up like So Min.
- Don't use words like "cliche."

57
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,930
- They're getting flustered.
- Cliche?

58
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,020
Cliche?

59
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,230
Cliche.

60
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,290
Doesn't that mean it's awkward?

61
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,820
I think...

62
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,630
- only five of us know the meaning.
- What's wrong with you?

63
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,430
Only five of us know what it means.

64
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,900
His yellow eyes were staring at me.

65
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,240
"Look at him."

66
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,680
Suk Jin.

67
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,180
Even if we make fun of Suk Jin,

68
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,180
- he won't yell at us today.
- Why not?

69
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,450
He needs to take care of his voice.
He has to sing.

70
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,670
- No.
- So, today...

71
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,750
- Why would you say that?
- No matter how much we tease him,

72
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,720
What a great singer.

73
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,910
he will never...

74
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,080
This is crazy.

75
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,560
- My gosh. You...
- What a great singer.

76
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,190
On YouTube,
he stopped ripping off name tags...

77
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,700
- and started singing.
- All of a sudden?

78
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,230
He doesn't even raise his voice.

79
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,600
(How the super rookie saves
his voice)

80
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,970
- He's saving his voice.
- I knew you would bring that up.

81
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,440
You should wear something
around your neck

82
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,700
- What do you do?
- Wear something around your neck.

83
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,040
- No, no.
- MSG?

84
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,860
We start fighting here and there
as soon as we meet.

85
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm recording a song today.

86
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,070
- Are you recording it today?
- Today...

87
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,810
So what are we doing today?

88
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,380
I heard it has something to do
with vacations.

89
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,480
Today,

90
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,580
- we are going on an early vacation.
- Okay.

91
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,820
And we have two delightful women
who will enjoy the vacation with us.

92
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,560
- Delightful women?
- Delightful women?

93
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,880
Two delightful women.

94
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,690
- Delightful women?
- Delightful women?

95
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,880
(Who are the delightful women?)

96
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,660
That looks amazing.

97
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,070
It's the van only for stars.

98
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,760
I want to go on a vacation
with my family in that van.

99
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,230
There's the product placement van.

100
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,630
Who are they?

101
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,160
- They must be stars.
- They are here.

102
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,230
Who are they?

103
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,310
(Who are the stars in the van?)

104
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,410
Who are they?

105
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,450
Isn't that Chae Young?

106
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,170
Han Chae Young? My gosh.

107
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,310
- Who are they?
- Han Chae Young?

108
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,350
It's been so long.

109
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,910
Isn't she Young Ji?

110
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,410
- It's Young Ji.
- My gosh.

111
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,610
(The two guests for the vacation!)

112
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,720
Han Chae Young?

113
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,010
- She's a delightful woman.
- "Delightful Girl, Chun Hyang."

114
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,350
They're dressed according to
the cliche created by TV shows.

115
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,060
- Hey.
- It's the cliche from TV shows.

116
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,130
Come on here.

117
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,570
Hello, Young Ji.

118
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,130
- How have you been?
- Hey, Young Ji. Welcome.

119
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,700
- Hello.
- It's been a long time.

120
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,790
- Hello.
- Stand in the middle.

121
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,330
- This is my first time seeing them.
- Young Ji.

122
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,570
This is too much.

123
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,440
Did you get your bangs cut
at a barbershop?

124
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,830
Young Ji and Chae Young.

125
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,980
Before we start...

126
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,310
I think I'm the only one
who heard this.

127
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,100
- What?
- What's the matter?

128
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,450
- What?
- Chae Young.

129
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,540
Don't be surprised.

130
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,010
"Hey, isn't she..."

131
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,450
"the living BB cream?"

132
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,480
BB cream?

133
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,910
(The living BB cream)

134
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,560
What?

135
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,630
He meant a Barbie doll.

136
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,320
- A Barbie doll?
- Suk Jin, it's a Barbie doll.

137
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,470
(When the guests first appeared)

138
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,100
(Suk Jin, Yellow Eyes,
"Isn't she the living BB cream?")

139
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,390
- My gosh.
- Hello.

140
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,040
(Casually greeting the BB cream)

141
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,700
What was that?

142
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,070
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

143
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,830
- That's how we greet guests.
- The living BB cream?

144
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,830
You should get used to it.

145
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,310
The living BB cream?

146
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,110
The living BB cream.

147
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,210
I meant...

148
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,620
I meant she has glowing skin.

149
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,050
He sounded so urgent.

150
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,080
He wanted to say something
that he knew first.

151
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,150
(He wanted to show
what he knows about the guests.)

152
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,490
The living BB cream.

153
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,490
I can't think of proper words
these days.

154
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,860
- It's driving me nuts.
- The living BB cream.

155
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,990
I've never met her before.

156
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,360
(She's a Barbie doll with
glowing skin and great proportions.)

157
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,630
I'm going nuts. What do we do?

158
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,700
- He meant she has good skin.
- Of course.

159
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,800
Pure skin.

160
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,570
They are our guests
for the Vacation Special.

161
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,940
It's been so long
since the last time we met them.

162
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,110
We have Han Chae Young and Young Ji!

163
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,810
(Han Chae Young and Young Ji
are here for the Vacation Special.)

164
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,680
By the way,

165
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,400
isn't this your first time
on our show, Chae Young?

166
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,340
- This is my first time.
- I knew it.

167
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,210
- Really?
- Seriously?

168
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,340
This is my first time.
Thank you for having me.

169
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,490
You know I fit right in
with the summer vacation vibe.

170
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,560
Is that why you asked me here?

171
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,150
(What?)

172
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,080
Wow, the living BB cream!

173
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,450
It speaks!

174
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,200
- The BB cream speaks!
- The BB cream speaks!

175
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,300
The BB cream is so pretty.

176
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,170
"Is that why you asked me here?"

177
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,630
(Unlike her cool looks,
she sounds somewhat frivolous.)

178
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,760
So we have the living BB cream,
Han Chae Young.

179
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,830
- We also have the Youngji Mushroom.
- Hello.

180
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,470
- Hello.
- I'm Young Ji.

181
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,950
- She's so cute.
- It's been a long time.

182
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,340
This is my first time as well.

183
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,900
- Seriously?
- Yes.

184
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,470
Then where did we meet?

185
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,050
I saw you on many different shows.

186
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,990
- I see.
- Why am I talking casually to you?

187
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,620
Where did I see her?

188
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,080
- We met a lot.
- I saw her a lot.

189
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,720
So this is your first time
on our show.

190
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,630
How did you feel
when you got a call from us?

191
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,590
I'm feeling nervous to be
on public TV after a long time.

192
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,390
Are you?

193
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,390
I've only been
on YouTube channels lately.

194
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,260
And it feels strange
to see Se Chan here.

195
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,260
- Why?
- Where did you see him?

196
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,810
- I host "Comedy Big League."
- That's right.

197
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,400
- Oh, right.
- So I see her...

198
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,740
- every week.
- We meet every week.

199
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,240
In the show, he sounds like...

200
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,950
- "Hey, guys."
- Hey!

201
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,140
Hey! Don't do that.

202
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,320
That's what he does.

203
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,880
- Gosh, that's annoying.
- But here...

204
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,620
- He acts like a leader.
- He's really...

205
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,620
(He acts like a leader.)

206
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,780
At "Comedy Big League,"

207
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,320
there's no one above me.

208
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,580
- Are you the senior?
- Yes, I am.

209
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,360
But you look like the youngest one.

210
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,560
- I'm the youngest here.
- He's the youngest here.

211
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,320
He's the youngest one here.

212
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,220
So he bosses people around
over there.

213
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,870
I should boss him around here today.

214
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,370
- That's...
- For Young Ji to see.

215
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,200
I'd like them to lift up the mood...

216
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,870
with their hit songs.

217
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,010
- My hit songs?
- Oh, right.

218
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,550
- Unnies.
- She was a member of Unnies.

219
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,070
- That's right.
- With Sook.

220
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,120
Do you remember the dance moves?

221
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,450
No, I don't.

222
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,010
(She says she doesn't remember,
but her eyes...)

223
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,080
Will she remember?

224
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,210
She gave me the chills.

225
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,990
(She passes her hat.)

226
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,150
She's changed.

227
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,650
(He takes it anyway.)

228
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,800
- You took it naturally.
- BB cream!

229
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,430
The BB cream is stepping up!

230
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,170
- BB cream!
- The living BB cream.

231
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,090
The living BB cream.

232
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,370
Something is a bit strange.

233
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,090
(She starts dancing to the rhythm.)

234
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,110
(Somewhat clumsy)

235
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,440
What is this?

236
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,180
What was that?

237
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,380
- What?
- It's a little slow.

238
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,510
It's somewhat...

239
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,550
(Her moves are listless
like sweaty BB cream.)

240
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,450
But her dance is...

241
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,190
She's not a good dancer though.

242
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,760
(Only does well on
the signature dance move)

243
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,220
I love this song. It's a good song.

244
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,260
There she goes.

245
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,520
(Charging)

246
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,960
(Swinging her hips as if she's squeezing
a tube of BB cream)

247
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,070
She's charming.

248
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,240
- That was fun.
- What is this?

249
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,510
It was fun. You know what?

250
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,310
When Chae Young passed this to me,

251
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,510
- I expected something amazing.
- Me too.

252
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,840
I never imagined
that she'd dance like this.

253
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,610
(The Barbie doll showed
rather frivolous dance moves.)

254
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,070
I expected something amazing.

255
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,690
I've never seen Ji Hyo
look so confident before.

256
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,750
- I can pull this off.
- Sure.

257
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,120
- Actually,
- She can pull that off.

258
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,450
Chae Young was a member
of a girl group.

259
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,690
- But Young Ji here...
- She's really good.

260
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,890
- She was an idol member.
- She's an idol artist.

261
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,260
She was a member of KARA.

262
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,300
- Can you show us, Young Ji?
- Sure.

263
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,170
I've never seen
Young Ji dance before.

264
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,170
(Youngji Mushroom's dance)

265
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,700
This is great.

266
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,870
(Her energy is a bit different
from the living BB cream.)

267
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,510
This is nice. Great.

268
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,510
- Let's go.
- Cool.

269
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,700
Go, Youngji Mushroom!

270
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,570
(Youngji Mushroom steps up.)

271
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,620
(Shocked)

272
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,690
(Startled)

273
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,010
She has resentment.
She's dancing out of resentment.

274
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,820
(Youngji Mushrooms are even better
than organic pine mushrooms.)

275
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,630
- That's right. She was an idol.
- Wow.

276
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,630
- She's good.
- She's great.

277
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,150
There you go!

278
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,930
(Her hips announce
her comeback as an idol star.)

279
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,770
- It's her original job.
- She's different.

280
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,360
She's really good.

281
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,040
She's good at her original job.

282
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,730
It's not over.

283
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,910
It's not over.

284
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,420
Mamma Mia!

285
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,190
(The variety show peddler's energy
on public TV)

286
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,290
- Nice expressions!
- She didn't forget the moves.

287
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,820
I love her facial expressions.

288
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,350
(All the men fall for Young Ji.)

289
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,790
(Youngji Mushroom is in season.)

290
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,030
She's still got the moves.

291
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,060
This is so cool.

292
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,720
- She's an idol artist.
- Dominate the cameras.

293
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,400
- She's...
- Stare at the jimmy jib.

294
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,640
She doesn't dance like that
on cable channels.

295
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
- To the jimmy jib.
- She does that only on public TV.

296
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,960
She's dominating the jimmy jib.

297
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,570
(Young Ji's dance came to public TV
for a vacation.)

298
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,770
That's who she is!

299
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,310
- She's so good.
- She's so energetic on public TV.

300
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,450
You don't do this on cable TV.

301
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,780
- You're not like this on tvN.
- I didn't know she'd dance so well.

302
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,240
- Her face changed right away.
- She was so serious.

303
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,450
Chae Young might feel like
Young Ji is trying...

304
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,820
to make fun of her.

305
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,290
It's not like that.

306
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,930
- I just thought...
- Right. She made her look bad.

307
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,350
I was just relieved
that I danced first.

308
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,120
I can't dance after this.

309
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,170
But this is all I can remember.

310
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,400
- I know.
- I could tell that...

311
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,270
- Young Ji sure was an idol artist.
- She's good.

312
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,330
- She couldn't hide it.
- How did she not forget it?

313
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,940
I miss KARA. I really do.

314
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,310
- He's seriously not talking today.
- That's not true.

315
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,950
- He's trying to save his voice.
- Right?.

316
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,210
I'm just waiting
for the right time to join in.

317
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,840
This is where
you should cheer for them.

318
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,150
- Right.
- I did cheer for them.

319
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,390
- Something like "Gosh."
- But I did.

320
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,210
- You should say something.
- No, it's not true.

321
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,290
I was just surprised.

322
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,950
- He's a singer just like her.
- That's not it.

323
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,320
- They're your seniors.
- Then why don't we...

324
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,590
- shout out loud together?
- Good.

325
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,120
Shout out loud.

326
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,720
Let's shout Running Man.

327
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,800
1, 2, 3.

328
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,320
- Running Man!
- Running Man!

329
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,640
- You didn't shout.
- Make it louder.

330
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,330
- I did.
- I can't believe this.

331
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,810
He's the worst since Myung Soo.

332
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,310
- It's not like that.
- He's the worst.

333
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,570
- He's just like Myung Soo.
- This is what Myung Soo did.

334
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,070
Myung Soo wasn't this bad though.

335
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,700
(He's the worst since Myung Soo
who didn't say "Challenge.")

336
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,780
You should speak.

337
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,680
I'm doing things the same as usual.

338
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,680
- Just be comfortable...
- That's awkward.

339
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,020
This is so awkward.

340
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,790
Suk Jin, you're not yourself today.

341
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,020
His head is full of
"How Do You Play?"

342
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,390
- That's not true.
- Seriously, he's...

343
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,610
It's not like that.

344
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,080
Even "How Do You Play?"
doesn't want you to be like this.

345
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,850
(Too much affection puts
the show's host on the spot.)

346
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,700
- I'm trying my best.
- Why does he...

347
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,460
keep messing with my shows?

348
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,460
That was my mistake.

349
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,460
(Crocodile tears on the quiz show,)

350
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,460
(too much affection
on the playing show)

351
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,140
Today is the Delightful Men
and Women's Vacation Race.

352
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,040
You will have missions
for the vacation bonus.

353
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,410
You'll be divided into three teams.

354
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,340
You can't go on a vacation with
more than five people these days.

355
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,450
That's right.

356
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,450
So you'll be split into teams
of 4, 4, and 1.

357
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,980
- 4, 4, and 1?
- Only one person?

358
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,580
- 4, 4, and 1?
- 4 people?

359
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,480
The 1-person team will be decided
through a game.

360
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,950
Even if you go solo,
you can win with a good strategy.

361
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,430
So don't give up.

362
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,560
The 1-person team will be so lonely.

363
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,490
At the end of each mission,

364
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,200
there will be a Mr. Unpleasant Poll
where you choose the worst member.

365
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
- Mr. Unpleasant?
- Oh, my.

366
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,360
We already chose
Mr. Unpleasant in the beginning.

367
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,270
- We sure did.
- Because of his BB cream joke...

368
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,600
His BB cream joke made him...

369
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,370
- I mean, why are you doing this?
- He wouldn't say.

370
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,280
Why suddenly change
the style of our show?

371
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,650
What's with this poll?

372
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,340
Even his tone of voice
sounds annoying too.

373
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,480
- Indeed.
- My gosh.

374
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,390
- He's so annoying.
- His tone of voice is...

375
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,390
Stop trying to speak politely!

376
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,530
Who speaks like that
on a variety show?

377
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,090
You'll end up bowing like this
when you say hello.

378
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,300
- Gosh.
- Why is he so funny these days?

379
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,090
- I mean, just speak as usual.
- Gosh, seriously.

380
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,590
With every Mr. Unpleasant Poll,

381
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,860
two people who get
the most votes will get a penalty.

382
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,370
We'll spin a roulette with the names
of the other seven people,

383
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,340
and the person who is chosen
will receive the vacation fund.

384
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,550
The winner will get
a cash prize today.

385
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,280
Each of you will receive...

386
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,480
a different amount of vacation funds
according to the game results.

387
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,110
All of you will begin
with 50 dollars.

388
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,580
- It triples if you win first place.
- It triples?

389
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,950
It doubles if you win second place.

390
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,530
Since you will team up
with different people in each round,

391
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,590
if you win 1st place in every round,
you'll get 27 times more money.

392
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,460
That means you can get
up to 1,350 dollars.

393
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,700
(The maximum amount
they can get is 1,350 dollars!)

394
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,140
- That's the maximum?
- I should do my best.

395
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,730
- Then let's divide you into teams.
- Okay.

396
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,640
A 1-person team
could be better than four.

397
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,470
We need to know
what games we'll play.

398
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,650
- What's this?
- It's like the ladder game.

399
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,820
- I guess that car will decide.
- It follows a black line, right?

400
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,950
- Yes.
- How do we play this game?

401
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,210
I guess that car will follow
one of those lines.

402
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,710
- By itself? It moves by itself?
- I think it will follow a line.

403
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,480
The mission for choosing
the 1-person team is...

404
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,660
That car follows a black line...

405
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,160
- using a sensor in it.
- It has a sensor in it.

406
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,660
- That's fascinating.
- That car?

407
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,160
Write down your names
at the end of the nine lines.

408
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,620
The person chosen by the car
will be the 1-person team.

409
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,960
- The person that the car chooses?
- Correct.

410
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,460
Then here... I'll write Haha's name.

411
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,460
Jong Kook, Seok Sam,

412
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,860
So Min, the living BB cream,

413
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,570
Youngji Mushroom, Ji Hyo,

414
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,540
- Jae Suk, and Se Chan.
- Jae Suk.

415
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:16,810
Here we go.

416
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,150
- We'll do this just once!
- Yes.

417
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,320
- Here we go.
- That's so fascinating.

418
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,780
- My, this is fascinating.
- Oh, wow.

419
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,820
(Se Chan, Jae Suk, Ji Hyo,
Young Ji, Chae Young)

420
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,820
(So Min, Suk Jin, Jong Kook, Haha)

421
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,020
- It's following the line.
- This is state-of-art.

422
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,660
- Let's go. Let's go.
- This is so amazing.

423
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,980
- Keep going.
- Go right. Go right!

424
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,930
- Seok Sam!
- Gosh, seriously.

425
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,090
- Seok Sam!
- Seok Sam!

426
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,220
- Seok Sam!
- Go right.

427
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,300
- Go right!
- It started moving already.

428
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,960
Where will it go?

429
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,140
That's great.

430
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,700
(Where will the train that carries
everyone's desires stop?)

431
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,040
- Let's go.
- This is so amazing.

432
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,940
- Keep going.
- Go right. Go right!

433
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,180
- Keep going.
- Go right.

434
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,870
(The train turns left
where there isn't Seok Sam's name.)

435
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,150
(1 of these 4 will be
the 1-person team.)

436
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,740
- Let's go.
- This is so amazing.

437
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,020
- Keep going.
- Go right. Go right!

438
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,050
- Ji Hyo!
- It's Ji Hyo.

439
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,150
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my. Ji Hyo?

440
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,320
- Oh, no. It's Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo will go alone?

441
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,110
- What is she going to do?
- Oh, no.

442
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,820
(The wishes of Seok Sam's fans
didn't come true in the end.)

443
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,580
- Can't we try it again?
- But...

444
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,320
- You know...
- Wouldn't that be better?

445
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,590
- It's Ji Hyo.
- I think we should try it again.

446
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,820
Let us try it again.

447
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,830
- Ji Hyo will be so lonely.
- Let's try again.

448
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,100
- It goes to the same line.
- This one is a little darker.

449
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,700
- Then...
- How about we make them darker?

450
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,230
- Shall we?
- Yes. Draw a line on top of them.

451
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,040
Right. Fill that area.

452
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,070
- Oh, that area?
- That's Seok Sam's line.

453
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,840
- Why?
- He drew only on Seok Sam's line.

454
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,450
(Only on Seok Sam's line.)

455
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,710
Only on Seok Sam's line.

456
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,190
- Suk Jin, why did you hit him?
- You're trying to make me alone.

457
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,580
- What's wrong with you?
- This is the last attempt.

458
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,520
- This is really the last attempt.
- Okay. Let's do this.

459
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,710
Hey, anyone can notice...

460
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,750
Even the viewers can tell
that it's darker than the others.

461
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,250
That's not true. Here we go.

462
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,900
We have to accept
the result this time.

463
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,590
Whoever is chosen this time,

464
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,860
- let's accept the result.
- Okay. I agree.

465
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,090
Okay, okay.

466
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,770
- Okay, okay.
- So Min, it turned toward yours.

467
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,330
Really? No,
I think it'll go toward Suk Jin's.

468
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,970
(Will the train go the way
they want it to?)

469
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,970
- Youngji Mushroom?
- Youngji Mushroom?

470
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,240
- No, no.
- It should be separated.

471
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,050
- You said it was the last attempt.
- Our guests are the exception.

472
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,110
(They get very calm
at the unwanted result.)

473
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,290
- Then just put it to a vote.
- She's our guest.

474
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,560
She's our guest, you know.

475
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,930
- Why are the guests an exception?
- Hold on.

476
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,820
- Hold on a second.
- Why is there a bump here?

477
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,530
Let's just close our eyes and...

478
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,090
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Wait and see.

479
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,140
- I'm fixing the names.
- We should fix the names.

480
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,830
- Write Seok Sam's name on the left.
- Okay.

481
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,680
That's better.

482
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,810
- Just tell me to do it.
- No.

483
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,000
Just tell me.

484
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,180
- We should keep it fair.
- It's a random choice.

485
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,110
- Stop pretending to be scientific.
- It's a random choice.

486
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,070
- It's a random choice.
- To be fair...

487
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,480
- Use plenty of nano-tech.
- I wonder who will be chosen.

488
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,690
(They play until
they get the result they want.)

489
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,450
- Just say it's me!
- Seok Sam.

490
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,950
- Suk Jin.
- I'll gladly do as you want.

491
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,190
Speak louder, will you?

492
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,560
I'm practically shouting, you punk!

493
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,120
- Louder than that.
- Speak even louder.

494
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,620
In a variety show tone!

495
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,490
- This is... So Min's line.
- That's... So Min, Ji Hyo.

496
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,770
- I'm so excited.
- Stop pretending it's fair.

497
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,270
We'll accept the result this time.

498
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,640
- This is fair.
- We won't manipulate the result.

499
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,640
Now it's fair.

500
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,910
- This is the real deal.
- This is driving me nuts.

501
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,440
My gosh. This is so exciting.

502
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,870
- Fine. All right.
- Seok Sam.

503
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,070
All right. I'll do it.

504
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,470
Okay. It's Seok Sam!

505
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,520
(With his fan's interference,
Seok Sam has been chosen!)

506
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,890
It's Seok Sam!

507
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,190
Why did we even do this?

508
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,920
Just take it to a vote.

509
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,160
- We couldn't let our guest...
- Or the director could've chosen.

510
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,320
be alone from the beginning.

511
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,060
- That's just an excuse.
- You know that.

512
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,300
- We'll change the teams each round.
- Do it just this time.

513
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,700
- Okay, okay.
- Don't worry.

514
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,700
- Then I will...
- It's coming up.

515
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,960
- I'll divide you into two teams.
- Suk Jin. Okay.

516
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,300
Divide them into 2 teams of 4.

517
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,800
Go ahead.

518
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,140
Today, we'll play games,
like on "Family Entertainment."

519
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,200
That's a good idea!

520
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,040
- Let's do this.
- "Let's check the scores!"

521
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,070
The teams will be divided by gender.

522
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,950
- Okay!
- Team Boy versus Team Girl.

523
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,020
Yes.

524
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,180
- We don't know what game it is.
- Right.

525
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,480
(Team Boy, Team Girl, Team Seok Sam)

526
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,020
Where should each team sit?

527
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,020
- Team Boy is on this side.
- Team Boy...

528
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,980
- We're divided by gender, right?
- Yes.

529
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,580
- "Family Entertainment."
- Gosh. I'm alone.

530
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,620
What?
What is this? There's a camera...

531
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,750
Oh, what's that?

532
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,860
- What is that?
- Will they observe us?

533
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,800
- He's in there.
- You see a lot of this in Gangnam.

534
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,770
Stop acting cute.

535
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,940
- You can take off your mask.
- Take off your mask.

536
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,360
(Laughing)

537
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,540
- Chae Young.
- What is it?

538
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,300
(She suddenly bursts out laughing.)

539
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,150
- What was that?
- What made you laugh?

540
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,350
What made you laugh?

541
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,120
- Exactly what made you laugh?
- Well...

542
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,310
I didn't know everyone except me was
wearing a mask earlier.

543
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,860
But this time, I was the only one
who was wearing it.

544
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,930
- Chae Young is...
- She has a unique sense of humor.

545
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,950
Chae Young is always
one step behind.

546
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,490
- She's funny.
- Exactly.

547
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,450
- She's always one tempo behind.
- She's really unique.

548
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,560
She saw that all of us were
wearing a mask.

549
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,340
So she put on a mask hastily.

550
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,640
And when we aren't wearing
a mask, she is wearing one.

551
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,260
- She's one tempo behind.
- I'm cute, right?

552
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,840
She said, "I'm cute, right?"

553
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,970
(I'm cute, right?)

554
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,740
"I'm cute, right?"

555
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,910
(She boosted the energy
with her unique tone of voice.)

556
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,040
Okay. The first mission
that will make your vacation...

557
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,980
- more fun and exciting is...
- Yes!

558
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,810
The Midday Dancers.

559
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,810
- "Dancers?"
- Oh, we're going to dance?

560
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,430
- Dancing?
- But this place is too...

561
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,700
(They must copy the dance moves
on the screen to win.)

562
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,430
- Oh, we're going to dance.
- Really?

563
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,760
But aren't they at an advantage?

564
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,370
Chae Young and Young Ji
have experience.

565
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,140
(An idol singer's groove)

566
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,530
I learned how to do that too.

567
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,800
- Show us.
- Oh, my.

568
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,440
- She's so stiff.
- She's dancing.

569
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,940
- Okay. Very stiff.
- She's dancing.

570
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,470
(Bowing)

571
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,300
- Ji Hyo.
- Look at Ji Hyo.

572
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,620
- Ji Hyo...
- She looked like she was bowing.

573
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,850
They're trying to get the drop
on me.

574
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,090
- That's nothing. We can do better.
- Of course.

575
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,690
- This is too easy for us.
- We can do this so easily.

576
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,890
They're good dancers too.

577
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,250
- Let's do that too.
- All right.

578
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,750
Let's do it. Here we go.

579
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,790
Here we go.

580
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,260
Stiff. Stiff.

581
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,670
(The wave encountered obstacles.)

582
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,530
Stiff. Stiff.

583
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,260
I think Ji Hyo is
a little bit better than Chae Young.

584
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,730
- Right? I'm better than her, right?
- Yes.

585
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,270
- I'm better than Chae Young.
- What was that?

586
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,500
That's how we finish up.

587
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,040
- There are three teams in total.
- Yes.

588
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,180
2 teams will have a match at a time
and there are 3 rounds in 1 game.

589
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,210
- Okay.
- Three rounds?

590
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,090
One person from each team will
come forward to have a match.

591
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,780
But there's no one else
on Suk Jin's team.

592
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,950
- He'll represent his own team.
- Gosh. Why is it a dancing game?

593
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,220
Suk Jin, will it be okay?
You're a balladeer.

594
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,720
- It's okay.
- Exactly.

595
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,750
He's a balladeer?

596
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,720
- Balladeers hate dancing.
- True.

597
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,670
(The great balladeer's dance
can only be seen in this game.)

598
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,430
The 4-person teams can change
the player...

599
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,940
as many times as you want
during the song.

600
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,940
- Really?
- I see.

601
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,960
- That's great.
- Nice.

602
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,940
Maybe you will have to dance
the entire song.

603
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,530
(He already seems tired.)

604
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,380
The first match is
between Suk Jin and Team Girl.

605
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,970
(Team Suk Jin versus Team Girl)

606
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,310
- What song is it?
- The order of players is important.

607
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,450
Who will go first?

608
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,480
- If Chae Young comes out...
- Here.

609
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,810
Chae Young, you should go first.

610
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,480
- Chae Young will go first.
- Go, Living BB cream!

611
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,550
(The balladeer chose
the living BB cream.)

612
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,780
- Go, Living BB Cream!
- You can do it!

613
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,100
- Go, Living BB Cream!
- We have the living BB cream!

614
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,360
Go, balladeer!

615
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,700
Go, living human being!

616
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,960
Go, balladeer!

617
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,490
If Suk Jin sees it...

618
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,490
She looks like a samba dancer.

619
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,670
- Here you go.
- Let's begin.

620
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,460
She really looks
like the living BB cream.

621
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,700
Amazing!

622
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,030
- She's the living BB cream.
- Yes, she is.

623
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,300
The living BB cream looks amazing.

624
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,700
We'll start the game now.

625
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,770
It's started.

626
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,450
It's started.

627
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,470
Step forward.

628
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,450
Oh, gosh.

629
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,950
- Suk Jin, raise your arms.
- You're doing great.

630
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,220
- That's great!
- Raise your arms!

631
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,550
Suk Jin, you should raise
your arms like that.

632
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,790
This is so difficult.

633
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,330
Hey, this is too difficult.

634
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,700
I can't keep up.

635
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,840
You know...

636
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,340
That's incredible.

637
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,140
- How...
- She keeps getting the blue one.

638
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,230
This doesn't make sense.

639
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,940
(Chae Young is doing well.)

640
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,770
You can actually learn choreography
by playing this game.

641
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,810
(His body is moving
in a disorderly manner.)

642
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,980
- How does it track their movements?
- There it goes.

643
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,620
Aren't there any Korean songs?

644
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,890
(The shaggy dog keeps failing.)

645
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,450
He's so bad at this.
You can do this, right?

646
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,220
Just repeat. It's the same moves.

647
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,870
(Team Girl's 1st change of players)

648
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,930
(Here comes Song Jeoktoma.)

649
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,430
Ji Hyo came out! Song Jeoktoma!

650
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,260
(Good)

651
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,260
That's great.

652
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,840
Here comes Song Jeoktoma!

653
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,270
Oh, wow. Ji Hyo is doing well.

654
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,000
Move powerfully.

655
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,420
(The shaggy dog is dancing
as he wants now.)

656
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,850
Ji Hyo, you're doing great!

657
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,710
- What is Suk Jin dancing?
- I know, right? What is he doing?

658
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,550
What is... What is that move?

659
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,160
(To the right, to the left)

660
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,330
What is he doing?

661
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,330
(He turned it into an old dance
in the end.)

662
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,130
- The balladeer is excited.
- Go, balladeer!

663
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,560
The excited balladeer.

664
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,100
My gosh. What dance move is that?

665
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,460
The ballad singer is excited!

666
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,230
(Shouting)

667
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,610
- What is he doing?
- He's just an excited old man.

668
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,000
What's going on?

669
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,300
(The balladeer became very excited.)

670
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,810
Yoo Yaho!

671
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,540
Am I doing it right?

672
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,950
(But he ran out of energy quickly.)

673
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,160
- There's a lot of purple ones.
- Don't press the button.

674
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,520
(She starts dancing abruptly.)

675
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,700
(As his daughter-in-law
is dancing excitedly...)

676
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,330
Why does he keep moving
in the opposite direction?

677
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,370
He keeps moving
in the opposite direction.

678
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,170
What are you doing now?

679
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,100
- You should face forward.
- Face forward.

680
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,730
- So Min, face forward.
- They're excited.

681
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,880
- So Min, look at the screen.
- Face forward.

682
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,200
You're not there
to show off your dance skills!

683
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,210
- Hey!
- Move aside. Move!

684
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,950
- A daughter-in-law...
- A daughter-in-law?

685
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,210
(Despite her help,
Suk Jin runs out of energy again.)

686
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,920
- And a father-in-law.
- The balladeer is doing well!

687
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,630
(Game over)

688
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,020
The balladeer...

689
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,370
- You see...
- I'm out of breath.

690
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,200
- It feels like a national holiday.
- I mean...

691
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,170
(It was neck and neck at the end.
How will the results turn out?)

692
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,170
(1st, Team Girl, 2nd, Team Suk Jin)

693
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,460
- What?
- The orange player won.

694
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,910
(Team Girl won.)

695
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Really?

696
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,200
(He danced for his life but lost.)

697
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,880
Suk Jin, you kept moving
in the opposite direction.

698
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,150
- Did I?
- You couldn't dance precisely.

699
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,090
- You went up when they went down.
- Why didn't you look...

700
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,620
- at the screen?
- What's funny is...

701
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,690
- It wasn't like that.
- that they won by a small margin.

702
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,890
It's because I couldn't tell...

703
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,930
It was nice to see you dancing
with your daughter-in-law...

704
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,990
- after a long time.
- Exactly.

705
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,600
She kept blocking my view.

706
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,720
By the way,
Ji Hyo turned out to be the ace.

707
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,200
She's the ace of our team.

708
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
She's a dancing machine.

709
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,440
Let's begin the second round.
Team Suk Jin versus Team Boy.

710
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Okay.

711
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,960
You should boost your energy.
Suk Jin, boost your energy.

712
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,000
- Boost your energy.
- Okay.

713
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,180
- Is Suk Jin going to play again?
- Get ready. Get your energy up.

714
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,970
- Start the game right now.
- That's great.

715
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,270
Excuse me, Director,
let the other two teams play first.

716
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,810
Left and right are reversed.

717
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,310
How do I do this?

718
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,210
(His vision is becoming blurry.
He keeps seeing the grim reaper.)

719
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,590
- The balladeer versus the producer!
- "The producer?"

720
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,900
- Yoo Yaho versus the balladeer.
- Yes.

721
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,020
You can do it!

722
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,250
- I don't think I can do this.
- Go for it!

723
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,900
- Go for it!
- You can do this!

724
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,960
(Suk Jin, Jae Suk)

725
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,400
What is this?

726
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,760
- Get on your horse.
- What's this?

727
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,970
- What's this?
- This character is you.

728
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,150
- Like this?
- This one.

729
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,740
- What's this? My goodness.
- Oh, my.

730
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,080
(The racing horses start running!)

731
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,450
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

732
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,620
My gosh.

733
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,890
Try to dance on beat.

734
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,520
They're both doing well.

735
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,590
Up!

736
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,630
They're doing well.

737
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,930
You're doing great!

738
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,990
This is fun. This is fun.

739
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,400
- They're doing well.
- This is fun. This is fun.

740
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,440
(Knee kick)

741
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,460
Now to the other side.

742
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,080
(It somehow makes you want to
dance along.)

743
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,500
You're doing great!

744
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,690
- What's that?
- You should jump over him.

745
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,210
Jump over him. Jump.

746
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,810
(Suk Jin crashes into Jae Suk.)

747
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,360
- You're up.
- Here you go.

748
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,020
- Are we allowed to change players?
- Yes, let's switch.

749
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,020
What's going on?

750
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,330
Jump.

751
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,200
(He crashes into Jong Kook as well.)

752
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,340
Gosh.

753
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,440
(The old horse can't even get
1 leg over him.)

754
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,230
Why can't he jump over anyone?

755
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,440
Hop on!

756
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,800
(A piggyback ride)

757
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,770
- Move on to the next move.
- Come down.

758
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,350
This is so funny.

759
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,590
(Panting)

760
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,420
(Suk Jin is in critical condition
and can't even see clearly.)

761
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,860
A match between the boys and girls
would've been fun.

762
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
Run!

763
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,430
- That's good! Keep running.
- Jong Kook is enjoying this.

764
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,430
(Unlike the energetic owner,)

765
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,430
Okay!

766
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,100
Great!

767
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,840
- Run!
- Keep going!

768
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,960
(the shaggy dog follows
far behind him.)

769
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,230
Okay, let's go!

770
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,770
(The owner and the dog
run toward the climax.)

771
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,800
Oh, okay.

772
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,140
(The owner and the dog
run toward the climax.)

773
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
What? What's going on?

774
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,710
Run!

775
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,510
(The final spurt)

776
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,780
(Please... No more.)

777
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,620
Nice. That's good.

778
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,050
Superstar!

779
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,280
Superstar!

780
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,700
- Superstar!
- That was great!

781
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,630
Bravo!

782
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,370
- Bravo!
- That was great!

783
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,640
- Se Chan, help me lift him up.
- Oh, my.

784
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,370
- It's good exercise.
- Se Chan, help me lift him up.

785
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,140
- We... Is it us?
- Hey.

786
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,410
- Are you okay?
- It's good exercise.

787
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,300
- Are you all right?
- Great.

788
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,680
- We won.
- We made it to the final?

789
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,850
- Okay!
- We won? I see.

790
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,180
Even his character on the screen
seemed tired too.

791
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,450
- Who won?
- We'll compete with Team Girl now.

792
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,950
- You see, this is...
- Young Ji.

793
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,950
(The final match begins right away!
Team Boy versus Team Girl)

794
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,980
Nice!

795
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,590
(Perfectly synchronized)

796
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,690
(Thanks to the former idol singer
Young Ji's great performance...)

797
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,900
We won.

798
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,200
Team Girl won.

799
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,220
(Team Girl won.)

800
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,630
- We won. We won.
- Great job!

801
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,030
- It was neck and neck.
- It was.

802
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,910
- You did a great job.
- Toward the end...

803
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,840
- Young Ji did so well.
- Right.

804
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,000
- She sure was an idol singer.
- As a result,

805
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,450
Team Girl that won 2 rounds
wins 1st place.

806
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,610
(Team Girl is in 1st place.)

807
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,880
Team Boy is in second place.

808
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,510
Oh, gosh. We lost.

809
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,310
Team Suk Jin is in third place.

810
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,450
- You see...
- Suk Jin, are you okay?

811
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,360
- It was hard enough for me...
- Are you okay?

812
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,710
to dance to the entire song.

813
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,160
But I had to play two rounds
without a break.

814
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
(He miraculously came back to life
after the intense match.)

815
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,830
Those on the winning team get
3 times as much as the fund.

816
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,170
- We got 150 dollars.
- The 2nd place gets double.

817
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,490
And the third place gets
the same amount.

818
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,200
Now, it's time to vote.

819
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,760
The 1-person team gets 4 votes.

820
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,060
The members of the other 2 teams
get 1 vote each.

821
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,530
You can vote for Mr. Unpleasant.

822
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,000
Everyone did well though.

823
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,800
Don't say that while looking at me.

824
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,310
Everyone is looking at me.

825
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:16,240
You showed off your dance skills
instead of playing the game.

826
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,890
- You were supposed to focus...
- I mean, she was...

827
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,310
- on the game. But you were like...
- Exactly.

828
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,810
- She got so excited.
- She showed off her dance skills.

829
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:27,050
And how she bit her lower lip was
extremely unpleasant.

830
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,600
- That's funny.
- I mean...

831
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,330
I hated how she bit her lower lip
while dancing.

832
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,730
Since I have 4 votes,
I'll give 1 person all my votes.

833
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,760
Okay.

834
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,230
No, I'll vote for two people.

835
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,200
Good. I wrote Suk Jin's name.

836
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,000
- Really?
- He's so unpleasant.

837
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,800
He was sitting next to me.

838
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,150
- Oh, okay.
- And it was very unpleasant.

839
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,510
- I'll cast all four votes for you.
- Okay.

840
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,770
Suk Jin's pale legs annoy me too.

841
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,620
- They're so unpleasant.
- They look so pale.

842
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,710
His sneakers annoy me as well.

843
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,420
Right? That pink color is too much.

844
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,130
Maybe I should go tanning.

845
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,750
Yes, I think you should.

846
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,790
- Okay.
- Turn it on...

847
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,370
and place the car in the center.

848
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,020
It may choose a line right away.

849
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,260
- Okay.
- It's random.

850
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,460
- All right.
- Right in the center?

851
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,840
Why are you putting it
toward my name?

852
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,730
It may move right away.
We can't predict it.

853
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,040
(The car moves
toward Haha and Young Ji!)

854
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,310
(Which of them will go solo?)

855
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,690
- Oh, my. It's Young Ji.
- It's Young Ji.

856
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,450
- Okay.
- It's Young Ji.

857
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,160
Then Young Ji is
on the one-person team this time.

858
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,450
I have a feeling
that she'll do well by herself.

859
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,890
- I think she'll do well.
- Exactly.

860
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,220
- Especially today.
- She's on her own.

861
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,130
- Young Ji, divide us into teams.
- Okay. I'll do that.

862
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,600
Then...

863
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,200
(Glancing)

864
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,530
- My hair...
- Suk Jin, she's looking at you.

865
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,060
What? Why?

866
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,940
I have blue hair on my head
from the wig.

867
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,200
It'd be funny if Suk Jin joined
that team alone, Young Ji.

868
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,910
- Considering his hormone levels...
- Please join this team.

869
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,910
- What?
- Please come.

870
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,920
- That team?
- Yes.

871
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,780
- That's great.
- I'm sure it's not just me.

872
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,890
- I'm sure of it.
- Are you serious?

873
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,980
- It will be interesting.
- They're all avoiding eye contact.

874
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,980
(The girls avoid making eye contact
as Suk Jin walks toward them.)

875
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,830
- Suk Jin...
- You're perfect for the team.

876
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,790
You're the most feminine of all
on that team.

877
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,830
- You're the cutest one.
- Right.

878
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,430
If you look only at his legs...

879
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,060
- He's perfect for the team.
- Well...

880
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,200
Since Se Chan and Haha seem to have
good chemistry...

881
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,530
Right. Separate them.

882
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,260
Se Chan and Chae Young,
switch teams.

883
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,840
- Chae Young.
- Really?

884
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,140
Now, we'll go and have lunch.

885
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,000
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

886
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,450
- Oh, wow. It's very spacious.
- It smells like a new car.

887
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,080
It's good to be in the same car
as you guys.

888
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,770
The four of us have never been
on the same team, right?

889
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,710
- Oh, that's true.
- I think this is the first time.

890
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,510
- Right? I'm happy to be with you.
- I think so.

891
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,620
But honestly,
I really like this combination...

892
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,360
- as we're in different age groups.
- True.

893
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,790
Let's see how it turns out today.
If it works out well,

894
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,170
- we can team up again later.
- That wouldn't be so bad.

895
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,460
- But today,
- I like the idea.

896
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,030
Suk Jin is not as energetic
as usual.

897
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,030
He's refraining
from speaking loudly.

898
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,610
We would have a chance
if he can act like always.

899
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:54,180
- It's a shame. We teamed up...
- Hey, stop.

900
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,770
See? You should sound hoarse.

901
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,800
(Shouting)

902
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,240
You should sound hoarse like this.
Try it.

903
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,710
But we're inside the car right now.

904
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,240
- See?
- Right?

905
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,690
Who would speak so loudly in a car?

906
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,450
- My gosh.
- That's ridiculous.

907
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,690
Is it because of "How Do You Play?"

908
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,750
I'm disappointed.

909
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,090
We've been working together
for over ten years.

910
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,330
What are we to you, Suk Jin?

911
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,700
You didn't make this much effort
for our theme song "I Like You."

912
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,830
- I was so upset...
- That's different.

913
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,700
when I found out
that Suk Jin commented...

914
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,900
on the other members' posts
so often on social media.

915
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,030
- Whose posts?
- Like Wonstein and Lee Dong Hwi.

916
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,200
Has he ever commented
on our social media posts?

917
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,260
- Never.
- Right?

918
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,060
- Do you like Wonstein that much?
- It's not like that.

919
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,440
Let me explain.
They commented on my posts.

920
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,450
- I commented on your posts too.
- They commented so many times.

921
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,410
So I thought I should do the same
in return.

922
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,710
I think
Suk Jin is embarrassed by us.

923
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,920
- You're embarrassed by us, right?
- No, I'm proud of you guys.

924
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,210
He's practically whispering.
Your voice makes me feel sleepy...

925
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,130
- because you speak in whispers.
- You don't speak loudly in a car.

926
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,360
Gosh. I can't believe her.

927
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,750
Whenever you speak, I feel sleepy.

928
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,600
There are times
when you should speak loudly.

929
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,730
(It's hard to stay awake
because of his whispers.)

930
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:54,960
- I can't stay awake.
- Oh, Suk Jin.

931
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,230
- Hey, wake up.
- Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

932
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,230
- Hey, wake up!
- That's good, Suk Jin.

933
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,800
- I'm sorry.
- Wake up!

934
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,700
I'm sorry.
Please speak a bit louder.

935
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,580
All right. Okay. I'll do that.

936
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,610
- That's more like it.
- Okay. Let's go!

937
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,620
Let's cheer up!

938
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,310
Suk Jin, drink a lot of water.

939
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,150
"Hyeonchon?" What is this place?

940
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,310
Are we at Namhansanseong?

941
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,020
- I can't hear him.
- Right?

942
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,520
- Me neither.
- Suk Jin.

943
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,720
- We can't hear you.
- Can you speak a little louder?

944
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,930
We really can't hear you.

945
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,050
Suk Jin, we can't hear you.

946
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,560
Why do you keep on mumbling?

947
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,060
- We can't hear you.
- We can't.

948
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,940
There's a certain volume
the show airs at.

949
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,170
A certain volume?

950
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,340
When it's edited,
my voice will sound louder.

951
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,870
The scheduling team?

952
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,940
I can't hear you.

953
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,410
The scheduling team
turns up your audio?

954
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,270
I really can't hear you.

955
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,950
- A little louder.
- Can you speak up?

956
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,380
- A little louder.
- Okay, we've done enough.

957
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,270
We have all we need for today.
1, 2, 3.

958
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,810
- Good.
- 1, 2, 3.

959
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,090
We're back.

960
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,390
The camera's rolling again.

961
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,620
Suk Jin...

962
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,450
Stop it already. They don't use
much of this footage anyway.

963
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,550
1, 2, 3.

964
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,890
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

965
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:52,980
Nice.

966
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,860
We won't know what they'll use,
so we have to keep filming.

967
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,060
Why are you speaking so loudly?

968
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,670
On the other side...

969
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,260
(Young Ji, who's alone,
is filming a vlog.)

970
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,560
They seem happy.

971
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,260
(They seem happy.)

972
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,610
Meanwhile, I'm all alone.

973
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,230
(I'm all alone.)

974
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,150
My situation is different...

975
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,810
from Suk Jin's earlier on.

976
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,510
He had to battle loneliness...

977
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,620
in a sad way,

978
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,890
but for me,

979
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,360
it's like...

980
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,120
(Young Ji's Vlog)

981
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,630
It's like I'm getting
the VVIP treatment.

982
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,750
(The VVIP treatment)

983
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,600
(However,)

984
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,430
(no one's around to hear her.)

985
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,700
The head manager at my agency...

986
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,640
told me to stick close
to Suk Jin today...

987
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,840
because he's been trending lately.

988
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,140
(But it's been hard to hear
the trending balladeer's voice.)

989
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,500
I haven't been near Suk Jin today.

990
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:47,740
(She tries to film
enough scenes for herself.)

991
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,420
You can rest, you know.

992
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,280
There's nothing for me to do.

993
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,980
(While Young Ji films
a sad vlog entry...)

994
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,960
Chae Young used to figure skate
in the US.

995
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,060
- Right.
- Figure skating?

996
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,140
- Didn't you know?
- Gosh, no.

997
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,170
- She used to live abroad.
- When I was really young.

998
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,910
Just so you know, Chae Young...

999
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,460
was a figure skating prodigy.

1000
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,440
- Really?
- That's not true.

1001
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,110
But judging by her dancing earlier,

1002
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,270
it didn't seem that way.

1003
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,380
- Figure skating?
- Really?

1004
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,350
I guess you can say
there's a difference.

1005
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,620
Good dancers
usually have good lines.

1006
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,310
I have good lines too.

1007
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,780
You were stiff though.

1008
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,630
You have good lines
when you stand still.

1009
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,220
- When you move, though...
- Really?

1010
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,250
I have good stamina though.

1011
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,720
(She cuts in with another brag.)

1012
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,790
How she speaks is addictive though.

1013
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,030
- It's addictive, isn't it?
- Yes.

1014
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:46,760
It's been a while
since I woke up this early,

1015
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,840
so I'm tired.

1016
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,650
(There's no way
to predict her comments.)

1017
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,850
Chae Young,

1018
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,920
I thought you were going to say
something important.

1019
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,080
I thought something was up.

1020
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,150
- I thought something was wrong.
- You're tired?

1021
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,210
- But you're just tired.
- Unbelievable.

1022
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,780
I mean...

1023
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,210
Her way of talking
is so addictive...

1024
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,950
that I might suffer from withdrawal.

1025
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,330
- Aren't I adorable?
- Right.

1026
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,290
You know,

1027
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,060
you're not at all how you seem.

1028
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,390
- You seem cold and chic.
- Exactly.

1029
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,430
And one would think
you'd be smug in a way.

1030
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,910
Well,

1031
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,660
when I was young,

1032
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:24,370
I liked being called
chic and sophisticated,

1033
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,870
- but now...
- Not anymore.

1034
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:28,270
- I like to be called cute.
- I see.

1035
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,310
Okay, noted.

1036
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,710
- Duly noted.
- Got it.

1037
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,910
You're funny too.

1038
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,710
- You're adorable.
- You're cute.

1039
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,210
Don't say it all at once.

1040
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,660
Throw it in from time to time.

1041
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,390
You have cute nails.

1042
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,930
- Look at that.
- I've been thinking this,

1043
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,330
but her ribbon is cute too.

1044
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,060
I mean it.

1045
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,770
Just so you know...

1046
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,960
- Can I call you Jong Kook?
- Call me whatever you want.

1047
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,430
Behind me...

1048
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,160
- You didn't know it was him?
- No.

1049
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,270
Really?

1050
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,310
- Who then?
- Who did you think I was?

1051
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,180
I don't pay attention
to my surroundings.

1052
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,250
- You're adorable.
- You are.

1053
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,870
- Chae Young, how cute of you.
- You're adorable.

1054
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,750
- I really didn't know.
- You're adorable.

1055
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,950
How cute of you.

1056
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,140
Who did you think was talking then?

1057
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,250
- She didn't know but...
- I knew someone was there, but...

1058
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,350
Shall we get out then?

1059
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,350
I really had no idea.

1060
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,580
How adorable of you.

1061
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,020
- How cute.
- It was a long drive.

1062
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,290
Namhansanseong is known
for its creek.

1063
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,160
Gosh, I haven't been here
in a while.

1064
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,370
We're at the creek.

1065
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,500
It's been a while
since I was at a creek.

1066
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,200
Eating samgyetang here is the best.

1067
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,410
Watermelons cool down
if you put them in the water.

1068
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,770
To be honest,
I don't like being at the creek.

1069
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:28,830
There are too many mosquitoes.

1070
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,370
Yes, there are a lot here.

1071
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,000
You're always so fussy!

1072
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,140
- I'm also...
- You don't like it here either?

1073
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,620
I tend to go inside.

1074
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,140
Then why not just stay home?

1075
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,460
It's why Yong Man,
Suk Jin, and I...

1076
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,850
- have fun together.
- I see.

1077
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,480
- No wonder.
- We're always on the same page.

1078
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,160
- Anyway, Young Ji is here.
- She's here.

1079
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,290
- She runs in a cute way.
- Grab your bangs...

1080
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,660
as you run!

1081
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,600
What took you so long?

1082
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,770
This is nice.

1083
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:55,660
I've missed greenery like this.

1084
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,040
- This place...
- And the sound of nature.

1085
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,540
Our audio director...

1086
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,830
is having a hard time
recording our voices.

1087
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,480
Water, hush!

1088
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,640
(What?)

1089
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,210
- Is that possible?
- Are you trying to rule nature too?

1090
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,210
What?

1091
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,710
He's trying to rule nature too.

1092
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,750
- Are you a deity?
- He's trying to rule nature too.

1093
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,080
But the audio director...

1094
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,710
- I think we need the sun.
- He's having a hard time.

1095
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:15,910
Can you tell the sun to rise higher?

1096
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,350
Up with the sun!

1097
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,520
Up with the sun!

1098
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,930
- Up with the sun?
- Water, be quiet!

1099
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,500
Okay, go.

1100
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,370
(Sliding in)

1101
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,330
Move over. It's wet over there.

1102
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,430
(The balladeer who saves his voice
gets pushed to the side.)

1103
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,560
You're so unpleasant.

1104
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,460
- Suk Jin...
- Unbelievable.

1105
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,100
Can you please wear some underpants?

1106
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,330
Can you see inside?

1107
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,210
Who wears underpants?

1108
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,770
I can see your underwear.

1109
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,450
Beef up your thigh muscles
or wear tighter shorts.

1110
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,520
- Suk Jin, you look...
- Do one or the other.

1111
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,680
How long should my underpants be?

1112
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,350
- Should they stick out?
- Goodness.

1113
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,080
Your shorts are too loose.

1114
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,430
It's an unpleasant sight!

1115
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,560
You're disgusting us.

1116
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,350
Then don't look!

1117
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,350
Let us vote.
Let's vote for Mr. Unpleasant.

1118
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,160
It's an unpleasant sight!

1119
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,790
Shouldn't we give him a blanket?

1120
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,390
- What is the meaning of this?
- Gosh.

1121
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,210
Unbelievable.

1122
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,100
In this next game,
you will be oversharing...

1123
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,040
while surrounded by
this scenic view.

1124
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,850
It's Majority Rules Truth or Dare.

1125
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,710
- Majority Rules Truth or Dare.
- Truth or Dare?

1126
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,620
All members will participate.

1127
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,620
When given a question
with two options for an answer,

1128
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,850
you will choose one simultaneously.

1129
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,120
You will win a point if your answer
is the majority opinion.

1130
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,830
- Majority rules.
- I know how the game works.

1131
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,750
Points will be added for each team.

1132
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,500
So the staff will be
asking the questions?

1133
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,230
Yes, about things
that seem like oversharing.

1134
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,960
However,

1135
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,060
if all players
choose the same answer,

1136
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,770
Young Ji from the one-man team
will win ten points.

1137
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,370
- So that should be avoided.
- A unanimous answer?

1138
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,770
That's a sweet deal for you.

1139
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,310
- It won't happen easily.
- That's why...

1140
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,080
some things are better
when you're alone...

1141
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,120
and some are better
when you're on a team.

1142
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,350
- Just answer honestly.
- Got it.

1143
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,950
Beware of oversharing.

1144
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,480
"When I shower,"

1145
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,730
"I scrub the bottoms of my feet
with soap every time."

1146
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,250
- Every time?
- "I scrub them every time."

1147
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,520
Is it number one for yes?

1148
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,000
- Is it number one for yes?
- One for yes...

1149
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,520
and two for no.

1150
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,060
1, 2, 3.

1151
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,500
- Of course I scrub my feet.
- Me too.

1152
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,600
Yes for me.

1153
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,330
(Do you scrub the bottoms
of your feet with soap every time?)

1154
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:17,680
(3 people picked number 1,
6 people picked number 2.)

1155
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:18,810
Yes for me.

1156
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,350
Those who chose no
will receive a point.

1157
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,040
- Nice!
- Okay!

1158
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,310
"No" is the majority?

1159
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,620
- Seriously?
- You don't scrub your feet?

1160
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,750
Not every time.

1161
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,460
- No?
- Don't you usually...

1162
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,520
let your feet do the work?

1163
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,560
- Like this.
- Of course not.

1164
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,160
Soapy water travels down
to your feet,

1165
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,390
so you rub them on the floor.

1166
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,560
What?

1167
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,700
I do.

1168
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,700
- Haha,
- I do.

1169
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,660
- you should rub your feet like so.
- That's what I do.

1170
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,770
And then you let them dry.

1171
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:41,060
- What if you trip?
- Chae Young, don't you do it?

1172
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,230
Not every time.

1173
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,640
Washing your skin too often...

1174
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,040
can make it dry.

1175
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,310
(Washing your skin too often
can make it dry.)

1176
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,310
- Right?
- How adorable!

1177
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,500
- That's adorable.
- I get it.

1178
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,770
- That was a cute way to put it.
- How adorable.

1179
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,370
So Min...

1180
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,480
- How do you shower?
- In my case,

1181
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,710
I wash my body like this.

1182
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,620
I'd rather not see this.

1183
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,140
And then I scrub my feet.

1184
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,910
Do you use the loofah
on your feet too?

1185
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,850
- Yes, I then let it dry.
- But then...

1186
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,580
- Really?
- You could do that.

1187
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,850
I see you usually use a shower ball.

1188
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,560
I go for the longer type.

1189
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,600
(He prefers a loofah that's long.)

1190
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,020
Old man Yu!

1191
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,160
Then travel down with it.

1192
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,430
Don't you do this too?

1193
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,100
(Front and back)

1194
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,160
Hey!

1195
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,600
- Are you insane?
- That was unpleasant!

1196
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,040
- This is unpleasant.
- You'll burn your skin.

1197
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,330
That's something I don't do.

1198
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,600
- That will hurt.
- It'll definitely hurt.

1199
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,350
This is oversharing,

1200
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,040
but do you hit your face
when you wash it?

1201
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,450
- I do.
- I don't do that.

1202
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,290
- I do.
- In my case...

1203
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,250
- One should hit the face.
- I do.

1204
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,960
- Like this.
- Jae Suk,

1205
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,730
- do you make noises when you wash?
- How?

1206
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,620
Like that.

1207
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,160
I know what he means.

1208
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,750
Some do that.

1209
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,230
- I know what you mean.
- At the sauna...

1210
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,500
- Exactly.
- You're like that, aren't you?

1211
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,790
- Don't you make that noise?
- I don't.

1212
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,100
- Dads do that.
- I wash my face quietly.

1213
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,870
I hit my face with water.

1214
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,330
- Splash, splash!
- Splash, splash!

1215
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,580
Like that.

1216
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,270
Old men do that.

1217
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,580
Here's the second question.

1218
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,950
You went to a fortune-teller...

1219
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,640
to ask about your compatibility
with your boyfriend or girlfriend,

1220
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,710
Oh, this question.

1221
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,910
but you were told...

1222
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,910
- that one of you would die.
- Die?

1223
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,750
Hold up one if you would break up...

1224
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:13,430
and hold up two if you won't.

1225
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,460
- Two for not breaking up?
- That's right.

1226
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,160
This could be unanimous.

1227
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,200
- We need a strategy.
- It's sad though.

1228
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,870
We have to be smart about this.

1229
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,160
- All right.
- One,

1230
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,060
2, 3.

1231
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,310
(Would you break up...)

1232
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,310
(if a fortune-teller
told you that one would die?)

1233
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,270
(They all choose 2.)

1234
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,850
You all choose number two.

1235
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,310
(1-person team Young Ji
receives 10 points.)

1236
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,140
This is why I wanted
to choose the other option.

1237
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,350
I thought of that too.

1238
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,410
So, Young Ji wins ten points.

1239
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,620
If I'm not in the best of health,

1240
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,850
I may consider breaking up.

1241
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,430
If I know I'm sick, I mean.

1242
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:47,160
I was told that
my wife and I weren't compatible.

1243
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,600
- Your wife?
- Yes.

1244
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,160
That's true from her point of view.

1245
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,890
Seriously?

1246
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,500
- Hey...
- It's true.

1247
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,660
We didn't get along
during the first three months.

1248
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,370
During those first three months,
I was too busy playing Starcraft.

1249
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,580
Do you know how to play Starcraft?

1250
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,640
- Of course.
- Then...

1251
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,930
Exactly, right?

1252
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,250
- You were the worst.
- She says you're the worst.

1253
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,680
Check your compatibility
before getting married.

1254
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:09,980
You never know.

1255
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,120
Suk Jin's wife...

1256
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,580
You shouldn't completely
ignore these things.

1257
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:17,660
All right. "I use the bidet..."

1258
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,960
"in the bathrooms
at the TV station."

1259
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,750
Choose number 1 if you do
and number 2 if you don't.

1260
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,100
I use it sometimes.

1261
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,270
1, 2, 3.

1262
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,790
- You use it?
- I don't.

1263
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,430
- I use it.
- Of course I use it.

1264
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,540
- You don't?
- No.

1265
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,000
(3 people picked number 1,
6 people picked number 2.)

1266
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,330
- I don't use it.
- 6 people who chose number 2...

1267
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,980
- get one point each.
- All right!

1268
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,080
I picked number two.

1269
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,500
Of course I use it. Don't you?

1270
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,770
- No, I don't.
- Why not?

1271
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:43,180
I use the one at home.
I don't think bidets outside...

1272
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,710
- Really?
- are clean.

1273
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,520
- I'm not comfortable using it.
- It's a little uncomfortable.

1274
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,710
It's not pleasant.

1275
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:51,250
It doesn't suit him.
Why does he only use it at home?

1276
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,250
- What? Then what should I do?
- What about you?

1277
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,000
Should I relieve myself on the floor
over a newspaper?

1278
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,250
Should I wash myself with my hand
like this?

1279
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,770
Hey! I use a bidet at home too!

1280
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,960
- You look like you'd use a leaf.
- A leaf?

1281
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,330
We live in the 21st century!

1282
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,270
You look like someone who'd crumple
a newspaper to wipe your butt.

1283
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,910
No way! I use a bidet too.

1284
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,540
Don't you tear off a calendar
to wipe yourself?

1285
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,480
What do you mean?
I use a bidet from Chungho Nais.

1286
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:14,080
- I'm using it nicely!
- Oh, really?

1287
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,250
The ink from the newspaper
might be stained on your butt.

1288
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,080
(They're sharing
too much information.)

1289
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,980
After your first kiss
with your girlfriend or boyfriend...

1290
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,290
- After the first kiss?
- Yes.

1291
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:27,850
You have bragged to your friend
after your first kiss.

1292
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,890
- Choose number one if you have.
- Brag about it?

1293
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,060
- If you have bragged about it...
- Brag about it?

1294
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,230
- Brag about it?
- Why would I brag about it?

1295
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,390
Choose number one if you have,

1296
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,640
(Remembering her first kiss)

1297
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,100
and choose number two
if you never have.

1298
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,430
- You brag about your first kiss?
- Why would I brag about it?

1299
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,830
- Why would I brag about it?
- How about sharing instead?

1300
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,540
Sharing is bragging in a way.

1301
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,180
Talking about it
is considered bragging.

1302
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,910
I mean, my friend would ask me,
"So did you..."

1303
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,040
That means you've bragged about it.

1304
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,450
- I'm sure you have!
- I hesitated to tell.

1305
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,660
- "I mean..."
- Your tone tells that you have.

1306
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,410
- Let's choose it now.
- No, I've never bragged about it.

1307
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,290
- That's what you call bragging.
- I'm sure he has bragged about it.

1308
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,680
- I can tell from his face.
- "You kissed her?"

1309
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,620
- I'm sure you have.
- "It's not that."

1310
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,960
- "Of course."
- You see? He's done it for sure!

1311
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,200
You can't call this bragging!

1312
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,600
- No, that is bragging.
- How is this bragging?

1313
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,890
- You put on airs.
- I only answered his question.

1314
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,100
1, 2, 3.

1315
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,960
- More people will choose number 2.
- No, they'll choose number 1.

1316
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,540
(Which one is the majority opinion?)

1317
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:17,810
5 people chose number 1.

1318
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:19,370
- 4 people chose number 2.
- All right!

1319
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,910
I picked number 2 on purpose.

1320
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,540
I've never bragged,
but I chose number 1 to win points.

1321
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,580
- You've never bragged about it?
- No, never.

1322
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,310
I kept it quiet.

1323
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,230
- It's different from what we know.
- It's more like sharing.

1324
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,100
According to what Park Hyung Man
from Washington DC reported,

1325
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,730
you bragged about the kiss you had
under the overpass in Suyu-ri.

1326
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,460
I know! He has bragged about it!

1327
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,460
(Got you!)

1328
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,700
- You've bragged about it!
- He remembers it.

1329
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,770
(Did I do that?)

1330
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,270
(Episode 508,
viewers' reports about the members)

1331
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,580
(Jae Suk's friend Hyung Man
who lives in Washington DC...)

1332
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,980
(made a report.)

1333
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,040
- This one is true!
- "The story I'll share with you..."

1334
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,310
(A scoop from the States)

1335
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:59,520
(This story is about
where Jae Suk had his first kiss.)

1336
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,350
("I remember how he told us
at the school store the next day.")

1337
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:06,660
(He bragged about it
at the school store the next day.)

1338
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,960
You love bragging.
Why can't you be honest?

1339
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,520
- Listen.
- An overpass? That's so funny.

1340
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,930
If social media existed back then,
he'd have bragged all over it.

1341
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:15,100
- Hey.
- Under an overpass?

1342
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,830
I told Hyung Man
because he was my close friend.

1343
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,330
I didn't brag about it.

1344
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:22,040
The fact that you shared it
is bragging.

1345
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,430
It must be convenient
for you to kiss...

1346
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,750
since you don't have to
lean forward that much.

1347
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,080
Right, he just needs to
brush past her.

1348
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,270
- Even if you move slightly...
- He can only brush past her.

1349
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,620
- I know.
- It must be really convenient.

1350
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,020
- You can kiss faster than others.
- The same goes for you, right?

1351
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,310
I know what it's like. I get him.

1352
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,960
You can kiss faster than others.

1353
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,020
All right. Here's the next question.

1354
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:38,830
You've lied to your boyfriend
or girlfriend...

1355
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:42,460
that you're sleeping...

1356
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,370
but went outside to hang out
in secret.

1357
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:45,370
I know this one!

1358
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:47,660
But you have to be really honest.

1359
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,500
- I'll be really honest.
- You can't lie for points.

1360
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,330
- Don't lie about it.
- I'll be honest.

1361
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:55,040
I'm sorry, but what if I went
to the gym instead of hanging out?

1362
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,080
- That's considered the same.
- That's the same thing.

1363
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,310
- That's considered hanging out.
- That's considered hanging out.

1364
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,000
- That's considered hanging out.
- You have to be honest, So Min.

1365
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,450
- Honestly, if you say you haven't,
- I'm sure everyone has done it.

1366
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,210
you're lying to yourself.

1367
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:04,850
I don't do that
because I get caught anyway.

1368
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:06,750
- Right, I don't do it either.
- I don't lie at all.

1369
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,750
But I've never lied
that I was sleeping.

1370
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,060
I told her
that I was working though.

1371
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,020
- I've never lied...
- We won't get a unanimous answer.

1372
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,460
1, 2, 3.

1373
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,160
I think I have.

1374
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,100
- I chose number 1.
- More people chose number 2.

1375
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,370
Young Ji, Se Chan, and Suk Jin
chose number one.

1376
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:20,890
- Yes!
- I was being really honest.

1377
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,270
- More people chose number one?
- This...

1378
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:25,100
- I can't play this.
- This doesn't make any sense.

1379
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:27,270
You hypocrites.

1380
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:29,580
I'm not the type to
go through the trouble of lying...

1381
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,750
- just to hang out.
- Me neither.

1382
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,040
- You know me, right?
- I think you have.

1383
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,450
You've never done it before,
Jong Kook?

1384
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:36,810
- I tell her that I'm working.
- That's considered the same.

1385
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,290
- But I've never said I'm sleeping.
- Chae Young, you've never done it?

1386
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,810
- No, never.
- Really?

1387
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,060
(Stern)

1388
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,290
I'm sorry.

1389
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,750
I've never done it before.

1390
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,460
- He apologized right away.
- I don't lie...

1391
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,960
- because it shows.
- Me too. It shows.

1392
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,500
- Right?
- It's risky to lie.

1393
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,700
Have you done it before, Young Ji?

1394
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,390
- Yes, I have.
- Where did you go?

1395
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,140
My boyfriend didn't let me
go and hang out.

1396
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,730
- So?
- So I told him I'm exhausted,

1397
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:01,180
- And?
- and I went bowling.

1398
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:02,870
- But this is...
- That's wholesome.

1399
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:05,270
If they scold you
for every little thing,

1400
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:06,580
- you can't help but lie.
- That's wholesome.

1401
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,750
- That's right.
- So you shouldn't be controlling.

1402
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,910
- That's right.
- Right.

1403
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:11,210
What about you, Ji Hyo?

1404
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,080
I've never done it before.
I actually sleep.

1405
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,980
- Of course.
- She sleeps for real.

1406
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,660
- You're so honest.
- She actually sleeps.

1407
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,830
- Right, she does.
- That was funny.

1408
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:22,290
- She really falls asleep.
- She actually sleeps.

1409
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:25,000
I lied that I was sleeping
three times,

1410
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,700
and I lied that I was sick once.

1411
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:31,310
I get caught if I keep lying
that I'm sleeping.

1412
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:33,370
There are days when men
hang out by themselves.

1413
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:34,830
You need to start acting...

1414
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,680
- that morning.
- That's right.

1415
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,680
- "Gosh, today..."
- You start acting in the morning.

1416
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,210
- "I..."
- "I'm not feeling well."

1417
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:41,680
But your girlfriends know.

1418
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,640
- They pretend to fall for it.
- I've never lied to go outside.

1419
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,680
But if you're going to lie
that you're sick,

1420
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,350
you need to start acting
two days in advance.

1421
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:47,350
What's that?

1422
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,960
(He needs to act
two days in advance.)

1423
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,180
- I do that too.
- I can totally relate to it.

1424
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,060
- You're so mean.
- I'm sure all men can relate to it.

1425
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,660
You need to act in advance.

1426
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,160
If you say that you're sick
on the day of, they get suspicious.

1427
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,500
- You need to act like you're tired.
- You need to act in advance.

1428
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,700
You need to act sick.

1429
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,700
"Gosh, my ears are..."

1430
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,270
Did your ears hurt?

1431
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:07,980
- That's right.
- That's so right.

1432
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,730
I hate it.

1433
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,480
"My ears keep getting inflamed."

1434
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,580
(He needs to sound
as serious as possible.)

1435
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:15,770
We did that a long time ago
when we were still young.

1436
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,620
- Here's the next question.
- Okay.

1437
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,710
Before you fall asleep,

1438
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,980
right before you fall asleep,

1439
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,210
your girlfriend or boyfriend
texts you.

1440
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,230
Choose number one
if you read the text.

1441
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,620
If you don't,
then choose number two.

1442
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,730
How many texts did she send?

1443
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,160
1, 2, or 3?

1444
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:34,700
If it's just one,
you can read it in the notification.

1445
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:36,100
This one's easy.

1446
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,730
1, 2, 3.

1447
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,140
- Why wouldn't you read it?
- Of course you shouldn't.

1448
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,660
- That's...
- 1, 2, 3.

1449
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,230
(Number 1, you read the text,
number 2, you don't read the text)

1450
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:44,370
- Why wouldn't you read it?
- I wouldn't read it either.

1451
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:46,370
Young Ji and Suk Jin
chose number one.

1452
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:49,140
This must be why
I never got replies.

1453
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,290
Don't be upset, Young Ji.

1454
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:52,350
- But...
- Calm down.

1455
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:54,710
I didn't ask for much, did I?

1456
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,430
I only said I couldn't fall asleep.

1457
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,390
"I can't fall asleep, sweetie."
That's all I said,

1458
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:04,790
- and he doesn't reply?
- Good one, Young Ji.

1459
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,660
I've never gotten any replies.

1460
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,930
This is why you shouldn't read it.

1461
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:11,040
If you reply to that,
you have to keep exchanging texts.

1462
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,460
That'd make her upset.

1463
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,270
- "Why do you want to hang up?"
- That's right.

1464
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:16,710
You might end up fighting.
It's better to not read it.

1465
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:19,680
It's better to call in the morning
and say you fell asleep.

1466
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,210
Even if you read the text
in the morning, you can go,

1467
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:25,540
"I'm not feeling well."

1468
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:27,850
Jae Suk.

1469
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,350
That's so annoying of you.

1470
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,930
Jae Suk always acts like he's sick.

1471
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,960
Remember how he talked about
getting an IV?

1472
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,600
He always acts like he's sick.

1473
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,660
He's an expert in playing a patient.

1474
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,000
It'd be perfect if her house
is around here.

1475
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,060
I'm a fan.
I wish I had a boyfriend like him.

1476
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,560
Chae Young doesn't check
the text either?

1477
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:46,600
It's not only applicable
to my boyfriend.

1478
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,980
I just can't be reached after 9 p.m.

1479
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,080
- Oh, is that so?
- She's very strict.

1480
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,500
Oh, so she can't be reached.

1481
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,080
- That's why...
- How cute.

1482
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,140
What?

1483
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,350
Isn't it so cute
that she can't be reached after 9 p.m.?

1484
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:59,890
So she goes to bed
at a certain time.

1485
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:02,390
It's raining
more than we thought it would.

1486
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:03,390
It's raining a lot.

1487
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:04,730
Let's go inside to have lunch.

1488
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:06,330
- Okay, let's do that.
- Let's go inside.

1489
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,730
(As it starts to pour,
they sit under a tent.)

1490
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,200
It's pouring all of a sudden.

1491
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,290
(There's a smell of grass
and rain in the air.)

1492
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:14,560
- Now...
- Yes.

1493
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,330
We moved because it started to pour.

1494
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,100
- It's nice!
- Yes!

1495
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,410
We're going to have lunch now.

1496
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:23,930
But there are even scores,
so let's do a quick question first.

1497
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:25,310
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

1498
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:26,600
Please hand out the boards.

1499
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,710
- Please ask a sentimental question.
- A sentimental one?

1500
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,270
- Yes.
- The one that suits the weather.

1501
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,750
I think
So Min is going to cry again.

1502
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,390
- Then why don't you...
- Go ahead and cry.

1503
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:34,960
Why don't you give us one, So Min?

1504
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,060
- Me?
- I think So Min is the one...

1505
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,620
going through menopause,
not Suk Jin.

1506
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,350
I'm going through it
faster than I thought.

1507
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:42,700
Is there anything you want to ask?

1508
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,200
- A question?
- Yes.

1509
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,460
"I want to see him now."

1510
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,830
I choose number 1.

1511
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:48,870
Choose number 1
if you have someone you miss,

1512
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:50,060
Choose number two if you don't.

1513
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:54,910
- After taking a shower,
- There's another one?

1514
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:59,080
you clean your shower drain
right away.

1515
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,480
That's a good one.

1516
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,580
- Right away?
- Choose one if you do.

1517
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,810
If you leave it for days,
choose number two.

1518
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:08,890
1, 2, 3.

1519
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:10,160
- Of course it's number 1.
- Of course it's number 1.

1520
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,180
- Number 1.
- Of course it's number 1.

1521
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,460
- You didn't choose number 1?
- Number 2.

1522
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,480
I don't clean it right away.

1523
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,580
Of course it's number two.

1524
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,020
- You didn't choose number one?
- I don't clean it right away.

1525
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,600
- All right.
- I clean it right away.

1526
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,160
Only Ji Hyo and Jae Suk
picked number one.

1527
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,600
- Yes!
- I don't clean it right away.

1528
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,660
You don't clean it right away?

1529
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,700
But you should clean it right away.

1530
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,660
- No, no.
- Otherwise, it doesn't drain well.

1531
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:28,100
You need to wait a few days
until more hair piles up.

1532
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,430
It feels good if you clean up
after your hair piles up.

1533
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:30,640
- When you remove it...
- You know that feeling, right?

1534
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,710
When you do it after a few days.

1535
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:33,250
You feel great if you clean it
after a few days.

1536
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:36,080
If you swirl the hair
out of the drain hole,

1537
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,480
- you know,
- That's the reason I shower.

1538
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,710
you can drag it out like this.

1539
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,290
Wait a minute.

1540
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,290
If you drag out that much,
that means it's a woman's hair.

1541
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,730
(Zipping)

1542
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:45,890
That means it's a woman's hair.

1543
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,830
(He zips his own mouth.)

1544
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,200
You said you like women
with bobbed hair.

1545
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,600
If you drag out that much,
that means it's a woman's hair.

1546
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,330
- You live alone, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

1547
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:57,200
I only need to drag out this much.

1548
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,960
Doesn't everyone clean it
right away?

1549
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,000
But I think my wife cleans it
right away.

1550
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,410
That's why you never do it.

1551
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,770
Actually, I...

1552
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:07,180
So you never clean it, do you?

1553
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,580
You have a nice wife.

1554
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:11,520
My wife is probably happy
that she married me.

1555
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,910
So you don't have to care
about that.

1556
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,160
Don't mind her.

1557
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,790
Okay, you're right about that.

1558
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:18,060
Chae Young, you're married,

1559
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,430
so you must know. Only one of you...

1560
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:20,960
Why are you
speaking to her casually already?

1561
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,930
We've gotten a lot closer.
Right, Chae Young?

1562
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,520
- Did you ask if she's okay with it?
- Wait a minute.

1563
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,770
- Did you ask her?
- How many times...

1564
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:27,060
- have you seen her?
- Chae Young.

1565
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,500
I saw her for the first time today.

1566
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,560
- Chae Young.
- Why are you casual with her?

1567
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,870
You can choose.
Can I speak casually with you?

1568
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,370
(Can I speak casually with you?)

1569
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:35,810
Well...

1570
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:37,500
I hope you won't be too casual
with me.

1571
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,040
(She sternly asks him
to address her formally.)

1572
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,350
- I'd appreciate it if you do that.
- Okay, okay.

1573
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,580
- Good one, Chae Young.
- Well done.

1574
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,410
- He's very uncomfortable.
- If that's what you want...

1575
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:49,080
- She finds it uncomfortable.
- She's drawing a line.

1576
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,160
Okay, I got it.

1577
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,160
I've seen you many times,

1578
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,330
- so it's okay, right?
- Of course.

1579
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:55,930
- I'll speak casually to you.
- When I see you next time...

1580
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:57,520
It's more natural for you
to address her formally.

1581
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,060
Okay. Next time I see her...

1582
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,060
- It's way better.
- And don't speak casually...

1583
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,370
- to Young Ji either.
- Right.

1584
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,060
I've seen her a lot.

1585
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,910
I've seen her
at Jun Ha's restaurant too. Right?

1586
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:08,910
But you didn't pay for us.

1587
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:10,310
(He didn't do anything for her
when he met her.)

1588
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,750
He didn't?

1589
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:12,950
- He's the worst.
- I'm kidding.

1590
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:15,310
- He's the worst.
- But honestly...

1591
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:17,640
- We are way older than her.
- Why didn't you pay for her?

1592
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,580
Young Ji, I only heard
that you were at the next table.

1593
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,460
- Still, you should've paid for her.
- I didn't even see you.

1594
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,580
People usually pay
for the younger ones.

1595
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,250
Then why did you say
you saw her at Jun Ha's restaurant?

1596
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,520
What? I just heard
she's at the next table.

1597
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,160
I pay for my juniors
in every region.

1598
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,750
Good for you, you punk.

1599
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:33,100
What did you call me?

1600
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,370
- Calm down.
- What did you call me?

1601
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:36,430
- He's so pathetic.
- I'm warning you.

1602
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,330
Don't go around
and pay for everyone.

1603
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:39,370
It's 2 on 1.

1604
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:40,870
- I can't hold it anymore.
- Calm down.

1605
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:43,500
- You should calm down.
- You want a piece of me?

1606
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,910
- Calm down.
- You're carrying me so stably.

1607
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,410
- Wow, Jong Kook...
- Jae Suk is finally on his back!

1608
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:50,040
- You're carrying me so stably.
- Jae Suk is finally on his back!

1609
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,080
- Calm down, Jae Suk.
- You're so stable.

1610
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,640
- I was really going to...
- You should stop paying for people.

1611
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,620
I really like Chae Young though.

1612
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,960
- Address her formally!
- It's Ms. Han for you!

1613
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,350
Call her Ms. Han!

1614
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,960
- Ms. Han.
- Don't address her informally!

1615
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:04,660
She's so good
at doing variety shows.

1616
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,600
- He keeps speaking casually.
- Respect.

1617
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,600
- We have the result.
- All right.

1618
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,270
The team in 1st place won 20 points.

1619
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,730
(1st place)

1620
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:13,960
It's Team Green.

1621
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,640
- Yes!
- Yes!

1622
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,430
- All right!
- Really?

1623
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,770
- Good job.
- That's impressive.

1624
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:21,250
The one in second place...

1625
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,450
- won 17 points.
- It must be Young Ji.

1626
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,710
- Or us.
- Could it be me?

1627
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:26,520
- It's Team Red.
- Really?

1628
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,120
Young Ji, why did you get
so many questions wrong?

1629
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,960
Young Ji, you're in 3rd place
with 15 points.

1630
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,790
But Young Ji
got the ten-point question.

1631
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,520
- She earned big points though.
- I guess that wasn't enough.

1632
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,160
- Let's vote right away.
- Oh, right. Mr. Unpleasant.

1633
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,960
- Mr. Unpleasant.
- Yes, Mr. Unpleasant.

1634
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,370
We need to vote for Mr. Unpleasant.

1635
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:40,770
Can't we just raise our hands?

1636
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:42,770
I know who to vote for.

1637
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:44,000
- Thank you, Jae Suk.
- Thank you.

1638
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,270
- He was really unpleasant.
- I agree.

1639
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:48,770
The most unpleasant moment for me...

1640
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:51,270
was when I saw his underwear
inside his shorts.

1641
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,140
It was really unpleasant.

1642
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,850
Don't go stirring people up.

1643
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:57,020
Stirring people up?
I have no intention to do that.

1644
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,210
Give it to me.
One person should collect them.

1645
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,960
Chae Young, is your name spelled
with "ae" or "e?"

1646
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,980
It's "ae."

1647
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,980
- I wrote it correctly.
- Right?

1648
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,160
Did you write my name?

1649
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:08,600
Of course not.

1650
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,960
Your funds have been multiplied.

1651
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,960
The vacation funds
of Team Jae Suk tripled.

1652
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,330
- All right!
- Yes!

1653
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:16,270
- Team Suk Jin's doubled.
- All right!

1654
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,700
- Yes!
- This is nice.

1655
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,330
We'll serve you the food
once it's ready.

1656
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:23,640
My gosh, look at that.
The side dishes look so good.

1657
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:26,310
Is it chicken soup
with sarcodon mushroom? It is!

1658
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:27,950
(This dish
has all the good ingredients.)

1659
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:30,680
I really wanted to have
potato pancakes.

1660
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:32,290
Yes! Acorn jelly!

1661
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,080
- Let's eat now.
- Thank you for the food.

1662
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,480
Thank you for the food.

1663
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,460
Thank you for the food.

1664
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,620
It's seafood pancake.

1665
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,960
If you need some more...

1666
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,350
Chae Young,
do you want some seafood pancake?

1667
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,520
The potato pancake is crispy.

1668
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,060
- The potato pancake is really good.
- It's so good.

1669
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,870
- The potato pancake is so savory.
- Wow, it's so good.

1670
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:48,930
You can tell how good the restaurant
is from its radish kimchi.

1671
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:50,830
It's already seasoned.

1672
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,930
It looks good.

1673
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,870
The broth seems really thick.

1674
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:57,580
(Even Jae Suk, who doesn't like
eating by the creek, is mesmerized.)

1675
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,140
It's so good.

1676
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,040
- Can I have a bite?
- The broth is so good.

1677
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,140
Is it amazing?

1678
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,140
- It's good. The broth is good.
- It's amazing.

1679
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,140
You need to dip it in salt though.

1680
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,980
It's so nice to eat by the creek
while listening to the water.

1681
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:13,330
- It's so nice.
- The sound of the water.

1682
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,250
The potato pancake
is made with potatoes only.

1683
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,460
I think so too.

1684
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,270
Chae Young has the most funds.
She has 450 dollars.

1685
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,100
- Really?
- How come she has so much?

1686
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,230
How cute.

1687
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,600
- The number is so cute.
- Even the amount is so cute.

1688
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,210
- How cute.
- It's so cute, Chae Young.

1689
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:32,410
And we'll pick two Mr. Unpleasants.

1690
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:35,770
One of them is already decided
as he received the most votes.

1691
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:36,810
(One of them is already decided.)

1692
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,350
The first Mr. Unpleasant...

1693
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:39,710
(Mr. Unpleasant is decided
after just two votes.)

1694
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,580
is Suk Jin with 16 votes.

1695
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:44,350
He won all the votes
now that Kwang Soo isn't here.

1696
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:45,680
I can't believe it.

1697
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,750
He got all the votes.

1698
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,060
Now we need to vote.

1699
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,160
(He won...)

1700
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,370
(6 votes in the 1st round.)

1701
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:54,830
(In the 2nd round,
he won up to 10 votes.)

1702
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:57,000
It's been decided.

1703
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,910
The problem is,
the second place is neck and neck.

1704
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:01,540
(One of them will be voted
as Mr. Unpleasant.)

1705
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,730
People in 2nd place are Jae Suk,
Haha, and So Min with 2 votes each.

1706
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,350
- Why did they vote for me?
- It's neck and neck.

1707
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:06,750
Se Chan and Chae Young
are in third place.

1708
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,770
We got one vote each. All right.

1709
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:11,850
Your place could change dramatically
in the last vote.

1710
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,850
- Let's decide this now.
- All right, go ahead.

1711
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,660
We'll decide who'll go solo.

1712
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,020
You can start.

1713
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,850
(The member who'll fight alone
in an important mission)

1714
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,730
(Se Chan, Chae Young, Jong Kook,
Haha, Ji Hyo, Young Ji, Suk Jin,)

1715
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:22,890
(So Min, Jae Suk)

1716
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,000
(Jong Kook)

1717
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,430
Jong Kook!

1718
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:28,560
(It's Jong Kook.)

1719
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,700
All right!

1720
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,160
(The strongest 1-person team
has been formed.)

1721
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,910
You picked the right direction.

1722
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:36,870
It doesn't seem
that disadvantageous for him.

1723
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:39,580
- He can fight against everyone.
- It seems advantageous for him.

1724
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,810
Let's move to play the last mission.

1725
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:43,140
- Let's go.
- Jong Kook likes it.

1726
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,620
All right!

1727
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:47,140
Let's move to the next spot.

1728
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,660
This is a vlog.

1729
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,080
(The gym lover's vlog starts
with his smiling eyes.)

1730
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,120
All right!

1731
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,230
Getting on the amazing Staria!

1732
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:02,370
I should shake off the dust.
That's good manners.

1733
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:03,790
(Gym Jong Kook)

1734
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,100
All right. That's good manners.

1735
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,100
(Good manners)

1736
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:08,980
The door is automatic.

1737
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,040
(He seems to have the wrong idea
about vlogs.)

1738
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,140
(He was different
from the beginning.)

1739
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,250
This is really nice.

1740
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,850
- This is our last mission, right?
- Yes.

1741
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,950
We should think carefully
about who to vote for.

1742
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:20,980
Suk Jin is done for.

1743
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,810
He's been decided already.

1744
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:25,160
- The remaining...
- We have to vote for one more.

1745
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:27,980
We're not going to betray
each other, are we?

1746
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,250
- Come on.
- Hey.

1747
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,560
- We don't do that.
- It's all about peace here.

1748
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,830
I'd never vote for you, Young Ji.

1749
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:34,230
- Young Ji, that means...
- That's right.

1750
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:35,790
they're going to betray you.

1751
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:38,160
- That's how they start?
- Come on, Ji Hyo.

1752
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,230
- There's more coming.
- That's a big misunderstanding.

1753
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,100
I just got the chills.

1754
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,210
He spoke exactly the way
I expected him to.

1755
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,850
Why would we betray you after having
chicken soup with you?

1756
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:49,080
Don't say that
on a nice day like today.

1757
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,450
- We enjoyed the potato pancake too.
- It's exactly the same.

1758
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:54,140
- I have something to tell you.
- What is it?

1759
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:57,310
2 people are to receive the penalty,
and we need to pick 1.

1760
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,080
So Min,
you and I are in second place.

1761
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,180
You want to pick Jae Suk?

1762
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:01,850
We don't need to say it, right?

1763
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:03,250
No need. It's been decided.

1764
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:06,960
Aren't you upset that Jae Suk
drove everyone to pick you?

1765
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,230
- Let's vote for him.
- Gosh.

1766
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,460
- Yes, it's upsetting.
- Let's vote for Jae Suk.

1767
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,100
- What do you think, Ms. Han?
- Shall we do that?

1768
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,640
- How about voting for Jae Suk?
- Shall we?

1769
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,660
Of course we should.

1770
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,730
Jong Kook's vote must be crucial...

1771
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,410
- since he has four ballots.
- His vote is important.

1772
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,870
I'm sure...

1773
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:21,770
he'll listen to you, Ms. Han.

1774
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:23,250
Then you should convince him.

1775
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,770
- Me?
- Yes.

1776
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,410
(They try to convince Jong Kook
with Chae Young in their corner.)

1777
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,680
- Hey, Suk Jin.
- Jong Kook.

1778
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,830
Ms. Han...

1779
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,120
wants to ask you a favor
for the first time in her life.

1780
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,830
- To whom?
- Hang on.

1781
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:40,060
- She has something to ask you.
- Me? Okay.

1782
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,540
I wanted to ask you a favor.

1783
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,890
What is it?

1784
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,910
Shall we all vote for Jae Suk?

1785
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:53,210
What do you think?
It's my first time on the show,

1786
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:54,870
and I'm asking you a favor.

1787
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,140
(She's a novice negotiator
who only has cuteness as her card.)

1788
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:59,750
Is that so? Then I guess...

1789
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:01,810
Okay, I'll do that...

1790
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:03,660
since you asked.

1791
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:04,710
You mean it, right?

1792
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,660
I'll vote for Jae Suk then.

1793
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:08,350
Tell him that he's so cool.

1794
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:10,930
Right. You're so cool, Jong Kook!

1795
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:15,830
(She forces herself
to compliment Jong Kook.)

1796
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:19,830
All right, Jong Kook.
We have a deal.

1797
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:21,370
You've been decided
to receive the penalty.

1798
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:23,640
It doesn't matter me.

1799
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,810
Please help us, Jong Kook!

1800
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:26,410
Help us out.

1801
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:28,040
(They arrive at the last spot.)

1802
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,350
The weather is so nice.

1803
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:30,450
The view...

1804
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,640
- is incredible.
- The view is amazing here.

1805
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,950
It's so green.

1806
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:35,890
Se Chan, hit an approach shot.

1807
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:37,980
That was a good shot, Jong Kook.

1808
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:40,160
- Hit an approach shot.
- Nice approach.

1809
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,680
Until when are you going to film
your vlog?

1810
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,160
They didn't take the camera away,
so I'm just filming with it.

1811
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,160
I'm practicing for my channel.

1812
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:49,460
This is the last mission
for a fruitful vacation.

1813
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:51,160
It's an upgraded version...

1814
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,560
- of the quiz we played.
- What is it?

1815
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,060
It's the Nerve-wracking Quiz.

1816
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,730
- But why...
- We're playing a quiz again?

1817
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:57,330
would you let us play a quiz
after forming a team?

1818
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:58,600
(Why let us play a quiz
after forming a team?)

1819
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,850
This is driving me crazy.
After Kwang Soo left,

1820
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:04,850
- I'm the only empty head here.
- This is driving me crazy.

1821
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,620
Our team is better, isn't it?

1822
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,410
- Our team is better.
- Our team is better.

1823
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:09,410
(They're more or less the same.)

1824
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,660
We're playing a quiz? Okay.

1825
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,460
It's better to play alone.

1826
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,250
It's an upgraded version...

1827
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:18,060
of a quiz on units.

1828
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,890
We're done for.

1829
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:22,930
We added some symbols
on top of the units.

1830
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:24,870
But we don't even know the units.

1831
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:27,540
- Tell us what the unit is...
- We're in trouble.

1832
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,910
as soon as you see it.

1833
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:30,830
- Something like milliliter.
- Wait, is this a math quiz?

1834
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:31,910
Yes, it is.

1835
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,040
(It covers units and symbols
in all areas.)

1836
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,870
No, it's more like a science quiz.

1837
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:35,910
Oh, really?

1838
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:38,040
Young Ji studied in New Zealand...

1839
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,310
- Don't talk about that!
- when she was young.

1840
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:41,310
Is that so?

1841
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:43,060
- She can speak English.
- In that case...

1842
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,750
- And you know about Chae Young.
- She studied abroad too.

1843
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,460
- Up until her teen years...
- She used to live in Chicago.

1844
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:47,620
- Hi.
- Hi.

1845
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,790
- That's it?
- Hi.

1846
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:51,460
- That's all.
- Goodness.

1847
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:53,460
Each member will give it a go,

1848
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,600
and if they read the unit correctly,
they earn a point.

1849
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,270
If they get it wrong,
the chance goes to the other team.

1850
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:00,660
- What about him?
- He can answer...

1851
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:01,810
four times in a row.

1852
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:03,980
- I can do that?
- Yes, you get four chances.

1853
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:06,140
- Let's see how good they are.
- Right. Let's see.

1854
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,540
Let's go first then.

1855
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:09,520
All right. We can do this!

1856
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,410
- We're going first?
- Let's do this!

1857
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:13,020
We'll show the unit
to Team Jae Suk first.

1858
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,290
If you don't answer
on the count of three,

1859
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:15,810
- you are out.
- Okay.

1860
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:17,620
Please count to three slowly.

1861
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,250
- Here comes the first question.
- Okay.

1862
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,390
(Jae Suk will be given
the first question.)

1863
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:21,460
Will it be hard?

1864
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:22,930
Cue.

1865
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,020
1, 2, 3.

1866
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,620
- Decibel.
- You answered too late.

1867
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:27,160
- Decibel.
- I knew that one.

1868
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,430
- You answered too late.
- Decibel is a unit...

1869
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:29,540
- even I know.
- Decibel.

1870
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:31,230
- I should have gone first.
- I didn't know.

1871
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,640
You should count it
as the correct answer.

1872
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,810
- No.
- I got it right.

1873
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:37,080
- DB Insurance.
- Decibel.

1874
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,500
Isn't it DB Insurance?

1875
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,750
Insurance?

1876
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,540
- Listen.
- DB.

1877
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:42,620
Bo Pil.

1878
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:44,350
- You are strict.
- You should be more lenient.

1879
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:45,390
You are strict today.

1880
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:47,480
The charm of this game
lies in the quick answers.

1881
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,850
Charm? Charm?

1882
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:50,180
- Charm.
- Charm?

1883
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,350
Calm down.

1884
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,060
- Charm?
- Calm down.

1885
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:54,460
Why are you so offended?

1886
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,620
For goodness' sake.

1887
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,250
- Charm.
- I am really bad at this.

1888
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,290
- Jong Kook, you are up next.
- Me?

1889
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,930
- Okay.
- He won't get more than two right.

1890
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,560
- DB Insurance.
- Here comes the question.

1891
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,460
(Team Jong Kook's first attempt)

1892
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,210
Cue. 1, 2, 3.

1893
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:08,270
Newt? What is that?

1894
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,710
- N.
- N?

1895
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:12,040
- Isn't N from N and S?
- N.

1896
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,270
- Newton.
- Correct.

1897
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:17,450
Newton. Gosh, I got to "Newt."

1898
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:18,540
Newton.

1899
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,450
- Hold on.
- I got to "Newt."

1900
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:21,750
- The first one should be easy.
- Should Chae Young go first?

1901
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:22,980
- You should go first.
- Haha.

1902
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,520
Chae Young,
let's see what you can do.

1903
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,060
- Let's see it.
- Okay.

1904
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,790
- Go ahead.
- The first one should be easy.

1905
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:29,390
I will go first.
Please give me an easy one.

1906
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:30,750
- Chae Young, go first.
- The easiest one.

1907
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:31,890
Chae Young will go first.

1908
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,290
All right, Chae Young.

1909
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:35,540
Let's go.

1910
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:37,330
1, 2, 3.

1911
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:38,330
Gram...

1912
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,370
- Gigabyte.
- Gigabyte.

1913
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,500
Gram...

1914
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,430
(Gram?)

1915
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:45,770
- Gigabyte.
- Even I know gigabyte.

1916
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:47,850
- It's gigabyte, Chae Young.
- Gigabyte.

1917
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:50,020
It was too fast-paced,

1918
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,410
so I felt pressured.

1919
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:53,250
- Even I know that one.
- Chae Young.

1920
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,910
Decibel and gigabyte.

1921
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:57,480
- That was cute.
- That was cute.

1922
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,230
- That was cute.
- It suddenly feels so hot in here.

1923
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:00,390
Chae Young, that was cute.

1924
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:01,430
That was cute.

1925
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:02,520
- That was cute.
- That was cute.

1926
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,660
She almost started...

1927
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:06,100
- with "Grand."
- It's our turn again.

1928
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,520
- Grandfather.
- Grandfather.

1929
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,000
All three teams have zero points.

1930
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,390
- Bring it on.
- Will Jae Suk go first?

1931
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:11,540
Jae Suk.

1932
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,640
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1933
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,710
I hope they fail.

1934
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:16,810
(I hope they fail.)

1935
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:18,640
Isn't that going a bit too far?

1936
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:19,770
(The magical fairy puts a curse
on them with a selfie stick.)

1937
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:21,370
Set, go.

1938
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:23,180
- 1, 2...
- Sine.

1939
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:34,330
(Jae Suk is correct.)

1940
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:35,410
- Two...
- Sine.

1941
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:37,060
Isn't it just "Sin?"

1942
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:38,370
Thank goodness I didn't get it.

1943
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,640
I thought it was "Sin."

1944
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,350
- Like thin pizza.
- I know.

1945
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,980
- Sin.
- Sine.

1946
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,270
- It's sine.
- Sine from sine and cosine.

1947
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:45,640
I am about to throw up.

1948
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,040
- Let's go.
- I got one.

1949
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:48,640
She said she is about to throw up.

1950
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,980
- She said she is about to throw up.
- Hey.

1951
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:51,790
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

1952
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,290
Jae Suk, you are cool.

1953
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:55,120
- We are off to a good start.
- Young Ji.

1954
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:56,980
Let's go.

1955
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,950
- Here comes the question.
- Don't be nervous.

1956
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,230
Cue.

1957
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,600
1, 2, 3.

1958
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,100
Mountain.

1959
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:05,700
(Mountain.)

1960
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,040
(Mountain?)

1961
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,560
(He gets a sudden headache.)

1962
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:13,040
(They laugh because it seems like
she is wrong.)

1963
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,040
- What is that?
- Sigma.

1964
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,410
Sigma.

1965
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:17,180
- Sigma.
- You should have given me that one.

1966
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,180
It's okay not to know that one.

1967
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,080
- It's okay not to know that one.
- It's okay.

1968
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,680
- It's a hard one.
- No!

1969
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,580
I am not very well-educated.

1970
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,620
This is nothing.
You just need to answer quickly.

1971
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:26,890
This is doable.

1972
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:29,020
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

1973
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:30,580
Let's go!

1974
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,700
(Looking at the other team
gives them confidence.)

1975
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:33,500
- That was funny.
- It's Jong Kook's turn.

1976
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,700
So Min can't laugh.

1977
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,230
Let's do this comfortably.

1978
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:37,230
(It's loud,
but the selfie stick fairy focuses.)

1979
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:38,540
- Let's do this comfortably.
- It's Jong Kook's turn.

1980
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,790
- I will get an easy one.
- Set, go.

1981
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,470
- 1, 2...
- Watt.

1982
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:44,140
(Watt)

1983
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:45,230
Watt.

1984
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:46,700
- Set, go.
- The easy ones are disappearing.

1985
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:49,000
(The next question)

1986
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,480
- Let's go.
- Hertz.

1987
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,520
There you go.

1988
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,770
That's right.

1989
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:55,140
- Give me the easy ones.
- Why didn't I get that one?

1990
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:57,450
Let's go.

1991
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,480
- What is that?
- Pascal!

1992
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:02,180
- Pascal.
- Pascal.

1993
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,950
- Pascal.
- Pascal.

1994
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,350
- Pascal.
- Pascal.

1995
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:07,660
Why didn't I get that one?
I should have gotten it.

1996
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,620
- Pascal.
- Pascal.

1997
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,660
- Pascal.
- Why didn't I get that one?

1998
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:13,370
- Don't answer after taking a beat!
- No.

1999
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:15,600
You keep pretending to know
after a beat.

2000
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,810
- Stop it.
- P, A, K, A, L.

2001
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:19,140
- Pascal.
- Se Chan.

2002
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:20,310
What's pascal?

2003
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:21,950
- That was too much.
- What's pascal?

2004
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:23,450
That was too much.

2005
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:24,480
What's pascal?

2006
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,140
- Don't corner him like that!
- What's pascal?

2007
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:28,390
- It's...
- What's pascal?

2008
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,720
- What's pascal?
- Isn't it a unit of measurement?

2009
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:33,290
Isn't it a unit of measurement?

2010
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:34,950
You know,

2011
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:36,930
- Bo Pil is something else.
- He is unbelievable.

2012
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:38,100
"What's pascal?"

2013
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:40,620
Did you have to go that far?

2014
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:43,330
- He cornered me.
- Just because you are educated...

2015
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:44,520
(Se Chan got humiliated
for "Pakal.")

2016
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,270
What's pascal?

2017
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,310
Is Jong Kook leading right now?

2018
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:49,560
- Did he answer 2 questions?
- 2 questions.

2019
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:52,140
Shall I go first?

2020
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,540
Yes. Let's try to get
one question right.

2021
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:55,750
This is hard for me too.

2022
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,980
- Okay. Let's go.
- Get ready.

2023
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:59,250
Let's go.

2024
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:00,680
What are you doing?

2025
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:01,950
- Ear hair.
- Get ready.

2026
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,480
(Jong Kook films his ear hair.)

2027
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,750
What are you doing?

2028
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:06,480
Ear hair. I am filming it.

2029
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,230
- Film it.
- I don't have ear hair.

2030
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,830
- Ear hair.
- It's because of you.

2031
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:11,120
Film his ear hair.

2032
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,020
- I don't have any!
- Don't cut it.

2033
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:14,430
- Ear hair.
- Stop it.

2034
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:16,500
Jong Kook,
you are working hard today.

2035
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,600
The viewers might be curious.

2036
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,700
You are working hard today.

2037
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:21,910
I thought it was a fist.

2038
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:23,040
- All right.
- Let's go.

2039
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,140
Let's do this.

2040
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,040
Let's go. This is nothing.

2041
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,730
That's right.
We use those units in real life.

2042
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:29,350
- We use those units.
- Don't be nervous.

2043
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:30,750
- I just need to be alert.
- Let's go.

2044
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,450
- Okay.
- Take it on.

2045
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:33,950
- Bring it on.
- Okay.

2046
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:36,140
- Bring it on.
- Here comes the question. Cue.

2047
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:37,810
I know what this is. Gertz.

2048
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:40,480
I know what this is. Gertz.

2049
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,160
(He says the wrong answer
in a cheesy manner.)

2050
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,790
- Gigahertz.
- Gigahertz.

2051
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:46,850
Gigahertz.

2052
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,790
Get up, get up, get up, gertz.

2053
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:51,200
- Gertz!
- Gigahertz.

2054
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,770
(Jae Suk is dying of laughter.)

2055
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:55,060
- Get up, get up, get up, gertz.
- Gertz!

2056
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:57,560
- Isn't it gertz?
- I thought you would get it right.

2057
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,930
- Gertz!
- He was close.

2058
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:01,140
The Great Gertz.

2059
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:03,100
- Gertz!
- I had high hopes.

2060
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,370
- He was close.
- Gertz!

2061
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:08,640
- It was an easy one.
- He needed to put them together.

2062
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:10,580
- It's our turn.
- Get this one right.

2063
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:11,720
Let's get another one right.

2064
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,060
Do you want to go first?

2065
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:14,160
- Ji Hyo, go first.
- Ji Hyo.

2066
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,580
Okay. I will go first.

2067
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,230
Let's go the opposite way. Okay.

2068
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:18,620
Let's go the opposite way.
Ji Hyo, let's go.

2069
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,730
- All right.
- Look at Ji Hyo.

2070
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:22,330
- Ji Hyo.
- I like that look in her eyes.

2071
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:24,290
- Ji Hyo.
- She is determined.

2072
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,140
- Come to your senses.
- I can do it.

2073
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:27,540
- You can do it.
- I can do it.

2074
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,930
That's so funny.

2075
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:30,470
- Get ready.
- Ji Hyo, let's go.

2076
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:32,480
- An easy one.
- Here comes the question. Cue.

2077
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,140
1, 2, 3.

2078
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,040
- Root.
- Root.

2079
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,980
(Root)

2080
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:39,220
(It's incorrect
since she went over time.)

2081
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:40,520
- Why didn't you answer faster?
- Root.

2082
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,790
- Root.
- She answered too late.

2083
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:44,020
- She still answered.
- Root.

2084
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:45,120
She still answered.

2085
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,310
The symbol looks strange.

2086
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:48,120
Why is it so short?

2087
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,560
You answered too late.
Move out of the way.

2088
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,330
I know it's a root.

2089
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:53,330
You answered too late.

2090
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:55,020
- You answered too late.
- Put the camera away, okay?

2091
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:57,120
- You answered too late.
- Put the camera away, okay?

2092
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,270
- Root.
- Put it away.

2093
01:07:58,270 --> 01:07:59,470
You answered too late.

2094
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:01,000
I want to take that camera from him.

2095
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,500
- Just answer comfortably.
- Jong Kook has an advantage.

2096
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,230
- Just answer comfortably.
- The next question.

2097
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:06,870
Okay.

2098
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:08,080
The next question.

2099
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,000
- This one's for me.
- Cue.

2100
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,040
Kilogram.

2101
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,680
(Kilogram)

2102
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,950
Kilogram?

2103
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:16,910
Everyone knows that.

2104
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:18,120
- I am jealous.
- He is using the camera well.

2105
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,160
- Okay.
- Seriously.

2106
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,310
Everyone knows that.

2107
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,950
- I am jealous.
- Kilogram?

2108
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:24,120
I can't believe he got that one.

2109
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:26,120
- Here comes the next one.
- Just answer comfortably.

2110
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,700
- He has an advantage.
- Just answer comfortably.

2111
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:28,870
Here comes the question.

2112
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:30,930
Cue.

2113
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:32,290
- 1, 2...
- Cos... Cos!

2114
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,790
Cosine!

2115
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,310
(He just read the unit as it looks.)

2116
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:37,860
- Costco.
- Cosine.

2117
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,000
Isn't it a clothing brand?

2118
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,140
- Cosine.
- Isn't it a clothing brand?

2119
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,980
- Cosine.
- Costco.

2120
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:45,370
He said Costco instead of cosine.

2121
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:47,280
Isn't it a clothing brand?

2122
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,320
It's my favorite clothing brand.

2123
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,690
Jae Suk is happy.

2124
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:52,390
I thought I wouldn't see that
since Kwang Soo is gone.

2125
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:54,860
Add a clip of Kwang Soo next to him.

2126
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:57,860
(The tall man's mockery)

2127
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:59,320
It's quite old.

2128
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:01,360
Add a clip of Kwang Soo next to him.

2129
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:02,970
Then, will I go...

2130
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:04,620
- after Jae Suk and Young Ji?
- Yes.

2131
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,830
I don't think I will get a chance.

2132
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:07,290
- Then come here.
- Give it a try.

2133
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:08,400
I will show you.

2134
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,830
Most of the things I know
have already been asked.

2135
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:12,740
Only two things remain.

2136
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,150
Get ready.
Here comes the question. Cue.

2137
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:18,220
- 1, 2...
- V.

2138
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,480
- Volt. Isn't it volt?
- "Robot Taekwon V."

2139
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,610
"Robot Taekwon V?"

2140
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:26,020
(Volt)

2141
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,410
- Volt.
- Volt.

2142
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:28,820
Jae Suk, it's volt.

2143
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,860
Everything I know has been asked!

2144
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:33,120
Only pi remains.

2145
01:09:33,730 --> 01:09:35,320
- Volt.
- V for victory.

2146
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:38,360
V.

2147
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,830
- Jong Kook.
- Yes.

2148
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:42,110
Just answer comfortably.
You don't need to be nervous.

2149
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:43,400
This is nothing.
You use these units in real life.

2150
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,200
- Are you talking to yourself?
- Yes.

2151
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:47,110
Being alone suits Jong Kook.

2152
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:48,810
- It's okay.
- It gets confusing.

2153
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,740
- Here comes the question.
- It's nothing.

2154
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:53,020
Cue.

2155
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:54,280
- 1, 2...
- Pi.

2156
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,280
(Pi)

2157
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,890
It's the only one I know.

2158
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:58,520
Everything I know has been asked.

2159
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,080
(He only had pi to depend on.)

2160
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:01,930
Everything I know has been asked.

2161
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:03,390
- Same here.
- Everything I know has been asked.

2162
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:05,820
I give up now.
Everything I know has been asked.

2163
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:07,290
- It's the same for me.
- I give up now.

2164
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:08,770
Only one remains.

2165
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:09,990
There is one more thing I know.

2166
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:11,740
You use these units in real life.

2167
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:13,530
- All right.
- Everything I know has been asked.

2168
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:14,600
Shall we resume?

2169
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,770
Here comes the question. Cue.

2170
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:17,640
1, 2, 3.

2171
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,110
- Ton.
- Tangent.

2172
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:20,480
- Tangent.
- Tangent.

2173
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,480
(Another trigonometric function)

2174
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:24,200
I was reminded of a tanning salon.

2175
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:26,570
(The mockery mode is on.)

2176
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:28,610
- You didn't even know volt.
- Tangent.

2177
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:29,820
V, come back in.

2178
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,080
Tangent.

2179
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,820
Sine, cosine, tangent.

2180
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:34,060
Tangent.

2181
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,080
(He doubles over with laughter.)

2182
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,430
The man who was born in Germany,

2183
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:39,120
Haha will go next.

2184
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,820
- The man who was born in Germany.
- The man who was born in Germany.

2185
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:41,990
Let's go.

2186
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:44,030
- Show us what you can do.
- Here comes the question.

2187
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:45,570
- This is nothing. Don't be nervous.
- Here comes the question.

2188
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:46,940
Cue.

2189
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:49,270
- Mile.
- You got it right.

2190
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,830
(Haha is correct.)

2191
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,030
- He is happy.
- He is happy.

2192
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:55,310
Ha Dream!

2193
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:57,780
- He is happy.
- Ha Dream!

2194
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,320
I am your father!

2195
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:02,820
Stay tuned!

2196
01:11:04,150 --> 01:11:05,650
For goodness' sake.

2197
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:06,890
Let's resume.

2198
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:08,150
Chae Young.

2199
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:09,490
Here comes the question.

2200
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:10,750
(Chae Young is up next.)

2201
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,450
Cue. 1, 2...

2202
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:13,600
Centimeter.

2203
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:16,360
- Centimeter.
- Centimeter.

2204
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,790
- Hold on.
- That's...

2205
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:19,490
(Is cm really one of the questions?)

2206
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:20,940
Is that really the question?

2207
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:22,500
- Hold on.
- Hold on.

2208
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,940
Isn't that question too easy?

2209
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:26,640
- Listen.
- Come on,

2210
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,180
- that question was too easy.
- Come here.

2211
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:29,650
Grab his neck.

2212
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:31,480
- Grab his neck.
- How could you ask what cm is?

2213
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,650
- It's too much.
- It's too easy.

2214
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:35,740
- Even I know this.
- Did you hear that? "Centimeter."

2215
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:36,740
For goodness' sake.

2216
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:37,990
- "Centimeter."
- Aren't you annoyed?

2217
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:39,650
I am very happy. "Centimeter."

2218
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:41,580
(He suddenly conducts
a street interview.)

2219
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,320
Why? Why are you annoyed?

2220
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,060
- I am so annoyed.
- You are annoyed, right?

2221
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:46,600
- How about you?
- I am annoyed.

2222
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,430
- How about you?
- I am happy.

2223
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:50,190
(Han Chae Young,
the person answered correctly)

2224
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:52,770
(She feels good
since she earned a point.)

2225
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:56,140
- You are cute.
- You are cute.

2226
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:57,940
- Cutie Chae Young.
- Chae Young.

2227
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:59,140
You are cute.

2228
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,570
Cutie Chae Young.

2229
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,650
My goodness. It's our turn.

2230
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:04,180
We need to get a question right.
You should go.

2231
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:05,180
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2232
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,240
Jae Suk.

2233
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,320
I am good
when it's someone else's question.

2234
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,440
You get nervous.

2235
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,690
It's easier
when it's someone else's question.

2236
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:11,910
- You get nervous.
- Jae Suk.

2237
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,860
Don't look at it directly.
Look at it sideways.

2238
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,250
- Look at it sideways.
- It isn't my question.

2239
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,280
It isn't your question.

2240
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:19,530
When it's my question,
I can't answer the simplest thing.

2241
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:20,930
Look at it sideways.

2242
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:23,660
- There you go. That's good.
- It's someone else's question.

2243
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:25,160
- Let's go.
- Go.

2244
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,990
Cue. 1, 2, 3.

2245
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:29,030
Fahrenheit.

2246
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:30,070
(He is correct.)

2247
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:32,310
- Fahren-heat?
- Fahrenheit.

2248
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:33,870
- Fahrenheit.
- How did he know that?

2249
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:35,040
That one was easy.

2250
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,150
We are off to a good start.

2251
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:37,350
- Young Ji, you are next.
- Okay.

2252
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,350
Here comes the question. Cue.

2253
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:41,150
- 1, 2...
- Oh, that's...

2254
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:42,410
- Hey.
- Young Ji.

2255
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:44,190
- Liter.
- Liter.

2256
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,020
- That's...
- She is a total Empty Head.

2257
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,560
(Liter)

2258
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,950
(She speaks nonsense...)

2259
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:51,450
(and collapses on the floor.)

2260
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,950
(She is a total Empty Head.)

2261
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:54,990
That question was
practically a freebie.

2262
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:56,470
- Hey.
- It's easy.

2263
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:58,570
- Hold on.
- Even Empty Heads know that much.

2264
01:12:58,570 --> 01:13:00,940
Young Ji, what was that noise?

2265
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:02,330
I am going to go home.

2266
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:04,310
You should have answered "Lotte."

2267
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,780
- Lotte.
- Hey.

2268
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:06,830
(Young Ji's ignorance
shakes up the Empty Head Land.)

2269
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:09,850
(She attacks Jae Suk's thighs.)

2270
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:12,440
Your face. Are you okay?

2271
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,220
- I am okay.
- Are you okay, Young Ji?

2272
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:15,410
It's okay.

2273
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:16,890
- Oh, no.
- My goodness.

2274
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,580
Don't be so nervous.

2275
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:23,030
Isn't liter abbreviated as L?

2276
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,120
- That's an L.
- That's an L.

2277
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,860
(Liter)

2278
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:29,530
(This is an L.)

2279
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,100
- That's an L.
- Young Ji.

2280
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,940
- Young Ji, keep your mouth shut.
- She should be protected.

2281
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:36,270
- She should be protected.
- You aren't like kids these days.

2282
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,270
- Edit this out.
- She should be protected.

2283
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:39,310
Young Ji.

2284
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,900
You know, in this segment,

2285
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,650
- you filled up Kwang Soo's spot.
- Seriously.

2286
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:46,280
She is good.

2287
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,680
You filled it up.

2288
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:48,820
- My goodness.
- All right.

2289
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:49,940
- Jong Kook.
- Me?

2290
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,650
Answer comfortably.
You use these units in real life.

2291
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:54,450
- Jong Kook has an advantage.
- You see these units in real life.

2292
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:56,320
- Here comes the question.
- Okay.

2293
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:57,890
Cue.

2294
01:13:58,230 --> 01:13:59,730
1, 2, 3.

2295
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:01,560
Gosh, that one.

2296
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,660
- It's pound.
- That's right.

2297
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,900
- Is that pound?
- It's written on fitness equipment.

2298
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,030
I can't believe I got it wrong.

2299
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:07,970
- How is that pound?
- Why?

2300
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,070
- Are those letters L and B?
- Why is that the abbreviated form?

2301
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,830
Isn't that Red Velvet?

2302
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,040
In Korea, we use kilograms.

2303
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,870
- But in the US, they use pounds.
- Really?

2304
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,480
You should have gotten it right.

2305
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,040
I can't believe I got it wrong!

2306
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:25,020
(Gym Jong Kook becomes upset.)

2307
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:27,080
(The fitness fairy
is disappointed in himself.)

2308
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,080
I...

2309
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:32,900
(Now is our chance.)

2310
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,190
I...

2311
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:36,660
(Furious bicep workout)

2312
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:39,030
I work out so much.
I see that symbol every day.

2313
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:40,600
Hey. So Min, you can do it.

2314
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:42,400
- So Min, you are smart.
- Let's go.

2315
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,440
So Min, you can do it.

2316
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,240
So Min. Here comes the question.

2317
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,480
Cue.

2318
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:49,000
1, 2, 3.

2319
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:50,310
Lexy.

2320
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:51,870
(Laughing)

2321
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:53,320
X-Large.

2322
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,720
Lux.

2323
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,820
(She mentioned a popular singer
from the 2000s.)

2324
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:57,890
It's a unit of illuminance.

2325
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,780
(Men are the same)

2326
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:04,080
(They are babies)

2327
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,120
Lux.

2328
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:07,450
We have the results.

2329
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:08,570
(The Nerve-wracking Quiz ends.)

2330
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:11,270
Team Jong Kook has five points.

2331
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:12,290
Five points.

2332
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:14,160
Team Green with Chae Young has...

2333
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:16,770
3 points. This team has 2 points.

2334
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:17,940
(Team Jae Suk has 2 points.)

2335
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:19,900
It's best to work alone.

2336
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:21,850
Okay.

2337
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,680
Jong Kook will get
triple the prize money.

2338
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,180
As for the other teams,
it's two times and nothing.

2339
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:29,390
Let's begin the last poll.

2340
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:31,040
Okay.

2341
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,250
(It's time for the last poll.)

2342
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:34,910
With 16 votes, Suk Jin became
Mr. Unpleasant.

2343
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:37,430
Don't waste your ballot
by writing down my name.

2344
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:39,030
Write down someone else's name.

2345
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,950
So Min? Haha?

2346
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:42,820
(The 12 ballots will determine
the 2nd Mr. Unpleasant.)

2347
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,270
This is hard, right?

2348
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:48,970
- Who is in second place?
- Can I trust you guys?

2349
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:49,970
Of course.

2350
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:51,240
- It's the only way.
- Really?

2351
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,000
Of course. It goes without saying.

2352
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,830
- Really?
- Yes.

2353
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:56,180
It can't be helped.

2354
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:58,440
(Team Suk Jin came up
with a plan in the car.)

2355
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:01,540
(Their goal is Jae Suk.)

2356
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:06,060
(They even roped in Jong Kook
with 4 ballots.)

2357
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:08,150
(If things go as planned,)

2358
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:10,430
(Jae Suk will receive 8 ballots
and become Mr. Unpleasant.)

2359
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:11,730
I wrote down his name too.

2360
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:14,600
- What?
- Show me all the ballots.

2361
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:15,770
I am telling you the truth.

2362
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:17,600
Look at his eyes!
Look at his facial expression!

2363
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,030
- This is driving me crazy.
- His facial expression.

2364
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:20,900
- Haha.
- I am telling you...

2365
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,640
that I wrote his name.

2366
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,740
- Then why do you...
- How annoying!

2367
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,900
She drives me crazy.

2368
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:26,980
(They suddenly become distrustful.)

2369
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:31,680
- Why do you keep acting?
- I even showed you.

2370
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:33,440
- Okay.
- Here you go.

2371
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,220
How could you write my name
when I am right here?

2372
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:39,150
- All right.
- Why are you acting?

2373
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,990
Did you see Jae Suk hit me?

2374
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:42,320
(I am innocent.)

2375
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,230
I am not acting!
Why are you so distrustful?

2376
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:46,750
Hey.

2377
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:49,270
- But...
- Show me what you wrote.

2378
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:52,440
The results will be revealed
at the place of the penalty.

2379
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,190
Will the penalty come right away?

2380
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:58,160
If you look here, there is a creek.

2381
01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:02,180
The penalty will involve
experiencing the creek.

2382
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:05,070
Simply put,
you'll need a new pair of underwear.

2383
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:06,320
That's right.

2384
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,720
A new pair of underwear.

2385
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,540
Suk Jin will carry out the penalty
since he received 16 ballots.

2386
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:11,820
It's set.

2387
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:13,990
It's a matter of who places second.

2388
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:16,690
- Let's see what happened.
- I will announce the results.

2389
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:18,860
- So Min.
- What?

2390
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:20,690
- Me?
- Everyone is acting.

2391
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,360
- Haha.
- I didn't write your name.

2392
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,290
- No.
- Haha.

2393
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:25,470
Jae Suk.

2394
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:26,990
It's a match between So Min and me.

2395
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:29,030
- I can't believe Haha got out.
- I know. It makes no sense.

2396
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:30,860
Jae Suk, Jae Suk.

2397
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:33,700
(Jae Suk receives
3 consecutive votes.)

2398
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:34,810
It's game over.

2399
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,310
- It's refreshing.
- This is important.

2400
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,570
- Jae Suk.
- So Min.

2401
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,220
So Min, So Min.

2402
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:41,280
(So Min also receives
3 consecutive votes.)

2403
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,350
It's neck and neck.

2404
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:44,240
(Jae Suk's teammates voted
for So Min.)

2405
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,490
- Why...
- It's over.

2406
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:46,820
- Why...
- How many ballots remain?

2407
01:17:46,990 --> 01:17:48,450
It's a tie. Four ballots remain.

2408
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:49,490
Four ballots.

2409
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:50,650
(So Min has 4 votes.
Jae Suk has 4 votes.)

2410
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,730
(If things go as So Min planned,)

2411
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:55,600
(she won't receive more
than 4 votes.)

2412
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,100
It isn't me. I wrote down his name.

2413
01:17:58,230 --> 01:17:59,600
- It makes no sense.
- It's a tie.

2414
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,330
It's a tie. Four ballots remain.

2415
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:02,400
(The 9th ballot)

2416
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,500
So Min.

2417
01:18:04,030 --> 01:18:05,530
- Really?
- So Min.

2418
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:07,070
So Min.

2419
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,530
- Really?
- So Min.

2420
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:10,780
(The 10th vote goes to So Min
as well.)

2421
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:13,610
(Jong Kook gave Jae Suk and So Min
2 votes each.)

2422
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:15,020
Jae Suk.

2423
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:17,820
If the last one has my name,
I will never trust Haha again.

2424
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:19,490
- What are you talking about?
- Seriously.

2425
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:21,780
You saw it. Jae Suk,
you saw me write your name.

2426
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:24,580
- I will never trust Haha again.
- Jae Suk saw me write his name.

2427
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:25,900
(Jae Suk looks resigned.)

2428
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,820
If it's 6 to 6,

2429
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:30,070
we will choose one person at random.

2430
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:31,160
Hold on.

2431
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,790
So Min, calm down.

2432
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:33,790
(Who received the last vote?)

2433
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:35,330
I bet it's a tie.

2434
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,860
Who will receive the penalty?

2435
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:44,280
(Jae Suk has 5 votes.
So Min has 6 votes.)

2436
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,870
Who will receive the penalty?

2437
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:47,280
So Min.

2438
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:48,940
Really?

2439
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:50,720
Come on.

2440
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:51,780
(So Min became Mr. Unpleasant.)

2441
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:52,890
- Hold on.
- Oh, no.

2442
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:54,110
- Is it you?
- No.

2443
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:55,250
(Haha said he wrote
Jae Suk's name.)

2444
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,730
(15 minutes ago)

2445
01:18:57,730 --> 01:19:01,530
(Haha wrote So Min's name
in the corner and pointed to it.)

2446
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:02,660
- It isn't me.
- So Min, listen.

2447
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:03,660
We wrote the same thing.

2448
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:05,100
- I'm sorry, but...
- Haha betrayed you.

2449
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,400
Can I see the votes?

2450
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,740
No.

2451
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,640
- Jae Suk hit me.
- Why?

2452
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:11,830
Hang on. I'll pay.

2453
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:14,140
- So Min.
- I'll give you my pay.

2454
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:15,940
Wait. I'll offer you my pay.

2455
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:18,110
- Jae Suk.
- Just go.

2456
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:19,850
- Let go of me.
- Just send a text message.

2457
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:23,040
I don't have extra underwear today.
I'll give you my pay.

2458
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,580
- So Min.
- I don't have extra underwear.

2459
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:26,690
You betrayed her.

2460
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:29,750
No, I didn't.
I wrote Jae Suk's name.

2461
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:31,360
You saw it.

2462
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:33,620
While these two
experience the creek,

2463
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:35,290
our guests will tell us
how they enjoyed our show today.

2464
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:38,530
Suk Jin does things like this
with So Min quite often.

2465
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,690
We're getting along well these days.

2466
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:43,400
- Make it quick.
- Okay.

2467
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,970
And make a short speech.

2468
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,570
(Mr. Unpleasant makes
unpleasant jokes until the end.)

2469
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:49,780
- Let's do this.
- The Great Gertz.

2470
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:51,480
- It looks cold.
- The Great Gertz.

2471
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,940
- Gosh, it's cold.
- He's Entertainer Gertz.

2472
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:55,180
(They can't help but scream
in the cool water.)

2473
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:58,150
Gosh, it's so cool... My gosh.

2474
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:01,060
(Giggling)

2475
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:02,560
Let's not do this.

2476
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,890
- They look so close.
- I know.

2477
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:06,290
- They look happy.
- It's so cold.

2478
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:07,860
This is cool. I love it.

2479
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:09,160
Go ahead and end the show.

2480
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,290
I forgot something important.

2481
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:12,030
We need to decide the winner
with a roulette.

2482
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:13,790
It's so cold. I can't stay seated.

2483
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:16,160
No, you should sit.

2484
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,970
- Hey.
- Stay seated.

2485
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:20,400
- The Great Gertz.
- Just stay there.

2486
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,280
We will spin the roulette,
and the winner will get...

2487
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,540
the prize money.

2488
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:26,650
We get as much money
as it says here.

2489
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:28,850
- Let's begin.
- Go ahead and spin it.

2490
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:31,190
As you know, we will wire
the money right away.

2491
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:32,950
Really?

2492
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:35,410
(The roulette to decide the winner
starts spinning.)

2493
01:20:35,410 --> 01:20:36,430
Let's go.

2494
01:20:37,690 --> 01:20:42,030
(Who will get the vacation bonus
after the delightful vacation?)

2495
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:43,990
It's Young Ji.

2496
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:46,070
(Hur Young Ji)

2497
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,140
- That's great, Young Ji.
- I'm in last place though.

2498
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:50,160
- You get 150 dollars.
- It's okay.

2499
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,370
You saved your money, SBS.

2500
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:55,400
We will wire 150 dollars
with the tax deducted.

2501
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:59,020
- With the tax deducted?
- Hey, just give her 150.

2502
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,320
- With the tax deducted.
- That's true.

2503
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,150
- Is she really getting the money?
- Yes.

2504
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:05,190
- Young Ji is really...
- It could've been Chae Young.

2505
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:06,280
This is amazing.

2506
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:07,490
Thank you.

2507
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:08,780
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2508
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:09,780
Thank you.

2509
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,750
It's not so bad to sit in here.

2510
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:15,120
(Dried young pollack)

2511
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,490
(Dried Pollack Race)

2512
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:18,400
(So this is all about talking?)

2513
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,160
(It's a race
for those who love to talk.)

2514
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,270
Tell us about your past.

2515
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:23,770
(They go back in time.)

2516
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:26,680
(Talking about love stories,)

2517
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,200
(they warm up the talk engine.)

2518
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:32,370
(11 a.m., in the van)

2519
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:35,110
(1 p.m., in the village hall)

2520
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:37,910
(3 p.m., in the bar)

2521
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,080
(They keep chattering...)

2522
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,410
(in many different places.)

2523
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:42,690
You're the only one who's talking,
you punk.

2524
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:45,450
(The members are happy
that they get to talk,)

2525
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:47,530
(which flusters the young pollacks.)

2526
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:49,770
(What will their day be like
with all the talking?)

2527
01:21:50,570 --> 01:21:52,600
(Talk Nightmare,
The Day of Chattering)
