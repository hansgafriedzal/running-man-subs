1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,660
- What is this place?
- It's so pretty.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,760
It's beautiful.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,760
(Maehyang Ecological Park
with beautiful scenery)

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,300
I didn't know Hwaseong had
a place like this.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,470
- Okay!
- This place is so refreshing.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,340
(The park has green fields that look
like ones from fairy tales.)

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,040
I'll definitely come back
to this place with my family.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,840
- This is amazing.
- This is a good place for families.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,880
This place is really beautiful.

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,950
This is perfect.

11
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,450
- Everyone.
- This place is unbelievable.

12
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,180
Guys. This is not how you're
supposed to advertise a product.

13
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,080
- You think?
- Is this an advertisement?

14
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,290
We shouldn't be doing this.

15
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,760
Gosh, I want to do chin-ups here.

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,650
This isn't an advertisement.
We're supposed to pay to be here.

17
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,830
- That's right.
- We are very grateful...

18
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,220
for the financial support
for our show.

19
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,230
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

20
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,000
- Thanks to you...
- This is so relaxing.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,140
- Because...
- Hwaseong is so beautiful.

22
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,510
Does this place offer good money?

23
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,180
If it does, I'd like to make
a workout video here...

24
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,710
- for my YouTube channel.
- Really?

25
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,610
Stop talking about
your YouTube channel!

26
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,280
You have a million subscribers!

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,440
- I'll do chin-ups here.
- But...

28
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,250
the thing is...

29
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,550
- This is ridiculous.
- I feel a little dejected.

30
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,980
Suk Jin and Haha...

31
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,930
have worked really hard...

32
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,460
to have more subscribers.

33
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,570
But they're not even close
to having one million subscribers.

34
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,100
It turns out there were a lot
of people who like to work out.

35
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,040
I felt happy for him
until he got 500,000 subscribers.

36
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,210
- Right. He did.
- Until then, I thought he was good.

37
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,100
The number of subscribers
increased rapidly.

38
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,440
I was happy for him
when it went just well.

39
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,710
But it's going too well now.

40
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,690
I even thought he probably
hired some people for his channel.

41
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,850
- Suk Jin.
- People who write comments.

42
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,320
To be honest, I have
no appetite these days.

43
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,260
I don't want to eat anything.

44
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,350
I've lost some weight.

45
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,720
- You shouldn't try too hard.
- You're right.

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,050
- I agree.
- Don't try too hard.

47
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,630
- That's not true.
- You even got the thumbnail...

48
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,130
where you were shirtless.

49
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,740
And you tell us not to try too hard?

50
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,660
Anyway, I'd like to thank
all my subscribers.

51
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,360
- The workout lovers.
- I'm happy for you.

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,010
Your channel is fun though.

53
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,040
This is so fun.

54
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,650
By the way,
this ecological park is really nice.

55
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,650
Look. There are butterflies.

56
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,150
This is so refreshing.

57
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,440
This is amazing.

58
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,650
I haven't seen butterflies
for 30 years.

59
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,290
- It's been so long.
- And, So Min,

60
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,650
you should stand in the middle.

61
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,350
- Good. Let's do that.
- Come here.

62
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,610
We should have the girls
in the middle.

63
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,550
They wanted to stay in a corner.

64
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,290
Why are you being like this?

65
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,030
- Just stand there.
- Did I push you away?

66
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,190
Let them stay in the middle.

67
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,190
What are you talking about?

68
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,220
How many crew members
did you bring today?

69
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,890
- How many people do you have?
- He brought a lot.

70
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,540
- He's a celebrity.
- I wanted...

71
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,840
All the crew members are lying down.

72
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
They are his subscribers.

73
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,750
- Ji Subscribers.
- His subscribers.

74
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,140
- Ji Subscribers.
- They are tenacious.

75
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,970
- How tenacious.
- Tenacious subscribers.

76
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,070
What? Hang on.

77
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,140
- What?
- Yun Sang is still here.

78
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,040
I bet Kwang Soo is coming.

79
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,190
- What is Yun Sang doing here?
- Is Kwang Soo today's guest?

80
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,350
- Is Kwang Soo coming?
- Yun Sang is here.

81
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,530
- I know.
- Who are you in charge of?

82
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,600
I just shoot the scenery.

83
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,760
- He sounds so sad.
- The insert shot.

84
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,290
- He's shooting the insert shots.
- Oh, no.

85
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,760
That's nice.

86
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,570
So what are we doing today?

87
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,260
- It's fun to talk here, right?
- Yes.

88
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,260
A lot of comments online...

89
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,170
of fans of Running Man say...

90
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,250
that the opening is fun because
the members have good chemistry.

91
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,510
They say they'd watch our show
even if you just talk all day.

92
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,910
- Seriously?
- So we are going...

93
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,540
to see it through to the end.

94
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,850
Really? Are we
going to talk all day?

95
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,120
In order to reflect
the opinions of our viewers...

96
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,630
and let you chatter
as much as you want,

97
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,030
- I'd love that.
- we planned The Day for Chattering.

98
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,130
That sounds great.

99
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,390
- We're supposed to talk.
- That's what we're doing.

100
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,970
We often liken chattering
to dried young pollack.

101
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,130
- That's right.
- Right.

102
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,130
Actually, we're not supposed...

103
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,070
- to catch too many young pollacks.
- I see.

104
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,640
So we prepared dried pollack
instead of young pollack.

105
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,010
- I love dried pollack.
- It tastes good.

106
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,640
- It's good with mayonnaise.
- We often call it young pollack,

107
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,910
but it's actually dried pollack.

108
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,250
And you will be receiving...

109
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,120
- 100 dried pollacks today.
- I see.

110
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,980
You are to go around good places
to have a talk with no break,

111
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,390
and we will deduct
two dried pollacks every 10 minutes.

112
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,390
(2 dried pollacks will be deducted
every 10 minutes.)

113
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,630
All we need is So Min and Suk Jin.

114
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,130
- And we have Jae Suk.
- If you manage to deduct...

115
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,730
all the dried pollacks by 3 p.m.,

116
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,410
you can go home
without getting a penalty.

117
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,730
But if you fail,
two of you will get a penalty.

118
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,380
The number of members to get
a penalty increases every hour.

119
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,540
So what you mean by chattering...

120
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,810
There are various topics.

121
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,100
Will you give us a specific subject?

122
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,440
You can talk about what you like,
and we will also give you a topic.

123
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,620
- Really?
- Yes.

124
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,620
I realized something last week.

125
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,640
The selfie stick makes me
keep talking. Seriously.

126
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,620
He was excited because
he was getting a lot of subscribers.

127
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,080
- It's not like that.
- Good for you.

128
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,950
- I'm serious.
- He's good.

129
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,890
So I'd like you to talk
as much as you can until 3 p.m...

130
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,960
- to get rid of them all.
- Okay.

131
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,300
If you are silent
for over 10 seconds,

132
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,370
you will gain
two additional dried pollacks.

133
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,010
- For 10 seconds?
- We shouldn't stop talking.

134
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,310
- We shouldn't keep silent.
- I don't like it...

135
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,180
when I'm forced to talk though.

136
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,180
- We have no choice.
- Against my will.

137
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,140
You can also get rid of
more dried pollacks...

138
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,880
by completing additional missions
every 30 minutes.

139
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,420
You can also get rid of
dried pollacks by eating them.

140
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,010
- Let's eat.
- We should eat them.

141
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,450
- We can eat them.
- Grill the pollacks for us.

142
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,950
Hyung Gu, are you done
working as a producer?

143
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,690
He's just...

144
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,430
- He's good though.
- Hyung Gu, do you like it better?

145
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,090
Aren't you here
to learn about editing videos?

146
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,690
My dad is a big fan of you.

147
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,500
(Thank you.)

148
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,740
That's what he got from So Min.

149
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,330
- He's wearing it.
- He got the mask from So Min.

150
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,830
It has So Min's autograph on it.

151
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,680
- He got it from fans.
- I see.

152
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
All right.

153
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,840
Time is ticking.

154
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,310
- You can have a seat now.
- Okay.

155
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,400
- Can we sit?
- Who wants a dried pollack?

156
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,550
So this is dried pollack.

157
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,770
- Who wants a multigrain shake?
- They are dried pollacks.

158
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,840
I want a multigrain shake.

159
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,510
Do we have some sauce
like mayonnaise...

160
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,880
- We will bring them to you.
- soy sauce, and peppers?

161
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,230
It tastes better
with some sesami oil, right?

162
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,080
Does this count too?

163
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,190
You should go talk over there.

164
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,890
Okay.

165
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,070
- This is nice.
- My gosh.

166
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,170
There's a multigrain shake.

167
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,570
Can we eat this, sir?

168
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,960
Yes. It's all for you.

169
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,330
Who wants a multigrain shake?

170
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,810
- Me. I want it.
- I like multigrain shakes.

171
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,530
This is a multigrain shake.

172
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,030
It's thick, right? Is it good?

173
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,380
Jae Suk, have some.

174
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,940
Thank you.

175
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,270
You're welcome.

176
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,700
- I want a multigrain shake too.
- The multigrain shake you serve...

177
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,270
- looks like a protein shake.
- Get me some multigrain shakes.

178
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,920
- Do you like the multigrain shake?
- I want a multigrain shake.

179
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
It's like a protein shake.

180
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,190
This is really...

181
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,210
This is place is good to run around.

182
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,120
By the way, this place is...

183
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,580
- Kids will love this place.
- This is so relaxing.

184
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,280
There are butterflies flying around.

185
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,930
- We need to see something green.
- I've...

186
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,560
never seen
so many butterflies before.

187
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,870
- It's beautiful.
- Isn't this interesting?

188
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,300
When I was young, I didn't
like places like this.

189
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,000
- Me neither.
- I know, right?

190
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,370
- I hated it.
- I was...

191
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,530
- I really hated it.
- My dad was...

192
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,900
See? I can't stop talking.

193
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,010
This is what
those who like to talk look like.

194
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,120
- After seeing some butterflies...
- I know.

195
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,250
Once I see something,

196
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,990
I can keep talking about it.

197
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,640
So...

198
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,210
- I don't say anything useless.
- What?

199
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,320
I just say fun things
only when they are needed.

200
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,430
Suk Jin is the best...

201
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,950
- when it comes to sedentary work.
- He's the best.

202
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,430
- That's not true.
- He's the Catch-Rats guy.

203
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,570
- When the cameras are on,
- The Catch-Rats guy.

204
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,500
Suk Jin doesn't have many things...

205
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,740
to talk about.

206
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,000
- I can talk about everyday life.
- He's only interested...

207
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,010
in real estate, stocks,
and investments.

208
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,740
We can also talk about
real estate here.

209
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,510
Or he just gossips...

210
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,380
about celebrities
who are going through hard times.

211
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,250
- That's all he can talk about.
- That's not true.

212
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,070
- And he talks about his past.
- I know.

213
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,420
- He can talk about the past.
- Right.

214
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,190
- Tell us about your past.
- Let's do that.

215
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,690
Tell us what it was like
when you were younger.

216
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,260
- When you were popular.
- Hey.

217
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,510
- Your prime time.
- Honestly...

218
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,780
I cried when Suk Jin told me
about his past love.

219
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,820
- Hey.
- Really?

220
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,190
Did you believe what he said?

221
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,320
Isn't that true?

222
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,320
- I'll tell you if it's true or not.
- I'm...

223
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,890
- Let's see.
- Actually, when I was younger,

224
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,670
women chased me around.

225
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,000
- I'm serious.
- That's a lie.

226
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,630
- Tell us more about it.
- I was on a bus.

227
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,700
Someone touched me.

228
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,330
We didn't have
cell phones back then.

229
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,940
She said, "Excuse me."
This is a true story.

230
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,140
By the way,

231
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,140
while he's talking...

232
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,440
- How could you...
- What's wrong?

233
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,920
Do you own this hut?

234
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,690
We can be free these days.

235
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,560
- This isn't about being free.
- You don't have to worry.

236
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,450
- You can't show off your feet.
- This is free.

237
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,880
- We don't want to see your feet.
- Can he show the sole of his feet?

238
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,590
- Why would you zoom in?
- We should be free.

239
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,500
Why would you zoom in on his feet?

240
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,670
We can be free.

241
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,960
It never happened to you, right?

242
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,890
A woman asking for your number.

243
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,960
- Gosh, Suk Jin.
- Yes?

244
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,700
- It never happened, did it?
- Gosh.

245
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,700
- There's no need to say.
- When you were unknown.

246
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,810
Haha can't say a word.

247
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,130
It did happen to Haha.

248
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,680
- I bet it happened a lot.
- It was a long time ago.

249
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,380
When he touted for business
on the street in Itaewon.

250
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,900
- On the street?
- Is he from the street?

251
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,820
- He's from the street.
- The street!

252
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,990
- I just did it twice.
- Hey, Haha.

253
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,080
- If it was twice...
- I did it for Geun Sik.

254
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,510
Hey, that's enough. Stop that.

255
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,320
You shouldn't be ashamed of that.

256
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,060
- It's okay.
- It's something cool.

257
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,280
- You just shamed him.
- Se Chan is...

258
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,060
Surprisingly, Se Chan is...

259
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,000
quite popular with comediennes.

260
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,070
- He's popular.
- Right.

261
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,500
That's not true.
There aren't many comediennes.

262
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,940
Is it true that there was something
going on between Do Yeon and you?

263
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,240
No, it wasn't like that. Actually,

264
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,530
Yong Jin and Do Yeon had
something going on.

265
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,240
- Right. It was Yong Jin.
- There was something.

266
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,330
Nothing happened between me and her.

267
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,510
- With Do Yeon?
- Nothing.

268
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,480
Yong Jin is your close friend.

269
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,580
So you can't do
anything about Do Yeon.

270
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,580
And it's not just that.

271
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,980
Before that, Na Rae said...

272
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,580
she had feelings for me.

273
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,510
- She told everyone.
- Right. She announced it.

274
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,460
She'd attack anyone
who approaches me.

275
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,310
So no one could ask me out.

276
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,460
- I see.
- He's really popular.

277
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,760
Se Chan is popular with girls.

278
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,600
This is from a long time ago,

279
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,830
but did you have feelings
for Eun Hye when we did "X-Man"?

280
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,830
My goodness.

281
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,030
(They can't talk about the past
without mentioning her name.)

282
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,260
Stop talking about her!

283
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,790
That's enough!

284
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,260
Don't say that.

285
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,610
- I told you not to talk about her.
- I want to know.

286
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,340
That's enough. Stop it now.

287
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,580
- You're finally sitting up.
- Don't say that.

288
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,980
- I'm curious as a viewer.
- That's enough.

289
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,270
Stop it. Don't say that.

290
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,480
- I saw it only on TV.
- Just don't say that.

291
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,750
- Aren't you curious?
- Enough.

292
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,750
By the way,

293
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,460
you were really popular
when you were doing "X-Man".

294
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,260
- I was very popular.
- Right?

295
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,020
(I was very popular.)

296
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,260
I heard that
he was popular back then.

297
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,730
(This is when he says
he was very popular.)

298
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,200
(It's hard to believe
that he was popular back then.)

299
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,870
- I was very popular.
- Right?

300
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,530
I heard that
he was popular back then.

301
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,970
There was a girl...

302
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,430
- who had a crush on her.
- That can't be true.

303
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,510
It's true.

304
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,530
- Jae Suk.
- She really liked him.

305
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,580
- It's not like that.
- So...

306
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,270
you went out with her.

307
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,170
There was a show...

308
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,850
- called "Fort Boyard".
- Exactly.

309
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,180
She told me that
when I was doing the show.

310
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,460
She always said
that you were her ideal type.

311
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,620
We expect...

312
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,380
this to be cut off, right?

313
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,590
- But they don't cut it off.
- They don't.

314
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,680
It's okay.

315
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,500
- Don't cut it off.
- This is true.

316
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,200
- Can I tell you something shocking?
- What?

317
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,560
(Something shocking?)

318
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,660
- What is it?
- A girl group member liked you.

319
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,740
- Me?
- Yes.

320
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,000
- Me?
- Seriously?

321
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,470
She was a close friend of mine.

322
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,480
She was serious.

323
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,930
She's married now,
so I can't tell you.

324
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,480
I heard that a lot,

325
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,670
but no one ever asked me out.

326
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,640
- She had a huge crush on you.
- Really? That's hard to believe.

327
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,880
He looks...

328
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,760
- like a decent guy now.
- Right.

329
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,010
But when he did "Kungkungtta",

330
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,360
he was a little like a delinquent.

331
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,050
Just a little.

332
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,730
- That's true.
- He was...

333
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,260
- Hey.
- I mean...

334
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,600
Just this much.

335
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,630
- Be honest. It's true, isn't it?
- Back then,

336
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,060
he used to smoke back then.

337
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,160
Really?

338
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,530
- Back then...
- Did Jae Suk smoke?

339
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,710
He used to smoke
with his colleagues after work.

340
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,400
Actually, Jae Suk made...

341
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,710
good smoke rings back then.

342
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,770
(He even had some skills.)

343
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,250
I could even...

344
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,580
make small smoke rings.

345
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,170
- It's hard to believe.
- But...

346
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,510
we have many young viewers...

347
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,910
who are watching this.

348
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,760
- Smoking is a bad habit.
- It's bad.

349
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,810
- That's why he quit smoking.
- He quit a long time ago.

350
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,990
I quit smoking...

351
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,150
- after I started this show.
- That's right.

352
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,260
And do you know
"X-Man" is on air now?

353
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,260
- Really?
- Seriously?

354
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,260
- "X-Man" is on air now.
- I watch it.

355
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,130
- Is it on air?
- Yes.

356
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,790
This is what
Jong Kook did back then.

357
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,700
He just smiled.

358
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,160
He acted like a prince.

359
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,210
Is he G-DRAGON or what?

360
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,900
(He just put on a serious look.)

361
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,670
(What else can I do?)

362
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,750
(He was a tough man
who didn't say more than a word.)

363
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,640
I didn't know Jong Kook
was so talkative back then.

364
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,350
Why have you become so talkative?

365
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,680
- He is so talkative now.
- I didn't like to talk.

366
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,910
- He was always like that.
- Jong Kook is...

367
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,380
- talkative. He likes to talk.
- He's really talkative.

368
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,020
I like to talk
when the cameras are off.

369
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,330
He's shy of strangers.

370
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,050
But I couldn't do it
when the cameras were on.

371
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,970
Is that when Haha became famous?

372
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,160
- That's when he became famous.
- Right.

373
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,100
- By copying him?
- He tried to copy me.

374
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,890
(They even stand in the same pose.)

375
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,370
(This is when
their relationship began.)

376
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,400
(Haha and his friends
tried to copy Jong Kook.)

377
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,140
(He practiced the dance moves
of Turbo's songs instead of his.)

378
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,580
- He was a copycat.
- I copied him.

379
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,910
- I wasn't a copycat though.
- Weren't you a copycat?

380
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,750
- Just don't call me a copycat.
- It's different.

381
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,620
- You were a copycat.
- I just tried to copy him.

382
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,910
You were a copycat from the street.

383
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,880
It's true that you were a copycat
from the street.

384
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,700
- From the street?
- Don't call him like that.

385
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,130
A copycat from the street?

386
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,890
A copycat from the street?

387
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,260
Hey, Ji Hyo.

388
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,630
What were you doing back then?

389
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,470
Was it when you shoot
"Whispering Corridors"?

390
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,530
It was 2002 or 2003.

391
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,080
I'm finally telling you
about Ji Hyo now.

392
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,210
Before Ji Hyo joined Running Man,

393
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,800
she was a guest...

394
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,400
- That's right.
- on "Family Outing".

395
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,770
(Ji Hyo was a guest
on "Family Outing".)

396
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,010
I brought some dried pollacks.

397
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,680
(It's interesting that she brought
dried pollacks when they first met.)

398
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,150
- Dried pollacks, not flowers?
- Right.

399
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,650
(That's how
the dried pollack universe began.)

400
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:50,200
We went out of town
early in the morning,

401
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,760
so we were very tired.

402
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,730
- And the guests felt very nervous.
- Right.

403
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,700
So I told Ji Hyo
to go get some rest.

404
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,110
- And she said yes.
- Did she lie down?

405
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,260
But she didn't come back
when we started the shoot.

406
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,240
I said, "Where's Ji Hyo?"

407
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,450
No one knew where she was.

408
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
Were you asleep?

409
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,670
And I found her...

410
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,670
- snoring in the next room.
- You're unbelievable.

411
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,720
- She even slept dressed as a ghost.
- I know.

412
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,280
She even slept in a ghost costume.

413
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,620
Did the producer of "Family Outing"
direct Running Man?

414
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,090
- Yes.
- It was Hyo Jin.

415
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,830
- We had several candidates,
- Right.

416
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:26,000
but our crew members
found Ji Hyo very impressive.

417
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,330
That's how Ji Hyo joined our show.

418
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,760
It was because of "Family Outing".

419
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,560
Was Suk Jin one of the candidates?

420
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,400
- Suk Jin was...
- How did he join our show?

421
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,510
- Was he a candidate?
- Can I tell you about him?

422
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,610
Yes, please.

423
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,170
- Can I?
- Go ahead and tell us.

424
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,480
- What's the behind story?
- Among all the candidates...

425
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Tell us. Let's see how it's
different from what I know.

426
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
It's been 11 years.

427
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Let me tell you then.

428
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,810
I'll just tell you the situation.

429
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,750
The crew members cast the members.

430
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,810
- Right.
- But...

431
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,510
- sometimes they ask my opinion.
- I see.

432
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,050
Back then, Hyo Jin asked me.

433
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,920
"Jae Suk, what do you
think of Suk Jin?"

434
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,000
- He brought it up first.
- Right.

435
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,100
The director mentioned
his name first.

436
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,500
He pulled out the sword.

437
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,000
I was surprised that Suk Jin was...

438
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,470
- one of the candidates.
- Surprised?

439
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,060
You didn't mention his name?

440
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,530
It's not that you mentioned
his name first.

441
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,400
- You didn't say Suk Jin's name?
- Because...

442
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,930
he was my close friend, so...

443
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,770
- You punk.
- I'm just curious.

444
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,080
Back then, I hesitated...

445
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,170
to join this show.

446
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,720
- That's true.
- I'm serious.

447
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,590
- Back then...
- Were you doing "Star Golden Bell"?

448
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,620
I was doing
"Star Golden Bell" back then.

449
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,990
- I was doing a lot of TV shows.
- So...

450
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,260
One of the names
Hyo Jin mentioned was...

451
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,760
- Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo.

452
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,680
- I met Kwang Soo on "Come to Play".
- Right.

453
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,200
That's where I met him.

454
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,370
When I met Kwang Soo
on "Come to Play",

455
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,870
- he was really good.
- Really?

456
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,970
When Hyo Jin mentioned his name,

457
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,390
I said, "I've worked
with him before."

458
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,030
"I think he's really good."

459
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,610
- "I'm not sure though."
- I see.

460
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,580
"Then what about Suk Jin?"

461
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,580
Suk Jin is...

462
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,380
- my close friend.
- Right.

463
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,250
- So I was...
- I was rather...

464
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,670
- He must've been uncomfortable.
- It could be uncomfortable.

465
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,880
To be honest,
I hesitated because of him.

466
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,640
I don't want you to butt in
when I talk.

467
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,090
- Why do you keep cutting in?
- You can't talk alone.

468
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,090
Are you the only one to talk?

469
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,550
- My gosh. He just...
- I was into it.

470
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,630
- Hang on.
- I was into his story.

471
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,990
- I can't go on if he keeps this up.
- But suddenly...

472
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,920
- Come on. Tell us.
- Come back, Jae Suk.

473
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,460
- Please tell us the story.
- Jae Suk, I'm sorry.

474
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,790
- Please.
- Don't be mad.

475
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,130
- I mean...
- What's the matter?

476
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,160
- Was it supposed to continue?
- It's not like that.

477
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,740
- Of course...
- I was falling...

478
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,060
- Exactly.
- into his story and you ruined it.

479
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,030
- It was so interesting.
- Gosh, seriously.

480
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,160
Jae Suk, don't be mad.

481
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,840
- All right.
- You all know the truth, don't you?

482
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,040
It feels as if I woke up
in the middle of a good dream.

483
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,850
If this were a YouTube video,
it would've been a commercial break.

484
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,080
- The second part begins.
- Gosh.

485
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
- What's wrong with you, Suk Jin?
- So what happened, Jae Suk?

486
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,490
You see, some viewers might think...

487
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,810
that I recommended Suk Jin...

488
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,420
- Right. Some might think that way.
- because we're close friends.

489
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,920
- No, I didn't need his help then.
- Come on.

490
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,960
Gosh, seriously!

491
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,830
I was enjoying his story.

492
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,460
That's not true. I don't want anyone
to get the wrong idea.

493
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,700
- My position was...
- Hey, there's a four-leaf clover.

494
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,230
- Suk Jin, can you pick it for me?
- Hurry. Go on now.

495
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,160
(A lucky 4-leaf clover?)

496
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,510
- Where? Here?
- Over here.

497
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,510
(Seok Sam plays along
with any joke.)

498
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,630
- So what happened?
- He's looking for it.

499
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,670
Continue.

500
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,580
- Tell us.
- So...

501
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,670
- But still...
- Yes?

502
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,170
(He continues telling the story
while Suk Jin is gone.)

503
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,880
- I couldn't disapprove of him.
- Right.

504
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,950
That would've been weird as well.

505
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:58,950
- Of course.
- Listen. I was...

506
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,120
I wasn't sure
about joining the show either.

507
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,250
Mister, the four-leaf clover...

508
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,250
- is right behind you.
- We'll hear your side later.

509
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,310
- I contemplated...
- We'll hear his side first.

510
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,490
- because of him.
- There's a butterfly over there.

511
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,390
- Over there.
- So I told them what I thought...

512
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,870
(Chasing a butterfly at the age
where one grows fond of nature)

513
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,370
trying to be as objective
and cool-headed as I could.

514
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,340
- From an objective perspective.
- I told them my honest opinion...

515
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,160
saying that I wasn't sure
if it would work out well.

516
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,580
- I told them about his strengths...
- Yes.

517
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,110
- as well as weaknesses.
- That's great.

518
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,750
- I told them both.
- No one must know this story.

519
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,880
- Come on. Tell us.
- Please tell us.

520
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,310
- I'm so curious.
- His strengths and weaknesses.

521
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:33,450
First, Suk Jin is good with words.

522
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,950
- True.
- And he's funny.

523
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,550
- He's funny.
- And...

524
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,360
- he's generally a friendly person,
- Yes.

525
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,920
so when he works as a team,

526
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,960
- He gets along well with others.
- he gets along with no problems.

527
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,730
- He blends in well. That's it.
- Yes.

528
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,830
However, his weakness is...

529
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,160
(However, his weakness is...)

530
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,740
- He was a solo host on many shows.
- True.

531
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,970
Although he's a friendly person,

532
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,430
he might get stressed out
because he wouldn't get...

533
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,930
the spotlight all to himself.

534
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,250
That's absolutely true.

535
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,300
- Absolutely true.
- He hates sharing the spotlight.

536
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,720
He used to be
a little authoritative.

537
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,450
He didn't like being friendly
with his junior entertainers.

538
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,910
- Did you want all the attention?
- I mean...

539
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,990
- I can't deny that.
- He couldn't work on a team.

540
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,260
- I was bossy back then.
- Right?

541
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,350
- I was bossy.
- Yes, he was.

542
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,490
Now I hang out
with my junior entertainers...

543
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,580
after a shoot,
but back then, I didn't like it.

544
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,930
- True. He didn't even look at us.
- Yes, but... What?

545
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,520
So what's your side of the story?
How did you get the offer?

546
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,090
Of course,
they gave me an official offer.

547
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,060
- How else would they have done it?
- I mean...

548
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,170
- My gosh.
- How else?

549
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,480
- Why would you get upset?
- Why would you get angry at him?

550
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,770
- Gosh. I heard you were friendly.
- I was just asking...

551
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,410
- Why would you get upset?
- His intention is annoying.

552
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,010
I had no intention.
I was just curious.

553
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,070
Your intention is annoying.

554
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,070
Since Suk Jin was more of an MC
rather than an entertainer,

555
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,780
I asked if he was cost-hosting
with Jae Suk.

556
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,050
Then the director said, "Gosh, no."

557
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,110
(The main director said,
"Gosh, no.")

558
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,260
- Did he really say that?
- "That won't work."

559
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,780
- Did he, really?
- You know that, right?

560
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,460
"Gosh, no."

561
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,520
"That won't work."

562
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,700
I clearly remember it.

563
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,000
- You see, I...
- Why doesn't Suk Jin jump in...

564
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,500
at the right time
as he said he would?

565
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,940
- Well... Yes.
- I was... What?

566
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,470
You told me not to interrupt,
you punk!

567
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,830
Why would you yell at me?

568
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,560
- I can't go on like this.
- That's not cool.

569
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,180
- He's too much. I'm scared.
- What was that?

570
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,180
Let me explain.

571
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,180
I hadn't been on a variety show
like this before.

572
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,040
- Stop frowning, will you?
- It's not like that.

573
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,510
- The sunlight hurts my eyes.
- Is that so?

574
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,770
- It's because of the sun. Okay?
- Okay.

575
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,110
- It's because of the sun. Okay?
- Okay.

576
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,420
(He made a fake smile
as Jong Kook complained.)

577
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,080
- It's because of the sun.
- The sun...

578
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,890
- Don't do that.
- No, no.

579
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,230
- This won't work because of him.
- Why would it hurt your eyes?

580
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,260
- It's because of the sun.
- You're sitting...

581
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,900
- in the shade.
- He keeps yelling. What's this?

582
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,260
- He's upset.
- Come on.

583
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,200
- That's not true.
- You keep yelling at us.

584
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,670
- Exactly. This is...
- By the way...

585
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,240
I didn't realize how important
teamwork was...

586
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
because I hadn't been
on a show like this before that.

587
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,910
I used to go straight home
after a shoot.

588
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,570
Do you know what I regret the most?

589
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,070
- This is what really happened.
- Okay.

590
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,250
- Jong Kook and Haha,
- Yes.

591
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,600
you guys called me at 5 a.m.

592
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,750
- Me too?
- I lived in Cheongdam-dong then.

593
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,980
- I was almost home.
- Yes.

594
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,310
You guys asked me to eat breakfast
with you.

595
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,580
- At 5 a.m.
- Right.

596
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,780
But I said I was too tired
and just went home.

597
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,290
- And I regret it greatly now.
- Suk Jin, I remember that.

598
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,320
- I remember it as well.
- It was...

599
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,700
- When we called you at 5 a.m...
- Yes.

600
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,730
You remember it, don't you?

601
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,260
I knew that you hated me...

602
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,170
- It's all in the past now.
- Yes, it's all in the past.

603
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,470
Suk Jin was hurt a little
at the time.

604
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,680
- That's right.
- So...

605
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,100
- he complained about many of us.
- It was quite intense.

606
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,750
- But I realized that I was wrong.
- And...

607
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,070
- He talked about Haha too.
- That's right.

608
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,150
- This is what he said about Haha.
- Yes.

609
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,840
"That little punk
won't stop acting up."

610
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,990
(They finally tell each other
how they really felt 11 years ago.)

611
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,550
- Also, back then...
- That's so cute.

612
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,820
I was playing the role of someone...

613
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,120
- who teased another member...
- That's true.

614
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,400
and made the others tease him
with me.

615
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,970
- When someone teased him,
- But it wasn't so bad.

616
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,900
if I giggled,
he would glare at me like this.

617
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,060
(Glaring)

618
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,330
- He looked so scary.
- You see,

619
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,470
I'd like to apologize to Haha...

620
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,510
because it was all my fault.
I know that now.

621
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,270
- I was too bossy.
- That's so funny.

622
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,870
- You couldn't open up your heart.
- Exactly.

623
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,980
- I didn't realize...
- People usually don't change.

624
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,070
I had a similar experience to that.

625
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,510
- Really?
- In the early years...

626
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,420
when you guys got together
quite often,

627
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,190
I never...

628
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,490
- joined you guys.
- You never joined us.

629
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,400
Kwang Soo called me several times...

630
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,460
to ask me to come out
to meet you all.

631
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,740
But I got the wrong idea.
I thought that Kwang Soo...

632
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,470
was hitting on me.

633
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,800
(She thought he was hitting on her.)

634
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,740
He called me to ask me
to come out so often.

635
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,370
- I see why she thought that way.
- That's understandable.

636
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,100
- That's understandable.
- Right.

637
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,180
I get it.

638
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,840
- I see.
- That's understandable.

639
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,010
- That's so funny.
- That's hilarious.

640
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,650
- That's understandable.
- I was so annoyed.

641
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,490
- I told him to stop calling me.
- That's so funny.

642
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,780
And I hung up.

643
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,080
- He really stopped calling me.
- Oh, I see.

644
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,780
Anyway, what's important is,
Ji Hyo...

645
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,320
that they didn't get together
so often.

646
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,900
And I didn't meet with them
often either.

647
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,400
- That's true.
- Yes.

648
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,360
- You were too busy then.
- Jong Kook likes to meet friends.

649
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,360
Yes, I do like that.

650
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,530
- Here we go, here we go
- Here we go

651
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,910
- Also, Jae Suk...
- He likes to gather with friends.

652
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,530
Whenever we walked down Garosu-gil,
we walked in single file.

653
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,010
Why?

654
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,340
- "We are one."
- Exactly. "We are one."

655
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,750
- I see.
- We always walked in a single file.

656
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,180
Jong Kook likes
doing things like that.

657
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,490
- I was even worse back then.
- Are you serious?

658
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,780
- I was...
- "Today's dress code is black."

659
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,960
- We had to wear black clothes.
- You had a dress code too?

660
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,550
I liked hanging out with them
as a leader.

661
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,580
- Jong Kook would hold...
- Right.

662
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,020
- an Americano in one hand,
- Exactly.

663
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,960
- and chicken breast in the other.
- That's right.

664
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,550
(Americano in 1 hand
and chicken breast in the other)

665
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,000
(Walking around cheerfully)

666
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,470
- Exactly.
- That's how exactly he looked.

667
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,600
- Yes, that's right. Exactly.
- Right?

668
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,210
- Behind him...
- Ladies and gentlemen,

669
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,910
- please don't get me wrong.
- Behind him...

670
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,870
It's not that I went to Garosu-gil
carrying coffee and food like that.

671
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,510
- Right.
- The gym I went to was there.

672
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,800
- It was right across the street.
- It was fun.

673
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,610
We came this far
starting with Suk Jin's story.

674
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,810
- I didn't think of teamwork.
- That's why...

675
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,510
- Suk Jin was...
- By the way, the exact time...

676
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,160
when Suk Jin became
more enthusiastic was...

677
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,490
- after our overseas fan event.
- Exactly.

678
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,020
- To be honest...
- That's true.

679
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,350
- Only we knew about this.
- Absolutely true.

680
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,760
- He changed his attitude...
- That's right.

681
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,530
- after our overseas fan event.
- Yes.

682
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,640
- Why do I feel embarrassed?
- Our first overseas fan event...

683
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,640
- In fact, in Running Man's history,
- True.

684
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,180
- there were a few turning points.
- That's right.

685
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,180
That's true.

686
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,770
- We were...
- The shoot in Thailand.

687
00:21:58,770 --> 00:21:59,980
- I'll be honest.
- The shoot in Thailand.

688
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,510
"Infinite Challenge" had
turning points as well.

689
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,110
- True.
- The show could've ended.

690
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,310
- True.
- What I'm saying is...

691
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,920
- We tried not to get our hopes up.
- It costs a lot for one episode.

692
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,490
- That's true.
- From the network's perspective,

693
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,780
they invest a large sum of money
to shoot the show...

694
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,390
- expecting to make a profit...
- Yes.

695
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,500
so they can continue to shoot
the show.

696
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,700
- Exactly.
- Or else, it's not possible.

697
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,590
- It must be profitable.
- When we went to Thailand...

698
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,790
- Yes.
- Yes.

699
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,200
- We were surprised.
- We were really surprised.

700
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,860
- We were all discouraged.
- It's because...

701
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,740
the week before that shoot,

702
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,470
- Our show was going to end soon.
- we heard that our show would end.

703
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,270
- We didn't have any expectations.
- So I said,

704
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,370
"We're going to pour out
everything we have..."

705
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,770
"since this will be our last shoot."

706
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,770
The director said,
"Yes. You did your best."

707
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,310
"It's okay even
if it doesn't work out."

708
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,420
But when we arrived...

709
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,650
At first, I thought it was
a hidden camera prank.

710
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,150
- At the airport?
- Yes.

711
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,850
- We were so surprised.
- I thought it was a prank.

712
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,580
(July 3, 2011,
Running Man, Episode 50)

713
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,090
(The cast and staff members
didn't have any expectations.)

714
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,640
(But as the cast members arrived,
they saw...)

715
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,760
(the Thai fans
who filled the airport.)

716
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,370
Hey, this is...

717
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,010
(The Thai fans' unexpected
and passionate welcome...)

718
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,650
(surprised the cast
and staff members.)

719
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,610
So many people are... Oh, hello.

720
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,320
(A great number of fans gathered
to greet the cast members.)

721
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,460
(Could this be
a hidden camera prank?)

722
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,230
(This is how popular
Running Man is.)

723
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,850
Isn't this a prank?

724
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,200
I'm puzzled right now.

725
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,440
(They were discouraged
thinking the show would end.)

726
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,760
(But the foreign fans encouraged
and cheered them up greatly.)

727
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,910
(Oh, this is... My goodness.)

728
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:42,100
(Who made this happen?)

729
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,840
(Oh, wow. This is incredible.
It's hard to believe.)

730
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,510
(The foreign fans' passionate love
still touches their hearts.)

731
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,810
We were all so surprised.

732
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,810
- I thought it was a prank.
- I don't know how this might sound.

733
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,780
Obviously, we're very grateful
for our Korean fans.

734
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,700
But we're even more grateful
for our foreign fans.

735
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,790
We're incredibly grateful for them.

736
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,730
- We were able to continue...
- Absolutely.

737
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,290
- the show because of them.
- Yes.

738
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,200
I thought that an idol singer was
behind us.

739
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,590
I thought the same thing.

740
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,510
- But we saw our names on the signs.
- We didn't think they came...

741
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,740
- to see us.
- It made me start crying.

742
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,100
We didn't think they came
to see us...

743
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,480
because there were
more than 1,000 people there.

744
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,250
- After the shoot in Thailand,
- It was so touching.

745
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,720
we all got Botox shots
and skin treatment.

746
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,310
(He became more emotional
than the others.)

747
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,690
- We all started losing weight.
- We started changing greatly.

748
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,960
We all started
social media accounts.

749
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,260
I don't know if I'm right,

750
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,490
but Suk Jin changed a lot
after that.

751
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,520
- Really?
- He changed a lot.

752
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,120
Since I realized
that we had so many fans overseas...

753
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,320
who were watching our show,

754
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,590
I felt a sense of responsibility
on my shoulders. That's why.

755
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,740
I thought I should work harder.

756
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,240
- Did someone hop on your shoulders?
- Yes.

757
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,360
I felt all that attention
on my shoulders.

758
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,800
Are you carrying all your fans
on your shoulders?

759
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,480
I felt a sense of responsibility
and thought I should work harder.

760
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,770
I actually thought
that I could burden everyone.

761
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,010
You hated being called Big Nose,
didn't you?

762
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,480
But at every concert,
he would scream, "Big",

763
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,420
and his fans would scream "Nose".

764
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,040
- That was so funny.
- That was the worst.

765
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,390
That was the funniest thing.

766
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,760
- That was the worst.
- "I say 'Big',"

767
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,160
- "you say, 'Nose'!"
- "You say, 'Nose'!"

768
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,660
- "Big! Nose!"
- "Nose!"

769
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,400
- "Big! Nose!"
- He's the worst.

770
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,200
- Right.
- That was so hilarious.

771
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,400
I laughed so hard.

772
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,730
- They said "nose" in Thai.
- Right.

773
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,760
- Now...
- By the way,

774
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,640
- you can say...
- Now...

775
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,260
(Now...)

776
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,600
(They won't stop chattering,
ignoring what the director says.)

777
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,980
Shut it.
We're having a conversation here.

778
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,980
- You told us to chat.
- Right. Shut it.

779
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,070
- We're doing this for the show.
- Why would you interrupt us?

780
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,750
- Just shut it so we can chat!
- Be quiet.

781
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,870
- You told us to have a chat.
- So we can eat while chatting.

782
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,810
- Stop it.
- Are we doing it right?

783
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,190
- All right.
- Please give us some.

784
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,690
You know... Well...

785
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,280
- I forgot what I was saying...
- Right.

786
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,550
- because of you.
- Why did you make him forget?

787
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,890
We were having so much fun.

788
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,260
What were we talking about?

789
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,930
- Big Nose.
- That's right. Big Nose.

790
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:39,020
He didn't like the nickname
but he changed his attitude.

791
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,730
- We were saying it was funny.
- Right. I remember now.

792
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,360
- Are we doing it right?
- Hey.

793
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
(Big Nose, once dreamed of becoming
a world star)

794
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,290
Can you give us some pollacks
so we can eat while chatting?

795
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,440
- We'll give you some if you want.
- Please give us some.

796
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,070
- So the adequate amount...
- It happened a lot back then.

797
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,570
Guys, the staff members are starting
to look bored.

798
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,840
What's wrong?

799
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,450
- Why? We're chatting.
- Just don't say anything!

800
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,340
- Let us have a chat comfortably.
- This is a realistic chat.

801
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,490
- Of course.
- It's so interesting.

802
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,650
A real chat!

803
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,650
- All right?
- Exactly.

804
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,260
- A real chat!
- This is a real chat.

805
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,890
- That's right.
- Our food is here.

806
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,280
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

807
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,290
- Thank you. Oh, my.
- We should eat some.

808
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,400
- Oh, wow.
- Thank you.

809
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,700
- They added spicy chili.
- Actually...

810
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,820
Actually, this is
a very good place...

811
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,530
to have a nice, long chat.

812
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,260
- And it's so cool here.
- It's really sunny today,

813
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,010
- Exactly.
- but we're under the shade.

814
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,910
We get to enjoy
a picturesque view as well.

815
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,910
(The chatting paradise)

816
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,770
By the way, I like the way
things are these days...

817
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,070
Back in the days...
I mean there are...

818
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,180
many young directors these days.

819
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,890
You know, these days, so-called...

820
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,490
- He's excited.
- Well...

821
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,990
Jae Suk is so excited right now.

822
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,550
- Like "Three Meals for Jae Suk"...
- All right. Then...

823
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,390
This is just like
"Three Meals for Jae Suk". Come on.

824
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,080
- I...
- Take it easy.

825
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,460
I talked about product placement
with Bo Pil this morning.

826
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:52,900
(Korea's best MC's opinion
on product placement)

827
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,100
That's right.

828
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,770
I mean it's just our job.
We're human just like everyone else.

829
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,800
Although I have never met
So Min's father...

830
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,250
The air quality was
a little bad in the morning.

831
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,610
I feel so relaxed.

832
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,780
- Jae Suk, wait. Listen to me.
- But I think...

833
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,510
- He won't stop talking.
- Jae Suk, come here.

834
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,110
How many more places will we visit?

835
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,850
I'm sorry, but at least three of us
are already tired.

836
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,780
Later, we can...

837
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,790
(Their ears hurt now.)

838
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,790
Not me.

839
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,760
- I'm not tired either.
- Me neither.

840
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,170
- I'm full of energy.
- I haven't even started yet.

841
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,170
Then let's stop talking
about showbiz.

842
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,260
Shall we?

843
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,940
- Is the next topic love?
- Let's talk...

844
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,170
- about So Min's favorite topic...
- Love?

845
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,330
- this time, which is love.
- Let's talk about love.

846
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,680
Where do you want me to begin?

847
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,070
- Sorry?
- Where should I begin?

848
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,570
Hey, have you ever fallen in love
at first sight?

849
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,250
Love at first sight?

850
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,680
Actually, I'm not the type
that falls in love at first sight.

851
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,490
Why are you sitting on the edge
like that?

852
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,690
(She's elated
as she's an expert in this topic.)

853
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,190
She's excited because it's her turn.

854
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,660
- It's her turn now.
- I rather get attracted...

855
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,280
- to a man I didn't like at first...
- Right.

856
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,290
- Right.
- more easily.

857
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,200
- Me too.
- An unexpected charm...

858
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,620
What are you doing?

859
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,090
Gosh, seriously.

860
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,900
- Actually, lately,
- Yes.

861
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,000
- I feel...
- Are you interested in someone?

862
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,910
Well... He's a friend...

863
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,410
- who lives in my neighborhood.
- Really?

864
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,770
- Yes.
- He'll know when he watches this.

865
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,180
- He'll know.
- Anyway,

866
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,150
I get a text message
at late night sometimes.

867
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,450
- From him?
- Yes.

868
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,840
- I bet he likes her.
- Did you meet him before that?

869
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:14,280
I met him with some other people
only once or twice.

870
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,890
We don't know each other well.

871
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,960
- Do we know him too?
- No.

872
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,990
Is it okay for you...

873
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,280
- to talk about him on a TV show?
- Someone we don't know.

874
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,660
- Go on and tell us about him.
- Nothing's going on between us.

875
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,730
- Right.
- It's not like that.

876
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,850
- Okay. Go on.
- We're just friends.

877
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,670
But I have this feeling...

878
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,790
- I feel...
- Oh, I see.

879
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,020
Right. I think I know what you mean.

880
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,670
One day, we ran into each other...

881
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,560
and walked home together.

882
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,300
Why would you walk home together
if you ran into each other?

883
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,800
Don't people part ways
when they run into each other?

884
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,140
I'll be honest with you.

885
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,340
- Don't you think it's weird?
- They should go home together.

886
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,250
- They were in the mood.
- Oh, I see. Okay.

887
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,720
Hey, why are you getting upset?

888
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,980
- I'm not getting upset.
- Why would you get upset?

889
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,190
(Why are you getting upset?)

890
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,650
- I mean it's unnatural...
- Why would you get upset?

891
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,160
- Goodness, you. You're jealous.
- I'm not jealous.

892
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,550
- Why would you get upset suddenly?
- It's not like that.

893
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,930
Okay. I'll just listen.

894
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,900
I really ran into him on the street.

895
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,430
I asked him,
"Hey, what are you doing here?"

896
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,400
He said he was on his way home
after working out at the gym.

897
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm an extrovert, you know.

898
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,530
I wasn't trying
to show my interest in him.

899
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,560
- I said, "I'll walk home."
- "Would you walk with me?"

900
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,740
"Do you want to walk with me?
How about you exercise more?"

901
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,470
- That's how it happened.
- My gosh. Clearly, you...

902
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,980
- That's a fake coincidence.
- It's strange.

903
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,180
Clearly, you talked him into it.

904
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,570
- I think you made a move on him.
- That's a fake coincidence.

905
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,270
That wasn't a coincidence.

906
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,770
It's definitely not a coincidence.

907
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,450
He said, "I'm sorry,
but I'm too tired."

908
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,720
- He refused indirectly.
- Yes, he did.

909
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,660
So I said okay
and started walking home.

910
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,280
It felt strange while walking.

911
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,730
- Why?
- He was walking with me...

912
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,090
- unlike what he said.
- I see.

913
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,500
So I said,
"Hey, you said you were going home."

914
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,730
He said, "Well, I'll walk you
over there and leave."

915
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,900
- But he wouldn't leave.
- Oh, my.

916
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,760
I bet he refused
but felt bad about it.

917
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,530
Suk Jin is right.
He must be a thoughtful guy.

918
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,770
He's a thoughtful guy.

919
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,040
And then we continued walking.

920
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,600
But I had this feeling
that he was...

921
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,870
So I said...

922
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,990
"We're almost there.
How will you go home from here?"

923
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,280
He said he would take a bus.

924
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,280
So I said I would walk him
to the bus stop.

925
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,890
He said, "That's okay.
You can go home."

926
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,260
But I insisted on walking him
to the bus stop.

927
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,430
It sounds like you have
a one-sided crush on him.

928
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,000
- This is...
- He doesn't seem to like you.

929
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,760
- I think...
- She's practically writing a novel.

930
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
- A novel about unrequited love.
- You're the only one in love.

931
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,400
- But it's not that he doesn't...
- So Min, listen.

932
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,760
But I felt so good...

933
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,410
when we arrived at the bus stop,
and he said, "Bye, sis."

934
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,570
Oh, gosh.

935
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,180
(He called her "sis"?)

936
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,680
He called you "sis"?

937
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,370
(She made a mistake.)

938
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,180
- "Bye, sis."
- "Bye, sis."

939
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,280
- He called her "sis".
- He must be younger than her.

940
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,990
The man who is younger than So Min
and lives in Yongsan,

941
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,660
you'd better behave yourself.
Got it?

942
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,760
Are you going to keep
holding things back from us?

943
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,620
- If you're younger than So Min...
- You could've told us...

944
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,760
- that he's younger than you.
- Be good to her, you brat.

945
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,730
- So Min likes you, you brat.
- Why didn't you tell us?

946
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,060
Hey, kid!

947
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,360
(I will call you by your first name)

948
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,530
(Whatever you say)

949
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,710
- The man living in Yongsan,
- Stop it.

950
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,250
- call So Min by her first name.
- Hey, stop it.

951
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,040
- Say that she's your girl!
- Gosh, seriously.

952
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,450
Call her by her first name.

953
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,920
(They all became more energetic
because of her love story.)

954
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,510
- The pollacks...
- I want to know...

955
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,890
- Ask any question.
- Bo Pil wants to say something.

956
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,020
- What?
- He picked up a mic.

957
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,690
You have the whole day, so...

958
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,400
- Are we more chatty than expected?
- Yes.

959
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,200
- I haven't even started yet.
- We can go...

960
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,290
We can go on all day.

961
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,020
You've been chatting...

962
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,790
for 70 minutes
since we started shooting.

963
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,790
Really?

964
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,910
(They've been chattering
for 70 minutes since the beginning.)

965
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:21,910
- Really?
- Is that true?

966
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,910
Since the beginning, yes.

967
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,800
We deducted 2 pollacks
for every 10 minutes.

968
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,830
14 pollacks have been deducted.

969
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,370
We've been chattering
for 70 minutes without a break?

970
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,370
We didn't pause at all?

971
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,870
And you ate 2 pollacks. 16 pollacks
have been deducted in total.

972
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,080
By the way, this is so tasty.

973
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,310
Keep it coming.

974
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,160
The first mission
where you can deduct pollacks...

975
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,760
requires a joint effort
from all seven of you.

976
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,160
- It's Doppelganger Tug of War.
- What?

977
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,500
(The 1st mission,
Doppelganger Tug of War)

978
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
"Doppelganger"?

979
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,970
You'll have a tug of war match
against seven staff members.

980
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,210
If you win at least once,
we'll deduct pollacks.

981
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,910
10 pollacks will be deducted
on your 1st win...

982
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,270
and 9 pollacks on your 2nd win.
The number goes down like his.

983
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,710
And from the 3rd round,

984
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,870
1 random member from each team
will be taken out in every round.

985
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,870
(From the 3rd round,
1 member will be taken out.)

986
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,720
We selected staff members
who have similar physiques...

987
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,110
to each one of you.

988
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,160
Let me introduce them.

989
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,890
The first member,
against the veteran Suk Jin,

990
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,690
is the veteran staff member,
the legend of variety shows,

991
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,020
Kang Chan Hee.

992
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,900
- We have a chance of winning.
- We can win.

993
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,260
- Chan Hee doesn't seem so strong.
- Chan Hee...

994
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,790
He does have a similar physique
to Suk Jin's.

995
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,830
- Next up is...
- Chan Hee has a nice body.

996
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:27,830
Yoon Hong Min whose body is
as muscular as Jong Kook.

997
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,300
- Gosh, we're in trouble.
- Oh, no.

998
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,410
- We might...
- He has such a muscular body.

999
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,270
- We might lose.
- Look at his shoulders.

1000
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,480
How do we beat him?

1001
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,870
Look at his back muscles.

1002
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,610
Next up is the Yoo Jae Suk
of the staff members...

1003
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:42,890
who is skinny but strong
and has similar facial features.

1004
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,160
- Lee Ju Yong.
- Oh, it's Ju Yong.

1005
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,890
(Jae Suk's look-alike,
Producer Lee Ju Yong)

1006
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,400
Next up is Na Dong Geun
from the directing team...

1007
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,900
against the swift Haha.

1008
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,730
- Oh, gosh.
- Dong Geun is strong.

1009
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:57,260
Cameraman Choi Yun Sang
will defeat Se Chan.

1010
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,000
- Oh, Yun Sang?
- Yun Sang?

1011
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,300
And Assistant Writer Yeo Si Yeon
who is as competitive as Ji Hyo,

1012
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,680
the determined fighter
of Running Man.

1013
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:08,750
Last but not least, Choi Hyung In
who's as passionate as So Min.

1014
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,750
- Hyung In?
- Oh, Hyung In?

1015
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,870
But Hyung In is stronger than me.

1016
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:16,040
- So they represent the staff.
- Let's give it a try.

1017
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,990
Please come out and get ready.

1018
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,660
- Let's go.
- It's important to pull the rope...

1019
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,080
- at the same time.
- No. That's not important.

1020
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,990
- I learned this from experience.
- Let's do this.

1021
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,930
We can win if we can just hold
our position at the beginning.

1022
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,900
How about we say "1, 2"
to pull at the same time?

1023
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,700
- We should do that.
- Just lie down on the ground.

1024
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,000
I know we should lie down, but...

1025
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,940
- It won't be easy.
- Shouldn't we pull it toward us?

1026
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,600
Like this. "1, 2. 1, 2."

1027
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,210
Shouldn't we wear those shoes too?

1028
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,680
Hey, are you guys wearing spikes,
Hyung In?

1029
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,870
Those are spikes.

1030
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,180
- What?
- That's not fair.

1031
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,270
What are you doing?

1032
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,870
- They're wearing spikes.
- That's not fair.

1033
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,980
Don't you think that's unfair?

1034
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,190
- They can't beat us anyway.
- My gosh.

1035
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,690
Give us spikes too.

1036
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,780
We didn't have enough money,
so we only got seven pairs.

1037
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,990
Excuse me.

1038
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
What are those gloves?

1039
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,390
- What are those gloves?
- Come on. Take them off.

1040
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:59,090
(The staff members are
fully equipped.)

1041
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,500
- That's what Kim Byung Man uses.
- What are those gloves?

1042
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,470
That's not fair.
They're non-slip gloves.

1043
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,900
- They're just like yours.
- They have better gear.

1044
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,970
Guys, it's almost like sandpaper!

1045
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,360
- But...
- They're not slippery at all.

1046
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,740
Fortunately,

1047
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,180
the ground has dried up.
It's not slippery. We can do this.

1048
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,700
- Okay. Let's trust Jong Kook!
- We can beat them.

1049
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,270
Jong Kook,
what order should we stand in?

1050
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,470
- I'll show you.
- Let's do this.

1051
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,870
- Grab the rope.
- Cross your arms.

1052
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,540
Grab it and put it under your arm.

1053
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,080
Keep the rope close to your body.

1054
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,390
And we should stand
close to each other.

1055
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,790
- Stay close to each other.
- Let's chant.

1056
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,790
1, 2, 3.

1057
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,830
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1058
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,930
- What? Let's chant as they did.
- Just lie down.

1059
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:32,560
- Let's chant.
- Okay.

1060
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,930
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

1061
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,160
- We can do this!
- We can do this!

1062
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,930
Lean back once it begins.

1063
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,040
- Okay.
- Got it.

1064
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,770
Jong Kook, we should hold the rope
with our arms crossed, right?

1065
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,930
Hold it first and then pull.

1066
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:43,310
Put it under your arm.
Stand closer to him.

1067
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,370
- Suk Jin, step back a little.
- Okay.

1068
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,770
- Okay.
- Wait. Hold on.

1069
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:47,910
There's no space for me.

1070
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,350
- Okay. Stand close to each other.
- Come.

1071
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,450
- Put it under your arm.
- Okay. I did it.

1072
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,810
- Hold it.
- Okay.

1073
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,310
Lean back as soon as it begins.
Wait. Hey.

1074
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,640
- Don't lean back yet.
- Come here.

1075
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,220
Are you ready? Are you good?

1076
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,260
- All right.
- Goodness.

1077
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,850
(They've built teamwork
for 11 years.)

1078
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,330
(They only need to win once.)

1079
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,490
Please get ready.

1080
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,160
(The elite staff members
aren't easy to beat.)

1081
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,600
(The grit gloves and spikes
add confidence.)

1082
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,470
(They're ready to fight
for the honor of the staff.)

1083
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,640
Please get ready.

1084
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,700
And...

1085
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,830
(All 14 players
are determined to win.)

1086
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,080
And go!

1087
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,100
(The game begins.)

1088
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,910
(What?)

1089
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,870
And go!

1090
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,850
(They get dragged
as soon as the game begins.)

1091
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:28,890
What the...

1092
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,180
(They were easy to beat
which made the staff fall down too.)

1093
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,430
What on earth was that?

1094
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,950
I had no idea they'd be this strong.

1095
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,660
- Hold on a second.
- No way.

1096
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,160
- That was a mess.
- How can we possibly beat them?

1097
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,620
- That was insane.
- What was that?

1098
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,990
This is insane!

1099
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,430
- The gloves.
- I mean...

1100
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,040
The gloves and the spikes.

1101
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,470
- Seriously?
- We should lodge a complaint.

1102
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,580
The gloves and the spikes!

1103
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,640
- Let us have those too.
- You lost the first round.

1104
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,810
Let's get ready
for the second round.

1105
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,640
Unbelievable.

1106
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,850
- It's as if they're beatable.
- How can we win?

1107
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,120
- Pull right away.
- Got it.

1108
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,220
Guys, don't leave
too much space between us.

1109
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,580
Don't pull just yet.

1110
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,990
Don't pull. Don't pull just yet.

1111
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,390
Guys, don't pull just yet.

1112
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,990
Lift up the rope.

1113
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,720
- Stay safe, guys.
- Lift up the rope.

1114
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,220
- He wrapped the rope around him.
- Lie down instantly.

1115
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,520
- Get ready.
- Just a second.

1116
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,620
- Lie down instantly.
- We're ready.

1117
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,620
And go!

1118
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,080
(Round 2 begins.)

1119
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,450
(They get dragged once again.)

1120
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,680
Darn it!

1121
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,320
- Darn.
- This is no fun!

1122
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:38,280
- We can't win.
- Why won't they budge?

1123
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,660
Also, the rope's too slippery.

1124
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,990
One from each team
will be taken out.

1125
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,490
- From this team...
- But our shoes!

1126
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,620
You gave them spikes.

1127
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,930
Please choose a member of the staff
to sit this next round out.

1128
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,570
- The jimmy jib cameraman.
- Jae Suk,

1129
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,410
- the jimmy jib cameraman.
- That's right.

1130
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,910
He needs to go.

1131
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,010
Let's take one out from that team.

1132
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,950
- That person will be out.
- Na Dong Geun.

1133
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,870
Dong Geun,
you'll sit this round out.

1134
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,220
Dong Geun?

1135
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,870
- So Min.
- So Min will be left out.

1136
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,580
Nice!

1137
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,320
(Round 3 will commence
without So Min and Dong Geun.)

1138
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,350
- This is great news for us.
- So Min's out.

1139
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,780
This is great news!

1140
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,530
- This is great for us.
- Okay!

1141
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,660
So Min, you can be the referee.

1142
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,760
Nice. This is the best news for us.

1143
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,300
Being the referee is the best.

1144
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,330
It is.

1145
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,100
Why don't you like
being the referee?

1146
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,970
Pass her the whistle.

1147
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,140
How did you draw my name out?

1148
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,830
- Was it really random?
- Can't I be the referee?

1149
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:25,870
- Was it random?
- I'll do it.

1150
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,910
I'd rather be the referee.

1151
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,030
You get to blow the whistle.

1152
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,740
- How was my name drawn?
- You get the best role.

1153
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,910
It'll be fine.

1154
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,100
Guys, please pick up the rope.

1155
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,550
- Pick up the rope.
- Jae Suk, get over here.

1156
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,950
Make sure that the rope
is in the center.

1157
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,010
- Bring it to the center.
- Step back a little.

1158
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,490
Make sure it's in the center.

1159
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,510
- Don't pull just yet.
- Bring it to the center.

1160
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,050
- Here we go.
- Don't pull.

1161
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,490
- Don't pull.
- Bring it to the center.

1162
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,780
Don't pull!

1163
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,120
- Hold on tight.
- Don't pull.

1164
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,760
I'll give you the signal.

1165
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:49,990
Get ready.

1166
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,370
Get ready!

1167
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,660
And...

1168
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,300
(The grasshopper on the staff team
gets ready.)

1169
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,530
Get ready! And...

1170
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,370
(We can't lose this round too.)

1171
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,510
Hold your ground.

1172
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,470
(The Grasshopper Producer...)

1173
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,410
(and the human forklift)

1174
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,410
Hold your ground.

1175
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,450
You can't win even with my help.

1176
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:13,990
Even my help wasn't enough.

1177
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,120
Seriously?

1178
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,780
- It's the shoes.
- The shoes are the problem.

1179
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,780
Let's compete barefooted.

1180
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,030
Let's take off our shoes.

1181
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,100
The shoes.

1182
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,390
It's too slippery.

1183
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,970
- It's too slippery.
- Just lie down.

1184
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,370
- The ground is too slippery.
- Choose another name.

1185
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,570
Choose Ji Hyo's name.

1186
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,970
(Who will sit out the 4th round?)

1187
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,030
The jimmy jib cameraman, please.

1188
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,300
- Yun Sang.
- Choi Yun Sang.

1189
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,640
And Haha.

1190
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,370
Bring on the great news!

1191
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,950
This is great news!

1192
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,780
We could win
now that Yun Sang is out.

1193
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,910
Yes, we could.

1194
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,910
- We might be able to.
- It looks promising.

1195
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,910
- Stick closer together.
- There's no way we'll lose this.

1196
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,620
We need to lie down,
so give me some space.

1197
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,550
Move a little to the right.

1198
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,550
Lie down, okay?

1199
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,830
Move a little to the right.

1200
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,930
Just a second.

1201
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,950
Are you ready?

1202
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,120
- They came prepared, didn't they?
- Okay, let's do this.

1203
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,800
(Will they be able to end the game?)

1204
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,930
(Round 4 begins.)

1205
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,240
(They help them a little.)

1206
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,580
(Team Running Man
hangs in there longer this time.)

1207
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,910
(Neck and neck)

1208
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,950
(The Grasshopper Producer
hops to add more weight.)

1209
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,580
(Heave-ho)

1210
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,550
(They get dragged
by Mr. Muscle once again.)

1211
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,780
Am I the issue here?

1212
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,080
It just can't be done.

1213
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,160
- Am I the issue here?
- It's the shoes.

1214
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,490
- Yes, the shoes.
- It's too slippery.

1215
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,430
It seemed doable this time.

1216
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,830
- It seemed doable.
- As if.

1217
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,390
- It was doable.
- Draw the next names.

1218
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,600
Is something on the line
for the staff too?

1219
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,030
Why are they fighting
with all their might?

1220
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,510
- The jimmy jib cameraman.
- It seemed doable.

1221
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,760
We could've won.

1222
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,010
(Which staff member
will sit out the next round?)

1223
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,140
Yoon Hong Min!

1224
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,680
Finally. All right!

1225
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,410
- Okay, we've got this.
- Nice!

1226
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,820
Please let it be Suk Jin.

1227
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,280
Nice. All right!

1228
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,220
(Who will also sit this round out?)

1229
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,350
- Oh, no.
- Nice. Suk Jin's out!

1230
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,160
- Let's party!
- Let's party!

1231
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,030
- That's great news.
- That's great news.

1232
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,160
Talk about great news.

1233
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,030
- We've got this.
- We'll win this time.

1234
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,600
We can't possibly lose this round.

1235
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,720
We'll win this round.

1236
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,470
Losing this round means
there's a spy among us.

1237
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,140
There has to be a spy.

1238
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,370
It won't make any sense.

1239
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,140
- We have to win this.
- Losing won't make sense.

1240
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,470
He's really invested
in the show, isn't he?

1241
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,200
Also, check out his stance.

1242
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,640
He's experienced
when it comes to tug-of-war.

1243
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,510
- "2 Days and 1 Night"?
- He did it a lot on that show.

1244
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,050
Check out his biceps.

1245
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,970
He was coaching the entire team.

1246
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,720
Exactly. The stance he carries...

1247
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,140
You need to lie down
and hold your ground.

1248
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,410
Is this better?

1249
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,910
This time around...

1250
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,220
- We'll win.
- Pull at a certain rhythm.

1251
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,620
No, we'll win for sure.

1252
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,200
Adjust as you go along.

1253
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,300
Move a little forward, please.

1254
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,120
- This...
- A little to the left.

1255
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,720
Move a little to the left.

1256
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,970
- Okay, good.
- Good.

1257
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,240
- Here we go.
- Are you ready?

1258
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,140
- We'll win for sure.
- Are you ready?

1259
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,370
- We're good.
- Get ready.

1260
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,100
And...

1261
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,080
(The immortal Chan Hee
isn't an easy competition.)

1262
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,970
(Who will win this round?)

1263
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,240
Heave-ho!

1264
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,640
- Hey!
- Lie down!

1265
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
Lie down!

1266
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,410
(They pull with all their might.)

1267
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,080
(The passionate grasshopper
holds his ground.)

1268
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,990
You fools.

1269
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,760
- Hey!
- You fools.

1270
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,220
- Just lie down.
- How does this make sense?

1271
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,390
(Screaming with agony)

1272
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,700
- It's over, guys.
- How come he's this strong?

1273
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,300
How does this make sense?

1274
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,490
(The staff team wins after fighting
with all their might.)

1275
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,510
- It's too slippery.
- Yes, that's the reason.

1276
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,970
- Give us those shoes too.
- Seriously?

1277
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,700
- And the gloves.
- How is this possible?

1278
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,370
Si Yeon's really strong.

1279
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,200
- Si Yeon's super strong.
- Si Yeon plays a huge role.

1280
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,080
- I know.
- She's probably stronger than me.

1281
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,640
This doesn't make any sense.

1282
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,850
You'll pick the next names.

1283
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,180
- Chan Hee needs to go.
- Or Ju Yong.

1284
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,080
Ju Yong or...

1285
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,660
- Kang Chan Hee!
- All right!

1286
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,680
Song Ji Hyo.

1287
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,780
Nice, Ji Hyo's out.

1288
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,930
If you lose this...

1289
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,950
- If we lose this...
- We can't lose this round.

1290
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,550
Si Yeon, Ju Yong, and...

1291
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,300
This we must win for sure.

1292
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,800
- Of course.
- This we must win.

1293
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,970
- We should win this.
- We can win this round.

1294
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,640
- Let's win this.
- Why don't I wrap this around me...

1295
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,700
and pull?

1296
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,430
No, just grab the rope.

1297
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,510
- 1, 2, 3. Let's do this!
- 1, 2, 3. Let's do this!

1298
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,180
Losing this won't make sense.

1299
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,600
- We'll win this one easily.
- And we should.

1300
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,550
- Unbelievable.
- Are you thinking you can win?

1301
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,050
Look at them sweating.

1302
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,180
Okay, we're good. We've got this.

1303
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,010
Are you standing in the center?

1304
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,240
What's going on?

1305
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,950
Si Yeon,
are you taking on Jong Kook?

1306
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:10,990
Bring it on!

1307
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,950
- All right. Bring it on.
- Just a little more.

1308
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,220
- Get ready.
- It's not in the center yet.

1309
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,450
- All right.
- Get ready.

1310
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,830
- Here we go.
- There's no way we'd lose this.

1311
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,490
(They have a chance to win
after losing 5 rounds.)

1312
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:22,530
(We will win this time.)

1313
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,410
(The passionate grasshopper
is ready.)

1314
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,180
(Go!)

1315
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,280
- Heave-ho.
- You've got this.

1316
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,010
(He pulls with all his might.)

1317
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,820
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

1318
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,620
You've got this. Yes, you'll win.

1319
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,350
(They tug with all their might.)

1320
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,680
- Heave-ho!
- You're winning.

1321
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,350
(The rope finally goes over
to Team Running Man's side.)

1322
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,450
Finally.

1323
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,930
(They finally win.)

1324
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,200
Good job.

1325
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,120
(He falls on his behind
after trying to beat two women.)

1326
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,390
- Ji Hyo...
- Okay!

1327
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,030
- Come on!
- You're good.

1328
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,490
You're good.

1329
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,740
(The staff gets knocked
off their feet.)

1330
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,800
Okay!

1331
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,010
Just to win against them...

1332
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,640
- Si Yeon.
- You pulled with all your might.

1333
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,370
- I'm sorry.
- How dare you come at us!

1334
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,180
- It's not a good feeling.
- Did you think you can take us on?

1335
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,280
I'm sorry about this.

1336
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,410
- I'm sorry for doing our best.
- It was embarrassing.

1337
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:09,470
I'm sorry for doing our best,
but we had no choice.

1338
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,580
I didn't know we'd win
until the last moment.

1339
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,320
- I'm so sorry.
- That was pathetic of you guys.

1340
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,390
I'm sorry, Si Yeon.

1341
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:15,910
- Think twice before challenging us.
- That surprised me.

1342
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,410
We had to win though.

1343
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:18,620
You won the game...

1344
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,390
in the sixth round,

1345
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,120
so you get to deduct
five young pollacks.

1346
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,950
That was tough.

1347
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,430
Let's deduct them just by talking.

1348
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,220
- Yes, with our words.
- We have no other choice.

1349
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,700
- If you think about it...
- I know.

1350
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,870
You'll then relocate
to another place to chatter.

1351
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,240
- Yes.
- Got it.

1352
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:35,280
(They get on a bus
to head to another location.)

1353
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,030
- We'll leave this seat vacant.
- No one's there.

1354
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,550
This used to be Kwang Soo's seat.

1355
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,450
- That's right.
- Haha usually...

1356
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:41,680
- sits here or here.
- Right.

1357
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,470
Usually,
when it was the eight of us,

1358
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:44,990
there were no vacant seats...

1359
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,490
Okay, so let's go ahead and...

1360
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,350
- There were no vacant seats...
- Okay, so let's go ahead and...

1361
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:52,030
chat some more.

1362
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,550
- Okay!
- All right.

1363
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,160
If only you were close enough
for me to punch.

1364
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,330
- What do you mean?
- Will you hit his mouth?

1365
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:00,100
- Let's...
- Will you hit his mouth?

1366
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,200
Let's get started.

1367
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,740
- Let's go!
- Let's do this!

1368
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,760
- How meaningful was that?
- Let's do this!

1369
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,470
It breaks my heart
that there's an empty seat.

1370
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:09,600
It's so great
that we have more space here!

1371
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,180
- Of course! It's more comfortable!
- This seat is...

1372
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,510
- I can stretch out my legs.
- It's really nice.

1373
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:16,680
- I can even flutter my feet.
- All right!

1374
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,740
Okay, let's do this!

1375
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,820
You can deduct dried pollacks
while traveling to other spots.

1376
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,050
- All right!
- That's so nice!

1377
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,390
Let's deduct dried pollacks!

1378
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:24,180
- That's right!
- No more dried pollacks!

1379
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,260
All right!

1380
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,330
My gosh, it's so pretty!

1381
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,800
Does anyone know
what those flowers are called?

1382
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,890
- Freesia?
- Aren't they wildflowers?

1383
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:30,050
- Freesia.
- No, they're not.

1384
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,760
- It's freesia.
- They're small cosmoses.

1385
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,220
- It's indeed pretty.
- It's so pretty!

1386
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,640
- It's so pretty!
- Is it that pretty?

1387
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,970
Yes! It's so pretty!

1388
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,100
- It's hard to see...
- It's really pretty.

1389
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,930
It's really pretty.

1390
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,510
Let's talk to Kwang Soo
since it's been long.

1391
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,600
- Kwang Soo.
- Hi, Jae Suk.

1392
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,700
What are you doing?

1393
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,470
I'm at my parents' place.

1394
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,410
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Jae Suk.

1395
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:53,390
It seems like you're free
on Mondays.

1396
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,550
(Laughing)

1397
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,010
If you're going to rest,
then just come join us.

1398
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,050
What are you doing tomorrow?

1399
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,490
I'm just going to
loaf around the house.

1400
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:07,200
We have a shoot tomorrow,

1401
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,530
so just loaf around here.

1402
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,760
- You don't have to be on the show.
- Exactly.

1403
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,100
- Just loaf around here.
- Watch us from afar, okay?

1404
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,300
Why would I watch you from afar
when I'm not even on the show?

1405
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,510
- It's been so long.
- Hey, hey!

1406
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,640
- It's been so long.
- Just do it!

1407
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,280
- Hey, listen!
- You're quite stubborn.

1408
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,280
- Just do it.
- Learn how to fly a drone.

1409
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,890
- Why would I...
- Learn how to fly a drone.

1410
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,490
Ever since you quit,
Yun Sang has nothing to do here.

1411
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:28,490
- He films butterflies.
- He films the scenery...

1412
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:29,890
and plays tug of war with us.

1413
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,160
He even films ants.

1414
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,350
(They share what Cameraman Choi
is up to these days.)

1415
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:33,550
Seriously.

1416
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:34,890
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

1417
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,660
I heard you talked with Suk Jin
on the phone.

1418
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,760
- It was yesterday.
- It was a joke.

1419
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,720
I gave a gift to him,

1420
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,640
and I saw how he exchanged it
with something else the next day.

1421
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,870
Is that true?

1422
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,240
- Oh, my gosh.
- He's the worst.

1423
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,010
- He's the worst.
- Seriously.

1424
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,740
I exchanged it with shoes.

1425
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,410
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

1426
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:51,550
I'll call you again.

1427
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,580
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

1428
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,640
- Pick up the call next week too.
- Okay.

1429
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,950
You should learn how to fly a drone!

1430
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,450
I'm sure he doesn't feel like
he quit the show.

1431
00:45:58,450 --> 00:45:59,550
(Kwang Soo gets teased every week.)

1432
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,720
There's an ant
on your face, Suk Jin!

1433
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,760
Darn it!

1434
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,720
There's an ant
on your face, Suk Jin!

1435
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,800
(There really is
an ant on his face.)

1436
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,550
(Darn it!)

1437
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:14,930
(He hates it.)

1438
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:16,600
- Hey!
- This is hilarious.

1439
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,970
- So Min, that was funny.
- You should've hit it away.

1440
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,740
How did you get an ant on your face?

1441
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,470
- Do you have it as a pet?
- This is incredible.

1442
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:23,580
Why was an ant there?

1443
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,080
- It was so funny.
- There really was one.

1444
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,080
Maybe your ear is an ant tunnel.

1445
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,410
- I'm getting goosebumps.
- Maybe his nose is.

1446
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,140
- It must've taken it as a tunnel.
- Maybe it took your face as ground.

1447
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,580
Gosh, I slapped my eye too hard.

1448
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,910
Suk Jin, that was funny though.

1449
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:37,410
You're the pride of comedians.

1450
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,030
- That was funny.
- That was a good one.

1451
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,780
- I slapped it too hard.
- "Darn it!"

1452
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,200
(He hit his face really hard
as he hated it.)

1453
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,490
- I was wondering what it was.
- You hit your face so hard.

1454
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,530
It was so funny.

1455
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:45,930
I felt something weird.

1456
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,800
This could go viral. "Darn it!"

1457
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,890
(It could become
the buzzword of the year.)

1458
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,070
The next place we're heading to
is a village hall.

1459
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,080
A village hall?
It's a good place to hang out.

1460
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,240
It's a good place to talk.

1461
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,300
It's a good place to hang out.

1462
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,910
(A village hall is a good place
to sit around and talk.)

1463
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,450
- There's watermelon.
- It's a must in summer.

1464
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:05,490
My gosh.

1465
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,550
They're giving us a chance to talk.

1466
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:10,580
You're having fun.

1467
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,830
Yes, come sit down.

1468
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:17,350
So Min likes
a certain type of humor.

1469
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,120
Something out of nowhere,

1470
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,970
but something funny. Am I right?

1471
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:23,260
- I love those.
- It's sweet.

1472
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:25,640
She was getting off the car,

1473
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,160
so I went...

1474
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,680
(The door is opening)

1475
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,910
Then So Min went like this.

1476
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,550
I thought it was a skit.

1477
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:37,350
She likes a certain type of humor.

1478
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:40,180
- Kwon Ryeol is there too, right?
- Yes.

1479
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,010
Kwon Ryeol
is the main director there.

1480
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,050
- He is.
- Oh, really?

1481
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:44,580
- Really?
- He's the main director.

1482
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,780
He's a director now.

1483
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,280
He's a big shot now.

1484
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,600
No, he's still as short.

1485
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:53,200
(Sullen)

1486
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,930
You laugh at everything
Jae Suk says.

1487
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:57,470
- That was witty.
- It was.

1488
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:58,470
"He's a big shot now."

1489
00:47:58,470 --> 00:47:59,970
- That's...
- "No, he's still as short."

1490
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,830
An adult can't grow any bigger.

1491
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,930
(That's why he burst into laughter.)

1492
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:05,680
- That was a good one, Jae Suk.
- Thanks.

1493
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,240
I should use this joke.

1494
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,280
My gosh.

1495
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,850
- That was...
- That was a good one.

1496
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:11,410
He's biased to Jae Suk.

1497
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,890
You must be really happy
since you have so many fans.

1498
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,180
Yes, it's nice.

1499
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,910
No, I really liked his joke.

1500
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,830
- It's incredible.
- I'll use it elsewhere.

1501
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,120
This is good, right?

1502
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,490
Do we get to have lunch today?

1503
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:24,830
Our culinary team who is known
to be good...

1504
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,830
is making bibim guksu right now.

1505
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:27,870
(They're making bibim guksu.)

1506
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,740
It's perfect for a hot day
like today.

1507
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,830
- It's perfect.
- And they're making assorted jeon.

1508
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,030
- I really love...
- I ate so much.

1509
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:36,140
- bibim guksu.
- I know. You must have it.

1510
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,200
- Here it comes.
- We have to keep talking...

1511
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,510
even when we eat, right?

1512
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:40,600
- Even while we're eating?
- Even while we're eating?

1513
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,220
But they say we have good reactions.

1514
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,410
(They need to keep talking
to deduct dried pollacks.)

1515
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,120
(Here come bibim guksu
and assorted jeon.)

1516
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,220
Thank you so much.

1517
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,990
- Thank you.
- What's all this?

1518
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:51,680
They're giving us nice food
so we won't be able to talk.

1519
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,930
They'll keep us from talking
with these.

1520
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,390
We can take turns to eat them.

1521
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,620
We can talk
about the food too, right?

1522
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:57,660
- Of course.
- Of course.

1523
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,220
- Can I give this to you?
- Sure, that'd be nice.

1524
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,490
Give me just a little.

1525
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,570
- Just a little?
- Yes.

1526
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,030
My mom's really good at this.

1527
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:04,970
- Really?
- Really? My mom's horrible at it.

1528
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:06,010
(A sudden diss)

1529
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:09,030
(A bad son who disses his mom)

1530
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,640
- Lucky you.
- You should...

1531
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,510
- You are...
- You should stop dissing her.

1532
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:14,910
- How could you...
- How could you diss your mother?

1533
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,180
- Doesn't that make you feel bad?
- She's really bad at it.

1534
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,390
- This looks so good.
- It really does.

1535
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:20,390
Let's try it.

1536
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,760
We still need to keep talking.

1537
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,990
- We need to keep talking.
- Okay?

1538
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:23,990
Why? How is it?

1539
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,450
(He's gone speechless.)

1540
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:27,550
This is so good.

1541
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:30,600
- It's so good.
- It really does look good.

1542
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,660
It's really good.

1543
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:35,390
(It's so good that they can't
continue talking.)

1544
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,430
It's really good.

1545
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,410
(Impressed)

1546
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,510
(The newbie in describing the taste
reacts to it without even chewing.)

1547
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:42,640
It's sweet and sour.

1548
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,370
- It tastes like the one that...
- It's so good!

1549
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,640
grandmas used to make for us.

1550
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,320
It'll be even better with jeon.

1551
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,080
- It's so good.
- If you have it with hamburger...

1552
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,120
I'll have it again.

1553
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,910
- Then I will...
- Yes.

1554
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,890
- wrap it with jeon.
- Go ahead!

1555
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:57,990
- I'll give it a go.
- You'll describe the taste, right?

1556
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,580
- How is it?
- How is it?

1557
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,800
How is it?

1558
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,850
(Exclaiming)

1559
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,450
- He's not really good at it either.
- He doesn't do it often.

1560
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:05,570
He's not really good at it.

1561
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,430
I bet he has nothing much to say.

1562
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:08,870
If it's good, just say it is.

1563
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,240
- Hey.
- Yes?

1564
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,910
(Then suddenly came silence.)

1565
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:17,010
Look, they started the countdown.

1566
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:20,050
- Start talking. Why won't you talk?
- Goodness.

1567
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,140
How is it, Suk Jin?

1568
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,050
Try describing how it tastes.

1569
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:27,140
So this is
what savoriness tastes like.

1570
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,320
(Reacting like a robot)

1571
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,490
It fools my tongue
with its savoriness.

1572
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,720
It fools my tongue
with its savoriness.

1573
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,950
- What? What did you say?
- The noodles, I mean.

1574
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,530
- Who fools what?
- You see? You punk.

1575
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:39,120
(He's only picking on Se Chan
who's an easy target.)

1576
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,220
It's your attitude.

1577
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,990
How was I supposed to react
when you talked about your tongue?

1578
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:44,570
It's your attitude.

1579
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,330
You weren't going to react
to whatever I say anyway.

1580
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,010
I think today's the day
Suk Jin is going to cry.

1581
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:53,510
He's going to cry?

1582
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,850
But I think...

1583
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,080
Hey, you punk. Hey!

1584
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:57,720
I told you not to do it.

1585
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,080
Hey!

1586
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,850
(He killed it at once.)

1587
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:01,910
He caught it.

1588
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:03,990
- He caught it.
- He caught it.

1589
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,120
How did you catch it?

1590
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:06,680
I shouldn't use this spoon.

1591
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:09,200
Please give us one more spoon.

1592
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,330
Give that to Suk Jin.

1593
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:11,430
No.

1594
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:13,760
(Shocked)

1595
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,070
Give that to Suk Jin.

1596
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:17,490
Why did you say that?

1597
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,260
We're spewing out nonsense.

1598
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,870
Why did you tell him
to give the spoon to me?

1599
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:22,410
(Even he thinks it's absurd.)

1600
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:23,510
What was that?

1601
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,410
Now we're just saying
whatever we want.

1602
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:27,580
(Even Suk Jin can't take
the nonsense Jong Kook said.)

1603
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,850
- There's nothing to say.
- Let's keep talking!

1604
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:33,320
- This is so good!
- Let's eat a lot and work out!

1605
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:35,320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1606
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,490
Thank you, Min Hee.

1607
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:39,030
Ji Hyo, tell us how it tastes.

1608
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,030
- Is she upset?
- What was that?

1609
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,490
Isn't that what teenagers do
when they're mad at their parents?

1610
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,300
- She was...
- "I hate you, Dad!"

1611
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:47,100
"I hate you, Dad!"
Then they slam the door.

1612
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,640
- Maybe she was upset.
- "How dare..."

1613
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,990
I didn't even ask her to bring it.
She did it on her own.

1614
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:54,010
Also, everyone else is using
wooden ones. She brought me this.

1615
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:56,800
She brought me a metal one.
What am I supposed to do?

1616
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,140
Give it to Suk Jin.

1617
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,720
(He spews nonsense again
when Suk Jin dropped his guard.)

1618
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,510
Why does he keep saying that?

1619
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:06,510
- Stop it.
- Hey.

1620
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:08,390
It's the funniest buzzword.
"Give it to Suk Jin."

1621
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:11,390
Don't you have rules when it
comes to having conversations?

1622
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:13,430
- He wants me to give it to you.
- Why would he say that?

1623
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,030
- It suits you, that's why.
- He's taking care of you.

1624
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,330
You're not crying while eating,
are you?

1625
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,930
I don't cry.

1626
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,470
- Stop lying.
- Come on.

1627
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:24,200
Stop lying.

1628
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,700
He's such a hypocrite.

1629
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,640
- Stop being like that.
- He's a total hypocrite.

1630
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,800
- Did you call me a hippo?
- No, I said you're a hypocrite.

1631
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,580
You're offended by everything I say!

1632
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,010
You're just upset at me.

1633
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:37,410
- Stop it.
- He misheard what I said.

1634
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:39,240
He called me a hippo,
and I should let that go?

1635
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,240
- He said you're a hypocrite.
- They're two different things.

1636
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,680
I meant that you're fake.
A hypocrite.

1637
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,080
Oh, a hypocrite?

1638
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,080
He grabs every chance
to get back at me.

1639
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,950
- "What did you say? A hippo?"
- He thinks you're a pushover.

1640
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:50,030
(His eyes went really wide.)

1641
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:52,570
- He's annoyed by you.
- Is he going to attack me only?

1642
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,070
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes.

1643
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,530
You're not having a beer
all by yourself, are you?

1644
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:57,700
The way you're sitting...

1645
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,700
(He's suspicious of Ji Hyo.)

1646
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,740
You look like...

1647
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,470
- You drank it refreshingly.
- It's a plum tea.

1648
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,780
(Ji Hyo was excessively having
the plum tea.)

1649
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,870
(Suk Jin's glass is empty.)

1650
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,120
Suk Jin, do you want more plum tea?

1651
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,240
- Why would I want it?
- I'm just giving it to you.

1652
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:13,950
- Why would you doubt him?
- Gosh, I'm leaving!

1653
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:16,120
- Suk Jin.
- I just wanted to give him more.

1654
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,950
His glass was empty,

1655
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:19,550
- so I wanted to give him more.
- I know.

1656
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:22,260
- Suk Jin, stop it already.
- Do you think I added...

1657
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,600
something bad in it?

1658
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,530
He obviously did it out of goodwill.

1659
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:26,760
- I'm so sorry.
- Suk Jin.

1660
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:28,330
- All right.
- It's really plum tea.

1661
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,640
Stop it already.

1662
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,430
Goodness, it's from Se Chan.

1663
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:32,800
- It's plum tea.
- Okay.

1664
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:34,910
It really is.

1665
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,300
It's been 30 minutes already,

1666
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,910
so we deducted
the dried pollacks for you.

1667
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:41,910
Here's the second mission.
Patience is the virtue for this one.

1668
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,720
It's called Hold That Scream.

1669
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,740
Is it where we have to
endure the pain?

1670
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,680
- It must be something painful.
- We have to endure it.

1671
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,160
Since we're at a village hall,
we prepared a mission that suits it.

1672
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,120
We'll show you acupuncture points.

1673
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,390
An expert will press
the acupuncture point...

1674
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,300
- that you pick.
- We're in trouble.

1675
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,760
Since it's acupressure,
I should pick a point...

1676
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,660
- that hurts.
- My shoulders hurt a lot.

1677
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,140
If you endure the pain
for 10 seconds,

1678
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,070
five dried pollacks
will be deducted for each person.

1679
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,160
An expert will help us.

1680
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:08,600
How have you been?

1681
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,510
You look...
You lost some weight, right?

1682
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:11,510
Yes, a little.

1683
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:14,370
I knew it. He looks much younger.

1684
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:16,220
- His bone might break.
- Ready, go.

1685
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:20,550
(With his expert touch, he helped
the members become healthier.)

1686
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:25,350
(A master of sports massage
who gives back your vitality)

1687
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,450
- It's been so long.
- How have you been?

1688
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:31,660
The order is important.

1689
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,870
How will you decide on the order?

1690
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,890
Well, we will...

1691
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,570
Jae Suk,
let's have Suk Jin go first.

1692
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,570
Right. Since he's older,

1693
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,100
- Me?
- let's have him go first.

1694
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:40,970
We should hold out
as much as we can.

1695
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:42,470
- Can I just stay seated?
- All of us.

1696
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:43,970
I'll sit here. Is this it?

1697
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,350
Oh, it's right here.

1698
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,510
- Hold out, Suk Jin.
- It's 10 seconds.

1699
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:49,740
Ready.

1700
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,140
Set, go.

1701
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,910
He's enduring it.

1702
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,550
He's enduring it.
It must be relieving.

1703
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,620
- I'm used to it.
- Is it usually this hard?

1704
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,030
- My gosh.
- Success.

1705
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:02,850
It was really relieving.

1706
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:04,200
- I mean it. It was relieving.
- You should've picked elsewhere.

1707
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,330
Then I'll choose this area.

1708
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,100
- The back will be okay.
- Then you should lie face down.

1709
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,260
Oh, I must?

1710
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,930
- Could you...
- Then I think it'll hurt.

1711
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,160
It didn't hurt at all.

1712
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,200
Ready.

1713
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,240
It must be painful for Jae Suk.

1714
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,300
He's going to flap. Let's hold him.

1715
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,870
- Set.
- It's only 10 seconds.

1716
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:21,870
- Hold on.
- Just hang in there for 10 seconds.

1717
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:25,580
- Set, go!
- Darn it.

1718
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:28,140
(Darn it.)

1719
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,120
(He failed in 3 seconds.)

1720
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,930
Why couldn't you endure it?

1721
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,660
- What's wrong, Jae Suk?
- It must be painful.

1722
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,390
- Does it hurt?
- My gosh.

1723
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:38,570
He's dying here.

1724
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:41,120
- He's dying here!
- Hold on. Sir!

1725
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,740
How could you...

1726
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:45,260
I just wanted to relax your muscles.

1727
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:49,280
Why would you mangle me?

1728
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,640
- You failed.
- I knew you'd fail.

1729
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,780
- Can I get a massage on my neck?
- Sure, go ahead.

1730
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:54,300
You should get this part massaged.

1731
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,740
Which part are you talking about?

1732
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,740
- Right here.
- Darn you.

1733
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,740
Why not?

1734
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,450
You can hold out.

1735
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,390
- You should get massaged there.
- Just do it already.

1736
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:05,080
- This part.
- Wouldn't he urinate blood then?

1737
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,080
I'll get massaged
on numbers 4 and 5.

1738
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,620
(He picks
the back of his neck instead.)

1739
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,450
Hold on. It hurts already.

1740
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,470
You need to relax the muscle here
to be relaxed.

1741
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:14,870
- Let's do it.
- Sir, it hurts there.

1742
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:16,260
You already started.

1743
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,140
- No, I haven't.
- Ready, set, go.

1744
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:20,970
- Darn it!
- Ready, set, go.

1745
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:22,580
(Darn it!)

1746
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:26,180
- Darn it!
- Don't curse!

1747
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,100
- Don't curse.
- Darn it!

1748
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,410
- Come on.
- Don't curse.

1749
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:31,910
- You're done.
- It hurts so much!

1750
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,720
You need to relax the muscles.

1751
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,390
- It was really painful.
- By the way,

1752
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:36,820
Suk Jin is checking out
the acupuncture points...

1753
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:40,850
after seeing us getting massaged.

1754
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:43,450
(Suddenly checking out
the acupuncture points)

1755
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:44,990
Ready, set, go.

1756
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:48,370
(Unlike Suk Jin
whose turn ended quickly,)

1757
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:52,870
(the other members
are making it funny.)

1758
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:57,030
(Suddenly got concerned
that his part won't get aired)

1759
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,100
Let me take a look.

1760
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:03,080
(He quickly looked for a point
that'd give a big laugh.)

1761
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:06,550
Which point will get me
a good reaction?

1762
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:08,450
(Looking for an acupuncture point
to get good reactions)

1763
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:09,990
Which part will be most painful?

1764
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:11,260
Ji Hyo picked her part too.

1765
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,760
- Which part did she pick?
- The head.

1766
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,930
- She picked the top of the head.
- Let's have Ji Hyo do it.

1767
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:15,930
It's an acupuncture point
called baekhoe.

1768
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:17,390
Right. I'll give it a try.

1769
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:19,030
- Does it work?
- Ready.

1770
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,470
Set, go.

1771
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:23,740
She's enduring it.

1772
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,740
(Pressing hard)

1773
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:26,640
Look at her.

1774
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,470
- It must hurt a lot.
- Stop.

1775
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:29,640
- It must hurt a lot.
- Endure it!

1776
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,140
Let's have
our dried pollacks deducted!

1777
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,580
You can do it!

1778
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,780
Goodness!

1779
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,870
(Success)

1780
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,580
- It must hurt a lot.
- That was amazing.

1781
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,820
I can't believe she endured it.

1782
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,140
You didn't press the button
of the cap, did you?

1783
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,350
He pressed the button on her cap!

1784
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:44,120
He pressed this!

1785
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,080
- Are you okay?
- I can't believe she endured it.

1786
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,260
(But her complexion got better.)

1787
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,990
- She cried toward the end.
- I'll pick gokgol.

1788
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,120
One must try that part.

1789
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,070
- Come here.
- Se Chan is going for gokgol.

1790
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:54,720
- He's going for gokgol.
- Are you sure you'll be okay?

1791
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,700
- This part.
- But it's a little above.

1792
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,140
- Really?
- Right here.

1793
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,660
But it'll be really painful.

1794
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,030
- It's right below the belly button.
- Isn't it below the belly button?

1795
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:04,140
- It's lower than that.
- What if he presses wrong?

1796
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:05,510
- This part is...
- Hold on.

1797
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:06,510
(Surprised)

1798
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:08,100
- This part is...
- Hold on.

1799
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:11,580
I'm so sorry.

1800
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,350
- I'm sorry, I'll switch.
- Why?

1801
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:15,550
You already picked it.
You can't switch.

1802
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:17,490
- You can't switch.
- It's too late.

1803
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:19,550
It'd be really funny
if your hand comes down like this.

1804
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,990
Ready.

1805
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:22,390
Set.

1806
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:24,330
- Oh, no!
- Go!

1807
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,990
(Screaming)

1808
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,240
- I told you that you can't take it.
- I'll never be able to.

1809
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,070
- Why not?
- I'll never be able to endure it.

1810
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,140
Did it hurt?

1811
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,180
I bet Suk Jin
will be able to take it.

1812
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,100
(I bet Suk Jin
will be able to take it.)

1813
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,240
Let's get your gokgol massaged!

1814
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:44,850
- Me?
- I bet Suk Jin will be able to.

1815
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:47,050
- Let's get your gokgol massaged.
- Give it a try.

1816
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:49,390
I bet Suk Jin
will be able to take it.

1817
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:51,780
Your fans are watching!

1818
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,350
All 400,000 fans of Suk Jin,
cheer for him!

1819
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:55,450
Let's go!

1820
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:58,100
Actually,
it doesn't really matter to me.

1821
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,120
I'm good with it.

1822
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,300
I don't really feel pain much.

1823
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,660
Yes, it's right there.

1824
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,660
(How will he
endure the pain this time?)

1825
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,910
Ready, set, go.

1826
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,410
(Grunting)

1827
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:13,950
(He begins with a pitiful grunt.)

1828
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:16,680
(He moves like a grasshopper
to forget the pain.)

1829
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,490
You're doing well!

1830
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:19,510
- Doesn't it hurt?
- Success!

1831
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,490
- All right. He did it!
- My goodness.

1832
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:22,490
(The old man stopped his fans
from unsubscribing his channel.)

1833
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:24,080
- He endures it so well.
- It does hurt.

1834
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,550
- Does it hurt?
- Yes, it hurts a lot.

1835
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:27,850
- Which part should I get massaged?
- Here's the chart.

1836
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:30,350
I should relieve the muscles
on my buttocks for my back.

1837
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:31,870
- I'll massage hwando then.
- He'll have his hwando massaged.

1838
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:33,760
That's the part that hurts the most.

1839
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,470
- Hwando.
- That'd kill me.

1840
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,930
- Ready.
- That will be really painful.

1841
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,260
- Set.
- That part hurts a lot.

1842
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:42,370
Set, go.

1843
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:46,080
That part hurts a lot.
He's enduring it.

1844
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,240
(He's enduring it.)

1845
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,470
It's not that painful.

1846
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:50,450
My gosh, Mom!

1847
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,780
Let's have
five of our dried pollacks deducted!

1848
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:56,450
- It's for the dried pollacks.
- He's...

1849
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:58,180
Success.

1850
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:00,660
- That was...
- My goodness.

1851
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,260
It's relieving, right?

1852
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:05,800
Do you want to try it, So Min?
Right below your pelvis.

1853
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:07,990
- Your pelvis is here.
- Lie down on your side.

1854
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:10,160
- On your side. That's it.
- Pull your leg up.

1855
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,200
I'll just press it gently.

1856
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,410
(Screaming)

1857
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:16,680
- Just give it a try.
- Don't do it.

1858
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,280
- No, I'm not doing anything.
- Just give it a try.

1859
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,740
Try it. Let's start.

1860
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,050
- He's started, right?
- No, not yet.

1861
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,240
Ready, set, go.

1862
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,120
(Screaming)

1863
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,350
(The frog screams.)

1864
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:32,120
That hurt so much!
That hurt so much.

1865
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,280
- That hurt so much.
- It does.

1866
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,930
- Yes, it really hurts.
- Right.

1867
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:36,660
Why don't you try it one more time?

1868
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,970
(Suk Jin, you're the last to go.)

1869
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:40,470
Suk Jin, you're the last to go.

1870
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,970
- All right!
- Why didn't Suk Jin do it?

1871
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:44,660
Suk Jin,
why don't you try this part?

1872
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,660
- Suk Jin!
- It's called yosu.

1873
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:47,970
What's wrong?

1874
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:49,680
- You haven't done it yet!
- Stop it already.

1875
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,970
- What's wrong?
- He wanted to go last.

1876
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:53,470
- You're the last to go.
- Let's do a skit.

1877
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:54,680
- I haven't done it yet?
- It's been long. Let's do it.

1878
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,080
- Yes, give it a go.
- Yes, do that.

1879
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,580
- "Give it a go?"
- Ji Seok Sam!

1880
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:00,350
I can endure it
if I try really hard.

1881
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:02,280
- How about deducting 10?
- Give it a try.

1882
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,550
Then we'll deduct five each.

1883
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:04,910
- 5 each? Okay.
- 5 each.

1884
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:06,950
Let's give it a go.
Go for it, Ji Hyo.

1885
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,330
- I can endure it.
- Ji Hyo, it's...

1886
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:10,490
- I couldn't endure it.
- It's really painful.

1887
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,490
- You think you can do it?
- Which part is it?

1888
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:14,030
- I'll do it then.
- Ready.

1889
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:15,640
Set.

1890
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,490
- It hurts already, right?
- Set, go.

1891
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:21,640
(Moaning)

1892
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,140
(Wait, this is...)

1893
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,180
What was that?

1894
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:28,410
- Hey!
- Hey! That's embarrassing!

1895
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:30,970
- What was that sound?
- What was that?

1896
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:33,080
Delete that sound! Delete it!

1897
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,140
What was that?

1898
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,760
What on earth are you doing
at a village hall?

1899
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,490
- Our show is for...
- I know we're having fun, but...

1900
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:39,760
(Her moaning made the elders
of the village displeased.)

1901
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,760
- What was that?
- That was embarrassing.

1902
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,490
Get out of here! Move!

1903
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:44,760
- Hey!
- Go away!

1904
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,220
- Get out.
- It... It really hurt.

1905
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:48,760
Why did you do that
with a smiley cap?

1906
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,760
- It hurt so much.
- This time...

1907
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,740
- We can have five more deducted.
- You're tearing up.

1908
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:54,240
Se Chan is the last one to go.

1909
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,200
- I did it already.
- No, you haven't tried this part.

1910
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,780
- I got gokgol massaged.
- No, I mean this part.

1911
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,370
- You said you'd get yosu massaged.
- You haven't tried hwando.

1912
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:00,870
- You should give it a try.
- You should try everything.

1913
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:02,870
- That part.
- It doesn't hurt much, right?

1914
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,870
You endured the pain earlier.

1915
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:05,890
Yes, bring it on.

1916
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:07,280
Stretch out your legs.

1917
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,850
- Stretch them out.
- I want to stay like this though.

1918
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,350
You need to stretch out your legs.

1919
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:11,760
- It'll be more painful though.
- Really?

1920
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,990
- I'll stretch them out then.
- Okay.

1921
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:14,660
I'm telling you the posture
that'll give you less pain.

1922
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,220
He might be able to endure it.

1923
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,220
All right.

1924
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,760
It hurts as soon as he presses it.

1925
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,930
Shall we? Ready, set, go.

1926
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:22,490
(As soon as he starts...)

1927
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:24,200
He's enduring it.

1928
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,910
You really look like Han Moo
right now.

1929
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,680
(His eyes pop out
along with his protruding mouth.)

1930
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,580
- He's enduring it.
- You can do it.

1931
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,780
Could you massage his calf too?

1932
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:34,140
- Success.
- He did it.

1933
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,370
- Massage his calf.
- I did it. Why would you?

1934
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:37,370
Why would you massage my calf?

1935
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:39,010
(No, no. I don't need you
to massage this part.)

1936
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:40,990
No, no. I don't need you
to massage this part.

1937
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:44,760
No, that'll kill me! No!

1938
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,580
(Screaming)

1939
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:49,450
I'm dying! I got cramps!

1940
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:51,260
I got cramps! I got cramps!

1941
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,470
(Putting on a straight face)

1942
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:55,570
Sir!

1943
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:58,030
- "Sir".
- Sir!

1944
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,760
Sir, that hurt a lot!

1945
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,600
- Thank you.
- "That hurt a lot."

1946
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:03,280
Does massaging the calf
hurt that much?

1947
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,280
It really hurt.

1948
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,410
Jae Suk! Give it a try.

1949
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:06,870
- No, I did it already.
- Give it a try!

1950
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,850
- I already...
- It's different. Your calf...

1951
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:10,780
- No, I did it already.
- It's on another level.

1952
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:11,870
Please lie down properly.

1953
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:13,280
Darn it!

1954
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,140
I didn't even start.

1955
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:17,080
- He didn't start!
- Don't lie!

1956
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,620
- He didn't even start.
- But it hurt so much!

1957
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,720
- Just do it!
- I said it hurts!

1958
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,720
You should give it a try.

1959
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,990
- He said he didn't even start.
- Try it.

1960
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,760
- It hurts!
- Give it a try.

1961
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,370
Try pressing yosu.

1962
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,390
(He got his vitality back.)

1963
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:33,640
- Darn it!
- Sir!

1964
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,200
(Jae Suk misses him.)

1965
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,740
He ran away.

1966
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:38,470
That hurt!

1967
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:41,240
- It must hurt a lot.
- Calves must hurt a lot.

1968
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,320
- It's like I was shot in the leg.
- It really hurt.

1969
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,350
It feels like I was shot in the leg.

1970
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:46,580
Could you massage Jong Kook's calf?

1971
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:47,910
- I can't...
- Try it.

1972
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:49,450
I don't think I can endure it.

1973
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,180
Let's hear Jong Kook scream
since it's been a while.

1974
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,050
- Right leg or left leg?
- Let's hear him scream.

1975
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:54,050
My left knee is bad,
so I'll have my right leg massaged.

1976
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:55,720
Let's hear Jong Kook scream.

1977
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,600
(Screaming)

1978
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,260
(He hits high notes with his shout.)

1979
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:06,760
(It was the highest note he hit
since his debut.)

1980
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,330
He does feel pain!

1981
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:10,930
This is a rare clip.
This is a rare clip.

1982
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:11,970
This is a very rare clip.

1983
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:13,200
- This is a rare clip.
- The calf.

1984
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:14,450
I can't stand the calf pain.

1985
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:17,580
(Let's check out
the rare clip again.)

1986
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,820
We learned something new.

1987
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:20,390
He does feel pain.

1988
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:21,820
- I can't stand the calf pain.
- They are his weaknesses.

1989
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:22,850
- The calves.
- I can't stand the calf pain.

1990
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:24,220
His calves are his weaknesses.

1991
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:26,280
- We figured it out.
- The calves.

1992
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,390
- His calves are his weaknesses.
- We figured it out.

1993
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:29,930
I can't even get my calves massaged.

1994
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:31,030
My goodness.

1995
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:33,570
Thanks
to Mr. Kim Hyung Joon's massage,

1996
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:36,800
- you became healthy.
- We became very energetic.

1997
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,530
That really woke you up, right?

1998
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:40,330
- Yes.
- My eyes became alert.

1999
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:41,700
- My eyes went wide.
- My eyes went wide.

2000
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,180
- That was incredible.
- I was feeling tired.

2001
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,800
25 dried pollacks
have been deducted.

2002
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,800
Okay.

2003
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:47,080
Thank you.

2004
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2005
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,390
We will now move
to the next location.

2006
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:54,390
Let's go.

2007
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:57,890
- The sky looks nice today.
- It's pretty.

2008
01:04:57,890 --> 01:04:59,760
The sky hasn't been that blue
in a while.

2009
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:01,430
The current time...

2010
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,600
is 2:48 p.m.

2011
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,720
You deducted
48 dried pollacks with time,

2012
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,120
30 dried pollacks with missions,

2013
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,030
- and four dried pollacks by eating.
- How many do we have left?

2014
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,260
You have 18 dried pollacks left.

2015
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:11,830
- We are almost done.
- We still have many dried pollacks.

2016
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:14,160
If you succeed by 3 p.m.,
the shoot will end.

2017
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,330
If you go over that time,
two people will receive the penalty.

2018
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:18,870
You made a mistake
with the rules today.

2019
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:20,640
- When it comes to talking,
- That's right.

2020
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:21,800
- we don't get tired.
- Seriously.

2021
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,910
- We don't get tired.
- No.

2022
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:24,640
We never get tired of talking.

2023
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,580
Suk Jin and Yong Man...

2024
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:29,410
used to stay up all night talking.

2025
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,160
We surprised people at the funeral.

2026
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,890
- I remember that.
- I got goosebumps...

2027
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:35,050
- because of ourselves.
- Me too.

2028
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:37,160
- Why?
- We went to a funeral...

2029
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,450
to offer our condolences.

2030
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:45,070
(They chatter about
how they chattered at a funeral.)

2031
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:47,100
We had things left to talk about,

2032
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:48,700
but we said, "We should leave."

2033
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:51,100
- "This looks a bit bad."
- I can't believe it.

2034
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:53,740
One time, Haha and I went to LA.

2035
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,410
Ji Hyo becomes talkative
after a few drinks.

2036
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,870
I become talkative when I drink.

2037
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,050
Did you know this?

2038
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:02,680
- Dolphins from different regions...
- That's right.

2039
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,990
- can't communicate.
- Do they have languages?

2040
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:05,320
You are really good at chattering.

2041
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,490
Let us keep chattering.

2042
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:08,430
- I want to hear more stories.
- Rules are rules.

2043
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:11,550
While you were chattering,
it turned 3 p.m.

2044
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,490
So two people will receive
the penalty.

2045
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:14,530
(2 people will receive the penalty.)

2046
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:17,530
If you fail the mission,

2047
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:18,910
two more people will be picked.

2048
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,970
Hold on. What's the penalty?

2049
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:21,970
What's the penalty?

2050
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:24,530
I will tell you
that you will need to stay behind.

2051
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:26,080
- It must be something tedious.
- Seriously.

2052
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:27,970
You will get stuck in the traffic
on your way home.

2053
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:30,470
- Staying behind is the worst.
- Staying behind.

2054
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:33,410
Being on the bus with Jong Kook
reminds me...

2055
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:34,450
of "Family Outing".

2056
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,080
That's right.

2057
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,510
- The bus.
- There are rice fields outside too.

2058
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:39,160
- Rice fields.
- My goodness.

2059
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,180
"Family Outing" was exhausting.

2060
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:41,260
- Seriously.
- I watched it on TV.

2061
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:42,700
Now, I can say...

2062
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,390
that being on "Family Outing"
with Jong Kook was...

2063
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:46,990
- The way there was exhausting.
- That's right.

2064
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:49,200
- Then we worked in the morning.
- I remember that.

2065
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,640
Watching that made me anxious.

2066
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,700
If you were late,

2067
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,160
everyone shunned you.

2068
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:56,430
We must have gotten
about two hours of sleep.

2069
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:58,870
We worked late at night
and early in the morning.

2070
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:01,010
- Ramyeon we had late at night...
- That's right.

2071
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:02,510
The production crew fed us ramyeon
on purpose...

2072
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:04,580
because it was funny
to make our faces puffy.

2073
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:06,280
The production crew fed us...

2074
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,910
- ramyeon and snacks on purpose.
- We ate late at night.

2075
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:09,910
- It was to make your faces puffy.
- That's mean.

2076
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:11,180
It was their technique.

2077
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,180
- That was a long time ago.
- I know.

2078
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:15,490
Don't you feel like
you have become an adult?

2079
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:16,990
"I feel like an adult
when I do this."

2080
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:18,350
Well, that's...

2081
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:19,890
The third location is...

2082
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:21,430
the old-fashioned pub
in the countryside.

2083
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:22,530
(They arrive
at the old-fashioned pub.)

2084
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:24,100
- Puffed corn.
- How about beer?

2085
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,430
We should have some fried chicken.

2086
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:26,870
We should have a glass of beer.

2087
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:28,100
1, 2, 3.

2088
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,580
(He pretends to end the shoot
with a clapperboard.)

2089
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:31,910
- It looks the same.
- It's fascinating.

2090
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:33,350
It really looks the same.

2091
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:36,680
(They begin to chatter.)

2092
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:42,320
(They chatter
until the production crew comes.)

2093
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,120
It's an old-fashioned chicken place.

2094
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,220
(They enter the old-fashioned pub.)

2095
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,660
This is an old-fashioned pub.

2096
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:47,720
(They enter the old-fashioned pub.)

2097
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,760
The production crew is fed up
with us.

2098
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:52,430
They realized that
they made a mistake with the rules.

2099
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:53,430
What do you mean?

2100
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:55,330
They didn't know
we would chatter so much.

2101
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:57,330
I feel dizzy because of you guys.

2102
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,470
Guys.

2103
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,700
- They are fed up with us.
- Sit here.

2104
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,530
Come here. I will sit with Haha.

2105
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:04,680
You know,

2106
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:07,080
I am impressed with ourselves.

2107
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,300
We keep eating dried pollacks.

2108
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:10,050
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

2109
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:11,180
It's tasty.

2110
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:13,180
(They keep eating pollacks.)

2111
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:14,180
- You know,
- Dip it in the sauce.

2112
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:16,010
we talk a lot,

2113
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,950
- but there is one problem.
- What?

2114
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:19,720
We talk about the past too much.

2115
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:22,800
We couldn't contribute
to some topics.

2116
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,990
Then you guys should talk about
the present.

2117
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,620
- Go ahead.
- If we do that,

2118
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:28,030
- we will sound like you guys.
- Talk about the present.

2119
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:29,570
What's your interest these days?

2120
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:30,630
- What's your interest?
- Golf.

2121
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:31,670
- Golf.
- It's golf.

2122
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:33,760
He really likes to play golf.

2123
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:34,840
- Really?
- Yes.

2124
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,210
I get that you like to play golf,

2125
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:38,710
but you shouldn't keep missing
soccer games.

2126
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:41,340
I will end you
if you play golf on Saturday.

2127
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:43,010
I was just talking about
my interest.

2128
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:45,380
"I will end you
if you play golf on Saturday."

2129
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,320
Why would you schedule to play golf
on Saturday?

2130
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:49,420
There are other days.

2131
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:50,850
(The scary soccer enthusiast
makes Se Chan choke.)

2132
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:51,920
I can't believe him.

2133
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,090
(The scary soccer enthusiast
makes Se Chan choke.)

2134
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:54,680
Sprite and Coke.

2135
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,500
You are so strong.

2136
01:08:57,330 --> 01:08:58,460
It's no wonder we lost.

2137
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:00,170
- I can't believe her.
- I am impressed.

2138
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,000
(Si Yeon still has strength
after the tug-of-war.)

2139
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,390
- Si Yeon.
- It must have been exhausting.

2140
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,130
I didn't know she was like that.

2141
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:07,540
- She didn't even tremble.
- She surprised me.

2142
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:08,670
(The production crew is full
of human weapons.)

2143
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:09,880
- What do you want? Coke?
- Yes.

2144
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:11,630
- Do you want Coke?
- Yes.

2145
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:13,280
(Suk Jin likes Coke.)

2146
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,340
It's okay.

2147
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,080
I don't drink Sprite.

2148
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,140
Hey.

2149
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,010
What?

2150
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:21,010
I am looking after you.

2151
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:22,510
It would be rude of me
to keep your glass empty.

2152
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:24,380
- He is clearly looking after you.
- Right?

2153
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:26,790
- That's what I do.
- All right.

2154
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:28,680
- I will make a toast.
- Okay.

2155
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,330
O.Y.S.N.!

2156
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:32,960
- Our youths start now!
- Our youths start now!

2157
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,960
(Our youths start now!)

2158
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:36,890
That's so old-fashioned.

2159
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:39,760
- So what's the game?
- If you go to Euljiro...

2160
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:40,930
It isn't time yet.

2161
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:41,960
I see.

2162
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,130
- Really?
- Yes.

2163
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:44,840
If you go to Euljiro,
there is the Dried Pollack Street.

2164
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:45,970
Shall we go to Euljiro?

2165
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:47,100
- Right now?
- Yes.

2166
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:51,140
(Chewing)

2167
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,490
- So suddenly?
- What?

2168
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:53,750
The shoot will end soon.

2169
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:54,840
Jae Suk sounded so carefree.

2170
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,990
- The shoot will end soon.
- "Right now?"

2171
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:57,660
- "Right now?"
- I want to go home and rest.

2172
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,990
- Suk Jin is anxious.
- Can't we go there?

2173
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:01,960
I might not have the energy
after the shoot.

2174
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:03,090
- Is that so?
- Yes.

2175
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,000
- Isn't that beer?
- That's beer!

2176
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,830
(What? That's beer!)

2177
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,500
No, no. It's the shaken barley tea.

2178
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,000
- Is it a prize?
- Is it barley tea?

2179
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,130
- What? For goodness' sake.
- For goodness' sake.

2180
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:15,670
- What?
- It's barley tea.

2181
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:16,780
It's barley tea.

2182
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,840
- Is it beer or barley tea?
- Is it really barley tea?

2183
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,000
(The beer lover
becomes disappointed.)

2184
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,800
Is it really barley tea?
Isn't it beer?

2185
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:22,920
It's really barley tea.

2186
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,620
- It smells like barley tea.
- I won't lie.

2187
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:25,840
- It's barley tea.
- It's really barley tea.

2188
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,210
It's barley tea.

2189
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,010
How does it look so much like beer?

2190
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,960
You will now have...

2191
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:34,460
- the Joint Responsibility Quiz.
- Oh, yes.

2192
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:36,720
- It's simple.
- And I am sitting with you guys.

2193
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,200
Before we begin,

2194
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:43,000
who would be the top 4
and who would be the bottom 3?

2195
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,570
It's obvious.

2196
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:46,740
Who would be the top four?

2197
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:47,910
- The top 4?
- Yes. Choose 4 people.

2198
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,500
- I would be included.
- No way.

2199
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,540
- I would be included.
- Jae Suk,

2200
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:53,470
- Suk Jin, Jong Kook...
- Suk Jin, Jong Kook, and me.

2201
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,840
- But Haha...
- I should be included.

2202
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,470
Haha and So Min are
on the same level.

2203
01:10:57,470 --> 01:10:58,840
- We are about the same.
- Hey.

2204
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,120
Didn't you see me guess "Mile"...

2205
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,550
- last week?
- What?

2206
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,350
Can you spell "Kitchen"?

2207
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:06,180
- Hey!
- Can you?

2208
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:09,390
- I didn't forget, okay?
- Do you want to spell it now?

2209
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,920
- My goodness.
- Do you want me to do that?

2210
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,130
I am staying quiet.

2211
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:13,260
I can spell it.

2212
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,330
- Ji Hyo.
- Shall I spell "Kitchen"?

2213
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:17,040
I will let you off
since you stayed quiet.

2214
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,260
(I will let you off
since you stayed quiet.)

2215
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:21,260
- You know that I am better.
- Haha and us 3 are the bottom 4.

2216
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:23,210
- Pick the bottom three.
- That's right.

2217
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:24,580
It's the three of you.

2218
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,780
The production crew is so wicked.

2219
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:28,840
It would have been easy
to pick the bottom four.

2220
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,080
- Why...
- The bottom four.

2221
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,780
- Let us pick four members.
- "Wicked".

2222
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:33,180
They are so wicked.

2223
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:34,290
Just three?

2224
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:35,710
- Just three.
- Shall we form a group?

2225
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:37,710
- Sure.
- Okay. We are in the bottom three.

2226
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,050
These four members are
in the upper rank.

2227
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:41,630
- The rest are in the lower rank.
- Let's do this.

2228
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,850
For this mission,

2229
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:45,960
the four members
of the upper rank...

2230
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,920
and the three members
of the lower rank will alternate.

2231
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:51,090
It's the Upgraded
Joint Responsibility Quiz.

2232
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,000
- We need to alternate.
- We need to alternate.

2233
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:55,100
Listen to the question.

2234
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,240
If you know the answer,

2235
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:00,140
pick up the beer glass
that is filled with barley tea...

2236
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:02,450
and shout, "Let me answer."

2237
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,580
Say the first letter or syllable
of the answer...

2238
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:06,590
and toss it to someone
who is sitting next to you.

2239
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,920
That person needs to say
the next part of the answer...

2240
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,160
and toss it again.

2241
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:12,380
I get it.

2242
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:14,160
Let's say the answer is Running Man.

2243
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,660
(What's a variety show that airs
every Sunday at 5 p.m.?)

2244
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:16,830
Run.

2245
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:18,630
- Ning.
- Man.

2246
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:20,220
Every time you get the answer,

2247
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:22,090
we will take out two pollacks.

2248
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:24,290
- It's like the 007 Bang Game.
- The last member...

2249
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:25,460
No, it isn't.

2250
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:26,630
It's different.

2251
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,460
For goodness' sake.

2252
01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:30,170
He should be in the bottom rank.

2253
01:12:30,170 --> 01:12:32,410
- He doesn't understand the rules.
- He doesn't understand the rules.

2254
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,880
It's totally different
from the 007 Bang Game.

2255
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,510
Do you think the members
will get eliminated?

2256
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:37,950
Seriously.

2257
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:39,450
He got attacked.

2258
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:41,820
If you say something wrong here,

2259
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,050
- you get torn apart.
- You pay for it.

2260
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:46,590
I am getting attacked
since Kwang Soo isn't here.

2261
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:48,180
Now,

2262
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:49,660
the bottom three will sit...

2263
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:50,830
- between the top four.
- Okay.

2264
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:52,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

2265
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,530
- I will sit here.
- Shall I sit at the end?

2266
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,200
- Can we sit like this?
- Yes.

2267
01:12:57,090 --> 01:12:58,390
- Can we sit like this?
- Yes.

2268
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:00,370
Two bombs are sitting...

2269
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:01,760
next to Jae Suk.

2270
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:03,600
Jae Suk.

2271
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,800
(The worst members are sitting
next to the first place.)

2272
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:07,750
She is the only one
I can toss the answer to.

2273
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,780
I am the only one
you can toss the answer to.

2274
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:12,990
I will take out two dried pollacks
every time you get a question right.

2275
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,590
You could end the mission...

2276
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,710
- or go over 4 p.m.
- Okay.

2277
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:17,960
Here comes the first question.

2278
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,160
What's the term for media...

2279
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:25,460
in which a person's face is attached
to another video using AI?

2280
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:26,630
What?

2281
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,220
- A person's face...
- Me!

2282
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:29,260
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2283
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:35,800
(He needs to say a syllable
and toss it to Ji Hyo or Se Chan.)

2284
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,930
Deep!

2285
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:39,970
(Deep!)

2286
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:42,450
(Dazed)

2287
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:43,510
(Neither of them
can move things along.)

2288
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:45,580
What is it called?

2289
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:46,790
Deep.

2290
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:48,840
(Deep)

2291
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:49,880
Fl.

2292
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:51,710
Is it incorrect?

2293
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,750
- Deepfake.
- Deepfake?

2294
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,630
- Incorrect.
- I thought it was "Deep flow".

2295
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:57,200
(I thought it was "Deep flow".)

2296
01:13:57,290 --> 01:13:58,660
I thought it was "Deep house".

2297
01:13:58,660 --> 01:13:59,700
(They fail to answer
the first question.)

2298
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:00,870
I didn't know what "Deepfake" was.

2299
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:02,090
Deepfake.

2300
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:03,200
The next question.

2301
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:07,960
In one SBS variety show,
a woman confidently claimed...

2302
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:11,170
that "Umbrella" starts with A...

2303
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:12,750
and made everyone laugh.

2304
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,750
(Episode 551 of Running Man,
Speed Quiz)

2305
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:19,590
(Jae Suk, there are thousands of
words starting with an A.)

2306
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:22,960
(Umbrella!)

2307
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:28,250
(So Min's shocking comment
got filmed.)

2308
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:31,050
What's the correct spelling
for "Umbrella"?

2309
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:32,460
- Me! Let me go first!
- Spelling?

2310
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:33,500
- Yes.
- Me! Let me go first!

2311
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,000
(Haha confidently takes the glass.)

2312
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,840
- U.
- What?

2313
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:38,500
- Hey.
- M.

2314
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,570
There you go.

2315
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:42,300
(What's the correct spelling
for "Umbrella"?)

2316
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,300
B.

2317
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:45,340
R.

2318
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:49,140
E.

2319
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:50,780
What?

2320
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:55,090
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

2321
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,380
(What will So Min say?)

2322
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:58,510
5, 4...

2323
01:14:58,510 --> 01:14:59,660
R, E...

2324
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:01,720
- A.
- Oh, my goodness.

2325
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,330
(She says A again.)

2326
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:06,370
Hey!

2327
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:10,700
- You like the letter A, don't you?
- No.

2328
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,760
- You like the letter A, don't you?
- Come on.

2329
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,040
How could you trap a member
with a question?

2330
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,380
So Min got it wrong again.

2331
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:19,580
You were out to get me, right?

2332
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,210
Isn't it A? A?

2333
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:23,510
- Umbrella.
- Umbrella.

2334
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:24,780
After R and E,

2335
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:26,120
- what should come?
- E, A.

2336
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:27,450
You spelled "Umbrea".

2337
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:29,660
Umbrea. Umbrea.

2338
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:30,680
Umbrea.

2339
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,660
The questions aren't difficult.

2340
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:34,350
All right.

2341
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:35,660
Here comes the next question.

2342
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:38,750
The literal meaning is
"Returning home in silk clothes",

2343
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:42,630
What's the idiom which means
"Returning to home successfully"?

2344
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:44,000
- You know it, right?
- You know it, right?

2345
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,960
- I know this one.
- Go.

2346
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,210
- Then I will go.
- I know this one.

2347
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,300
Geum.

2348
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:51,380
Yi.

2349
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,670
- Hey!
- It's "Ui"!

2350
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:54,670
The character for "Clothing"!

2351
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:58,820
(She got the second syllable wrong.)

2352
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,420
The character for "Clothing"!

2353
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:01,820
- "Ui"!
- "Ui"!

2354
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,550
- The character for "Clothing"!
- Clothing!

2355
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:04,960
(So Min turned the pub upside down.)

2356
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,090
So Min, don't open your mouth today.

2357
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:10,330
"Sik" means "Food",

2358
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:12,220
"Ju" means "House",
"Ui" means "Clothing".

2359
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:14,290
I don't think
you are in a good condition.

2360
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:17,870
- Se Chan, don't laugh.
- This will chase men away from her.

2361
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:20,410
- Food, house, and clothing.
- Don't laugh.

2362
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,130
- So Min.
- The man she is interested in...

2363
01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:23,540
won't call her again.

2364
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,410
- If he watches this episode,
- Don't watch this.

2365
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:26,640
- he won't call again.
- Don't watch this.

2366
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,710
I think So Min saved Ji Hyo.

2367
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:32,710
- I know that for sure.
- What would you have said?

2368
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:34,840
When So Min answered,
Ji Hyo didn't laugh.

2369
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:39,990
(When So Min said the wrong answer,)

2370
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:45,130
(she just bit her lips.)

2371
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:50,340
(So Min and Ji Hyo save each other.)

2372
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,740
- Here comes the next question.
- Okay.

2373
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:55,210
It's Swahili for "Don't worry.
Everything will be fine."

2374
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,580
What's the phrase
that became famous everywhere...

2375
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:58,740
after its appearance in "Lion King"?

2376
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:00,910
- Six syllables.
- What?

2377
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:01,910
I know this one.

2378
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:02,950
The phrase from "Lion King".

2379
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:04,010
(The answer is "Hakuna matata".)

2380
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,540
- Let me answer.
- I don't know.

2381
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,820
I don't know.

2382
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:08,880
- Ha.
- I know this one.

2383
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,180
- Ha.
- Ha.

2384
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:11,750
- Ha?
- Ha.

2385
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:13,550
(Haha?)

2386
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:15,050
No, no. We will start over.

2387
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,550
I will go first.

2388
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:18,590
- I will go first.
- Go ahead.

2389
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:20,960
- I don't know.
- Then toss it to me.

2390
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,090
Toss it to me.

2391
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:24,260
- Ha.
- Ku.

2392
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,040
Go ahead.

2393
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,070
(Haku)

2394
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:28,130
Na.

2395
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:29,970
Ma.

2396
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:31,670
Ta.

2397
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:32,950
Na.

2398
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:34,540
- It's my turn.
- Hey!

2399
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,540
- Ta.
- Na.

2400
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:37,750
(She suddenly intercepts.)

2401
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,140
It's my turn.

2402
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:41,340
- It's my turn.
- Hey!

2403
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,160
It's "Hakuna matata"!

2404
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:44,380
Her answer doesn't count.

2405
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:46,850
- So Min.
- Don't give it to me.

2406
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:48,530
So Min, keep your mouth shut today.

2407
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:49,790
What was that?

2408
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:52,330
Here I go. Ta.

2409
01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:54,000
- Hakuna matata.
- Hakuna matata.

2410
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,720
Hakuna matata.

2411
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:57,370
Hakuna matana.

2412
01:17:57,790 --> 01:18:00,340
- All right.
- Thank goodness.

2413
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:03,300
Don't toss it to me.

2414
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:04,710
- Don't toss it to me.
- So Min is in trouble.

2415
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:07,280
Haha, you totally belong
in the upper rank.

2416
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,380
Do you see it now?

2417
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:10,380
I see it now.
Haha belongs in the upper rank.

2418
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:12,450
(You can be in the upper rank
by knowing "Hakuna matata".)

2419
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:13,680
He says I belong in the upper rank.

2420
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:14,840
He belongs in the upper rank.

2421
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:16,380
He is knowledgeable.

2422
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:18,210
(10 dried pollacks remain.)

2423
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:19,960
- Here comes the next question.
- The king of common knowledge.

2424
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,660
- Cro.
- Co.

2425
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,590
- Dile.
- Te.

2426
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:26,700
- Ar.
- Yes!

2427
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:28,090
(They succeeded in getting
"Crocodile tear".)

2428
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:29,700
- S.
- Pin.

2429
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,200
(What is the term for a new story
that is based on an existing one?)

2430
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,390
- O.
- Ff.

2431
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:33,710
(They succeeded in getting
"Spin-off".)

2432
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:34,800
Everyone knows that.

2433
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:36,840
- Se Chan,
- Nice.

2434
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,410
you are doing pretty well.

2435
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:40,500
- I know that.
- Four dried pollacks remain.

2436
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,640
This is hard.

2437
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:42,970
The next question.

2438
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:46,590
What's the idiom that means
"Original and eccentric thoughts..."

2439
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:49,590
"that are beyond
ordinary people's comprehension"?

2440
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:51,790
Eccentric?

2441
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:54,030
You use this idiom a lot.

2442
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:55,350
Really?

2443
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:59,760
- Hold on.
- I think I know.

2444
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,630
- "Beyond ordinary people's..."
- You say something is...

2445
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,590
- Shall I give it a try?
- Yes.

2446
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:06,840
- Do you know the answer?
- Se Chan wouldn't know.

2447
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,070
"Lit".

2448
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:09,460
Gi.

2449
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:10,970
- Go on.
- Sang.

2450
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:12,540
(Gisang)

2451
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:13,880
- "Gisang".
- I know what it is.

2452
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,380
- Five,
- I know what it is.

2453
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,250
- four,
- It isn't that one.

2454
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:19,380
- three,
- No, no.

2455
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:20,380
- two,
- What's "Gisang"?

2456
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,510
- one.
- What?

2457
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:23,010
- Were we right?
- Were we right?

2458
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,380
(Were we right?)

2459
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:25,920
- You were right.
- Gisangcheonoe!

2460
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,030
(The answer was "Gisangcheonoe".)

2461
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:30,000
- How could you not know that?
- Gisangcheonoe!

2462
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,250
- Gisangcheonoe!
- Come on!

2463
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:34,290
- Even I knew the answer.
- How could you not know that?

2464
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:35,590
- Jae Suk.
- Original thoughts.

2465
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:38,290
- Gisangcheonoe.
- Jae Suk, even I knew the answer.

2466
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:39,760
- Really?
- Gisangcheonoe.

2467
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,840
- I said it's "Gisangcheonoe".
- I had no idea.

2468
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,930
- You didn't know?
- No.

2469
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:44,300
- Gisangcheonoe.
- Jae Suk, even So Min knew.

2470
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,540
It only occurred to me
when you brought it up.

2471
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,340
I thought "Sang" was incorrect.

2472
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:50,320
- I am sorry.
- It's okay, Jae Suk.

2473
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,180
(Overjoyed)

2474
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,950
What's the idiom that means
"Someone who ignores people..."

2475
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:58,490
"and does everything on his own"?

2476
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,030
- A greedy person.
- Could it be...

2477
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:01,130
We had it earlier.

2478
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,030
- What could it be?
- "Someone who ignores people..."

2479
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:04,630
It has the nuance of someone
who is alone.

2480
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:06,050
That's right! It's that one!

2481
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:08,130
- We use it very often.
- I know it.

2482
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:09,500
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

2483
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:10,670
- I know it.
- Isn't that it?

2484
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,290
- That's it. I think it's correct.
- Is it correct?

2485
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:13,710
- Dok.
- Bul.

2486
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,670
Jang.

2487
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:23,500
(Dokbuljang)

2488
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:26,860
(Time has passed
and only two dried pollacks remain.)

2489
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:30,800
(If Ji Hyo answers it correctly,
they can get off work.)

2490
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,000
Gun.

2491
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,170
("Dokbuljanggun" is correct.)

2492
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,180
(They successfully got rid of
100 dried pollacks.)

2493
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:38,770
- Dokbuljanggun.
- All right!

2494
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,050
- We are done.
- Are we done?

2495
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:41,680
Let's take out
the last two dried pollacks.

2496
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,810
Okay.

2497
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,380
- Okay.
- We are smart.

2498
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:45,640
We got rid of
all the dried pollacks.

2499
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:50,460
Ji Hyo told me...

2500
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,220
that when Jong Kook said "Dok",

2501
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:53,460
she thought it was "Dokgodie".

2502
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,300
(Thankfully,
she figured out the correct answer.)

2503
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,630
My goodness. That's hilarious.

2504
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,470
- The current time is 3:42 p.m.
- Okay.

2505
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:08,430
Two people will receive the penalty.

2506
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:11,180
- Oh, no.
- We will pick...

2507
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:13,900
1 member from the upper rank
and 1 member from the bottom rank.

2508
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:15,710
It's the Random Porcupine Game.

2509
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:18,180
- How cute!
- Push its nose...

2510
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:19,850
three or fewer times...

2511
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:21,420
and toss it to the next person.

2512
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:22,680
You lose if the needles pop out.

2513
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:23,760
It's so cute.

2514
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,720
- How do I do it?
- Push its nose.

2515
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:28,560
- Do we touch the nose?
- Push it down.

2516
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,630
Push it down.

2517
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:33,320
- You can do it once more.
- Up to three times.

2518
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,170
- It's up to you.
- As much as we want?

2519
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:36,390
She pushed it three times!

2520
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:37,890
Three or fewer times.

2521
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:39,140
- Pop out!
- It's scary.

2522
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:40,210
- Are you done?
- Yes.

2523
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:41,840
I will get picked.

2524
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:42,970
You don't know that.

2525
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:44,600
You can push it two more times.

2526
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:47,470
- Done. I won't push more.
- You never know.

2527
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:48,640
The needles will pop out now.

2528
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:49,720
I won't push more.

2529
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:54,140
- Gosh.
- What was that?

2530
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:55,810
You will break it!

2531
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:56,810
No.

2532
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,720
(Who will get the tedious penalty?)

2533
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,960
I have a bad feeling about this.

2534
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,260
The needles won't pop out this time.

2535
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:02,680
I doubt the needles will pop out.

2536
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:05,100
(The needles pop out!)

2537
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,020
Why did you say that?

2538
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:08,930
You are good at making
the wrong predictions.

2539
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:09,970
(He is good at making
the wrong predictions.)

2540
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:11,500
Se Chan will receive the penalty.

2541
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,600
Okay.

2542
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:15,900
(The order will be Jong Kook,
Jae Suk, Haha, and Suk Jin.)

2543
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,710
- There are four of us.
- Kwang Soo isn't here.

2544
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:19,770
- Staying behind is the worst.
- We have some reckless ones.

2545
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:21,380
- Today's penalty...
- Kwang Soo isn't here.

2546
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,010
involves staying behind.

2547
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:24,310
Who will go second?

2548
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:27,420
It's my turn.

2549
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:31,680
He pushed it two times.

2550
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:34,520
I hope they pop out.

2551
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:36,960
I hope they pop out.

2552
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,000
(The needles bounce.)

2553
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,690
I thought about pushing it again.

2554
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:43,390
That's right. You don't belong
in the upper rank!

2555
01:22:43,690 --> 01:22:46,230
You shouldn't play with people
in the upper rank!

2556
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:47,670
(A brave man who dreamed
of the upper rank)

2557
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:49,400
- Okay.
- I thought about pushing it twice.

2558
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,430
- That serves him right.
- The upper rank doesn't suit you.

2559
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:51,510
I knew he would get chosen.

2560
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:52,710
You should do what suits you.

2561
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,970
That's so upsetting.

2562
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:57,180
Thus, Se Chan and Haha...

2563
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,940
- will get a penalty today.
- Okay.

2564
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:03,260
There's a new baseball park
in Hwaseong here.

2565
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:04,460
- I saw it on my way here.
- Right.

2566
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:07,460
It's a baseball park for children.
You'll get a penalty there.

2567
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:08,850
At a baseball park?

2568
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:10,190
We should go there.

2569
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,860
What are we doing
at a baseball park?

2570
01:23:12,890 --> 01:23:14,860
- It's the worst penalty ever.
- It's the worst.

2571
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:16,540
You have to go somewhere else.

2572
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:18,930
- That's the worst penalty.
- I know.

2573
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:20,560
I'd rather get slapped in the face.

2574
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:21,970
It's better to do it here.

2575
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:23,930
- Sure. That's a lot better.
- Is it far from here?

2576
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:25,180
Thank you for your hard work today.

2577
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:26,710
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2578
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:27,710
(Haha and Se Chan go to
the penalty place...)

2579
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:28,710
(while the others go home.)

2580
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:30,250
This baseball park is really nice.

2581
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:32,050
- This is amazing.
- I know.

2582
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:33,940
I didn't know Hwaseong had
a place like this.

2583
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:36,350
Gosh. I'll definitely come here
with my family.

2584
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:38,480
- It's good to play baseball.
- Of course.

2585
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:40,320
So are we supposed
to play baseball here?

2586
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,720
- You will get a special penalty.
- Okay.

2587
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,350
You will play rock-paper-scissors
to decide orders.

2588
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:46,890
And the one who loses...
Do you know the tee batting?

2589
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:48,360
- You put a ball on there.
- Right.

2590
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,970
You will hit 10 balls.

2591
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:52,100
And the other person
should pick up the balls.

2592
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:54,260
- You will do it in turn.
- In turn?

2593
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:55,640
So it matters who goes first.

2594
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,510
The one who goes first
is at a disadvantage.

2595
01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:58,900
- So it's 10 balls per person?
- Yes.

2596
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:02,350
The farther the ball goes...

2597
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:04,070
So you should talk to each other.

2598
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:05,440
What are you up to?

2599
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,010
We should just touch it gently.
Let's do this.

2600
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:09,350
- But if you...
- What?

2601
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:10,960
- I'm really stressed out.
- Don't be.

2602
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,020
He's even worse than Kwang Soo.

2603
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,180
Okay. I'll be a new man.

2604
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,260
Just drop the ball here.

2605
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,350
- I'll hit it gently like this.
- Sure.

2606
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:19,970
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2607
01:24:19,970 --> 01:24:21,670
- Okay.
- Will you go first?

2608
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:22,970
- Yes. He goes first.
- Me?

2609
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:24,100
I'll go next.

2610
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,360
If you hit it hard,

2611
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,840
I'll send my ball really far.
You should remember that.

2612
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:29,930
If you ever...

2613
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:32,970
send the ball over the line,

2614
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:36,850
I'll hit the balls as hard as I can.

2615
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:38,940
You should remember that.
If the ball goes over the wall,

2616
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,310
you should go out to pick it up.

2617
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:41,440
(Se Chan goes next,
so he has control of the game.)

2618
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,460
- Haha.
- I have a lot on my mind.

2619
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:45,510
It's okay to hit it hard.

2620
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:48,520
I've never done this before.

2621
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,000
Haha, you should
hold your bat short.

2622
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
(Haha, you should
hold your bat short.)

2623
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:53,800
Okay? Hit it gently.

2624
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:56,560
Just do what you want
and see what I do to you.

2625
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:59,360
(What's Haha's choice?)

2626
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,840
Hit it gently. Then I'll be gentle.

2627
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,750
(A long hit to the left)

2628
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:19,470
I'm 100 percent sure
he won't keep his promise.

2629
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,580
I know him.

2630
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:23,290
(Haha had no intention to trust
Se Chan in the first place.)

2631
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:25,210
(Gasping)

2632
01:25:25,210 --> 01:25:26,210
Where is it?

2633
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:29,180
(The little clean-up hitter
is quite strong.)

2634
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:30,680
I know him.

2635
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:31,680
Go ahead and do it.

2636
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,300
(He lures Se Chan
with an infield hit.)

2637
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:37,300
(Then he makes a long hit
to the right.)

2638
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:38,760
I went that way earlier.

2639
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,390
It's over.

2640
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:43,260
Gosh, it's so bothersome.
It's so annoying.

2641
01:25:43,670 --> 01:25:44,710
Haha, you'll see.

2642
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:45,740
(You'll see, Haha.)

2643
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:46,970
You sent the ball there.

2644
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:50,970
(It's Se Chan's turn.)

2645
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:54,810
(They've become serious
after the 10 long hits.)

2646
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:58,120
(Is the ball flying toward Haha?)

2647
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:02,590
(He fails to catch the ball
because of his short legs.)

2648
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:03,790
He almost caught it.

2649
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:05,830
I should hit it this way.

2650
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:09,500
(A long hit to the right)

2651
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:11,390
(When Haha is on the right,)

2652
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:13,740
(he sends the ball to the left.)

2653
01:26:15,090 --> 01:26:16,800
(Now he hits it gently.)

2654
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:18,460
Pick it up.

2655
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:19,470
(The clean-up hitter
from Dongducheon is clever.)

2656
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:23,050
- That punk.
- It's over.

2657
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:25,880
- Pick them up.
- It's so bothersome.

2658
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:28,920
Haha and Se Chan,
your penalty is over.

2659
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:29,920
Okay.

2660
01:26:29,950 --> 01:26:30,990
Let's do it again.

2661
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:35,180
(One shiny day)

2662
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:37,180
(In front of the photo wall,)

2663
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:39,180
(the members pose for a picture.)

2664
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:40,890
(What are we taking pictures for?)

2665
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:43,870
(The Strange Family Photo Race)

2666
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,890
(They stand on their spots
according to their roles.)

2667
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:48,390
(Keep a straight face.)

2668
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,740
(The photographer asks
for a straight face for no reason.)

2669
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:53,930
(Are they switching roles?)

2670
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:58,450
(The race to defend
their roles begin.)

2671
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:03,790
(Quadratic formula)

2672
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:05,590
Geun Sik formula?

2673
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,850
(They struggle to be remembered...)

2674
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:09,880
(as a person.)

2675
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:11,720
(How would
the new family picture end?)

2676
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:13,700
(The Strange Family Photo Race)
