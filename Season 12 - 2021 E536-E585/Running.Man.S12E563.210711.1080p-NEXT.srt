1
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,990
(In the march of time,)

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,900
(there are times...)

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,100
(and moments...)

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,410
(that you want
to hold up quietly...)

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:29,150
(and cherish for a long time.)

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,880
(Since July 11, 2010...)

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,700
(to July 11, 2021...)

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,230
(11 years)

9
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,920
(In the long race of 11 years,)

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,740
(there were shining moments...)

11
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,080
(that they wanted to seize.)

12
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,310
- Kwang Soo isn't in the photo.
- What do we do?

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,480
(At times like that,)

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,020
(they paused for a while,)

15
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,710
(With the people
who are like family,)

16
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,950
(they have taken a lot of photos.)

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,720
(Family photo)

18
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,110
(Haha, Ji Suk Jin, Yoo Jae Suk,
3991, Lee Kwang Soo)

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,970
If you don't know what to do,
make a V shape.

20
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,580
Can't we do something
cute and refreshing?

21
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,310
Haha, did you know
we'd be taking photos today?

22
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,310
I had no idea.

23
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,190
You're lying. Then why
are you so dressed up?

24
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,860
It's a family photo.

25
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,950
- Is this right?
- I'm not in the photo.

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,220
Is there a family like this?

27
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,220
(But before that!)

28
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,140
(The Chattering Special from
last week got great responses.)

29
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,140
(I also want to watch the scenes
that were fast-forwarded.)

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,240
(I bet all the scenes
that were cut off are also fun.)

31
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,110
(So we decided to release the scenes
that were cut off last week.)

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,810
(The difference between the early
days and current Running Man)

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,720
We've come this far
talking about Suk Jin.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,190
We just keep talking.

35
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,950
We've been doing Running man...

36
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,420
- for 11 years.
- It's been 11 years.

37
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,800
A lot of viewers and fans
have watched...

38
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,100
and supported our show so far.

39
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,230
It's so fun to talk.

40
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,860
- This is all thanks to them.
- Of course.

41
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,960
But in the early stage
of our show...

42
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,010
- It was totally different.
- Even though...

43
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,830
the basic theme is similar,

44
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,300
- a lot of things have changed.
- It has changed a lot.

45
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,700
At first, it was mainly
about the Name Tag Elimination.

46
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,520
- Right.
- And it was all about characters.

47
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,240
We rarely talk back then.

48
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,610
- We didn't talk a lot back then.
- We thought...

49
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,490
it was fun to talk, but they cut...

50
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,950
- most of it out.
- Right.

51
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,360
And we mostly focused...

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,520
- on our guests.
- Exactly.

53
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,620
So that's what a TV show is
all about. And we still do that.

54
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,740
What really matters is...

55
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,040
- what our viewers find interesting.
- Sure.

56
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,900
That's what we focus on
when it comes to editing.

57
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,960
So why do you think
we are having a talk like this?

58
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,870
- This is...
- It means this is...

59
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,010
- what our viewers want to watch.
- They like it.

60
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,610
That's how a TV show works.

61
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,350
This is when Suk Jin
and I opened up to each other.

62
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,680
We all had our own characters,

63
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,110
and Suk Jin became
the race starter.

64
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,320
And I always followed him.

65
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,230
We were necessary for the race.
We're the ones who started races.

66
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,680
So we became the prison members.

67
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,520
You two had
a lot of talk in the prison.

68
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,570
I still remember the day
when I was eliminated...

69
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,140
even before the lights were
set up in the prison.

70
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,770
So Chan Hee was like this.

71
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,300
- "What?"
- Right.

72
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,930
"Are you here already?"

73
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,510
- "Go back to the race."
- Do you remember that?

74
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,400
- "Come back in again."
- That's how...

75
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,610
Suk Jin and I bonded.

76
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,210
We were really sad.

77
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,020
I was really embarrassed to say
"Race start" to the camera.

78
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,210
I know. It was hard to accept that.

79
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,150
(Advice from the married men
for Se Chan and Jong Kook)

80
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,260
Se Chan, am I on your list or not?

81
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,360
I don't have a list.

82
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,420
I mean, am I on your list?

83
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,600
You? No.

84
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,860
I don't have a list or anything.

85
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,200
I'm not seeing anyone, and...

86
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,570
Isn't it that you're seeing someone?

87
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,330
I'm not seeing anyone.
It's been more than two years.

88
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,010
- Really?
- And people want to set me up,

89
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,210
but for some reason,
I'm being calculative.

90
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,780
- Why?
- I don't know. It's strange.

91
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,510
- When I meet someone...
- You're being cautious.

92
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,360
Right. It's a little...

93
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,010
- I know I shouldn't be doing this.
- I have to tell you this.

94
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,360
I want to say this
to you, So Min, and Ji Hyo.

95
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,660
You should date a lot of people
when you can.

96
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,490
- Right. I agree.
- You should see many people.

97
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,730
Once you get married, you should
devote yourself to your family.

98
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,420
- So you should see a lot of people.
- Do you regret it then?

99
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,970
- No.
- So you didn't see many people?

100
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,100
Is that it?

101
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,360
I mean,

102
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,260
you should see many people,

103
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,060
so you'll be able to recognize...

104
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,610
someone you're right for you.

105
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,670
You should see
more people, Jong Kook.

106
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,050
- Why aren't you seeing anyone?
- Well...

107
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,300
- Maybe he's seeing someone.
- It's not easy...

108
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,980
to meet someone
for people of my age.

109
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,050
- I'm afraid.
- I understand him though.

110
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,050
I understand
Jong Kook can feel that way.

111
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,180
I totally understand.

112
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,550
I was going to set him up
with someone,

113
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,250
- but he said no.
- Forget it.

114
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,550
He wouldn't even go on a date.

115
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,360
He only wants to meet
someone spontaneously.

116
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
- That's the only thing he wants.
- When someone sets me up,

117
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,860
- I want to run away.
- He doesn't want that.

118
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,690
Then how would you meet a girl?

119
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,760
I can meet someone by chance.

120
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,060
I think he just wants...

121
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,430
to meet someone when he has
dinner with others or something.

122
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,740
- Spontaneously.
- Right.

123
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,410
He meets her
at dinner several times,

124
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,000
and then he can take her out.

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,980
- That's what I'd like to do.
- Spontaneous meetings?

126
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,480
It has to be spontaneous.

127
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,010
I don't want others
to set me up with someone.

128
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,850
Then you should join
a club or something.

129
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,880
What kind of club would he join?

130
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,610
- Like a cycling club?
- He always goes to a gym.

131
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,460
- Cycling.
- He only does YouTube...

132
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,620
- and TV shows.
- Once the COVID-19 pandemic ends,

133
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,920
- Then...
- he can meet...

134
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,460
the subscribers of his channel.

135
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,360
- That must be fun.
- If I keep doing it,

136
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,400
I will meet someone.

137
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,470
(If I keep doing it,
I will meet someone.)

138
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,600
No, Jong Kook should be...

139
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,990
alone just like he's been.

140
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,040
He gives up.

141
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,130
He should just...

142
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,210
enjoy his life alone.

143
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,780
- All right.
- Okay?

144
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,300
Chattering.

145
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,310
- Chatter.
- This is a chat.

146
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,720
(The beneficiaries
of "Family Outing")

147
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,350
Now that I'm
in a van with Jong Kook,

148
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,990
- it reminds me of "Family Outing".
- I know.

149
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,180
- These fields.
- The back seats of the van.

150
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,820
Look at the fields.

151
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,920
"Family Outing" was really hard.

152
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,960
- I know.
- I watched it on TV.

153
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,490
Now I can tell you.

154
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,990
When I did "Family Outing"
with Jong Kook...

155
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,600
- We got exhausted on the way.
- Exactly.

156
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,420
- Did you shoot it for two days?
- Yes. For two days.

157
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,800
And it took us like 4 or 5 hours
to get to the destination.

158
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,040
- It must've been hard.
- Before we even started...

159
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,670
I was really hungry
before we started cooking dinner.

160
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,870
I guess so. You didn't even eat.

161
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,670
And you had to go to work
early in the morning.

162
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,850
Exactly.

163
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,000
- It was crazy.
- It was thrilling...

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,050
when you decided the person to work.

165
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,050
It was really hard.

166
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,110
We really hated it.

167
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,650
They were upset
when they got picked.

168
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,990
Seriously,

169
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,510
they all turned their faces away.

170
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,750
- Because...
- When we decided it.

171
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,820
We got to sleep
only for a couple of hours.

172
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,660
- That sounds tough.
- If I get to work in the morning...

173
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,900
and cook breakfast,

174
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,190
- It just kills you.
- that means...

175
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,800
- I can sleep only for a few hours.
- You couldn't get enough sleep.

176
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,600
But as a viewer,
I really liked the show.

177
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,730
I liked it too.

178
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,130
I see.

179
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,040
So I cooked a lot.

180
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,110
Because they felt
comfortable around you.

181
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,110
And we had guests there.

182
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,500
- So he had to guide them.
- Right. I had to do it.

183
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,980
Jae Suk took care of them.

184
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,500
It was really fun
when Jang Hyuk was a guest.

185
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,570
Hyuk was really fun.

186
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,940
So we couldn't...

187
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,550
do the show for a long time.

188
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,650
That's right.

189
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,050
- It must've been hard.
- Because it was tough.

190
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,810
I could see that it was hard.

191
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,880
- And we had to go far.
- It was too far.

192
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,860
And do you know what's funny?

193
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,320
We filmed the show...

194
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,490
- for two days there.
- Right.

195
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,190
So our managers and stylists
didn't have anything to do.

196
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,260
- So they dated each other...
- Romance.

197
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,560
- a lot.
- Right.

198
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,300
It happened a lot.

199
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,610
I bet the managers had a lot of fun.

200
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,860
- They did.
- It must've been thrilling.

201
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,210
So it was the managers'
and stylists' favorite show.

202
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,910
It's "Family Outing".

203
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,240
- You know the manager.
- Right.

204
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,510
He met his girlfriend there.

205
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,870
- That's right.
- Really?

206
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,150
They dated for about 4 to 5 years.

207
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,850
But they broke up.

208
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,750
- Hey.
- He's married now.

209
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,490
You shouldn't say
that they are broken up.

210
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,610
They're broken up.

211
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,030
- They broke up.
- That sounds romantic though.

212
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,180
They were very much in love.

213
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,320
- Gosh.
- That's romantic.

214
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,530
Ji Hyo joined the show,
and she slept there.

215
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,560
- In the situation.
- You know what it was like there.

216
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,970
Ji Hyo, wasn't it hard
for you back then?

217
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,130
- It was really hard.
- Was it?

218
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,340
It was hard.

219
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,210
It's even harder for actresses
to get used to it.

220
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,040
Of course. I wasn't
used to the setting,

221
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,800
and I was nervous.

222
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,920
And I even dressed up
as a ghost at night.

223
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,480
I had to hide.

224
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,050
I fell asleep while I was hiding.

225
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,310
I was supposed to show up.

226
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,220
- Right.
- So the crew members woke me up.

227
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,860
- How could she...
- "You should wake up."

228
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,680
- I was asleep like this.
- That sounds just like Ji Hyo.

229
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,750
I had to surprise the members.

230
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,800
She was like that.

231
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,960
(August 2009)

232
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:35,170
(She woke up from her sleep
and played a ghost.)

233
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,630
(Her face is all puffy.)

234
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,310
(The sleepy ghost
showed up like that.)

235
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,990
(The ghost is excited
to go back to sleep.)

236
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,910
(She disappears with sleepy eyes.)

237
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,110
So it started the rumor...

238
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,510
- that she's easy-going.
- That's right.

239
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,990
- She just fell asleep.
- All she did was sleep.

240
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,830
Ji Hyo just slept there,

241
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,700
but people thought
she was easy-going...

242
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,100
- and nice.
- Ji Hyo?

243
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,940
I don't know
why we thought that way.

244
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,160
We just imagined what she was like.

245
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,570
Why did we think that way?

246
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,480
When was it? Was it 15 years ago?

247
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,270
It was about 13 or 14 years ago.

248
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,770
Gosh, that was a long time ago.

249
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,210
I know.

250
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,310
This is the same.

251
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,040
After some time, we will be like,
"Back then, we were..."

252
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,450
- "When we did Running Man..."
- "You know Running Man..."

253
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,110
"Has it been 10 years already?"

254
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,960
It wouldn't be that long.
It will happen in about five years.

255
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,930
Why can't I talk about it
10 years from now?

256
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:30,960
Because...

257
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,360
that's a long time.

258
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,390
I'm sure we will do that.
You'll see.

259
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,600
So how do you feel?

260
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,070
You said it doesn't
feel like a long time.

261
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,310
I know you look a lot older now,

262
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,900
- but what about your heart?
- It's the same.

263
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,080
- Do you feel the same way?
- It's pretty much the same.

264
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,370
- My heart hasn't changed at all.
- I said that before.

265
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,580
I feel the same way
as when I was 20.

266
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,510
So when the elders meet
their friends from school...

267
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,140
- It's just like that.
- They still swear...

268
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,820
and make the same jokes.

269
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,110
This is what they do.

270
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,510
"You blowfly."

271
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,820
"You haven't changed at all."

272
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,320
They just look their age,

273
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,430
- but I say, "You haven't changed."
- That's true.

274
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,650
- That's what happens.
- Let's say there's a gentleman...

275
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,430
who sounds decent and respectable.

276
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,460
But when he meets
his childhood friend,

277
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,520
"You punk."

278
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,860
(They become mischievous boys
when they meet friends.)

279
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,860
That's right.

280
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,100
- "You silly."
- They just act the same way.

281
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,890
"You haven't changed
at all, you punk."

282
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,630
- I'm surprised when I see that.
- Seriously,

283
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,260
- I think Haha is still...
- "Don't say that,"

284
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,770
- "you punk."
- "You silly punk."

285
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,740
Haha is still like
a little kid to me.

286
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,040
He looks like a little kid.

287
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,180
- So...
- I know.

288
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,740
- I understand.
- Sometimes...

289
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,110
I just forget...

290
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,850
that he's a father of three kids.

291
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,560
To me, he's just a reckless punk.

292
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,090
That's when he was young.

293
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,650
Like when we did "X-Man".

294
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,150
- I still remember the time.
- That's funny.

295
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,230
So do you not feel
like you're a grown-up?

296
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,620
When do you feel mature?

297
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,490
I just know...

298
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,760
- Married people will feel that way.
- that I'm a grown-up.

299
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,360
(We will be back with The Day
for Chattering 2 someday.)

300
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,610
(And it's the morning of Running
Man's 11th year anniversary.)

301
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,710
(A pretty wall is set up
at the entrance.)

302
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,370
What is this?

303
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,140
What's going on?

304
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,680
(What's going on?)

305
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,510
(The frog jumps up
to the filming set.)

306
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,590
Why am I the only one here?

307
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,490
(She finds the photo wall
and the sign at the entrance.)

308
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,280
- What is this?
- You should take a photo here.

309
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,750
- A photo?
- Pose for the camera here.

310
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,930
Hello.

311
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,730
What is this for?

312
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,970
What's all this?

313
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,290
(She's asked to pose for the camera
in front of the photo wall.)

314
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,240
- This is...
- This is just a photo shoot.

315
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,660
Then what is this phrase?

316
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,630
We prepared some phrases
for each of you.

317
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,310
But this isn't true.

318
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,980
I'm not like this.

319
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,450
It's a misunderstanding.

320
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,500
You can't define me like that.

321
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,850
You didn't even ask me.

322
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,220
(The guest lover already
forgot about her past.)

323
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,410
We don't even have
guests these days.

324
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,780
I haven't met a lot of male guests
for the past four years.

325
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,430
- Can I take pictures here?
- Yes.

326
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,690
- He's the photographer.
- Should I pose for the camera?

327
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,230
Yes. This is good.

328
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,570
(Posing)

329
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,020
(Always nice to male guests,
always serious about romance)

330
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,840
(Model number 1 is quite brazen.)

331
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,470
- Excuse me for a second.
- Okay.

332
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,810
We got a lot of good photos.

333
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,840
- We can finish it then.
- No, take more photos.

334
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,980
We haven't gotten
the best shots yet.

335
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,110
We need the best shots.

336
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,080
- The other members are waiting.
- We haven't gotten the best shots.

337
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,580
Let me try a bust shot then.

338
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,350
(The model insists on
taking more photos.)

339
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,910
Good.

340
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,380
Look at the camera.

341
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,690
You look great now.

342
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,960
(She tries her best
to get the A cuts.)

343
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,250
Lower your head a little.

344
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,650
You look pretty. Good.

345
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,930
(You look pretty. Good.)

346
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,060
Did you hear that?

347
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,730
(She asked for a longer session
and got more cheesy photos.)

348
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,290
It's done.

349
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,840
(She asked for a longer session
and got more cheesy photos.)

350
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,530
Aren't you going to do
something refreshing?

351
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,970
Something refreshing.

352
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,160
Take a couple of refreshing photos.

353
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,340
(Something refreshing)

354
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,980
(She tries to look refreshing
by twitching her face.)

355
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,410
- Okay. It's done.
- Is it over?

356
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,880
Thank you.

357
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,350
- Will you photoshop the photos?
- Of course.

358
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,410
It looks good.

359
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,780
Sir, you were serious about that.

360
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,060
I look pretty in the photos.

361
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,150
(Sir, you were serious about that.
I look pretty in the photos.)

362
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,790
I thought he was joking.

363
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,560
Hello.

364
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,760
Hello.

365
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,470
(Next up is the boy in overalls.)

366
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,260
You will take photos here
before we start.

367
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,440
What's this?

368
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,130
- What are we doing?
- We can't see the phrase.

369
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,370
You should read the phrase.
That's what describes you.

370
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,400
Running Man...

371
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,680
(Yang Se Hyeong's little brother,
the king of Empty Head Land)

372
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,710
All right.

373
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,450
That's too normal.

374
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,850
Are you done?

375
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,690
Don't try to be funny.
Just act natural.

376
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,380
Lower your head.

377
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,990
And don't stick out your mouth.

378
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,990
Push your mouth back in.

379
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,230
(Lower his head
and push his mouth back in?)

380
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,330
What's that?

381
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,830
Try to look smart.

382
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,430
Without a smile. That's cool.

383
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,860
That's cool.

384
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,030
(The boy in overalls looks better
with his mouth covered.)

385
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,740
Look at the camera. Good.

386
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,840
What's going on?

387
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,080
What was that?

388
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,370
Done? Thank you.

389
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,640
- Who's next?
- Is he the guy...

390
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,980
- who was here for Kwang Soo?
- Right.

391
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,350
The pictures were great.

392
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,780
- He was here before.
- Really? Is that him?

393
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,060
I'm so thankful.

394
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,460
What's this?

395
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,520
Hello.

396
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,930
- Hey, Tooniverse.
- It's Jae Suk.

397
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,990
Tooniverse? I'm not
a cartoon channel.

398
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,620
- Are you a game channel?
- No.

399
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,230
A game channel for children?

400
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,890
You should take photos.

401
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,970
- What photo?
- We will take photos of you.

402
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,970
Stand here.

403
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,240
- You're wearing a colorful shirt.
- I don't have...

404
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,530
many poses.

405
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,610
(The first pose
of the nation's beloved MC is...)

406
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,900
Jae Suk, that's not cool.

407
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,180
- That's what comedians do.
- Do something funny.

408
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,270
I should wear a suit.
This one is too cute.

409
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,320
(All right.)

410
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,740
It's like
an insurance company commercial.

411
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,190
- K brand!
- D company!

412
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,490
- D company!
- K brand!

413
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,280
I got insurance from D company too.

414
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,360
(He looks as if he's posing
for a flyer.)

415
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,990
(Making a funny face)

416
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,620
(Influenced by capitalism)

417
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,430
- That's an ad for K brand!
- K brand!

418
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,520
I've been enjoying their products.

419
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,990
The outfit I'm wearing is not good
for charismatic poses.

420
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,990
- What a shame.
- I'm wearing a cute outfit too.

421
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
Hello.

422
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
- He knew about this, didn't he?
- Hey, you look great.

423
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,000
- I bet he knew.
- Haha.

424
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,080
(Haha arrives in a nice outfit.)

425
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,680
Haha, you look so great today.

426
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,610
- Haha, you knew about this, right?
- No, I didn't know.

427
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,810
- You're lying.
- You look so great.

428
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:51,870
- Then why did you dress so nicely?
- Do I look great?

429
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,080
Yes, you look amazing.

430
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,510
(Do I look great?)

431
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,350
That's annoying.
I can't even look at him.

432
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,360
- He really looks amazing.
- He looks great.

433
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,190
- Haha.
- He's trying to look cool...

434
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,960
wearing his pants inside out. Gosh.

435
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,490
Haha, you look like Kwon Jung Yeol.

436
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,490
Look at the camera.

437
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,700
- From the band 10cm?
- Yes, 10cm.

438
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,020
- Let's call him "Mr. Dirty 10cm".
- Did you not wash your hair?

439
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,740
- Instead of "Mr. Dirty Mustache".
- Did you not wash your hair, Haha?

440
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,700
I have to admit,
Haha looks fabulous today.

441
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,810
- I didn't expect a photo shoot.
- I know, right?

442
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,240
But I dressed up as a cute guy.
Don't I look cute today?

443
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,270
- I dressed like a little boy.
- He looks playful, right?

444
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,040
Are you two
Super Mario and Papillon?

445
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,740
(Super Mario, Papillon)

446
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,080
- I don't look so bad, I guess.
- You and I look quite great.

447
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,590
You look like a celebrity
since you're standing with them.

448
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,610
- Me? Right?
- Yes.

449
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,590
They're so annoying.

450
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,460
So Min, you don't belong
in that group.

451
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,880
So he's been dressing like this
for his online videos...

452
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,190
for the past two years...

453
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,430
- And his subscribers...
- Oh, that's...

454
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,100
- It's been 1 year.
- 600,000 or 70,000 subscribers?

455
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,390
- Jong Kook has a million.
- We did well.

456
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,200
- I know. It's been successful.
- Indeed.

457
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,260
Hello, everyone!

458
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,810
- Jong Kook, stand there.
- We're having a photo shoot.

459
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,980
- You didn't dress up.
- What is this?

460
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,440
- Hey, Jong Kook looks...
- He's dressed for the beach.

461
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,040
- Jong Kook.
- Okay, that's nice. You look great.

462
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,040
Wait. Mr. Photographer,
do you really think he looks good?

463
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,980
- Stop lying.
- I really think he looks cool.

464
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,770
He looks as if he's attending
a wedding in that outfit.

465
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,950
(He actually goes to weddings
in this outfit often.)

466
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,640
- "I'll drop off my gift and leave."
- That's why...

467
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,490
"I have to go to the gym urgently."

468
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,190
- True.
- "Why, Jae Suk? What is it?"

469
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,430
"Since I'm not
dressed appropriately,"

470
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,490
- "I can't meet the couple."
- "I'll go and watch a soccer game."

471
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,560
- "I can't take photos with them."
- Exactly.

472
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,620
That's exactly how he looks
right now.

473
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,990
- Is it done?
- Jae Suk.

474
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,700
- Thank you.
- You know what I always say.

475
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,130
Of course I know.

476
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,970
- Right.
- "I didn't want to miss it."

477
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,440
- "I didn't want to miss it."
- "I didn't want to miss it."

478
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,370
"Jae Suk, I just...
So I decided to stop by."

479
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,540
"I had to come.
I should at least see them."

480
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,580
And shortly after he arrived,
he says, "Jae Suk, I'll get going."

481
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,720
(I didn't want to miss it.
I had to come. I'll get going!)

482
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,770
(Then he leaves hastily
to go to the gym.)

483
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,980
"Let's go!"

484
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,590
- He would run...
- "Let's go back now."

485
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,650
- "Where are you? I'm leaving now."
- Ji Hyo is coming.

486
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,090
"Get the car ready."

487
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,110
- There she comes.
- Ji Hyo is coming.

488
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,250
- Hello.
- "Get the car ready."

489
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,590
Please stand over there
and strike a pose.

490
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,830
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

491
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,730
"She's Cheon Soo Yeon
before going to the salon."

492
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,390
- "And Song Ji Hyo afterward."
- Please strike a pose.

493
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,120
- "She's in her prime for 11 years."
- "She's in her prime for 11 years."

494
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,740
Cheon Soo Yeon!

495
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,130
- "In her prime"!
- How pretty!

496
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,260
Did you go to the salon?

497
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,710
- She did. Look at her hair.
- Then Song Ji Hyo!

498
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,310
- Cheon Sung Im.
- Did you get your hair done?

499
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,980
- Of course.
- She had her hair blow-dried.

500
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,350
- I had my hair blow-dried.
- You two look like...

501
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,720
You two look like a couple
at an outdoor wedding ceremony.

502
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,850
(His joke caught them off guard.)

503
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,580
- He keeps making jokes like this.
- At a guest house in Yangyang.

504
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,490
- Why...
- Lock your fingers together.

505
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,990
- You two look great together today.
- Indeed.

506
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,890
- Gosh, seriously.
- I thought differently yesterday.

507
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,080
- Really?
- It changes every day.

508
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,130
But today, you two look
so sweet together today.

509
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,850
- Really?
- You look different today.

510
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,520
- Look.
- Oh, my.

511
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,790
- Gosh. He looks so flashy.
- What's going on?

512
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,930
- Hang on.
- He looks so flashy.

513
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,370
- Look at his shoes.
- Jae Suk, look at his shoes.

514
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,400
Look at his shoes.

515
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,500
My gosh. What's that?
That's unbelievable.

516
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,940
Jae Suk, look at his shoes.

517
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,680
(He looks like a leopard
in shiny silver boots.)

518
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,880
- My gosh. Hold on.
- Look at his shoes.

519
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
- Why?
- His shoes.

520
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,950
(Shooting a tranquilizer dart)

521
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,490
(But even the tranquilizer dart
couldn't stop...)

522
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,990
(his dazzling steps
with pointy-toe boots.)

523
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,010
Gosh, that gives me goosebumps.

524
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,720
- What's that?
- I'm getting goosebumps.

525
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,580
- I can't bear to watch this.
- It's the highlight of my look.

526
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,460
- Go and stand over there.
- What's that?

527
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,660
- You'll have photos taken.
- How silly.

528
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,520
- What's this?
- How silly.

529
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,320
- Gosh. This is unbelievable.
- What's going on?

530
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,320
Stand there and strike a pose.

531
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,740
It says,
"Health, longevity, blessing".

532
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,870
Is this his 60th birthday or what?

533
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,100
- My gosh.
- Those shoes...

534
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,180
- You're blocking the letters.
- "Health, longevity..."

535
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,180
Are you ready?

536
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,600
Is this his 60th birthday or what?

537
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,880
What's wrong with his shoes?

538
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,410
(Tell them)

539
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,770
(I'm not ready yet to die)

540
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,080
(The humans are singing...)

541
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,460
(while wishing the leopard
a long and healthy life.)

542
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,750
(Health, longevity, blessing)

543
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,250
(The shiny silver boots
have been saved in the photos.)

544
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,520
- Oh, wow.
- How nice.

545
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,130
- That's so unique.
- What's with your shoes?

546
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,200
What about my shoes?

547
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,330
- Those are too shiny.
- Celebrities wear shoes like them.

548
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,100
We see people like him on
"What on Earth".

549
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,800
- I know Suk Jin well, you know.
- I've seen them on the show.

550
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,210
- Suk Jin, wait.
- Why?

551
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,910
I think I can find a chocolate bar
if I unwrap this.

552
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,070
- Hershey's.
- A chocolate bar wrapper.

553
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,680
It looks like
a chocolate bar wrapper.

554
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,920
- Gosh, you guys.
- Suk Jin, I really think...

555
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,120
- They're so shiny.
- My goodness. They're so shiny.

556
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,350
- Why? Aren't they nice?
- Suk Jin, dance for us.

557
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,620
That's great.

558
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,850
- You can tell how anxious...
- My goodness.

559
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,430
- Suk Jin is, right?
- Why? I like them.

560
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,850
- How?
- He keeps stepping back and forth.

561
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,490
- With small steps.
- That's not true.

562
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,590
My stylist gave me two options.

563
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,670
- All right!
- My stylist gave me...

564
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,970
- Okay!
- Let's move on.

565
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,500
- Two options.
- That was great.

566
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,740
- What will we do on this sunny day?
- So I picked these.

567
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,180
- What are we going to do?
- We're all here.

568
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,570
- What are we going to do?
- My gosh.

569
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,300
- This episode we're shooting now...
- Yes.

570
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,340
- will air on July 11.
- Yes.

571
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,480
Do you know what day it is?

572
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,740
- Yes, I know.
- What day is it?

573
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,510
- The day when our show premiered.
- Correct.

574
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,620
Why don't you know that?

575
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,580
Our first episode aired
on July 11, 2010.

576
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,780
- My goodness.
- Then we should invite Kwang Soo.

577
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,190
Let's call him.

578
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,820
Today, you will have
a group photo taken...

579
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,660
to celebrate our 11th anniversary.

580
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,820
(They will have a group photo taken
to celebrate the 11th anniversary.)

581
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,320
First, since you all dressed nicely,

582
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,560
you will pose normally
right where you are standing now.

583
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,240
- "Normally"?
- "Normally"?

584
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,600
Does that mean we'll take one
that's abnormal as well?

585
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,210
We need to dress normally...

586
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,600
- to pose normally.
- Suk Jin, sit on this chair.

587
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,480
- I'm glad we dressed cute.
- Right?

588
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,040
(Mr. Silver Boots became downcast
as he doesn't look ordinary.)

589
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,510
I must say,
my stylist is not normal.

590
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,690
Why? You look great.

591
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,920
- Suk Jin, honestly...
- I really think those are too much.

592
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,010
- Why?
- Your clothes look fine.

593
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,850
- But your shoes don't.
- These shoes are trendy these days.

594
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,930
- Shoes like these?
- Yes.

595
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,490
- You could've worn...
- Don't they look so cool?

596
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,320
You'll see that everyone
is wearing these in Gangnam.

597
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,020
- I live in Gangnam, you punk.
- You do?

598
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,060
- Why would you swear at me?
- Why would you swear at him?

599
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,730
- Why would you do that?
- Why would you swear at him?

600
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,590
- I live in Gangnam.
- Why would you swear at me?

601
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,900
- What's wrong with you?
- Gosh.

602
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,710
He's treating me like an idiot now.

603
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,240
- Why would you swear at him?
- Why? What's wrong?

604
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,680
That punk said that everyone wears
shoes like these in Gangnam.

605
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,480
- It's true. You'll see it.
- I mean...

606
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,570
- Why did you call Se Chan "punk"?
- Why did you do that?

607
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,880
- He deserves it.
- You're ridiculous, mister.

608
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,080
- Exactly.
- Don't call me that.

609
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,920
- You want me to sit here? Why?
- Please sit down.

610
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,080
- Please sit.
- Why?

611
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,120
Because you're older than us.

612
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,220
We're having a group photo taken.

613
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,890
- My gosh.
- Sit on the chair for now.

614
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,730
I'll stand next to Haha
so I'll look younger.

615
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,960
Don't make it look like
I'm in a wheelchair.

616
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,160
I'll stand next to Suk Jin.

617
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,590
Suk Jin, you look like
a retired chairman of a company.

618
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,740
A successful shoes company.

619
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,410
Please stand closer to each other.

620
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,600
- Like this?
- I see.

621
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,070
- All right.
- Dad.

622
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,100
- It will look like a family photo.
- A daddy from the 1980s.

623
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,380
- Hey, you're blocking me.
- Is this what you wanted?

624
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,180
Haha, the daddy from the 1980s.

625
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,570
- I'll take a few photos as you are.
- Okay.

626
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,390
(Photos with the tycoon
of the shoe industry)

627
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,660
- All right. We're done.
- Okay!

628
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,750
Nice.

629
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,890
Okay!

630
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,230
Thank you.

631
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,900
You've finished the photo shoot...
where each of you showcased...

632
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
- your uniqueness.
- Yes.

633
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,030
It was sad to finish the photo shoot
just like this,

634
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,560
we planned
the Strange Family Photo Race.

635
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,670
- "Strange"?
- What is it?

636
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,650
You will have your last photo taken
with a special theme at the end.

637
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,180
Does a family like this
even exist in this world?

638
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,150
There are seven roles for you
to play,

639
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,960
and you will dress as the person
you'll play.

640
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,160
- Oh, we'll put on makeup.
- I knew it.

641
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,350
You'll get your roles
through an auction at the end.

642
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,730
Oh, we'll have to buy it.

643
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,590
To earn money to spend
at the auction,

644
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,820
you will play games
divided into three teams.

645
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,530
I bet we need more money
to get a better role.

646
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,060
Each of you will receive money
according to the game results.

647
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,380
And you can turn in some of it
to spend as your team money.

648
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,380
(They can turn in their money
to use as the team money.)

649
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,640
- Goodness, you.
- My gosh.

650
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,680
Do you think that will work?

651
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,880
You can spend only your team money
at the auction.

652
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,310
- I see.
- Only our team money?

653
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,420
(They can spend only the team money
at the auction.)

654
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,840
(The character auction begins.)

655
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,990
(Team A, Team B, Team C)

656
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,220
(They can get as many roles
as the members on each team.)

657
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,850
Each team will get
as many roles as...

658
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,430
the number of members the team has.

659
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,900
And then you pick one of them
with your individual fund.

660
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,470
How are we supposed to do that?

661
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,900
I'll team up with Ji Hyo.

662
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,440
We get roles for the team
with the team fund.

663
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,030
- Choosing the team is important.
- Then we choose one of them.

664
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,740
Can you show us how we'll dress
for each character?

665
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,000
I'll tell you
about the characters now.

666
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,910
- First, Dad.
- Oh, "Dad"?

667
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,810
- That's a good role.
- I'll do it.

668
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,980
- I want to be Dad.
- That sounds nice.

669
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,510
- We just have to put on a mustache.
- That shirt looks similar to mine.

670
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,220
- It doesn't look so bad.
- Next up is Mom.

671
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,540
- Mom is okay too.
- Ji Yeon dressed as Mom.

672
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,810
- Ji Yeon looks great.
- She looks great.

673
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,390
Why do you make the staff members
do things like that?

674
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,460
- I think I've seen it before.
- They're wearing matching shirts.

675
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,780
Next up is Teen Daughter.

676
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,780
- Oh, my.
- How cute.

677
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,050
- What's that? That's gross.
- Oh, boy.

678
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,320
- I think he looks cute.
- It's perfect for Jong Kook.

679
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,430
- Why did Nam Joong do that?
- He'd look cute.

680
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,790
Next up is Grandma.

681
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,900
- Grandma?
- Grandma would be...

682
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,240
- Is that Nam Joong?
- Yes.

683
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,440
- He's good at this.
- He has a thousand faces.

684
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,910
Newborn Baby.

685
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,440
Newborn Baby doesn't look that bad.

686
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,410
There isn't much to do
for Newborn Baby.

687
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,800
You can just wear the costume
and suck on a pacifier.

688
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,480
Next up is Dalmatian, the pet dog.

689
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,650
- That's the worst.
- How do we dress like a dog?

690
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,770
- How do we do that?
- That...

691
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,950
(Dalmatian, difficulty level, hard)

692
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,780
- How do we dress like a dog?
- Who will get that role?

693
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,040
- There's an animal character too.
- Suk Jin already looks like it.

694
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,190
- My gosh. That's...
- That would've been Kwang Soo.

695
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,520
- Suk Jin, you just have to...
- And Green Onion, the pet plant.

696
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,820
- What? How do we do that?
- Green Onion?

697
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,290
(Character 7, Green Onion,
the pet plant)

698
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,090
- But...
- That's too much.

699
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,290
- Green Onion?
- That would've been Kwang Soo.

700
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,400
- To get 1 of these 7 characters,
- We're in trouble.

701
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,470
- you will play games in the race.
- A dog and green onion?

702
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,800
I hope I'll be a human.

703
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,800
- You'll get to pick a character...
- Dalmatian is the worst.

704
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,300
- among the ones given to your team.
- Understood.

705
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,030
- Do you all understand?
- It's not a team match.

706
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,540
I'll tell you how we divided you
into teams.

707
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,650
You had photos taken
as you walked in here, right?

708
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

709
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,840
Photographer Kim Eui Kyum ranked
your photos earlier.

710
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,420
Those in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places
are on the same team.

711
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,250
- Those in 4th and 5th places...
- Really?

712
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,780
and those in 6th and 7th places
will team up.

713
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,580
On the same team... We'll team up...

714
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,050
The member in 1st place gets
350 dollars,

715
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,290
and for each rank that follows,
it decreases by 50 dollars.

716
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,090
- Got it.
- 350 dollars at the beginning?

717
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,790
Once Mr. Kim writes down the result,
we'll announce the teams.

718
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,640
Please... I really don't want
to team up with Haha.

719
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,000
- Why?
- Maybe ours are color photos...

720
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,180
while only Haha's is
black and white.

721
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,910
- But to be honest, the teams...
- Yes?

722
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,950
- won't matter in the end.
- That's true.

723
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,340
- I agree.
- The individual role is important.

724
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,380
- That's right.
- We need to get a good character.

725
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,450
In the end, all we want is...

726
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,010
- to avoid the dog or the plant.
- Right. That's the point.

727
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,620
- All the other roles are okay.
- We just have to avoid those two.

728
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,620
All the others are the same.

729
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,160
Two of us will get
a penalty today...

730
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,160
- to put it simply.
- The results are out.

731
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,780
- He wrote the reasons as well.
- Okay.

732
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,780
The reasons too?

733
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,430
The member in first place is...

734
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:43,170
(The winner who will get 350 dollars
will be announced.)

735
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,750
- I'll tell you the reason first.
- Okay.

736
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,210
"He's dressed appropriately
to the time, place, and occasion."

737
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,880
"And he seemed confident
in his looks."

738
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,440
- It's Haha.
- Oh, yes!

739
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,180
- What did he say?
- I knew it.

740
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,360
Gosh, seriously.

741
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,830
Haha will receive 350 dollars.

742
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,420
- Haha is in first place.
- Oh, he had...

743
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,420
some cool poses.

744
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,530
Next, the member in second place.

745
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,190
- I see why.
- He must've done well.

746
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,920
"He struck cute poses
like a true comedian.

747
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,100
- I bet it's Se Chan.
- Yang Se Chan.

748
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,430
(2nd place, Yang Se Chan,
Cute poses like a true comedian)

749
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,930
- You two are on the same team.
- Right.

750
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,200
I'll receive a lot of money.

751
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,810
I don't care. It's okay.

752
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,550
- Next up is...
- My cute poses.

753
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,940
- the third place who'll join them.
- Right.

754
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,620
(The last person to join the team
of 3 members)

755
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,020
"A beautiful smile".

756
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,980
- Song Ji Hyo.
- Okay!

757
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,290
- That's great.
- Okay.

758
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,120
- This is good. It's not bad.
- This is great.

759
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,420
- We'll be a great team.
- Indeed.

760
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,420
(Ji Hyo with a beautiful smile is
in 3rd place.)

761
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,790
- Okay!
- That's great.

762
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,360
(Haha, Se Chan, and Ji Hyo
become one team.)

763
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,620
- We'll be a great team.
- Indeed.

764
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,370
- Ji Hyo became less loyal.
- This is a good thing.

765
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,230
- Hey, this is a good thing.
- There's nothing wrong...

766
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,570
This is a good thing.
If we team up together...

767
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,870
That's possible. You're right.

768
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,160
- If we team up together...
- Sounds great.

769
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,630
- That'd be great.
- Why?

770
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,750
I really hope that Jae Suk
and Jong Kook will be separated.

771
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,580
- If I team up with Jong Kook,
- Please let them be separated.

772
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,140
- we'll be invincible.
- We'll beat them all today.

773
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,140
- It'll be game over.
- Please.

774
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,880
- The member in fourth place.
- You and I won't turn in any money.

775
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,120
"She struck various poses
but they were a little too much."

776
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Jeon So Min.

777
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,720
Oh, okay. Jeon So Min.

778
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,300
- So Min, step aside.
- In fifth place, joining So Min...

779
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,560
- The fifth place.
- I really hope so.

780
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,030
"He didn't seem confident
in his outfit." Yoo Jae Suk.

781
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,840
That's a relief.

782
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,270
(5th place, Yoo Jae Suk,
Not confident in his outfit)

783
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,160
- Jae Suk.
- I'm glad I'm on your team.

784
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,930
- You're always confident.
- One million subscribers.

785
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,130
- I think he always looks confident.
- One million subscribers.

786
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,730
- That's weird.
- I didn't feel confident.

787
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,700
- He looked okay in his photos.
- The photographer saw that.

788
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,850
The member in sixth place.

789
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,120
"Too many cute poses,
lacks diversity". Kim Jong Kook.

790
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,640
The member in seventh place.

791
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,820
"I wish he had dressed younger."
Ji Suk Jin.

792
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,360
- How much younger must he dress?
- That's impossible.

793
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,420
Do you want me to wear
a newborn baby's clothes?

794
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,530
- You see, to be honest...
- How would that be possible?

795
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,830
You don't look younger than your age
in this outfit.

796
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,100
- Then how should I dress?
- I see what he means though.

797
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,570
I think that your stylist decided
to make you look funny.

798
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,570
I've seen that look in Gangnam.

799
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,200
- So...
- Gosh. I'm worried.

800
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,540
- The teams won't be changed.
- I'm in trouble.

801
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,630
- Okay.
- But... I mean...

802
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,440
- I wish I was on Jong Kook's team.
- I teamed up with Suk Jin.

803
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,940
- Suk Jin is...
- Let's turn in our money, okay?

804
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,640
Before we begin,

805
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,940
we'll put the money in your bags
and give you the bags.

806
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,940
- The hardest thing...
- We should do that.

807
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,520
about being on the same team
as So Min is...

808
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,710
to have a battle of wits.

809
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,710
- I've changed. You know that.
- Who will be Dalmatian?

810
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,150
- Nonsense. You haven't changed.
- Or green onion.

811
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,090
It's up to you.
But let's hand in just a little.

812
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,420
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

813
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,120
- Let's hand in a little.
- Hand in at least 50 dollars.

814
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,530
- That's a promise. It's not a lot.
- For your information,

815
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,920
- I promise.
- the amount that you gathered...

816
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,190
will be announced at the end.

817
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,430
- Hand in at least 50 dollars.
- Let's hand in just a little.

818
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,460
Even if I don't spend any,
you'd have the same amount as me.

819
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,900
- Promise to hand some in.
- Okay. I promise.

820
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,200
- That's a promise, okay?
- I already promised.

821
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,310
- Ji Hyo...
- We have the most money now.

822
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,730
You should hand in
at least 30 dollars.

823
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,940
- We might lose in the second game.
- True.

824
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,940
- Really. 50 from you, 100 from me.
- Let's do that.

825
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,640
- I'll hand 50 dollars in. Okay.
- Then both you and I...

826
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,440
- will begin with no money.
- Right. Okay.

827
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,120
We'll be on the same team
until the end of the day.

828
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,590
That's right.
We'll stick together until the end.

829
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,260
Se Chan,
hand in more than 30 dollars.

830
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,290
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

831
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,830
- You hand in more than 20 dollars.
- Come on. Hurry up.

832
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,560
Okay. Jae Suk,
this is very important.

833
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,830
- Just go already.
- It's so important.

834
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,260
- I said, hurry up.
- How much do you have? Shall I...

835
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,620
- give you 10 dollars?
- You guys won't keep your promises.

836
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,620
(Papillon is sowing
the seeds of distrust.)

837
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,000
Don't you think I know you guys?

838
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,540
I'm so nervous.

839
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,110
(Haha is the 1st to turn in
the team money.)

840
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,370
(Haha made his team members promise
to hand in even a little.)

841
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,900
Please hand in the money
to spend as your team money.

842
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,900
(How much money out of 350 dollars
will Haha hand in?)

843
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,910
(Rummaging around in the envelope,
he hands in the team money.)

844
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,680
Gosh. I met the wrong teammates.

845
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,830
There's a beggar on my team.
This is driving me nuts.

846
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,720
He's driving me crazy.
He stresses me out so much lately.

847
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,420
Do you know he acts like that
even when the cameras aren't around?

848
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,460
(He's been Haha's main cause
of stress.)

849
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,730
My gosh.

850
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,340
- I'll hand in some money.
- That's good.

851
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,270
I trusted you guys
and handed in the money.

852
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,930
I'll hand some in no matter what.

853
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,700
(Protruding Mouth Mario goes next.)

854
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,840
Haha, don't look.

855
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,170
Hey, hand in at least one bill.

856
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,750
Of course I'll do that.
I took out a whole bunch.

857
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,370
You don't have to do that.

858
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,440
(He doesn't expect that to happen.)

859
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,020
He doesn't trust me at all
these days.

860
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,060
(Se Chan, whom Haha distrusts,
also hands in the team money.)

861
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,680
I'm going next.

862
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,260
- Haha.
- One bill?

863
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,790
- What? No, 2 bills.
- 20 dollars?

864
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,030
- It's okay, right? What about you?
- Yes.

865
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,150
I turned in 40 dollars.

866
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,770
- That's a lie.
- So Min.

867
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,920
I really turned in 40 dollars.

868
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,420
How much did they turn in?

869
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,190
I'm not allowed to tell you that.

870
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,190
(Ji Hyo promised to hand in
even just a little.)

871
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,070
How much is it? Hold on.

872
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,130
- Ji Hyo! Hand in 20 dollars.
- At least 20 dollars.

873
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,900
At least pretend you're taking money
out of the envelope.

874
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,940
The individual money
is not important.

875
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,250
Hand in at least 20 dollars.
No, 30 dollars is too much.

876
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,940
- Can't you trust me?
- Just hand in 20 dollars.

877
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,440
- It's me. You can trust me.
- Okay.

878
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,520
(Can't you trust me? It's me!)

879
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,410
- I won't hand in any money for now.
- Okay.

880
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,980
(I won't hand in any money for now.)

881
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,560
(Ji Hyo didn't hand in any money!)

882
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,650
Ji Hyo!

883
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,330
- Please!
- At least open your bag...

884
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,560
Hand in just 20 dollars.

885
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,450
It's so hard to keep a secret here.

886
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,000
Ji Hyo, you didn't hand in anything.

887
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,370
- I did, Haha.
- Ji Hyo.

888
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,890
You should've handed in
at least 10 dollars.

889
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,130
(After Ji Hyo, who is dreaming
of a big twist at the end...)

890
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,540
This is my decision. Here.

891
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,630
(The 2 members of Team Jae Suk
are done too.)

892
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,930
- Go!
- Be reasonable.

893
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,730
- Okay. Let's go. Go now.
- I'm going.

894
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:41,840
- I'll keep my promise.
- 100 dollars.

895
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,940
I'm going to kill him
if he doesn't hand anything in.

896
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,250
(Jong Kook promised he'll have
his revenge.)

897
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,050
(And the leopard hands in
the team money.)

898
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,820
Suk Jin seems to have a hard time
making up his mind.

899
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,520
- Suk Jin, hand in the money!
- Suk Jin, hurry up and hand it in.

900
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,360
- It shouldn't take this long.
- I think...

901
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,320
- that he handed in 10 dollars,
- Good.

902
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,220
and then handed in 10 more.
20 dollars in total.

903
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,380
No, I handed in everything I had.

904
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,680
Oh, my. What is this?

905
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,830
(After changing into team uniforms,
they move to the next location.)

906
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,000
Where is my seat?

907
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,390
"Yoo Jae Suk", "Jeon So Min",
"Kim Jong Kook"... Oh, here.

908
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,190
Oh, my. This is a school chair.

909
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,160
This brings back old memories.

910
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,960
Is this product placement?
Tell me now.

911
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,110
- Yes.
- Okay.

912
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,080
Oh, my. That looks yummy.
I eat this so often.

913
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,200
I already like this.

914
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,310
It hasn't been released yet.

915
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,850
(The new snack was released
the day after the shoot.)

916
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,710
- It says it's tripe-flavored.
- Hey.

917
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,320
- Try it and...
- That's interesting.

918
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,520
(His nostrils flare
as wide as possible.)

919
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,090
- Does it really taste like tripe?
- Yes.

920
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,980
- It tastes like tripe.
- Many people will eat...

921
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,450
- My mouth is on fire.
- Hey.

922
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,530
Here comes the king
of product placement.

923
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,620
(Here comes the king
of product placement.)

924
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,540
(The man who calls himself the king
of product placement is here.)

925
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,810
The king of product placement
is here. Quiet down.

926
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,130
It's spicy, sweet, and salty.

927
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,930
Do you think that such simple words
like "spicy" or "salty"...

928
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,940
can describe this taste properly?

929
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,370
Then how should I describe it?
Please show me.

930
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,940
(Savoring)

931
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,290
So delicious.

932
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,980
- Is that it? Really?
- That's it.

933
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,910
- That's it.
- That's it.

934
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,360
- Oh, so delicious.
- That's it.

935
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,450
I like it!

936
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,530
- Hey.
- It's so good.

937
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,330
Stop showing the packaging
to the camera.

938
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,220
- Why?
- It doesn't look natural.

939
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,630
Try to hold it naturally.

940
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,370
- By the way...
- Do you think that looks natural?

941
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,110
- Does this look natural to you?
- Just try to look natural.

942
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,110
- Hey, hold it naturally.
- Hey.

943
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,840
Suk Jin,
you should let people see it.

944
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,810
- This would go well with rice.
- Seriously.

945
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:25,820
(This would go well with rice.)

946
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,350
- With rice?
- Why?

947
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,780
Is it too much?

948
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,620
But it tastes like tripe.

949
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,090
- I always eat tripe with rice.
- My gosh.

950
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,520
- You see...
- I'm not joking. I think...

951
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,760
We're supposed to cook this...

952
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,120
on a grill.

953
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,450
- We need a grill and charcoal.
- Excuse me. Give me a bowl of rice.

954
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,600
That will...

955
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,530
He carries it around with him.

956
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,040
I'm saving some for later.
I'll put it in my pocket.

957
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,800
I'll eat it later.

958
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,070
Hey.

959
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,130
It's hard to take it out,
and the chips will be crushed.

960
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,130
Then where should I put it?

961
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,350
(He puts it under his cap.)

962
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,550
Oh, my goodness. That's brilliant.

963
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,820
I'm impressed.

964
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,910
(He puts it under his cap.)

965
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,410
- You can't tell, can you?
- I can't tell.

966
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,910
- Goodness, you.
- Goodness, you.

967
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,520
The king of product placement.

968
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,830
The P-king.

969
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,150
The P-king. I'm called the king
of product placement.

970
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,330
That was brilliant.
I can't beat him.

971
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,270
All right. I'll give you
the first mission right away.

972
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,420
- Okay.
- We're using a computer again?

973
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,430
Why are you making me use
a computer...

974
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,500
when I don't know how to use it?

975
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,540
The first mission
where you can get...

976
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,700
- money for the auction is...
- We must do well.

977
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,110
Indoor World Trip.

978
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,130
- "World Trip"?
- What is it?

979
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,430
- I want to go on a trip.
- What?

980
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:31,370
It's a game where you play
using the street view...

981
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:34,020
of a map website that allows you
to look around the world online.

982
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,820
- Oh, the street view?
- But...

983
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,120
I don't even use
a car navigation app.

984
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,290
Click the street view button
and you can see all these photos.

985
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,710
You can look around the street.

986
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,790
- I know that.
- I use it from time to time.

987
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,030
It shows real-life images.

988
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,860
- Look at the map on your screen.
- Okay.

989
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:50,270
Type in any location in the world,
and you can look around the street.

990
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,630
(Type in the name of the city
of your choice.)

991
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,430
(Choose any street in the world.)

992
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,810
(You can get real-life images
of the streets.)

993
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:06,280
(You can also move around,
however you want!)

994
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,320
Can you see the keywords here?

995
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,880
Your team will get points
whenever you find them.

996
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,790
(Example, Keyword,
A person sleeping on a bench,)

997
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,790
(3 points)

998
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,690
(You got 3 points.)

999
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,120
Do we get five points for a giraffe?

1000
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,390
- Hold on.
- Five points?

1001
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,120
Aren't you good at this?

1002
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,190
A giraffe is worth five points?

1003
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,300
I don't know how to view this map.

1004
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,730
Type in the search word and...

1005
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,340
This is too difficult.

1006
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,110
- We should go for five points.
- I'm terrible at this.

1007
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,730
Just try your best.

1008
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,080
You can't look up any streets
in Korea though.

1009
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
- We can't?
- How about Serengeti National Park?

1010
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,850
I know how to use a smartphone...

1011
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,170
but not computers.

1012
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,120
How do you go backwards?

1013
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,640
- Backwards.
- Here.

1014
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,250
- Must I rotate the view?
- Yes, like that.

1015
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,880
How do you go backwards?

1016
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,030
Jong Kook and I are in big trouble.

1017
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,880
Neither of us
know how to operate this.

1018
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,530
A giraffe and a zebra.

1019
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,860
A fully geared-up soldier.

1020
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,770
First of all...

1021
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,500
- Find one worth 5 points.
- Go for 5 points.

1022
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,770
Head to Africa.

1023
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,230
Let me tell you
how to use the program.

1024
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,630
I can't see anything.

1025
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,160
Okay, let's get looking.

1026
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,230
I'm sure there's one here.

1027
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,510
- I'm at the zoo.
- Nairobi isn't a serviced area.

1028
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,700
I'm at the zoo.

1029
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,470
(New York)

1030
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:14,140
(Haha heads to New York first.)

1031
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,710
(He's mindlessly looking
at the streets of New York.)

1032
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,150
I can't head over
to the area nearby.

1033
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,750
I want to go that way.

1034
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,230
What's that?

1035
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,750
What's with the red car?

1036
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,420
- Any red car is worth a point.
- Here!

1037
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,900
- I found one.
- Show us.

1038
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,000
Over here.

1039
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,060
What? Already?

1040
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,460
(You already found one?)

1041
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,100
Over here.

1042
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,830
- What? Already?
- Isn't that in Korea?

1043
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,380
- No, it's in Brooklyn, New York.
- Over here!

1044
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,440
Haha, that is accepted.

1045
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,480
- I also found a red car!
- Okay.

1046
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,710
Haha, that is accepted.

1047
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,750
- I also found a red car!
- Okay.

1048
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,440
- The point has been taken.
- It's been taken?

1049
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,420
You should've told me sooner.

1050
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,580
What else then?

1051
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,460
- Tell me.
- They told us earlier.

1052
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,580
Has the game already begun?

1053
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,830
Tell me what's on the list.

1054
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,250
A busker, a jogger...

1055
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,690
How can one find all these?

1056
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,370
Think where you'll find these
and it'll be easier.

1057
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Hold on a second.

1058
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,770
- Let's head to New York.
- Hold on a second.

1059
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:11,060
(New York?)

1060
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,730
Are we only allowed
to go for one point only?

1061
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,810
- That was worth one point.
- I mean,

1062
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,380
- can we go for other keywords?
- Sure.

1063
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,770
(New York stroller)

1064
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:24,540
(New York: no reviews)

1065
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,880
(New York jogging)

1066
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,480
("Jogging" turned up a search.)

1067
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,650
How can one find these?

1068
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,500
- Central Park?
- Take an educated guess.

1069
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,670
Go to a place where you know
a lot of people go jogging.

1070
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,830
Hold on a second.

1071
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,960
- You can only score once, right?
- Yes, take it and it's yours.

1072
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,210
Wait, over there.

1073
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,830
- Me!
- What are those people in uniforms?

1074
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,210
- Show us.
- Here.

1075
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,040
- No way.
- I have one.

1076
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,710
Where did you find them?

1077
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,210
- It's worth five points too.
- Let me see.

1078
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,310
- Did you find any?
- In Central Park.

1079
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,380
You can find everything
in Central Park.

1080
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,620
- Really?
- Head there.

1081
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,210
Where?

1082
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,230
A boyfriend taking a photo
of his girlfriend.

1083
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,920
Shouldn't that be worth more points?

1084
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,500
- Exactly.
- You'll find a lot there.

1085
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,270
- Where there are a lot of people.
- In Africa or Kenya.

1086
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,290
- I think I'll find an elephant.
- Wait a second.

1087
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,830
How do you get over there?

1088
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,730
I just pointed to a location
and got inside a mall.

1089
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,960
- I found a stroller!
- Show me.

1090
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,100
A stroller.

1091
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,400
(He's worked up.)

1092
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,810
- A stroller.
- Show me.

1093
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,710
Here's a stroller.

1094
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,210
- That's acceptable.
- Nice.

1095
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,270
Hold on a second.

1096
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,790
- A stroller.
- An alligator.

1097
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,420
- I found a stroller.
- Can it be from a zoo?

1098
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,750
- I think there will be one there.
- Where?

1099
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,690
Guys, I lost my way.

1100
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:36,830
And an elephant.

1101
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,250
I was at a place
with many people earlier.

1102
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,420
(He looks around,
but there's no one there.)

1103
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,350
I was at a park earlier
with lots of people.

1104
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,960
An alligator. Can it be from a zoo?

1105
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,270
Hold on a second.
I'm in a parking lot.

1106
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,960
I'm trapped in a parking lot.

1107
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,630
I'm trapped in a parking lot.

1108
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,710
(Nothing's around.)

1109
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,210
I'm trapped in a parking lot.

1110
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,810
Don't get trapped in places.

1111
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,210
But I'm trapped in a parking lot.

1112
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,650
- He's trapped in a parking lot.
- What do I do?

1113
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,440
I can't get out of this place.

1114
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,690
There aren't any people around.

1115
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,880
Was this taken
in the middle of the night?

1116
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,290
Why isn't anyone around?

1117
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,350
- No one's around.
- Is this mall in Zombie City?

1118
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,480
- Not a single person is around.
- What is this?

1119
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,560
Where on earth am I?

1120
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,060
- Why is it so spacious?
- Which neighborhood are you in?

1121
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,060
- I'm currently in Kenya.
- The zoo.

1122
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,600
Kenya? Oh, please...

1123
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,560
I found an RV!

1124
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,670
- Show me.
- Hold on.

1125
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,580
I can't swing the view that way.

1126
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,000
Must I see it like this instead?

1127
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,810
How does one change the view?

1128
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,080
Can you keep it down?

1129
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,670
But there's an RV here.

1130
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,880
- I'm almost there.
- Here!

1131
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,250
Stay put, will you?

1132
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,520
- It's from Honolulu.
- Accepted.

1133
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,650
Okay.

1134
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,960
(After hard work,
he finds an RV from Honolulu.)

1135
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,850
Why can't I only spot those
worth one point?

1136
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,020
Isn't there someone on their phone?

1137
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,500
- Let's do this.
- Can someone answer Suk Jin?

1138
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,790
Why are you making him
talk to himself like that?

1139
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,940
- Let's head elsewhere.
- We're a team, guys.

1140
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,270
We recently lost a member as it is.

1141
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,500
- Go elsewhere.
- Be good to those who are left.

1142
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,600
Unbelievable.

1143
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,080
It's supposed to be
a wildlife sanctuary,

1144
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,270
so where are all the animals?

1145
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,920
There aren't any animals in the zoo.

1146
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,750
- Can you believe it?
- The zoo...

1147
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,920
I'm in Kenya at the moment,

1148
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,420
but I don't know where.

1149
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,080
- Why...
- I want...

1150
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,850
to be in Nairobi. The National Park.

1151
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,060
Why can't I see any people?

1152
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,350
Where in Kenya am I?

1153
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,020
Ji Hyo, find one, will you?

1154
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,960
Wait. I think I stumbled onto one.

1155
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,020
Which one?

1156
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,370
(He clicked on a random street.)

1157
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,040
Haha and Se Chan
scored seven points.

1158
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,370
- Don't we have five points?
- Jae Suk, do better.

1159
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,000
(He's on a road in Colorado.)

1160
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,980
(What?)

1161
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,750
- Which one?
- I stumbled onto something.

1162
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,400
Look. I found cows!

1163
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,880
- Is cow on the list?
- A cow.

1164
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,040
- Yes.
- It's on the list.

1165
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,440
- A cow.
- I stumbled onto one.

1166
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,690
- A cow.
- Show him.

1167
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,150
Look. I found a cow.

1168
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,650
- Please confirm.
- A yellow school bus?

1169
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,350
(Jae Suk urgently
looks for a school bus.)

1170
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,880
Here. Someone is reading!

1171
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,850
- Over here.
- Wait.

1172
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,960
- This person is reading.
- I found a horse.

1173
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,600
A street in New York...

1174
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,670
has its name written in Korean.

1175
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:04,230
- You're right. That's not it.
- See?

1176
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,000
- No?
- It's not actually written there.

1177
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,940
It's just like that on your screen.

1178
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,710
It's just a tool
to help you navigate.

1179
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,120
It's just like that on your screen.

1180
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,810
It's just a tool
to help you navigate.

1181
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:16,880
That's computer graphics.

1182
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,480
She understood me though.

1183
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,790
Over here!

1184
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,080
Just so you know, I use a map
made by a Korean company.

1185
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,290
(He's proud of Korean culture
and even our maps.)

1186
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,230
(He looks around
the familiar Montgomery Street.)

1187
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,170
Wait. I think this is a school bus.

1188
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,540
- A school bus!
- Did you find one?

1189
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,940
- A school bus.
- Is there one?

1190
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,230
- No way.
- I found one.

1191
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,230
- Nicely done.
- Here it is.

1192
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,400
He found one.

1193
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,540
I did, right?

1194
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,940
Okay. A yellow school bus.

1195
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,940
- Ji Hyo, find one, will you?
- Got it. Just a second.

1196
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,650
Why aren't there...

1197
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,120
any animals in the zoo?

1198
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,520
The view is slightly distorted.

1199
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,480
- Hey, Se Chan.
- Here.

1200
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,250
I'm almost at Starbucks.

1201
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,380
That's a school bus, right?

1202
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,750
- I can only see roads.
- Okay. A yellow school bus.

1203
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,690
Wild animals...

1204
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,920
- Why are there no parked cars?
- What on earth?

1205
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,870
Wait. Why am I in Itaewon?

1206
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,500
- Itaewon.
- Korea isn't allowed.

1207
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,940
Head to Italy instead.

1208
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,040
What's this?

1209
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,600
Here!

1210
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,440
Someone getting a ticket
from a police officer.

1211
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,630
Did you really find one?

1212
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,480
- Here. Do you see the officers?
- Is there one?

1213
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,020
Here. Do you see the officers?

1214
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,210
(He spotted three
French police officers.)

1215
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,270
Look.

1216
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,020
Someone's getting a ticket.

1217
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,290
It's the police.

1218
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,580
- Come on.
- The police.

1219
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,880
- That isn't what's happening.
- So he lied.

1220
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,380
Are you kidding me?

1221
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,580
- He's a fraud.
- Over here!

1222
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,670
I should go where
there are a lot of parked cars.

1223
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,900
Guys, I'm underground.

1224
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,600
- I want to go back up.
- Hey.

1225
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,210
- Look.
- I've been there myself.

1226
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,310
You can't escape from that place.

1227
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,170
Once you're in, you can't get out.

1228
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,310
How do you go back above ground?

1229
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,270
I'm heading to Broadway.

1230
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,040
Don't be ridiculous.

1231
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,880
Are you kidding me?

1232
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:01,080
Wait, I found Starbucks.

1233
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,350
Someone with a coffee to-go.

1234
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,750
Here. Look at this.

1235
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,190
That's not Starbucks.

1236
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,460
- Look.
- It's Ediya Coffee.

1237
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,750
It's not Starbucks.

1238
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,630
This isn't Starbucks.

1239
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,630
- It's not.
- Check out the straw!

1240
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,870
The green one. Nice.

1241
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,230
It might be from
Ediya Coffee though.

1242
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,480
The straw is green.

1243
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,380
(The Empty Head enjoys Broadway
with a surge of confidence.)

1244
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,810
Where do I find
a soldier in full gear?

1245
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,880
Maybe Iraq.

1246
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,270
I found someone doing cosplay.

1247
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,980
Over here.

1248
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:34,060
This is Suk Jin
when he goes to the airport.

1249
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,620
(Suk Jin at the airport)

1250
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,850
That doesn't count.

1251
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,730
This is Suk Jin
when he goes to the airport.

1252
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,350
That's how he styles himself.

1253
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,060
What's he wearing?

1254
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,330
Look. This is what
you wear to the beach.

1255
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,440
(The humble style Suk Jin enjoys
when he goes abroad?)

1256
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,730
- Is that not allowed?
- What was it?

1257
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:48,960
He's more stylish, so no.

1258
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,830
(It's not allowed because
he's more stylish than Suk Jin.)

1259
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,730
Because he's more stylish?

1260
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,830
That was harsh.

1261
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,400
- Unbelievable.
- Let's try again.

1262
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,980
That's funny though.
"He's more stylish."

1263
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,440
I found something!

1264
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:02,980
- Hold on.
- Okay.

1265
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,150
A zebra!

1266
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,620
- What?
- I found a zebra!

1267
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,750
A zebra!

1268
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,480
I found zebra.

1269
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,980
- Over here.
- Zebra?

1270
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,060
- Here.
- That is accepted.

1271
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,460
(Kenya scores 5 points
while traveling in Kenya.)

1272
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,830
Las Vegas.

1273
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,190
Where's Bluebird?

1274
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,270
(Jong Kook is now in Las Vegas.)

1275
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,290
Downtown Las Vegas.

1276
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,400
Get going.

1277
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,060
I remember this place.
I totally remember!

1278
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,370
Do you mean the street?

1279
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,730
This isn't the time
to enjoy the view, you know.

1280
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,040
The outlet in Las Vegas.

1281
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,310
(Reminiscing)

1282
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,850
I totally remember.

1283
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,940
This isn't the time to reminisce.

1284
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,650
I parked here and walked.

1285
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,580
Try finding an alligator instead.

1286
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,960
Why did you even go
to an outlet in Las Vegas...

1287
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,560
when you only buy the same things?

1288
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,980
T-shirts that cost 20 dollars.

1289
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:47,560
Why are the cars
all parked so neatly?

1290
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,730
I found a soldier.

1291
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:50,870
- What?
- Let me see.

1292
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,630
(A soldier worth 5 points?)

1293
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,900
- What?
- Let me see.

1294
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,690
- The soldier must be armed.
- And in full gear.

1295
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:56,830
Does the soldier have a gun?

1296
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,870
(An armed soldier in full gear)

1297
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,440
- And in full gear.
- Does the soldier have a gun?

1298
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,670
This person isn't a soldier.

1299
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:02,940
This person isn't a soldier.

1300
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,750
- Someone doing cosplay!
- I already found one.

1301
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,750
(Se Chan already found a cosplayer.)

1302
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,770
One was already found.

1303
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:08,850
The soldier...

1304
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,190
doesn't have a gun,

1305
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,420
but there's a pot in front of him.

1306
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,810
It's to collect money!

1307
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,460
One to collect money.

1308
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,690
Cosplayers ask for money, remember?

1309
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,000
- It had on a uniform.
- She found a cosplayer.

1310
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,850
He doesn't have a gun on him.

1311
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,170
- He has that pot to ask for money.
- Maybe it was the Armed Forces Day.

1312
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,190
- I found it!
- It must be somewhere.

1313
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,330
It's looking good.

1314
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,310
- Let's play for 10 more minutes.
- It's a flamingo.

1315
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:33,310
No, that won't do.

1316
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,540
I remember this place.

1317
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,830
(He found a place
to reminisce about.)

1318
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,310
I want to go there.

1319
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,310
I think you'll be able to
find yourself on the streets of LA.

1320
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,460
He's issuing a ticket!

1321
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,750
Wait a minute.

1322
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,460
He's...

1323
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,690
Can I go to a zoo?

1324
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,790
Here it is! A person reading a book.

1325
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,670
- Over here.
- I was going to find it.

1326
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,870
Look at this person.

1327
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,960
I'm certain.
She is reading a book, right?

1328
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,960
(It looks like
she's reading a leaflet.)

1329
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,400
She is. She is reading a book.

1330
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,400
It needs to be precise.

1331
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,100
Can't it look like they're reading
a book from the back?

1332
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,880
- But she's reading something. Look!
- They said it has to be precise.

1333
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,880
But look at her!

1334
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,040
- It needs to be clear.
- Fine, I'll show it from the front.

1335
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,150
The streets of New York...

1336
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,190
The people who have found
the least number of search words...

1337
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,060
are Suk Jin and Ji Hyo.

1338
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:22,620
- What?
- Hold on. I'll find one.

1339
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,500
Wait! Isn't this a little vague?

1340
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,460
- Why does he...
- I think it's naturally taken!

1341
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,870
Why does he keep saying that?

1342
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,290
It looks like he's taking
a photo of another woman.

1343
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:34,670
(A man taking a photo
of his girlfriend)

1344
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,940
He's pushing a stroller, but he's
taking a photo of another woman.

1345
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,000
(He's looking at the women.)

1346
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,040
- Gosh, why can't I...
- We'll give you five more minutes.

1347
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,770
- Only five minutes?
- Let us play longer.

1348
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,310
- Yes, let's do that.
- But it's fun.

1349
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,750
- It's actually fun.
- It is.

1350
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,480
- It brings back memories.
- It's nice.

1351
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,980
I want to visit France.

1352
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,440
(It feels like the thirst to travel
is being quenched.)

1353
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:52,920
I really want to go.

1354
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,250
I had so much fun here.

1355
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,830
It feels like I'm on a trip.

1356
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,080
(We hope we'll be able to shoot
our episode abroad soon.)

1357
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,020
It makes me want to go on a trip.

1358
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,000
- I really want to go.
- It's nice to travel indirectly.

1359
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,190
I should do this
when I'm bored at home.

1360
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,370
I found it! This is incredible!

1361
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:10,000
There's a woman waving her hand!

1362
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,370
(Haha found a woman waving her hand
at the camera.)

1363
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:12,710
A woman is waving her hand
at the camera!

1364
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,310
There's a woman waving her hand!

1365
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,600
A woman is waving her hand
at the camera!

1366
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,600
- We accept it.
- This lady...

1367
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,150
She's actually waving at the camera.

1368
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:22,150
You earned five points.

1369
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,850
Look at this!
She's really waving her hand.

1370
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:25,080
- We got it.
- She really is.

1371
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,980
- My gosh.
- Will you keep quiet?

1372
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:27,980
- Here, look.
- There's no bird?

1373
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:28,980
- It must be somewhere.
- I found it.

1374
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,980
I should go there.

1375
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,690
- We should find a bird.
- A bird is...

1376
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,960
- Jae Suk.
- Where are you?

1377
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,750
There could be birds on the streets.

1378
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,920
Take a look around the sky.
There could be one.

1379
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,330
Yes, you can find one that way.

1380
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,330
- Five people...
- Haha.

1381
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,790
- I found a bird!
- You found one?

1382
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,560
It's tiny, but it's here!

1383
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,630
Isn't that an airplane?

1384
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,270
Come on, that can't be
considered as a bird.

1385
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:47,330
- It's a bird!
- A bird!

1386
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,000
- It's a bird!
- But that's...

1387
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,600
- It's a plastic bag!
- No, it's not.

1388
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,310
- It's a bird.
- It's a plastic bag.

1389
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:53,480
- No, it's not.
- It is a bird.

1390
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,880
- It's a bird.
- Take a look, Seon Myung.

1391
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,380
- It's a plastic bag.
- Take a look.

1392
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,750
- No, it's a plastic bag.
- You can see its wings, right?

1393
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,020
- Seon Myung, it's a plastic bag.
- It needs to be clear.

1394
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,210
- It's not a bird.
- A bird.

1395
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,620
- It's a bird! It is a bird!
- What do you mean? It's a bird!

1396
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,630
- It's a plastic bag.
- Let me zoom in.

1397
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,460
- She says it's not a bird.
- No, it is a bird.

1398
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,020
- Come on, Seon Myung.
- It's not a bird.

1399
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,290
- It's a bird!
- It's a bird. Look at this.

1400
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,420
Seon Myung, come here.

1401
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,670
- It's a bird!
- It's a bird. Look at this.

1402
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:13,870
Seon Myung, come here.

1403
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,230
- It's a bird!
- Come here!

1404
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,330
- It needs to be clear!
- It's so clear!

1405
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:19,880
- It's clear. It has wings.
- It's clearly a bird. It's a bird!

1406
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,000
- It's a bird. Look.
- Seon Myung, it's a bird.

1407
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,500
If it's not clear,
then it's not a bird.

1408
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,170
- It's a plastic bag.
- No, it's a bird.

1409
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:26,670
- You can see its wings.
- It needs to be 100 percent clear.

1410
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:29,650
- No! It's not a plastic bag. Look.
- No! It has a tail and a beak.

1411
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:31,210
We've already confirmed
that it's not a bird.

1412
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:33,560
No, Seon Myung can't see it clearly.

1413
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,810
It looks like a UFO.

1414
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:36,250
It's clearly a bird.
Isn't it, Yun Sang?

1415
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,830
- It has wings. It is a bird.
- It is a bird.

1416
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,730
But she said it's not a bird.

1417
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:43,690
What's with her? What's wrong
with Namkoong Seon Myung?

1418
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,870
How can this not be a bird?

1419
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,400
- It's a plastic bag.
- Come on.

1420
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,000
Are you insane?

1421
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,370
My gosh, a group of people
is waving their hands.

1422
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,710
(A group of people is
waving their hands at the camera.)

1423
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:56,600
Shouldn't you triple the points
I got?

1424
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,850
Look at this!
I found a good one, right?

1425
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:03,310
- I think there could be one.
- They're going crazy!

1426
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,520
They keep waving their hands
at the camera!

1427
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:09,350
- Stop looking for them.
- Stop looking for those people.

1428
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,980
I found someone
waving their hand at the camera too.

1429
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,080
There are many people...

1430
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,460
- waving their hands.
- You found them already.

1431
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,600
I think it'll be easy
to find a train.

1432
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,690
It's rather easy to find a train.

1433
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:20,600
But where could it be?

1434
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:23,440
- Don't you know where they are?
- No.

1435
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,810
(Their talk somehow
hurts Se Chan's pride.)

1436
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,600
Why don't you look up
somewhere like France stations?

1437
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,230
- Right.
- Or go to Switzerland.

1438
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,900
I'm at the train station in Moscow.

1439
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,040
Look. I'll find one.

1440
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,940
This is a train station,
but I don't see any trains.

1441
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,690
- How frustrating.
- This is driving me crazy.

1442
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,480
There's no train.

1443
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,150
(There's no train
at a train station in Switzerland.)

1444
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,210
How come there's no train?

1445
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,850
But we found a lot already.

1446
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:47,330
- Right.
- They found a lot already.

1447
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,670
There must be a train. It's
a train station. One should be here.

1448
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,060
Isn't there a train coming?

1449
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,060
(They're still looking for trains
that seem easy to find.)

1450
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,630
This isn't easy.

1451
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,230
- All right.
- You found one?

1452
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,540
I found it.

1453
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,460
- Here it is! I found a train!
- A train!

1454
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,580
- I found one too.
- A train!

1455
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,580
I found a train.

1456
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,580
(So Min only targeted Moscow
from the beginning.)

1457
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,880
I found it.

1458
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,540
- Here it is! I found a train!
- A train!

1459
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,210
- I found one too.
- A train!

1460
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,540
(Jae Suk also headed to Russia.)

1461
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,150
(He found a red train.)

1462
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,310
A train.

1463
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:15,850
- A train!
- We accept it.

1464
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,350
Vladivostok!

1465
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,850
- I looked up " Railroad Museum".
- A train.

1466
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:21,560
Time's up now.

1467
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,960
This wraps up...

1468
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,060
We have a higher score though.

1469
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,670
Team Suk Jin got four points.

1470
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,830
(Team Suk Jin is in the last place
with 4 points.)

1471
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,330
What did you two do?

1472
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,960
Jong Kook just enjoyed his trip.

1473
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,940
Jong Kook earned 3 points,
and Suk Jin got 1 point.

1474
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,480
And the team in second place...

1475
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:38,770
There's only one point difference.

1476
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:39,850
(Which team placed 2nd
with only 1 point difference?)

1477
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,620
The team in 2nd place
earned 18 points.

1478
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,380
(Is it Team Haha or Team Jae Suk?)

1479
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,150
The team in 2nd place
with 18 points is...

1480
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,290
- It's Team Haha.
- Oh, really?

1481
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:49,790
(Team Haha is in 2nd place
with 18 points.)

1482
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:52,130
(We're in 2nd place?)

1483
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,190
(Team Jae Suk succeeds in
turning the tables.)

1484
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:55,920
Team Jae Suk is in 1st place
with 19 points.

1485
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,130
They succeeded in finding a train.

1486
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,460
They found a lot toward the end.

1487
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:01,000
It wasn't a fair game.
He's not good with computers.

1488
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,230
It really wasn't fair.

1489
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,330
Team Jae Suk
will take 300 dollars each.

1490
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,100
Team Haha
will take 200 dollars each.

1491
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,170
And Team Suk Jin
will take 100 dollars each.

1492
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,270
We'll give you the money,
Team Jae Suk.

1493
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:13,750
(It's time to turn in
money for their team.)

1494
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:14,850
You can give
the whole amount, right?

1495
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,580
I will pay the whole amount
and I did too earlier.

1496
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,210
- Will you do that this time too?
- Yes, I will.

1497
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:19,420
(Jong Kook is determined to pay
the whole amount.)

1498
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,980
- Should we give just 100 dollars?
- Sorry?

1499
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,460
Should we give just 100 dollars?

1500
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,790
- Let's pay 150 dollars each.
- 150? To be safe?

1501
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:29,460
I think it would be better
if our team...

1502
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,000
- Team Jae Suk, you can go first.
- has more money.

1503
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,440
(So Min sets off.)

1504
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,190
(Will So Min give 150 dollars?)

1505
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,870
- One bundle is 50 dollars, right?
- Yes.

1506
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,830
We decided to pay 150 dollars.

1507
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:42,270
So I'll just give 50 dollars.

1508
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,710
Just 50 dollars? Okay.

1509
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,040
(She paid only 50 dollars
out of 300 dollars.)

1510
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,580
All right, thank you.

1511
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:48,250
Jae Suk, it's your turn.

1512
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,440
So Min, I'm carrying
the whole thing.

1513
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,040
Sure. I gave the whole amount.

1514
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,350
- I'm carrying it.
- I gave the whole amount.

1515
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,850
I'll pay the whole amount.

1516
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:56,250
That's how I am.

1517
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,020
- You should do the same.
- I don't have it!

1518
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,250
Did So Min pay 150 dollars?

1519
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,130
We can't tell you that.

1520
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,150
(With suspicious eyes,
Jae Suk hands in his money too.)

1521
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,730
I paid 40 dollars, and you paid
20 dollars earlier, right?

1522
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,170
You paid 20 dollars too?
Or was it 10 dollars?

1523
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,940
- I paid 20 dollars.
- 20 dollars?

1524
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,400
- I paid 20 dollars.
- Then that's 40 dollars.

1525
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,130
- I think that's enough.
- Then who will pay this time?

1526
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,710
I'm so glad I'm not with them.

1527
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,130
My head will explode.

1528
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:18,350
- I'll hand in everything.
- Of course.

1529
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,480
Do you mean it?

1530
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,040
(After the breathtaking
mind game...)

1531
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,150
Should I turn in mine this time?

1532
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,080
If you seriously... Trust me.

1533
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,150
Haha.

1534
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:28,790
Trust me this time. I'm going to
hand in this for our team.

1535
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,290
I'll hand it in just like this.

1536
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:33,130
I get headaches
when I'm on the same team as Haha.

1537
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,690
- Haha, if you...
- I'll hand it in for real.

1538
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,250
Don't you dare lie to us.
We're paying 150 dollars.

1539
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,290
You better turn the whole thing in.

1540
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,900
(Haha took out the money
he's paying. How much could it be?)

1541
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,440
Se Chan, don't try to fool us.

1542
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:47,830
(With Ji Hyo's nagging, Se Chan
nonchalantly hands in the money.)

1543
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,540
(Ji Hyo also hands in the money...)

1544
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:54,170
(without hesitation.)

1545
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:56,790
(She's handing in only 50 dollars?)

1546
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,690
(She even contemplated
taking out 10 dollars.)

1547
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:04,150
(Ji Hyo's decision to survive
among the cheating men.)

1548
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,420
Ji Hyo, why is your team
making it so complicated?

1549
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:10,870
Jae Suk, they're all frauds.

1550
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:13,400
They're frauds, I can't trust them.

1551
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,600
I'll go first.

1552
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:17,060
Jong Kook has given up already.

1553
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,870
(How will this mind game end?)

1554
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,670
Here's the next mission.

1555
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:22,670
- We need to win this.
- What is it?

1556
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:25,040
It's the last chance
for you to earn the money.

1557
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,040
- Really?
- It's our last chance?

1558
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,210
- It's already the last mission?
- What?

1559
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:30,940
This mission is called
You Can Tell From the Eyes.

1560
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,940
(The last mission,
You Can Tell From the Eyes)

1561
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:35,650
The team that isn't playing
will see the words...

1562
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,920
that the other team has to
guess correctly.

1563
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,190
Let's say the words Team Haha
has to guess...

1564
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,460
- are apple, carrot, and onion.
- Okay.

1565
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:44,230
Then the other team
will see those words in advance.

1566
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,540
Then the team that isn't playing
can pick five words...

1567
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,870
they want to ban.

1568
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:51,000
So that they can't use those words?

1569
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,270
The words for our team?

1570
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,170
If the team playing uses
the banned words,

1571
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:57,980
- 20 seconds will be added.
- When we describe the words?

1572
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,940
If "you know" is banned,
we can't use those words.

1573
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,940
Let's say the word is "camera".
You can ban them...

1574
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,150
from using
a word like "electronics".

1575
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,920
We can ban exact words?

1576
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,960
That'd be nice.

1577
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,980
It's difficult.

1578
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,350
You can't ban exclamations
or pronouns.

1579
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,380
Got it.

1580
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,460
- Only words?
- Yes.

1581
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,290
How about a word like "that"?

1582
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:17,560
- You can't ban conjunctions.
- We can only ban words?

1583
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,870
You can't ban any conjunctions
needed to explain.

1584
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,330
- We can't ban infinitives?
- No, you can't.

1585
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:23,830
We'll give you a paper to write down
the words you want to ban.

1586
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:25,540
We can choose five each, right?

1587
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,100
(Team Jae Suk: Yi Sun Sin,
Ji Suk Jin, spring rolls)

1588
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,170
- That's right.
- They'll guess these words.

1589
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,710
We need to ban the words
they might use to explain.

1590
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,850
These are the words
that they will guess.

1591
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:34,980
The words here.

1592
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,420
They can avoid using these words.

1593
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,310
- How about banning "politics"?
- What?

1594
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,420
- "Politics"?
- It's related to "president".

1595
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:42,210
- They can use that word.
- How about "national assembly"?

1596
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,830
- Won't they use this word?
- They won't use that word.

1597
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:45,920
Right.

1598
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,920
(They're certain Team Haha won't
use the word, national assembly.)

1599
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,130
No, they won't use this word.

1600
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:49,250
- No, they won't.
- They won't use that word.

1601
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,330
How about "commander-in-chief"?

1602
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:54,940
They don't know that word!

1603
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,040
- They don't?
- Of course not. There's no way.

1604
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,770
- Let's use this then.
- They don't know that word at all.

1605
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,900
They'll never use that word
their whole lives.

1606
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:03,310
My gosh.

1607
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,770
(Team Empty Head
is completely looked down upon.)

1608
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,850
- Let's use this one.
- Shall we? Okay.

1609
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,210
The words they might use...

1610
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,210
There aren't that many.

1611
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,940
Even when they need to use
technical terms,

1612
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,560
- I don't think they will.
- We keep saying this.

1613
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,290
"They don't know this word."

1614
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:18,920
(They can't tell how empty
their heads are.)

1615
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:19,980
- I think so too.
- Right.

1616
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,900
- Yes, yes.
- I got it. How about this one?

1617
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,400
- How's this?
- Yes!

1618
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,600
(They try to come up with words
with little knowledge they have.)

1619
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,830
You're so smart!

1620
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,310
- Oh, the other way around?
- Yes, that's right.

1621
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,540
I think Jae Suk and So Min...

1622
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,600
(They'll use this word for sure.)

1623
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,250
(Jae Suk knows Suk Jin
through and through.)

1624
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,850
(Which words did he choose to ban?)

1625
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:45,580
(Empty Heads
are having a serious meeting.)

1626
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,620
What about this?
Let's use the opposite word of this.

1627
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,880
It's this one,

1628
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,520
- but they think it's the other one.
- Good idea.

1629
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,920
- Right?
- Yes.

1630
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:53,730
(Bursting into laughter)

1631
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,460
- Right?
- I'm sorry,

1632
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,520
but are you guys scientists?

1633
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,190
- Are you?
- Who's the leader among you?

1634
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,630
- Who's the leader among you?
- Who's the leader?

1635
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:01,830
Who's the boss?

1636
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:03,830
It's Haha. He's the smartest one.

1637
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:05,600
Excuse me. You there with a beard.

1638
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,310
You there with a messy beard.

1639
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:10,210
- I think he meant you.
- Do you think...

1640
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,650
He meant Ji Hyo?

1641
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:13,310
(Haha disses Ji Hyo.)

1642
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,020
You're the one with the beard?

1643
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,540
- Yes.
- The one with a messy beard?

1644
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,210
- I was talking about him.
- She has some peach fuzz.

1645
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,210
- Sorry?
- What is it?

1646
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:22,080
The one who has hair
everywhere on his face.

1647
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:23,850
Get a pencil...

1648
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,850
Ask Young Jin for a pencil...

1649
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:28,630
- and...
- Call Kwang Soo!

1650
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:31,420
He keeps picking on me
because Kwang Soo is not here.

1651
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,870
(The prankster found another target
to tease.)

1652
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,170
He doesn't go along with Jae Suk.

1653
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:37,770
We need to use this word
for this too.

1654
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:39,440
I got a call.

1655
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,500
(I got a call.)

1656
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,540
Put him on speakerphone.

1657
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,940
Yes, you!

1658
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,500
- What is it?
- The one with a beard.

1659
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,040
You with a messy beard.

1660
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,040
You called the wrong person.

1661
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,420
Let me say just one more thing.

1662
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,080
Get off your high horse.

1663
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,120
(Very tired of him)

1664
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,020
There, I'm done.
Now I feel a lot better.

1665
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:58,580
Please submit your papers now.

1666
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:00,650
- Should we go first?
- Yes, Team Suk Jin will go first.

1667
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:03,400
It's fun though.
I'm getting nervous!

1668
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,870
We don't have a strategy at all.

1669
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,600
We don't need one. Let's just play.

1670
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,600
- Just trust me.
- You need to be witty.

1671
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,830
I'll explain it well.

1672
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:11,600
- You did a good job.
- You did really well.

1673
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,000
- All right.
- They did?

1674
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,440
They wrote the banned words
for our team?

1675
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,670
Yes, they're the ones.

1676
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:17,600
Ready, start.

1677
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,770
Let's do this. Let's do it.

1678
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:21,020
Let's go. We can do this.

1679
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,670
Darn it.

1680
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,210
(Banned words: Youn Yuh Jung,
seafood soup, plant,)

1681
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:25,210
(vegetable, forsythia)

1682
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:26,290
Just take it easy!

1683
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,580
(Given word: Minari,
which means water parsley)

1684
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,020
(Jong Kook has to describe the word
without using the banned words.)

1685
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,480
Just step on the mine!
You only need to step on it once.

1686
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,330
You only need to step on it once.

1687
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,650
- You need to give up one.
- The clock is ticking.

1688
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:37,770
Vegetable!

1689
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,670
(He used the word "vegetable".)

1690
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,690
(He uses the banned word
as soon as he started.)

1691
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:42,290
Zucchini. Lettuce.

1692
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,040
Sesame leaf.

1693
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,400
- Vegetable wrap. Pork belly?
- He must use the other words.

1694
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,830
- Meat.
- You might end up...

1695
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:48,830
saying all the banned words.

1696
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:49,830
(You might end up
saying all the banned words.)

1697
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,250
- Be careful.
- We're running out of time.

1698
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,270
Hurry up!

1699
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,850
(They're having so much fun.)

1700
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:57,690
- Did you watch Tae Hyun's movie?
- What?

1701
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,920
The movie Tae Hyun was in.

1702
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,650
- Tae... Taeyeon?
- You can't use gestures.

1703
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,380
- Taeyeon? Which one?
- Yes.

1704
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:03,850
- I meant Cha Tae Hyun. His movie.
- Oh, him?

1705
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:05,580
- You need to stop talking.
- He's very calm.

1706
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:06,580
- He's very calm.
- He told Suk Jin to stop talking.

1707
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,500
He told him to stop talking
when he needs to get the answer.

1708
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:10,600
- "Hello Ghost".
- Yes, I did.

1709
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,670
- In the last scene, in gimbap...
- The last scene?

1710
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,130
- It's in the gimbap.
- His father is a taxi driver.

1711
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,040
Because of what's inside the gimbap,

1712
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:19,100
Tae Hyun finds out the truth
in the end.

1713
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,600
What was inside the gimbap?
I watched the movie 10 years ago.

1714
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,770
You can't expect him to remember it!
Just say the words!

1715
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:27,440
He can't even remember
what he had yesterday.

1716
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,120
- A stem. It's a stem?
- A stem?

1717
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,540
A stem vegetable?
Sweet potato stems?

1718
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:35,020
- Which stem?
- You picked the good ones.

1719
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,920
- What kind of stem?
- They can't avoid using them.

1720
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,460
How does it look? Tell me its shape.

1721
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,630
Is it flat? Wide?

1722
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:43,330
Just keep throwing the words.

1723
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:46,100
- I've been throwing a lot of words!
- You should keep throwing them.

1724
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,370
Sesame leaf, lettuce,
broccoli, zucchini.

1725
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:50,500
Sesame leaf and lettuce
are not stem vegetables!

1726
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,500
(He explodes.)

1727
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:54,600
- You need to describe it!
- What other stem vegetables?

1728
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,000
- It's a stem vegetable!
- Which one?

1729
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,940
- It's a stem. Think of others!
- What about a stem?

1730
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:02,420
Jong Kook is really mad.
He's seriously mad this time.

1731
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,980
I think it'd be better
just to use the banned words.

1732
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,580
Just use the banned words.

1733
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,650
Pickled radish.

1734
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:08,210
It's a famous movie. The one
that got a big award recently.

1735
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:10,290
The one that got an award?
"Parasite"?

1736
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:11,330
No!

1737
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,330
Which famous movie got a big award?

1738
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:14,420
It received an award
from an American award show.

1739
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:15,600
- An American award show?
- A Korean.

1740
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,900
- A Korean?
- That's right.

1741
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:19,630
- Youn Yuh Jung!
- No, the movie!

1742
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,230
(He said the exact banned word.)

1743
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,330
(Suk Jin smoothly said
the second banned word.)

1744
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,710
I've been describing a vegetable
all this time!

1745
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:29,330
(Jong Kook has been trying hard
to avoid saying Youn Yuh Jung.)

1746
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:31,150
What is it again?
I can't remember...

1747
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:32,850
- the title.
- I've been describing a vegetable.

1748
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:33,850
They got it!

1749
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,850
Jong Kook put his hand
in his pocket! He's really mad!

1750
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:38,190
- They got it!
- They got it!

1751
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:40,020
What's the title of the movie
Youn Yuh Jung was in?

1752
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,560
"Summary"? What is it?

1753
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,750
"Summary"?

1754
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,750
("Minari" turned into "Summary".)

1755
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,290
- What did he say?
- "Summary".

1756
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:46,290
He said it's "Summary".

1757
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,190
- What is it?
- This is driving me crazy.

1758
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:50,130
What's the title again? Oh, gosh.

1759
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:52,630
It's stem...
You said it's a vegetable!

1760
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,230
- A vegetable. Which one?
- The one in this.

1761
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:58,210
- Which one?
- They banned the word "vegetable".

1762
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,830
They even banned Youn Yuh Jung.

1763
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:01,730
I even said the word "award".
I bet they banned all these words.

1764
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:03,540
- So that's...
- I bet they included "Academy" too.

1765
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,540
He repeated the words.

1766
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:07,750
You can't say it then. You said
they included "Academy".

1767
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,170
Let's move on to the next one.

1768
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,020
We can get 20 seconds as a penalty.

1769
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,520
It's the person you see
when your prostate goes wrong.

1770
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,810
Oh, it's a urologist.

1771
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,520
- A urologist.
- That's correct.

1772
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:18,690
The answer is a urologist?

1773
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:20,600
- This is incredible.
- Oh, it's the second question.

1774
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,290
And what's next? Describe it.

1775
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,190
The last question.
Why are you stalling time?

1776
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:25,270
The captain of editors.

1777
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,920
A producer.

1778
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,330
(They already said
two banned words.)

1779
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:29,400
A captain of editors?

1780
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:32,830
- They're saying all the words.
- It's crazy.

1781
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:35,580
I said he's the captain of editors.

1782
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:38,850
It is a producer
if it's someone who edits.

1783
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,480
Shouldn't you think of
some other word...

1784
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,940
when I said
it's the captain of the editors?

1785
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:42,980
A captain who edits?

1786
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:45,080
This is crazy.

1787
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,620
What's the captain of editors?

1788
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,020
We'd be in big trouble if they
included the word "edit".

1789
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,460
We're bound to say this word.

1790
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,560
We're in the last place anyway.

1791
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,750
If the answer was "producer"...

1792
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:57,870
- If the answer was "producer"...
- What are you doing?

1793
00:58:57,870 --> 00:58:59,600
If the answer was "producer"...
Just hold on.

1794
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,330
If the answer was "producer",
I would have said...

1795
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,130
- it's someone who edits.
- You told me to hurry!

1796
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:05,370
- Listen. I'd have said that.
- You can say that later.

1797
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,210
- What are they doing?
- Your time is up.

1798
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,130
If I said it's the captain of
editors, the answer is Bo Pil.

1799
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,880
- I said it in general.
- You can stop already.

1800
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,210
- Bo Pil...
- Jong Kook.

1801
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:15,250
The answer is Choi Bo Pil.
The captain of all editors.

1802
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,770
Then you could've said
the producer of Running Man!

1803
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:18,920
If I said it's someone who edits,
then the answer is producer!

1804
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,710
I was trying
to avoid the banned words.

1805
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:22,310
- That's not it.
- Just apologize to him.

1806
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,810
Hey! The answer was so easy!

1807
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,230
You could've pointed at him
and said, "It's him!"

1808
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:26,920
We even included the word "him".

1809
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,520
(Banned words: This place, producer,
captain, him, next to Chul Min)

1810
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,460
(They even included that word.)

1811
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:31,830
- You did?
- We banned "him" as well.

1812
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:33,920
- We banned "him".
- Listen, my point is...

1813
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,730
Is it okay to point at you
and say it's you?

1814
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:37,230
Why can't we?

1815
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,230
- But they included the word "him".
- We did.

1816
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:42,000
I was only trying to
avoid saying the banned words.

1817
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,900
- It's minari.
- We knew he'd say "him".

1818
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,750
Suk Jin is hilarious.

1819
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,580
Goodness, Suk Jin.

1820
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,250
- He was totally...
- He was hilarious.

1821
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,480
- told off by Jong Kook.
- They included "producer" as well.

1822
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,350
- He should've thought of "captain".
- Why did you make it so hard?

1823
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:53,810
- I mean...
- You could've said...

1824
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:57,020
This is supposed to be hard!

1825
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,750
They expected us to use these words,
so it's bound to be hard!

1826
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,830
I told you we should just
use those words.

1827
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:03,750
- The main producer of Running Man!
- Jong Kook.

1828
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,870
You need to sing.

1829
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,040
Don't abuse your vocal cords.
You need to sing.

1830
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,830
All right. Let's move on
to the next one.

1831
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:12,710
- Use the easy words.
- Here's the question.

1832
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,600
- Go.
- Is it easy?

1833
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,540
(Banned words: Joe Biden, country,
election, Moon Jae In, captain)

1834
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,000
Let's see how they do it.

1835
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,650
He is Korea's...

1836
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,040
(The word they have to guess
is "president".)

1837
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,040
most powerful person.

1838
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:24,310
President.

1839
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,420
- Correct.
- They got it.

1840
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,190
- I got it?
- It's too easy.

1841
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,560
A peck... This is too...

1842
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,580
Kiss?

1843
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:35,020
- A deep kiss.
- You can't say that.

1844
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:36,190
The first one.

1845
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:37,250
- First kiss.
- You can't use gestures.

1846
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:39,830
- You can't use that gesture.
- Why not? I only did this.

1847
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:42,600
Hey! This would mean kiss.
I only did this.

1848
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,600
It's okay. We got the answer.

1849
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,730
- First kiss.
- You'll get a penalty.

1850
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:46,040
They're getting a penalty.

1851
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,400
(They move on to the next one
after getting a penalty.)

1852
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,130
(Given word: Quadratic formula)

1853
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:51,670
I don't think you can get this.

1854
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:52,940
- Try us.
- Try us.

1855
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,080
Don't look down on us. Just try us.

1856
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,310
- Do you know this word?
- I'll just use the word. It's math.

1857
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,920
- Pi!
- Yes, it is.

1858
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,420
- Square root.
- It's all included.

1859
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:02,480
- It's not a symbol.
- Se Chan will never use this word.

1860
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,810
He can never say this word.

1861
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:05,460
It's not a symbol?
Then is it a person?

1862
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:06,830
Se Chan will never use this word.

1863
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:07,830
It's not a person.

1864
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,100
- 3.14!
- Ji Hyo doesn't know.

1865
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,830
- It's not something like that.
- Is it a formula?

1866
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:13,130
- That's right!
- Is it a formula?

1867
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:14,130
Fraction!

1868
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,230
- That's it!
- What did you say?

1869
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:17,460
You can't use gestures.

1870
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,670
We should've thought of it.

1871
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:20,880
Pythagoras...

1872
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,270
It's something like that!
Keep going!

1873
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,270
- That's all I know.
- What was that?

1874
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:26,750
Do you know what an equation is?

1875
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,080
- Equation. Pythagoras.
- It's something like that.

1876
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,850
When people break up

1877
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:31,920
- It's some kind of formula.
- "Love Equation"!

1878
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,120
- What?
- "Love Equation".

1879
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,310
Darn you!

1880
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,460
- A formula?
- That's right.

1881
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,460
What is a formula?

1882
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,130
(You dumb fool!)

1883
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:40,750
You don't know this?

1884
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,920
- What is it?
- You must know this!

1885
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,020
- It's a formula?
- I told you...

1886
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:46,870
This is so frustrating.

1887
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,870
A formula.
My closest friend's name...

1888
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:50,870
- Geun Sik!
- Geun Sik formula!

1889
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:52,770
It's that one! Geun Sik!

1890
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:54,400
(They don't know how to
apply the hint.)

1891
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,080
- "Geun Sik formula"?
- Geun Sik.

1892
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:58,080
- That's right.
- "Geun Sik formula".

1893
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,540
That's right. It's similar.

1894
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,440
That's it! You're almost there!

1895
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,040
- You're almost there!
- "Geun Sik formula".

1896
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,520
- "Tenacity"?
- What?

1897
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:05,810
(She only changed one syllable
to make use of the hint.)

1898
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:07,210
- She said it's Geun Sik formula.
- Who?

1899
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:08,580
- What did you say?
- Ji Hyo.

1900
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,210
- What did you say?
- Geun Sik.

1901
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:11,630
"Geun Sik formula"?

1902
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,060
- "Modern".
- You think that's the answer?

1903
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,920
- Modern formula!
- Darn it!

1904
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,000
(A terrible sight where Empty Heads
copy each other)

1905
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,730
- Quadratic formula.
- Correct!

1906
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,100
- Oh, it's the quadratic formula.
- "Geun Sik formula"?

1907
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:26,870
They said it's Geun Sik formula.

1908
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,130
- "Modern formula".
- That was hilarious though.

1909
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:31,500
- It's the quadratic formula.
- It's the quadratic formula.

1910
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,040
You said the banned words
four times, including the penalty.

1911
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,310
It's okay.

1912
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:38,620
- We did well.
- That team is in last place anyway.

1913
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,120
Don't make it hard,
and say the questions fast.

1914
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,310
- Let's do it fast. Okay.
- Let's just say the banned words.

1915
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:44,980
It's better to say the banned words.

1916
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:47,460
- Let's do this.
- I hope the questions aren't hard.

1917
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,460
- Let's do it.
- We picked the good ones, right?

1918
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:50,560
We'll break through them.

1919
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,500
Ready, go.

1920
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:54,330
Yes, just say all the banned words.

1921
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:56,560
But I think she'll say
the banned words.

1922
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,440
(Given word: Yi Sun Sin)

1923
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,770
A famous general.

1924
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,540
General Yi Sun Sin.

1925
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:03,540
- I got it?
- Yes.

1926
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:04,940
- What was that?
- All right!

1927
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,040
(Given word: Ji Suk Jin)

1928
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,710
(It's hard to describe Suk Jin
without saying the banned words.)

1929
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:11,710
(Banned words: Not that, here,
old fossil, old, unattractive)

1930
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:13,080
The grandpa of Running Man.

1931
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,810
- Ji Suk Jin.
- There you go.

1932
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:17,020
It's way too easy.

1933
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:20,250
(He perfectly described Suk Jin
with just two words.)

1934
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,830
- How did he avoid all of them?
- That was too easy.

1935
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:24,400
Jae Suk explained it so well.

1936
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,370
Jae Suk, I can see the answer
in your eyes.

1937
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:27,540
This is...

1938
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,830
(If So Min gets the last one fast,
they will place 1st.)

1939
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:31,130
Just spit it out.

1940
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:32,330
Vietnam.

1941
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,710
It's very tasty.

1942
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,310
- Banh mi.
- Food.

1943
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:37,230
(He starts off
by stepping on the 2 mines.)

1944
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,810
In Korea, we have lettuce wraps.

1945
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,580
In Vietnam, they have...

1946
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,670
(Jae Suk used 3 banned words,
but So Min doesn't have a clue.)

1947
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:44,850
They are done.

1948
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,380
In Korea, we have lettuce wraps.

1949
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,620
In Vietnam, they have...

1950
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:48,850
(He used "Wrap" 2 times
and "Vietnam" 3 times.)

1951
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,580
Coriander?

1952
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:53,650
- What could it be?
- How could she not know this?

1953
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,630
He gave you everything.
It's like a minefield.

1954
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:57,630
- Go. Go.
- What could it be?

1955
01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:58,730
Wrap! Wrap!

1956
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:00,870
Wrap?

1957
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:07,000
I don't know this one. Pho. Pho.

1958
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,440
(She says "Pho" multiple times
without knowing anything.)

1959
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,440
No, no.

1960
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,670
I don't know this one. Pho.

1961
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:12,750
Pho.

1962
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,620
Pho. Pho.

1963
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:16,750
- No, no.
- My goodness.

1964
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:18,210
- Hey.
- Banh mi. Banh mi.

1965
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:20,020
- No.
- Keep going.

1966
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,750
There is something like a mixed pho.

1967
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,120
It's pho, but...

1968
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,350
Stop talking about
miscellaneous things.

1969
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:28,190
- But...
- Say the answer.

1970
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,020
- It uses...
- Pho.

1971
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:32,190
rice paper. Rice paper.

1972
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:34,940
(They covered all banned words.)

1973
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:38,230
(They stepped on so many mines.)

1974
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:40,040
- Spring rolls.
- There you go.

1975
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,670
- You know,
- The one we chose worked well.

1976
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:42,980
you stepped on...

1977
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,170
every single mine 16 times in total.

1978
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:46,250
You said every single one of them.

1979
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,540
- Rice paper.
- How?

1980
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:49,380
- Vietnam. Pho.
- I can't believe you.

1981
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,670
- You said every single one of them.
- So Min.

1982
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:52,520
I couldn't think of the answer.

1983
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,210
When I said it's like
the lettuce wrap of Korea,

1984
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:56,190
- you should have thought of it.
- Seriously.

1985
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,980
- We chose the banned word well.
- We did a good job.

1986
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,080
A minefield!

1987
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,100
Here is the result.

1988
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,190
First place is Team Haha.

1989
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,460
(1st place is Team Haha.)

1990
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:04,770
Geun Sik formula!

1991
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,400
- Geun Sik formula!
- Spring roll.

1992
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,130
Both teams went...

1993
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:09,730
- well over five minutes.
- Geun Sik formula.

1994
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:11,460
- My goodness.
- How did we go over five minutes?

1995
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,330
Since both teams went
over five minutes,

1996
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:14,500
decide with rock-paper-scissors.

1997
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,830
- Okay.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1998
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:17,750
Let us take second place.

1999
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:19,440
- We took the last place twice.
- All right.

2000
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,480
Beat us in rock-paper-scissors.

2001
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:23,380
Go ahead.

2002
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,750
Rock-paper-scissors.

2003
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:26,210
- Okay.
- Okay.

2004
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,580
Let's submit a lot of money
this time.

2005
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:29,480
- I didn't play scissors this time.
- Let's submit a lot of money.

2006
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,350
It's your last chance to submit
team money.

2007
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:35,060
1st place, 2nd place, and 3rd place.

2008
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:38,290
The 1st place team will get
350, 300, and 250 dollars.

2009
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:39,790
Then the other teams will get
200 and 150 dollars...

2010
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:41,560
- and 100 and 50 dollars.
- Why?

2011
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:44,100
The other teams will decide...

2012
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,560
who will get how much.

2013
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,630
(The other teams will decide
who will get how much.)

2014
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:49,730
We should give Haha
the biggest amount.

2015
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:52,100
We will give Haha
the biggest amount.

2016
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:53,540
Yes. We will give Haha
the biggest amount.

2017
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,770
- Me?
- Yes.

2018
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:56,620
- Thank you, but...
- It's advantageous to us.

2019
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,380
Haha won't contribute to team money.

2020
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:00,620
- Then Se Chan and Ji Hyo.
- Okay.

2021
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,480
We will do that.
Please decide on the distribution...

2022
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,580
among the five of you.

2023
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:05,460
- Suk Jin should get more money.
- Suk Jin.

2024
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,650
Suk Jin should get more money.

2025
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:07,650
(He is a habitual traitor.)

2026
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:09,920
Suk Jin will get 200 dollars,
and Jong Kook will get 150 dollars.

2027
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,370
Between them,
So Min should get more money.

2028
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:12,460
(Team Jae Suk has So Min.)

2029
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,330
So Min will get 100 dollars,
and Jae Suk will get 50 dollars.

2030
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:16,330
Don't worry, Jae Suk.
I will submit all the money.

2031
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,560
I will submit all the money.

2032
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:19,230
- Really?
- I will submit all the money.

2033
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:20,230
(Suspicious)

2034
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:21,770
Okay. I will believe you.

2035
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,940
- We need to submit a lot of money.
- I will go...

2036
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:25,540
- and submit the money.
- Submit a lot of money.

2037
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,150
- A lot of money?
- Of course, Haha.

2038
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,250
- How much are you thinking?
- I am thinking 200 dollars.

2039
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:31,250
Are you sure?

2040
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:33,480
Otherwise, we won't be able
to avoid the green onion costume.

2041
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,960
(It's the last chance to avoid being
the green onion or Dalmatian.)

2042
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,020
200 dollars.

2043
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:37,830
Once we bring good costumes,

2044
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:39,650
- we can choose among ourselves.
- That's right.

2045
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:41,750
It's important that we bring
good costumes.

2046
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,330
We need money for the auction.

2047
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,170
Would he really contribute
200 dollars?

2048
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,540
I think I should contribute
this much...

2049
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,100
since I have 350 dollars.

2050
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:52,310
I should make a contribution.

2051
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,880
I think I should contribute
this much.

2052
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,940
(Did Haha submit a lot of money
as he promised?)

2053
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,250
(Se Chan said he will submit
200 dollars.)

2054
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,250
(He finishes submitting money.)

2055
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:05,020
(Ji Hyo put down 60 dollars.)

2056
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:08,120
(Will she be loyal to the team
and submit a lot of money?)

2057
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:11,460
I will submit this much.

2058
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:13,690
I will submit this much.

2059
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:14,900
(She betrays the team
this time as well.)

2060
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:18,130
(Ji Hyo has been reborn
after 11 years.)

2061
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:19,270
We need to win.

2062
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:21,000
I will go all in.

2063
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,040
(Team Suk Jin and Team Jae Suk
finish submitting money as well.)

2064
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,810
The Strange Family Photo Race
to celebrate the 11th anniversary...

2065
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:27,940
has come to an end.

2066
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:31,080
All teams have turned in the money,

2067
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,770
so you will decide on the roles
for the family photo...

2068
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:35,540
through the Role Auction.

2069
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:36,710
(The Role Auction)

2070
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,980
Here is how
the Role Auction will go.

2071
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:42,710
We combined the team money
you have turned in so far.

2072
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,290
Each team will check...

2073
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:45,830
the amount we wrote down.

2074
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,730
You should keep the amount a secret
from other teams.

2075
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:52,130
That way, you can decide
to bid more money or not.

2076
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:54,020
Even if you have a big amount,

2077
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:56,870
you won't get other good roles
if you spend too much on one role.

2078
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:58,900
- I see.
- They need three roles...

2079
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,310
while we need two roles.

2080
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,980
We will have a public bid
for the Role Auction.

2081
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,600
Once the role
and the starting price get revealed,

2082
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,940
raise the paddle...

2083
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,770
and place your bid.

2084
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,480
The team that makes
the highest bid...

2085
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,190
will win the role.

2086
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,560
The team that obtained
enough number of roles...

2087
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,710
- will be removed from the auction.
- Two roles.

2088
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,850
I see why a team of three is
at a disadvantage.

2089
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,790
We were at a disadvantage
from the start.

2090
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:23,730
- I know.
- We will give you the team money.

2091
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:25,190
Don't show it to other teams.

2092
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:27,760
We won't have a problem
if we followed the plans.

2093
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,670
I am not joking when I say
that it wasn't intentional.

2094
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:31,400
I got confused.

2095
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,800
(Ji Hyo got the taste of betrayal
and turned in only 110 dollars.)

2096
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,600
Check the amount
and don't show it to other teams.

2097
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,050
(How much team money
did Team Haha gather?)

2098
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:41,100
This is bad.

2099
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,180
Gosh.

2100
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,090
(A mysterious exclamation...)

2101
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:47,340
Did you turn in all the money?

2102
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,510
Not bad.

2103
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:49,960
(and even more mysterious
facial expressions)

2104
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,520
- All right.
- You know,

2105
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,480
it's nice to see some loyalty
for the 11th anniversary.

2106
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,720
You must be surprised.

2107
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,000
- No, no.
- The 11th anniversary.

2108
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:00,430
That's why.

2109
01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:02,340
I got confused.

2110
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:07,010
(So Min's eyes twinkle
because she saved up money.)

2111
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:09,180
There is a lot.

2112
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:10,180
(How much money
does Team Jae Suk have?)

2113
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:12,600
(370 dollars!)

2114
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:14,970
- There is a lot.
- Yes.

2115
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:16,470
Seriously. There is a lot.

2116
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:17,580
(So Min didn't submit much,
but there is a hefty sum.)

2117
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,390
It's meaningless
if the team doesn't have...

2118
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:22,550
much money.

2119
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,010
I will turn in 150 dollars.

2120
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,850
Did So Min turn in 150 dollars?

2121
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:27,790
You didn't do this alone.

2122
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,150
It's a lot.

2123
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:30,390
- All right.
- You know,

2124
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:32,170
I am not joking when I say...

2125
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:33,830
that it wasn't intentional.
I got confused.

2126
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:36,170
(Suk Jin got 400 dollars
and Jong Kook got 300 dollars.)

2127
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:38,670
It's as I expected.

2128
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:40,060
All right.

2129
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:41,770
(The Role Auction begins now!)

2130
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:43,010
All right.

2131
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:45,100
Here comes the role of Dad
in the family portrait.

2132
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:46,250
- Let's begin...
- We need to buy it.

2133
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:47,300
- the auction.
- We need to buy it.

2134
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:48,420
- It's a good one.
- The starting price is...

2135
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:49,680
- 10 dollars.
- Dad is a good one.

2136
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,770
- 10 dollars.
- Yes.

2137
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,140
- 10 dollars.
- 10 dollars.

2138
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:53,340
- 20 dollars.
- 20 dollars.

2139
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:54,890
- 30 dollars.
- Go.

2140
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,260
- 40 dollars.
- 40 dollars.

2141
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:57,930
- 50 dollars.
- 50 dollars.

2142
01:09:58,430 --> 01:09:59,830
Let's make them use up their money.

2143
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:00,890
- 70 dollars.
- 70 dollars.

2144
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:02,430
(Team Haha bids 70 dollars.)

2145
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:04,150
- 80 dollars.
- 100 dollars.

2146
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:05,470
- 100 dollars.
- 100 dollars.

2147
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:07,220
- Bid 150 dollars.
- 150 dollars.

2148
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:08,340
150 dollars.

2149
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:09,430
(Team Suk Jin bids 150 dollars.)

2150
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,170
- 150 dollars.
- What?

2151
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,400
150 dollars is too much.

2152
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:14,370
150 dollars is too much.

2153
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:15,900
150 dollars is too much.

2154
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,340
Then the other member
will get the green onion.

2155
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:19,640
Then the other member
will get the green onion.

2156
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:21,010
Hold on.

2157
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:22,580
How much money do you guys have?

2158
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,140
We turned in so much money.

2159
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:25,220
- Hold on.
- How much money do you guys have?

2160
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:26,390
Don't you guys have much money?

2161
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:28,550
- We have money.
- This is our strategy.

2162
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:29,680
There are three of us.

2163
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,390
(What could be the strategy
for this 3-member team?)

2164
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,020
- 160 dollars.
- 160 dollars.

2165
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,220
We should raise the bid.

2166
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,000
- 170 dollars.
- 180 dollars.

2167
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,220
- 180 dollars.
- 190 dollars.

2168
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:39,670
- 200 dollars.
- 200 dollars.

2169
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:42,230
(Team Jae Suk bids 200 dollars.)

2170
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:43,690
- It's okay.
- 250 dollars.

2171
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:45,710
(Team Suk Jin bids 250 dollars.)

2172
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:48,600
(Did they just bid 250 dollars
for Dad?)

2173
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:49,770
It's done.

2174
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,640
5, 4,

2175
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:52,970
- 3,
- 250 dollars is too much.

2176
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,770
two,

2177
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:56,440
one.

2178
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:00,180
The bid is closed for Dad.

2179
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:02,890
We did well.

2180
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:05,390
We had to bring it no matter what.

2181
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,020
- Hey.
- I am happy we got Dad,

2182
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,650
- but we used too much money.
- Suk Jin.

2183
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:10,500
- Look here.
- It's our strategy.

2184
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:11,930
We still have a lot of money.

2185
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:13,630
- Mom.
- Mom.

2186
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:14,870
- So we have...
- We need to get Mom.

2187
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,730
- We have 430 dollars left.
- Shall we start...

2188
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:18,400
- from 50 dollars?
- We still have a lot of money.

2189
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,270
(Jong Kook educated Suk Jin
from the very beginning.)

2190
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:25,600
(He convinced Suk Jin
until the end...)

2191
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,220
(with the leadership
of trust and revenge.)

2192
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:31,550
(They turned in all the money
at first.)

2193
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:36,120
(When they didn't do well
in the subsequent missions,)

2194
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:40,680
(they turned in everything
for the team money.)

2195
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:44,390
(Thus, they saved up 680 dollars.)

2196
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:45,870
It's as I expected.

2197
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:47,690
(Thus, they gained the high ground
despite doing badly.)

2198
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:50,140
There is no way they have money.
They can't trust each other.

2199
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:52,760
I think every team has
about the same amount of money.

2200
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:54,560
- It's neck and neck.
- It depends on the strategy.

2201
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,300
- It depends on the strategy.
- The second role is...

2202
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:57,840
- Mom.
- Mom.

2203
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,250
- We need to get Mom.
- That's right.

2204
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,550
Mom. It's an easy role, right?

2205
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:02,620
- Let's buy it.
- Shall we start with 50 dollars?

2206
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,180
Okay. We will start with 50 dollars.

2207
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:05,390
- 50 dollars.
- 50 dollars.

2208
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,890
- 100 dollars.
- 100 dollars.

2209
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:08,150
- 150 dollars.
- 150 dollars.

2210
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,220
- 200 dollars.
- 200 dollars.

2211
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:12,050
- What?
- No way.

2212
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:13,350
- 200 dollars.
- 200 dollars.

2213
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:16,520
This is easy.
We don't need to save up money.

2214
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,060
- They don't have much money.
- 200 dollars?

2215
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,130
They bid 200 dollars.

2216
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,590
Did they bid 200 dollars
when they don't have that much?

2217
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,370
Do they have that much?

2218
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:24,930
Is Mom a good role?

2219
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,670
Isn't it pretty good?

2220
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:28,510
- It's pretty good.
- You just need to wear lipstick.

2221
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,970
- That's right.
- It involves the wig, lipstick,

2222
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,470
- and outfit.
- It's a simple role.

2223
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:33,140
Hold on. What's the next role?

2224
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,580
- Teen Daughter?
- Teen Daughter.

2225
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:35,810
- You should be Teen Daughter.
- Let's get this one.

2226
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:37,470
- Let's get this one.
- Why?

2227
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:38,920
You and I should be a couple.

2228
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,120
- Really?
- Yes.

2229
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,220
(You and I should be a couple.)

2230
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:46,980
- Let's get this one.
- You know,

2231
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,130
that made my heart flutter.

2232
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:49,300
Suk Jin. For Teen Daughter...

2233
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:50,720
Let them have Teen Daughter.

2234
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,890
Okay.

2235
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:53,590
- 300 dollars.
- 300 dollars.

2236
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,390
They are going all in.

2237
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:56,970
- 5,
- They just need 1 more role.

2238
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,230
- four,
- Go, Jae Suk.

2239
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,370
three,

2240
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:00,510
Come on.

2241
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,640
- two,
- Aren't you going to bid?

2242
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,140
- one.
- You should bid.

2243
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:05,080
- What was that?
- Okay.

2244
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,050
- This team got Dad and Mom.
- Okay.

2245
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,380
- Is it set?
- That was successful.

2246
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:10,510
Yes. That was successful.

2247
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,480
- Teen Daughter.
- I think it's...

2248
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,550
- a cute role.
- Let's get it.

2249
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:14,680
- Let's get it.
- Ji Hyo.

2250
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,310
Bid 150 dollars.

2251
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,680
Let's start with 100 dollars.
100 dollars.

2252
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:19,850
Don't miss this role.

2253
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:21,050
- Let's take this to the end.
- 200 dollars.

2254
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:22,050
200 dollars.

2255
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:23,130
250 dollars.

2256
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:24,550
- My goodness.
- That's a lot.

2257
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:26,370
- 300 dollars.
- They bid 300 dollars.

2258
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:28,140
- Then...
- Wouldn't you go bankrupt?

2259
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:29,760
- 310 dollars.
- Everyone.

2260
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,870
I am telling you this
because I have had enough.

2261
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:34,710
Bid only the amount you have.

2262
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,300
(I am telling you this
because I have had enough.)

2263
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:40,580
("Bid only the amount you have"?)

2264
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:44,010
How could you bid
the amount you don't have?

2265
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:45,920
We don't know, okay?

2266
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:49,050
We don't know how much you have.

2267
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:50,650
Why would you bid
the amount you don't have?

2268
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:52,090
Cover it.

2269
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:54,890
(Ji Hyo felt bad about
turning in only 110 dollars.)

2270
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:55,890
(180 dollars)

2271
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:58,020
(180 dollars?)

2272
01:13:58,020 --> 01:13:59,220
Gosh.

2273
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,670
(That means the 2 of them
turned in 70 dollars in total.)

2274
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:02,800
All right.

2275
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,590
Turn it in.

2276
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,730
(Se Chan turned in 10 dollars
in the 1st round.)

2277
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:10,300
(Haha didn't turn in any money.)

2278
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:12,100
(Clean)

2279
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,750
This isn't a good team.

2280
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:14,770
(His teammates could say
the same thing.)

2281
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:16,510
(In the 2nd round,)

2282
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:17,940
(Haha turned in 0 dollars,
and Se Chan turned in 20 dollars!)

2283
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:20,090
(In the last round,
he turned in a meager amount.)

2284
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:22,760
It feels like a waste.
It feels so much like a waste.

2285
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,480
(He regretted paying that much.)

2286
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,390
(Ji Hyo didn't compare
to Se Chan and Haha.)

2287
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:30,390
You can't do that.

2288
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:31,760
- Then...
- You can't do that.

2289
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,800
200 dollars.

2290
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,830
200 dollars. 200 dollars.

2291
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:36,040
- What?
- 200 dollars.

2292
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,040
- 200 dollars.
- It's a big amount, right?

2293
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,870
- Okay. Take it.
- It's a big amount.

2294
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:40,170
- Fold.
- Fold.

2295
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:41,430
200 dollars.

2296
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:42,710
- Fold.
- Hey.

2297
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:43,770
- Don't you even have 200 dollars?
- What are you going to do?

2298
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,050
- What are you going to do?
- They are dirt poor.

2299
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:48,340
They don't even have 200 dollars!

2300
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:49,420
Why did you say that?

2301
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:51,140
- The next role.
- Forget it.

2302
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:53,180
- Grandma.
- Grandma isn't too bad.

2303
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:55,960
180 dollars.

2304
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:57,460
I guess they have 180 dollars.

2305
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,680
180 dollars.

2306
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:00,680
- 180 dollars.
- 180 dollars?

2307
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:02,520
- We can bid 250 dollars.
- That's right.

2308
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:07,800
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

2309
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,590
(Grandma goes to Team Haha
for 180 dollars.)

2310
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:11,540
- Okay.
- Why didn't you increase the bid?

2311
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,140
We bought it for a cheap price.

2312
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:14,600
- I know.
- The next one.

2313
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:15,730
We will bid...

2314
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:16,880
- How much?
- 170 dollars.

2315
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,930
170 dollars.

2316
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:18,970
Fold.

2317
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,250
"Fold."

2318
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,380
Newborn Baby is a good one.

2319
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:22,420
We are done.

2320
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:23,420
Thus...

2321
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:25,420
- Why didn't I get Newborn Baby?
- Which roles remain?

2322
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:28,260
It's disadvantageous to be
in a three-member team!

2323
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:30,310
You didn't turn in any money.

2324
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:31,850
- Why didn't you turn in money?
- Seriously.

2325
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:33,630
- This team is a mess.
- I can't believe it.

2326
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:35,000
You should have turned in money!

2327
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,390
I am the only one
who turned in money.

2328
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:38,000
- Really?
- I am the only one.

2329
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,890
- This is a match for Grandma.
- Then Ji Hyo should get the role.

2330
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:44,470
The team with Mom and Dad
will reveal how much they have.

2331
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:46,900
- Okay. We...
- Do it separately.

2332
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,170
- Do you have any money?
- No.

2333
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:49,380
- Not at all?
- No.

2334
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:50,580
Did you submit everything?

2335
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:51,900
Jong Kook submitted everything.

2336
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:52,900
(Opening his back)

2337
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:55,550
- Did you submit everything?
- Jong Kook submitted everything.

2338
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,180
Did you save up money?

2339
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:59,180
10 dollars?

2340
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,390
- Really?
- 20 dollars.

2341
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:02,150
(I have 20 dollars.)

2342
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:03,460
20 dollars.

2343
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,980
I knew it. I said
they would have 10 or 20 dollars.

2344
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,960
- 10 dollars.
- I can't believe you stashed it.

2345
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,460
I know him well.
I knew he would submit everything.

2346
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:11,830
Still, I am proud of you.

2347
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:14,090
- I have improved a lot.
- Seriously.

2348
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:16,000
Suk Jin did well.

2349
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,590
Suk Jin, which role
would you choose?

2350
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:18,870
The roles are about the same.

2351
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:20,300
Don't you feel bad?

2352
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:21,930
- What?
- You must feel bad.

2353
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:23,340
All right. Shall I choose Dad?

2354
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:24,730
- All right.
- Hold on.

2355
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:26,440
- It will be funny that way.
- You must feel bad.

2356
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:27,640
- No, no.
- Don't you feel bad?

2357
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,920
I choose Dad.

2358
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,180
Be Mom.

2359
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,220
There is a reason why
I stashed 20 dollars.

2360
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,550
- I want to be Dad.
- Mom.

2361
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:35,310
Suk Jin is Dad...

2362
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:36,650
- and Jong Kook is Mom.
- Okay, okay.

2363
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:38,430
Team Jae Suk, reveal how much
each one of you has.

2364
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:40,830
Please help me with this.
Which role would suit Jae Suk?

2365
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:43,090
- Newborn Baby and Teen Daughter.
- Make him Teen Daughter.

2366
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:44,690
Be Teen Daughter.
I will be Newborn Baby.

2367
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:45,760
- Be Newborn Baby.
- Be Newborn Baby.

2368
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,130
I will be Teen Daughter.

2369
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:49,260
Now, reveal how much
each one of you has.

2370
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,640
It's written on the envelope.

2371
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,400
Jae Suk looked determined.

2372
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:53,870
He didn't submit everything.

2373
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:54,900
Who will go first?

2374
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,080
Se Chan, go first.

2375
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:59,180
- How much do you have?
- His envelope is thick.

2376
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,440
I submitted a lot of money.

2377
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,250
- I will end you!
- Be honest.

2378
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,720
(By the order of the amount,)

2379
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,790
(they will choose
from these three roles.)

2380
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,510
- To be honest...
- That's...

2381
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:10,680
- You are less than human.
- I don't know.

2382
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,710
Someone counted my money wrong.

2383
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:20,150
I have 760 dollars.

2384
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,210
(760 dollars?)

2385
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:24,250
Hey.

2386
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:26,580
You are less than human.

2387
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:28,590
Someone counted my money wrong.
I have 760 dollars.

2388
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:30,000
Ji Hyo, how much do you have?

2389
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:31,050
That's too much.

2390
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:32,660
760 dollars?

2391
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,400
- Ji Hyo.
- You have more, right?

2392
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,830
You have more, right?

2393
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:37,830
That means he submitted
only a tiny amount of money.

2394
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:39,160
- Hey, how much do you have?
- How much do you have?

2395
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,830
(How much money did Haha stash?)

2396
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:43,480
- 870 dollars.
- Hey!

2397
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,110
I can't believe them.

2398
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,910
- That's too much.
- You got Grandma.

2399
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:48,340
(He is unbelievable.)

2400
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:50,150
- Ji Hyo, how much do you have?
- How much do you have?

2401
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,650
590 dollars.

2402
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:54,040
- She left...
- 590 dollars.

2403
01:17:54,910 --> 01:17:56,660
She left a hefty sum too.

2404
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:57,880
That's not true.

2405
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:01,080
It would have been disastrous
had she submitted more.

2406
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,450
Please pick a role.

2407
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:03,920
I choose Grandma.

2408
01:18:04,030 --> 01:18:05,460
Se Chan, please choose a role.

2409
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:08,500
This is meaningless.
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2410
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,200
- I think Green Onion is better.
- I know.

2411
01:18:10,570 --> 01:18:12,740
You have to wear a lot of makeup
for a Dalmatian.

2412
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:14,940
Thus, the roles have been decided.

2413
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,040
Let's dress up
and take the family portrait...

2414
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,370
- before we wrap up.
- Okay.

2415
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:20,110
I stashed money too,
but they were beyond me.

2416
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:21,540
Please enter.

2417
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:23,170
- Here?
- Which outfit does Grandma wear?

2418
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:24,510
How about me?

2419
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:26,210
Ji Hyo.

2420
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:28,790
Se Chan.

2421
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:31,320
- Yes?
- There is dirt. Premium dirt.

2422
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,290
- No way.
- I guess you will be planted.

2423
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,620
I don't have a shoot
for "Comedy Big League" today,

2424
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:37,620
but I am seeing
the makeup artists here.

2425
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:40,730
I can't believe
I am seeing them on Tuesday.

2426
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:41,760
(Dalmatian takes the spandex.)

2427
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,630
What will Ji Hyo and I wear?

2428
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:44,910
Be quiet, you punk.

2429
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,110
Hey, Dalmatian.

2430
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:48,910
Se Chan.

2431
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,110
I heard that you are Green Onion.

2432
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,840
Put on the spandex.

2433
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,300
- Really?
- Why would I put on the spandex?

2434
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,120
It's your outfit.

2435
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:59,910
Hey, Green Onion wears the spandex!
That's incredible!

2436
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:02,820
- Green onion has a white stalk.
- You are right.

2437
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,250
(Green Onion must put on
the white spandex.)

2438
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,790
I see.

2439
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:07,360
It's the worst.

2440
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,160
I think you will need to stand
in a pot.

2441
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:10,900
Shall I turn it to the side?

2442
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,090
Okay.

2443
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:13,590
- It's done.
- You need bangs.

2444
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:15,960
Teen Daughter is better.
You don't need to wear much makeup.

2445
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,540
(Jae Soon, a 16-year-old girl,
looks feisty.)

2446
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,200
(He gets a bit of the blusher.)

2447
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,300
Thank you.

2448
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:23,630
- Are you done?
- Yes.

2449
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,200
- You look pretty.
- Ma'am.

2450
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,080
Ma'am, hello.

2451
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,840
I should have chosen that role.

2452
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,840
You look pretty.

2453
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,080
I am jealous. You are done already.

2454
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:34,410
- You will draw the wrinkles.
- Yes.

2455
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:37,910
Is he Grandpa?

2456
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,920
I am Dad.

2457
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,700
- He doesn't look like Dad.
- Why is my mustache gray?

2458
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,500
- You are Dad.
- He doesn't look like Dad.

2459
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,000
Why is my mustache gray?

2460
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Please give him more ear hair.

2461
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:49,700
(Ear hair will help him live
a long life.)

2462
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:52,630
Dad didn't look like that
in the photo.

2463
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:54,240
There is Grandma too.

2464
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,480
- Mom...
- Oh, there is Grandma.

2465
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,630
- There is Grandma.
- There is Grandma.

2466
01:19:57,630 --> 01:19:59,450
- Dad looks too old.
- I see.

2467
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:01,300
- Dad...
- My bad.

2468
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,080
Dad looks like Grandpa.

2469
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,840
Grandma shouldn't look like my wife.

2470
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,150
How embarrassing!

2471
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:07,580
Honey.

2472
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:11,080
- You look like Grandpa.
- I am supposed to be your son.

2473
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:14,830
I am satisfied
since I will be done pretty fast.

2474
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:15,860
(He begins to transform into Mom.)

2475
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:17,090
That was easy.

2476
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:19,500
Why don't I resemble my mom
even when I put on a wig?

2477
01:20:20,530 --> 01:20:22,460
I look too much like my dad.

2478
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,440
What are you talking about?
You look exactly like your mom.

2479
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:29,480
- No, I don't.
- You look exactly like your mom.

2480
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:32,750
- Do I resemble my mom?
- Yes. Only you don't know that.

2481
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:34,540
I also don't think
I resemble my mom.

2482
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:36,670
- Really?
- Hey, do I resemble my mom?

2483
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:38,150
- Of course you do.
- How do I resemble her?

2484
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:39,410
- I don't see the resemblance.
- You are the spitting image of her.

2485
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:40,820
Do I resemble my mom?

2486
01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:43,550
Jong Kook, when will you be ready?

2487
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:45,160
Are you my wife?

2488
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:47,860
- This is like "My Little Old Boy".
- Seriously.

2489
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,860
You do resemble your mom.

2490
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,760
- You do resemble your mom.
- You do. Only you don't know that.

2491
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,830
Only you don't know that.
You do resemble your mom.

2492
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:56,460
I can't believe it!

2493
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,910
- Shall I put it on?
- "I can't believe it!"

2494
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:03,500
- Grandma.
- There you go.

2495
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:05,200
There you go.

2496
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,450
Give me a hug.

2497
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:07,750
Go away.

2498
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,320
- Give me a hug.
- Go away before I beat you up.

2499
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,490
It's Green Onion!

2500
01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:15,080
No, I am a person.

2501
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,620
He is garaetteok.

2502
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:18,750
- I am still a person.
- He is garaetteok.

2503
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:21,830
Mom.

2504
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:23,090
(Mom enters.)

2505
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:25,000
- I mean...
- Let's film "My Little Old Boy".

2506
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,790
Let's film "My Little Old Boy".

2507
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:28,370
Look at her shoulders!

2508
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:30,070
I didn't know
you had such broad shoulders.

2509
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:31,870
- I have broad shoulders.
- Jong Kook.

2510
01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:34,540
- How is your body like that?
- What?

2511
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:36,940
Ji Hyo isn't even smiling.

2512
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:38,610
She is serious.

2513
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:40,580
Gosh, look at Ji Hyo.

2514
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:41,670
Ji Hyo.

2515
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:46,690
(She went to the salon
and showed up as Song Ji Hyo.)

2516
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:49,080
- I will be okay, right?
- Of course.

2517
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,320
Look at Ji Hyo.

2518
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,730
My goodness.

2519
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,160
Oh, no.

2520
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:59,230
Gosh, it's a big work. Seriously.

2521
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:00,420
Ji Hyo got a muzzle.

2522
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:03,760
(Ji Hyo, the Dalmatian,
becomes dazed.)

2523
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,500
Gosh, it's a big work.

2524
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,570
Seriously.

2525
01:22:07,570 --> 01:22:10,280
- It's time for Green Onion.
- Enter, Green Onion.

2526
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:11,780
It's time for Green Onion.

2527
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:13,410
(Se Chan thought
he would just put on a hat.)

2528
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:15,980
It will be attached to his head.
Thank goodness I chose Grandma.

2529
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,580
- Grandma is infinitely better.
- You chose well.

2530
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:19,750
It's like...

2531
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:22,190
I didn't do this
even in "Comedy Big League".

2532
01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:23,620
Is it done?

2533
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:25,530
(He's the organic green onion.)

2534
01:22:25,530 --> 01:22:27,990
He didn't do it this much
even in "Comedy Big League".

2535
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:30,290
Seriously, I don't do this
in "Comedy Big League".

2536
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:31,730
(He thought he was used
to all kinds of costumes.)

2537
01:22:31,730 --> 01:22:33,260
I don't do it this much
even in "Comedy Big League".

2538
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:34,920
- What are you doing?
- This is...

2539
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,370
- What are you?
- Okay.

2540
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:37,760
You look like a prince.

2541
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,940
- Gosh, this is...
- It looks like a crown.

2542
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,260
This isn't right.

2543
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,410
Se Chan, you look cool.

2544
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,740
Seriously, this isn't right.

2545
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,410
- You look nice.
- This is really...

2546
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:47,410
Look at me.

2547
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,820
You'll be in a flowerpot later.

2548
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:51,650
- What?
- A flowerpot?

2549
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:53,690
- Is there a flowerpot?
- Is he going into a flowerpot?

2550
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:56,660
Gosh, that would be really cool.

2551
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:58,010
(The strange family is complete.)

2552
01:22:58,210 --> 01:22:59,620
Who goes first?

2553
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:01,120
- Anyone...
- Let's start with Dad.

2554
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,450
- Let's start with Dad.
- Dad goes first.

2555
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:04,550
This is the country
of courteous people in the east.

2556
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:08,030
He looks like a guy
in an American drama.

2557
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:10,570
His name is Francisco.

2558
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:12,910
- He lives in Korean town.
- He looks like a real dad.

2559
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:14,000
(Dad Ji Suk Jin got a year older
with his dyed mustache.)

2560
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,610
All right. Who's next?

2561
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,830
It's the mother's turn.

2562
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:19,500
Mom.

2563
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,610
(She's number 1 of the family
whom the dad is scared of.)

2564
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:22,950
Mom.

2565
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:24,510
- What?
- He's scary.

2566
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:26,910
- He's the mom.
- He looks terrifying.

2567
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:28,750
This is funny though.

2568
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:32,360
Mom is... You can imagine
that I'm having hard times.

2569
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:34,530
My wife is so muscular.

2570
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,120
He looks like a mom.

2571
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,360
(Next up is a girl who wants
to be pretty, Jae Soon.)

2572
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,630
(Next up is the shortest grandma.)

2573
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:49,830
(So Min is the youngest baby
who seems somewhat drunk.)

2574
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:56,120
(The three women of the Jis
who are known to be nice)

2575
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:57,620
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

2576
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:59,080
(Now it's the dog's turn.)

2577
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:00,650
Ji Hyo is cute.

2578
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:01,750
You look cute, Ji Hyo.

2579
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:04,620
Ji Hyo is lovely.

2580
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,030
This is crazy.

2581
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,920
It doesn't have to be Ji Hyo.

2582
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,550
I can't recognize who you are.

2583
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:12,400
(Ji Hyo looks
just like a Dalmatian.)

2584
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,090
We were going to be Ha-Se-Hyo,
but it didn't work.

2585
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:16,630
Ji Hyo.

2586
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:18,660
- Look at him.
- What?

2587
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:20,660
(Watch out for the dog.)

2588
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:23,700
We were going to be Ha-Se-Hyo,
but it didn't work.

2589
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:24,830
Ha-Se-Hyo is...

2590
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:26,540
We are Ha...

2591
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:29,510
Ha...

2592
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:31,820
(Haha's mischievous joke
makes her even more upset.)

2593
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:33,080
- Dalmatian.
- Go, Dalmatian.

2594
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:36,320
Dalmatian is amazing.
She looks unbelievable.

2595
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:38,660
- Ji Hyo.
- Hey, Ji Hyo.

2596
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:40,880
Ji Hyo.

2597
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:44,160
What do we do with her?

2598
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,570
- Ji Hyo, please.
- Ji Hyo.

2599
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:48,290
We should've done that.

2600
01:24:48,290 --> 01:24:49,540
The pictures look good though.

2601
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:51,590
- You are an actress.
- We shouldn't laugh.

2602
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:53,330
(The Ji family's pet dog
has a disinterested attitude.)

2603
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:55,170
Oh, no.

2604
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,300
But the pictures look good.

2605
01:24:58,130 --> 01:24:59,410
Good.

2606
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:00,410
(She's a smart dog
that can hold out its paw.)

2607
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:02,150
You look pretty.

2608
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:05,880
- It looks like a Disney movie.
- Next up is the green onion.

2609
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,080
- Green onion.
- Bring a flowerpot.

2610
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,080
What? Is he going into the pot?

2611
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,080
(He's a pet green onion
of the Ji family.)

2612
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:12,580
- Should I go in there?
- Yes.

2613
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:15,620
(He's being planted in the pot.)

2614
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:17,530
(What?)

2615
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:19,030
What is this?

2616
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,740
They can't see the soil anyway.

2617
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,200
- My gosh.
- Oh, dear.

2618
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,570
We can't even see the soil.

2619
01:25:26,570 --> 01:25:28,000
Why the soil...

2620
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,110
Se Chan doesn't do this
even in "Comedy Big League".

2621
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:33,370
(The pet green onion is withering
despite the premium soil.)

2622
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:38,820
(He comes back to life
with his yellow teeth.)

2623
01:25:39,650 --> 01:25:41,190
- All I can see his gums.
- It looks scary.

2624
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:43,120
Let's take a family photo now.

2625
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,290
Dad is intimidated.

2626
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:47,080
I should keep a straight face.

2627
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:48,700
Good.

2628
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,420
(Wriggling)

2629
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:53,370
(Ji Hyo is trying to do something.)

2630
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:54,660
Smile a little.

2631
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:56,660
- I need to pee.
- Did you pee?

2632
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:58,660
- What?
- She wants to pee.

2633
01:25:58,660 --> 01:25:59,760
- What is she talking about?
- Pee?

2634
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,570
She wants to pee.

2635
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:04,000
- She's trying to pee here.
- I see.

2636
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,610
You don't have to do that, Ji Hyo.

2637
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:07,370
She's just upset
that she's doing this.

2638
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:10,340
Ji Hyo, that's not necessary.

2639
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,120
- Ji Hyo, we're sorry.
- Let's take a picture.

2640
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,320
(The family is embarrassed.)

2641
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,990
The looks on your faces
are really good.

2642
01:26:16,990 --> 01:26:19,790
All right. Only the two
of you should smile.

2643
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:21,360
- An awkward smile.
- Okay.

2644
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,360
(They don't look alike,)

2645
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,530
Good.

2646
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:26,830
(but the Ji family is
kind-hearted.)

2647
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:28,530
It's done.

2648
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:30,330
- We're done.
- Thank you.

2649
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:31,830
That's it for our
commemorative photo.

2650
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:33,110
- Okay.
- Well done.

2651
01:26:33,570 --> 01:26:34,630
(Where's Ji Hyo?)

2652
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:35,830
(Ji Hyo is gone.)

2653
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,580
(A witch who grants your wish)

2654
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:41,300
(They are here to make a wish.)

2655
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:43,450
(Ha Do Kwon, Nam Ji Hyun,
Chae Jong Hyeop)

2656
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:45,820
(My wish is to take revenge.)

2657
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:48,820
(I want Do Kwon to be
Jong Kook's trainer.)

2658
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:49,860
(A small revenge)

2659
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:51,820
(I want Seok Sam to be
my younger brother for a day.)

2660
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:52,830
(He should treat me
like his older brother.)

2661
01:26:53,190 --> 01:26:56,090
(The members don't want to miss
their chances to make a wish.)

2662
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:57,230
I want to do it too.

2663
01:26:57,230 --> 01:26:59,730
(But there's a price.)

2664
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:00,920
Ji Hyo is amazing.

2665
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,130
I'll end this.

2666
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:03,400
- Good.
- This is like UFC.

2667
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:06,460
(They feel dizzy
with the UFC-like price.)

2668
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,940
(Is it time to confess love?)

2669
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:10,940
(They struggle in unique ways...)

2670
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:12,750
(to get their wish
without paying a price.)

2671
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,670
(Will they be able to fulfill
their wishes without paying prices?)

2672
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:19,120
(Make Your Wish Come True
and Pay The Price Later)
