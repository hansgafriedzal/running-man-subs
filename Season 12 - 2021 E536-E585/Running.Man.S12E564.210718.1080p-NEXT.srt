1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,320
Hello.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,290
Seriously, we should start
treating Suk Jin like a star.

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,310
Totally.

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,040
He wouldn't even get off his van.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,600
- Okay.
- Good.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,710
Okay.

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,840
- It's cool in here, right?
- He has 1.4 million subscribers.

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,640
Will you stop that?

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,120
- It's 1.4 million.
- Where's the man with 390,000?

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,920
- Jae Suk is coming.
- There's Jae Suk.

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,710
- He's ready to make jokes.
- Right.

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,620
Hello, Jae Suk.

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,920
Hey.

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,350
Suk Jin is acting like a big star.

16
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,730
You look nice today.

17
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,090
- You look cool.
- That's cute.

18
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,300
I like your outfit.

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,560
- It's perfect for today's weather.
- I like your shoes.

20
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,730
- I like your outfit.
- What's with your knee?

21
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,110
I need to take good care of my knee.

22
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,470
Suk Jin is a big star now.

23
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,370
- Why?
- He wouldn't let me open his car.

24
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,300
- Really?
- And the windows are tinted dark.

25
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,610
- I can't see through them.
- Really?

26
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,310
- That's crazy.
- Did you watch the music show?

27
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,720
He should know that
popularity is like bubbles.

28
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,620
Suk Jin did the ending thing.

29
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,620
The ending pose?

30
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,080
Suk Jin did that too.

31
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,230
(Suk Jin made his debut
on a music show a few days ago.)

32
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,620
(He expressed his feelings
with exaggerated gestures.)

33
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,390
(He even did the ending pose
as other idol artists do.)

34
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,110
He doesn't know
that's the end of his life.

35
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,730
(They've got a lot of things
to make fun of Suk Jin with.)

36
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,580
- The end of his life?
- Why isn't he coming?

37
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,340
- He's coming.
- Oh my goodness.

38
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,470
The groom enters.

39
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,170
What?

40
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,550
(They see a dim shape of him.)

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,810
What? Why is he...

42
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,980
(Amazed)

43
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,640
I'm just wearing what I got.

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,810
Did you just have it fitted?

45
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,510
What's with your suit?

46
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,590
I guess he just had it fitted.

47
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,450
- What's going on?
- What's that suit?

48
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,860
- That's not right for our show.
- Why are you wearing that suit?

49
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,030
- Why is it not right for our show.
- That's not appropriate for today.

50
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,030
This isn't a music show.

51
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,730
- You should look natural.
- This isn't formal.

52
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,840
Just look at this.

53
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,140
- Why are you wearing it?
- Can't I wear a suit like this?

54
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,140
But why?

55
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,470
Because I'm a celebrity.

56
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,580
He calls himself a celebrity.

57
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,440
It's just that you guys wear
the same thing all the time.

58
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,000
- What's with you?
- I want to wear this.

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,550
Suk Jin, what's this curtain?

60
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,720
- What?
- Let me pull the curtain open.

61
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,280
- What?
- This is...

62
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
He's wearing this again.

63
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,420
What do you mean
he's wearing it again?

64
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,720
He was wearing this last week.

65
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,560
- Isn't this an earphone?
- Right.

66
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,510
- Are you listening to music?
- Is it an earphone?

67
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,060
- An in-ear earphone.
- MSG's songs?

68
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,090
- Is it an in-ear earphone?
- Yes, it is.

69
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,530
- This is crazy.
- It's an in-ear earphone.

70
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,720
He has hair on his ears.

71
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,660
You can't pull it out.
You might die.

72
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,370
- It's for longevity.
- Don't pull it out.

73
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,840
It's for longevity.

74
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,240
By the way, it's not aired yet,

75
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,410
but he cried again.

76
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,840
- Really?
- Is that true?

77
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,970
Seriously?

78
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,810
I'm so sick of this.

79
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,970
- Again?
- It's not like that.

80
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,070
- I'm not sure if it will be on TV.
- He's worried.

81
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,340
- You'll understand when you see it.
- Suk Jin...

82
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,810
- has a new catchphrase.
- What is it?

83
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,340
"What's wrong with me?"

84
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,720
(What's wrong with me?)

85
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,560
"What's wrong with me?"

86
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,620
"What's wrong with me?"

87
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,930
"You Quiz on the Block" released
one more scene for Running Man.

88
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,370
"What's wrong with me?"

89
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,240
(A few weeks ago,
on "You Quiz on the Block")

90
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,210
(They didn't even add the background
music for Running Man.)

91
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,780
(It's a gift from "You Quiz
on the Block" to Running Man.)

92
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,340
(So Running Man purchased...)

93
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,710
(the clip from them
to return a favor.)

94
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,470
(I don't even know
why I'm being like this.)

95
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,410
(It's not a waste of money...)

96
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,120
(to purchase the clip
of Suk Jin's catchphrase.)

97
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,310
(Starting this video, he's been
crying every other week on MBC.)

98
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,460
Shall we start now? Okay.

99
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,820
- Suk Jin.
- When did you start that?

100
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
- "What's wrong with me?"
- "What's wrong with me?"

101
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,090
- I guess he likes to do that.
- I see.

102
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,790
When is Ji Hyo coming?

103
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,630
For today, Ji Hyo has...

104
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,340
invited three special guests.

105
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,270
Let's find out...

106
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,240
who Ji Hyo's friends are.

107
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,940
Is Ji Hyo bringing three friends?

108
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,250
She has a lot of friends.

109
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,000
- Look at that.
- What?

110
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,620
There's Yong Gu.

111
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,720
It's Do Kwon.

112
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,810
Why did he grow a mustache?

113
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,040
Do Kwon is here.

114
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,440
- Yong Gu.
- It's Do Kwon.

115
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,120
- Yong Gu.
- Yong Gu.

116
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,490
Hey, you're here.

117
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,060
What are the glasses for?

118
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,090
You're here.

119
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,350
Hello.

120
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,690
(The No. 1 romantic comedy queen
with great acting skills)

121
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,660
(Actress Nam Ji Hyun who rose from
a child actress to a mature woman.)

122
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,680
(A super rookie who emerged
as a star with "Stove League".)

123
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,630
(An actor with diverse characters,
Chae Jong Hyeop...)

124
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,680
(who featured in dramas
like "Sisyphus" and "Nevertheless".)

125
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,720
(His only target is Kim Jong Kook.)

126
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,040
(He went through a lot every time
because he chose the wrong target.)

127
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,660
(Running Man's family, Ha Do Kwon)

128
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,390
(They are Ji Hyo's friends.)

129
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,630
- They're here.
- Welcome.

130
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,050
- Hello.
- Ji Hyun.

131
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,090
What's Ji Hyo doing?

132
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,290
Look at Ji Hyo.

133
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
She pretends to be a guest.

134
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,270
Ji Hyo, don't act
like you're a guest.

135
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,290
Where's Ji Hyo?

136
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,730
- Ji Hyo.
- There's Ji Hyo.

137
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,580
- It's for "The Witch's Diner".
- "The Witch's Diner".

138
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,840
"The Witch's Diner".

139
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
(They are the stars
from "The Witch's Diner".)

140
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,410
(It's a popular drama
that was aired only two days ago.)

141
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,520
(It's a soulful, cruel fantasy drama
that features a lot of good actors.)

142
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,920
(Actually, it's not an SBS drama,)

143
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,130
(but this is the benefit
that our members can enjoy.)

144
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,030
The first episode is scheduled
to air on July 16?

145
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,130
- Right.
- Yes.

146
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,490
That's why you're here.

147
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,790
All right.

148
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,230
Do Kwon is joining our show
for the fourth time.

149
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,340
- That's a lot.
- What's important is...

150
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,210
He still holds a grudge
against Jong Kook.

151
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,340
- Still?
- Actually,

152
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,280
I've never beaten Jong Kook yet.

153
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,470
I keep doing dramas
just to be on this show.

154
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,150
- Is that why?
- That's funny.

155
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,150
To beat Jong Kook?

156
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,590
He's doing many dramas
to beat Jong Kook on our show.

157
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,220
That's enough, Do Kwon.
You've had enough.

158
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,390
Ji Hyo, tell us about
your character in the drama.

159
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,460
I'm...

160
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,290
- What's wrong?
- Why?

161
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,850
She's crying. You should say,
"What's wrong with me?"

162
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,200
Say "What's wrong with me?"

163
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,340
I play the witch
in "The Witch's Diner".

164
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,730
- Really?
- I see.

165
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,400
It sounds perfect.

166
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,730
She'll make a good witch.

167
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,530
- She's a witch.
- Do you work some magic?

168
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,880
- Yes.
- Seriously?

169
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,670
- Of course. She says she's a witch.
- I'm a witch,

170
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,280
- so I do magic.
- Can you move things?

171
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,510
- Telekinetically?
- Yes.

172
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,510
I also ride a broom.

173
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,880
Excuse me. I can see that
you're trying to help, but...

174
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,910
- It just doesn't work.
- That doesn't help...

175
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,320
their drama.

176
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,590
I knew it sounded strange.

177
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,680
I'm sorry, Do Kwon.

178
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,830
- Say "What's wrong with me?"
- "What's wrong with me?"

179
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,330
- "What's wrong with me?"
- "With my comment?"

180
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,550
Just stay quiet.

181
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,630
What's wrong with my comment?

182
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,030
And they are doing
a drama with Ji Hyo.

183
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,590
We have Nam Ji Hyun here.

184
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,010
- Hello.
- Welcome.

185
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,470
Is this your first time...

186
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,780
in Running Man?
Is it your second time?

187
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,880
- It's my second time.
- She was here before.

188
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,540
- When was it?
- It was about six years ago.

189
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,670
That's right. It was a lot of fun.

190
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,040
You thought it was her first time.

191
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,240
- She was really fun.
- I remember that.

192
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
- Do you?
- You ran around.

193
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,320
- Are you sure you remember that?
- Sure.

194
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,680
- You were wearing a skirt.
- That's right.

195
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,180
Gosh, you're right.

196
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,590
I heard Ji Hyun was
a psychology major.

197
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,760
That's true.

198
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,530
- That's amazing.
- That sounds cool.

199
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,050
How do you think
Suk Jin is feeling now?

200
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,570
- Look at him.
- Look at his outfit.

201
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,900
His outfit?

202
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,590
I guess he wants to stand out.

203
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,090
(Correct)

204
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,300
We don't have to study
psychology to know that.

205
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,600
- We all feel the same way.
- She knows how he feels.

206
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,650
- He wants to stand out.
- It really stands out.

207
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,510
I'm wearing this
to take good care of you guys.

208
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,720
I think it will be
perfect for our dramas.

209
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,780
Exactly.

210
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,980
I see.

211
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,980
She's nice.

212
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,610
That's good.

213
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,350
Do you know what
giving a two-thumbs-up means?

214
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,780
It means "shut your mouth."

215
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,700
You must already know the meaning.

216
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,900
(She knows the meaning.)

217
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,290
She knows it. She wants me
to stop talking.

218
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,900
That's what young people do, right?

219
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,090
That's what
our writers do all the time.

220
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,930
- I see.
- Oh, that's right!

221
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,910
- "Stop it."
- How dare you...

222
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,930
- But...
- They did it to me.

223
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,410
But old guys get excited
and keep talking.

224
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,280
- "That's enough."
- But they talk even more.

225
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,540
That's when you should stop talking.

226
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,090
There's something
that's even worse than this.

227
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,220
You give a two-thumbs-up
while walking away.

228
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,820
(The worst one is
a moving two-thumbs up.)

229
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,480
- "I'll be on my way."
- "I'll be on my way."

230
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,180
"I'll be on my way."

231
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,130
And this is your first time
to be on Running Man.

232
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,220
He's Chae Jong Hyeop.

233
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,990
(Actor Chae Jong Hyeop)

234
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,090
- He's handsome.
- He's good-looking.

235
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,090
- He's cute.
- Is this your first variety show?

236
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,270
Yes, this is my first time.

237
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,860
- He's good-looking.
- You've never done this before?

238
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,640
I did one show
to promote our drama...

239
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,280
- a few days ago.
- Which one?

240
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,780
"Amazing..."

241
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,880
- "Amazing Saturday"?
- I see.

242
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,910
You were on "Amazing Saturday".

243
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,170
Why are you so nervous now?

244
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,610
- Don't worry. We're different.
- You will get...

245
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,910
- used to it in no time.
- We're different.

246
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,740
Suk Jin, do something to help him.

247
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,550
I bet he was just like this.

248
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,130
He's blushing to his ears.

249
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,280
You can do this.

250
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,400
- It's so funny.
- Good.

251
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,830
It's all the same.

252
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,050
What was your name again?

253
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,490
My name is Chae Jong Hyeop.

254
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,830
I'll make you a star today.

255
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,070
Wait for me.

256
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,660
First...

257
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,970
I should let him wear this jacket.

258
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,510
My gosh. It's attached.

259
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,600
I'll make you a star.

260
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,780
Se Chan said...

261
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,300
As you said
"I'll make you a start today,"

262
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,200
he murmured, "How annoying."

263
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,310
Wait for me.

264
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,940
I'll make you a star today.

265
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,650
How are you going
to make him a star?

266
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,490
- Just wait and watch.
- What?

267
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,660
What was your name again?

268
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,120
How many times do you have to ask?

269
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,580
This is how I make him a star.

270
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,660
How could you...

271
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,900
- I'm doing this to make him famous.
- That's ridiculous.

272
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,290
- What's your name?
- It's Cheon Yeop.

273
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,960
- Chae Jong Hyeop.
- Cheon Yeop?

274
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,100
It never ends.

275
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,100
Cheon Yeop?

276
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,030
- He's blushing to his ears.
- It's already...

277
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,410
hanging over the viewers' heads.

278
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,980
The directors are being like this.

279
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,200
They all are doing this.

280
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,510
- You're the worst.
- Cheon Yeop?

281
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,670
- It's Jong Hyeop.
- Jong Hyeop?

282
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,540
There's something surprising
about Jong Hyeop.

283
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,680
- Did you study in South Africa?
- Seriously?

284
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,910
- The Republic of South Africa?
- Where? South Africa?

285
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,390
That's very interesting.

286
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,390
It's very unique.
The Republic of South Africa?

287
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,530
How long did you study there?

288
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,260
It wasn't for long.

289
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,730
I spent a year in Thailand
when I was in middle school.

290
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,400
Then I went
to the Republic of South Africa.

291
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,500
- He studied abroad.
- He's a global talent.

292
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,160
- He's a global star.
- He studied abroad.

293
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,600
- He must speak good English.
- Jong Hyeop.

294
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,460
- You must speak good English.
- Not really.

295
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,910
- No? Not at all?
- No.

296
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,110
He does speak good English.

297
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,670
I bet he's good.

298
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,300
U.M.B.R.E.L.L.A.

299
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,040
(She suddenly spells umbrella.)

300
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,020
Umbrella!

301
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,170
Umbrella.

302
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,040
- You memorized it.
- Well done.

303
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,180
That was good.

304
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,890
- I'm hot.
- So Min is...

305
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,760
I'm doing two shows with So Min now.

306
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,100
My heart sinks
whenever she starts talking.

307
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,820
- It's all right.
- This is what Ji Hyo always does.

308
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,230
Monday, Tuesday...

309
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,400
Wednesday? Thursday?

310
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,610
Ji Hyo tries hard.

311
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,740
That's the wallpaper on her phone.
She studies hard.

312
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,800
That's funny.

313
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,300
So did you do something...

314
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,350
to become an actor?

315
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,520
(He tries to continue
with the talk.)

316
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,280
Well... I did.

317
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,210
Tell us more about it!

318
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,620
- That's too short.
- We are curious.

319
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,260
- We don't want a short answer.
- Make it longer.

320
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,680
Give a long answer.

321
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,730
- Go ahead and talk!
- "You know what?"

322
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,490
- Make things up.
- "When I was young..."

323
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,130
Say that you met Tom Cruise
in South Africa.

324
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,060
Jong Hyeop is talking.

325
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,830
I started working as a model
in South Africa.

326
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,140
- A model?
- A model in South Africa.

327
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,140
- Did you?
- Show us your walking.

328
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,200
A model in South Africa?

329
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,370
How did you manage to
become a model there?

330
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,880
- So Min's eyes are shining.
- A model in South Africa?

331
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,880
(She tosses her hair
when she hears the word "model".)

332
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,940
But things didn't go well.

333
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,710
So I wanted
to give it a try in Korea.

334
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,620
- So you came.
- That's why I came to Korea.

335
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,890
- Show us how you cry.
- That's so cool.

336
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,020
Walking.

337
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,890
Show us how you wail.

338
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,710
"What's wrong with me?"

339
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,950
(Show us how you wail.
"What's wrong with me?")

340
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,780
(The wailing king is proud.)

341
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,600
- "What's wrong with me?"
- That's not what he does.

342
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,820
You're not supposed
to say it like that.

343
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,160
"What's wrong with me?"

344
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,790
("What's wrong with me?")

345
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,770
He's really good.

346
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,270
That was perfect.

347
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,510
He's been making the worst clips...

348
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,830
in many TV shows these days.

349
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,830
He's weeping a lot.

350
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,210
Today, we have four special guests.

351
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,440
The crew members will...

352
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,680
grant your wishes during the race
on behalf of the witch.

353
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,910
- You will?
- Really?

354
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,030
First, I'd like you
to write down one wish each.

355
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,400
But it has to be something
that the crew members can grant.

356
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,600
So the Wish Committee
will review your wishes,

357
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,830
and we will grant the ones
that are approved.

358
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,500
Please bring in the table.

359
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,030
Okay.

360
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,530
(What would they write down
for their wishes?)

361
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,570
(They start
writing down their wishes.)

362
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,510
- This is...
- Those who are done...

363
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,300
can hand in your wishes right away.

364
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,120
(What are their wishes?)

365
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,620
Everyone, we've got
your earnest wishes.

366
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,860
Can I change my wish?

367
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,490
- During the race.
- No, you can't.

368
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,360
- I can never change my wish?
- No.

369
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,550
My wish is too small.

370
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,690
All right.

371
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,900
You always have a small wish.

372
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,790
Now I'd like each one of you
to read your own wish.

373
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,400
I want Seok Sam to be
my younger brother for a day.

374
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,660
- One day is too long.
- That's easy.

375
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,800
I think...

376
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,670
he's already treating
Suk Jin like his younger brother.

377
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,610
- It doesn't have to be his wish.
- That's not true.

378
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,650
It's official.

379
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,700
He should treat me
like his older brother officially.

380
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,910
Like his older brother.

381
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,120
- Even when the cameras are off.
- He should be polite to me.

382
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,120
- This is too small.
- Tell us about yours, Suk Jin.

383
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,780
- Suk Jin.
- I was being too nice.

384
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,210
- Why?
- I want all the crew members...

385
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,180
to cheer for me when I get off work.

386
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,500
What a boring wish.

387
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,690
- What's funny then?
- Suk Jin.

388
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,920
What do you think is funny?

389
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,290
You should've come up
with something unique.

390
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,740
Calm down.

391
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,790
What's your wish, Jong Kook?

392
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,060
I want Kwang Soo...

393
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,370
- to join our show as a guest.
- That's similar to mine.

394
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,510
- Really?
- I like that.

395
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,980
- What about you, Haha?
- I want...

396
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,300
Kwang Soo to be
a crew member here for a day.

397
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,570
He could be a writer, or
he could learn how to fly a drone.

398
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,880
But he can't be on TV.

399
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,180
He can't be on TV.

400
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,120
So Kwang Soo will never be
able to get away from us?

401
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,210
- He should be here every week.
- We call him every week.

402
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,390
- He might come here every week.
- Right.

403
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,280
- Next up is Ji Hyo.
- You guys are so clingy.

404
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,420
I want the staff members
to tell me...

405
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,450
the answers to the quizzes
for one day.

406
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,460
Yes. I want the same thing as her.

407
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,770
I want the staff members
to only tell me the answers...

408
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,190
for English
or Chinese character quizzes...

409
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,870
and make it look like I knew
the answers.

410
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,800
But you already revealed your plan.

411
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,510
- I mean... You're right.
- You shouldn't have revealed it.

412
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,750
I see that those who are always
at the bottom want such things.

413
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,780
- Exactly.
- I want it.

414
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,850
- Next up is Se Chan.
- This is what I actually wish for.

415
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,850
I want Haha to buy me...

416
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,940
- the latest model tablet PC.
- Why should I?

417
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,490
- Why Haha?
- I want the latest model.

418
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,250
- Why me?
- I really want to have one.

419
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,780
- Why?
- My wish lately is...

420
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,680
- to use a tablet PC...
- Don't build a fake relationship.

421
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,990
That's not my intention.
I'm serious.

422
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,360
- You want what?
- A tablet PC.

423
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,630
You could've asked the staff for it.

424
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,320
No, I want Haha to buy it for me.

425
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,130
- That would be meaningful.
- It would be meaningful.

426
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,630
Haha, can you do it?

427
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,500
Well... I guess I could.
I mean if he wins the race.

428
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,010
- Next up is Ji Hyun.
- I heard he bought a nice gift...

429
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,930
I want the cast members of this show
to watch the first episode...

430
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,540
of our drama and post about it
on social media.

431
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,750
Thank you in advance.

432
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,150
- Thank you in advance, everyone.
- Jae Suk doesn't use social media.

433
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,680
- I'll post about it on Suk Jin's.
- You don't have to do it...

434
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,710
- if you don't have accounts.
- Of course we'll do that.

435
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,990
- Absolutely.
- He can upload a photo of us.

436
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,680
- We'll have a photo taken together.
- You can do this too, right?

437
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,530
- Next up is Do Kwon.
- Of course we can do it.

438
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,530
That's nice.

439
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,860
Okay. I want to give Jong Kook
a personal training session...

440
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,790
and have him upload it
to his YouTube channel.

441
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,460
- That sounds fun.
- Hey, you wrote it in a rude way.

442
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,370
Has he lost his mind?

443
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,870
I followed the format we were given.

444
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,700
You could've used honorifics.

445
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,430
That would've made the sentence
sound unnatural.

446
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,010
Not if you use a proper preposition.

447
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,200
That's why one of them is
in parentheses.

448
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,750
- You use one or the other.
- Just let it go.

449
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,280
- You should write it down for him.
- Just let it go already.

450
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,890
- Gosh. Why that little...
- Yong Gu.

451
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,810
- I like your small revenge.
- That was nice.

452
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,860
- You won, Do Kwon.
- It was small revenge.

453
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,780
- Do Kwon won.
- He went to SNU for a reason.

454
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,580
- That's hilarious.
- Jong Kook, do you accept?

455
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,630
I should be trained by him?

456
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,420
- Oh, gosh.
- Just give it a try.

457
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,060
This is driving me nuts.
I accept it for now.

458
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,730
- Jong Hyeop, it's your turn.
- Okay.

459
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,530
Actually, I'm a big fan of Haha's.

460
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,980
So I want him to buy me
a high-performance speaker.

461
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,980
Nice.

462
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,150
(Jong Hyeop, "I want Haha to buy me
a high-performance speaker.")

463
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,350
- Me?
- Haha?

464
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,940
- Let's make our wishes come true.
- Okay.

465
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,940
(Many people make a wish to CEO Ha.)

466
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,850
- Did he mean me?
- Let's make him spend money.

467
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,620
- You... Who are you?
- Chae Jong Hyeop.

468
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,660
- Do you know me? Why me?
- This is nice.

469
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,580
- Why me? What's the reason?
- Haha.

470
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,630
- Just do it for him.
- Well...

471
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,660
He says he's your fan.

472
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,730
- I'm grateful for that, but...
- It's because he likes you.

473
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,100
- Just do it for him.
- Gosh, seriously.

474
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
This is driving me crazy.

475
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,240
- Haha, do it for him.
- Okay. I'll do it.

476
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,430
- Do it for him.
- How much is it worth?

477
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,110
- He wants a high-performance one.
- How much is it?

478
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,880
- Just buy one for him.
- It probably costs 1,000 dollars.

479
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,930
At least 500 dollars.

480
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,510
- Why would he pick me?
- It should cost that much.

481
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,250
- We've gathered your wishes.
- Can't I change mine?

482
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,910
- Can't I change my wish?
- Just this once.

483
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,040
- To what?
- Just this once.

484
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,940
I was going to ask Suk Jin
to buy me a T model.

485
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,150
- What's a T model?
- A T model?

486
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,750
It's a new SUV from K brand.

487
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,760
Gosh.

488
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,990
- It's like an ad.
- Why should I buy it for you?

489
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,280
- Why?
- Suk Jin, you can do it, right?

490
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,790
- Pardon?
- You can do it, right?

491
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,320
- Change your wish too.
- Me?

492
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,100
Fine. Then I'll accept that
and change my wish too.

493
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,560
- I'll do the same.
- Me too.

494
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,690
- Me too.
- Me too.

495
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,000
- I want an apartment in Banpo-dong.
- Hey, write it down.

496
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,430
- I want a T model.
- Write it down.

497
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,770
I want a 195㎡ apartment.
Jong Hyeop, is that okay with you?

498
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,570
I want to change mine too.
It's a realistic wish.

499
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,750
I want Dong Hoon to work
at my grandma's house.

500
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,150
She has a vegetable garden
and needs to move sacks of soil.

501
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,070
Dong Hoon, can you help us
with that work?

502
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,150
- I can't believe this.
- Please?

503
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,580
Why would you pick me as well?

504
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,860
All of your ardent wishes
have been received.

505
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,860
And we'll think that the people
who are involved have agreed.

506
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,530
However, it's only reasonable
that if you want something,

507
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,770
you must pay the price for it.

508
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,000
So today...

509
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,770
Some of us don't know
what "reasonable" means.

510
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,660
- I know what that means.
- Tell her the answer.

511
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,870
That's not necessary. I know.

512
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,280
We prepared a Wish Box
and a Payment Box.

513
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,040
After all the missions end,
we'll pick two from the Wish Box,

514
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,780
and the wishes of those two
will come true.

515
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,620
- You'll pick 2, not just 1?
- Yes.

516
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,480
But the price for their wishes
will be paid by two people...

517
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,890
picked from the Payment Box
through a harsh penalty.

518
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,590
- It's on behalf of the winners.
- Oh, I see.

519
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,830
It's interesting.
It's like the plot of the drama.

520
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,330
In the two boxes,

521
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,300
each of you has one ball
with your name on them.

522
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,340
You'll get into two teams
to play a game,

523
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,870
and the winning team gets to add
a ball for each of the members.

524
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,200
(The losing team members' names
are added to the Payment Box.)

525
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,840
Obviously, the losing team members'
names are added to the Payment Box.

526
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,700
Then how many penalties
will Haha get?

527
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,770
(Only when their team wins
will their wishes come true.)

528
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,910
But...

529
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,980
There's a way to avoid adding
your name when your team loses.

530
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,250
At the end of each game,
we'll make penalty juice...

531
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,060
that's bitter in your mouth
but very good for your health.

532
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,330
- I hate that.
- I can't drink it.

533
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,420
The five members will share it,
and if they finish it,

534
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,400
their names won't be added
to the Payment Box.

535
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,070
- Really?
- It's really bitter.

536
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,800
And we selected Ji Hyo and Ji Hyun
as team leaders...

537
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,660
and divided you into two teams
to maintain the balance.

538
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,310
The members of Team Song Ji Hyo
are Haha,

539
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,050
Se Chan, So Min, and Do Kwon.

540
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,200
(Team Song Ji Hyo,
Haha, Se Chan, So Min, Do Kwon)

541
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,240
Yong Gu!

542
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,550
- Yong Gu.
- Great.

543
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,820
- We have younger members.
- Then we're on the same team.

544
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,350
The members
of Team Nam Ji Hyun are...

545
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,660
Jae Suk, Suk Jin, Jong Kook,
and Jong Hyeop.

546
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,360
- Okay!
- We can beat them.

547
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,750
I like this combination.

548
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,160
- I like it.
- It's nice.

549
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,490
- I'm glad Ji Hyun is our leader.
- It's great.

550
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,990
Oh, my gosh. I'm the team leader.
All right.

551
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,330
Please change your clothes.

552
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,960
- And we'll begin the first mission.
- Okay!

553
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,400
Nice!

554
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,540
(Which team will take the victory
with the best teamwork?)

555
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,540
There comes our financial supporter.
You're here, Do Kwon.

556
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,610
- Isn't Jong Hyeop on our team?
- Okay!

557
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,650
- No, he isn't.
- I see.

558
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,820
- Hey, So Min is disappointed.
- He's on our team.

559
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,150
Exactly. I thought
Jong Hyeop was on our team.

560
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,150
(Love Frog activated her radar.)

561
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,620
So Min is upset.

562
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,790
Are you interested in Jong Hyeop?

563
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,820
- Gosh, no. Why?
- You're waving your hand...

564
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,860
It's so funny that I mentioned
his name more than ten times,

565
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,860
but he never turned around
when he must've heard me.

566
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,920
- Who? Why?
- I don't have good hearing.

567
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,660
That's how Se Chan would look
if he became much more handsome.

568
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,800
Nonsense.

569
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,430
I mean if he gets
all kinds of plastic surgery.

570
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,230
(It sounds a little bit absurd,
but they do look a bit similar.)

571
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,610
- I would look like him?
- Yes.

572
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,380
- Don't compare him to Se Chan.
- Exactly.

573
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,050
- What's your problem?
- Se Chan looks a little like him.

574
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,320
They have
completely different vibes.

575
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,980
- If you hit Se Chan's face...
- Hey, stop it.

576
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,710
- Stop hitting me.
- And scrape it like this.

577
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,450
And reshape it.

578
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,510
By the way, Ji Hyo...

579
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,330
Are you one of our members
or are you a guest today?

580
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,980
- She's our guest today.
- She's our guest.

581
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,490
- Address her politely as a guest.
- As our guest...

582
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,490
Ji Hyo, you should show
your upper teeth like Ji Hyun does.

583
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,960
That's good. Keep it up.

584
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
(She's equipped with a smile
like a guest.)

585
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,990
That's great.

586
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,730
- Show less of your upper lip.
- Show your upper teeth. Good.

587
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,140
- She looks so cute.
- Bite your teeth.

588
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,540
The first mission where you must get
the large wish ball...

589
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,770
to add your name to Wish Box is...

590
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,120
The One Who Gets the Wish Ball.

591
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,510
- You'll have 1-on-1 matches.
- Oh, I see.

592
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,550
The rules are simple.

593
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,860
Both players hold a gym ball
as they begin the match.

594
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,680
The one who takes the gym ball
from the other wins.

595
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,220
(The player who takes the gym ball
from the other wins.)

596
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,560
I guess it requires
physical strength.

597
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,420
- Isn't it too simple?
- Strong ones have an advantage.

598
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,400
The names of the winners
of each round...

599
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,160
and the names of all members
of the team with more winners...

600
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,140
will be added to the Wish Box.

601
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,810
- Then...
- We made the matchup list.

602
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,540
The first round is
Haha versus Suk Jin.

603
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,580
Why?

604
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,080
- He's really strong.
- It'll be easy.

605
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,240
- I won't go easy on you.
- He's been working out at home.

606
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,670
I've been working out at home.

607
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,240
He does 20 push-ups in 1 week.

608
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,850
In one week?

609
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,660
Isn't that too few?

610
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,980
He does 20 push-ups in 1 week?

611
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,420
How many push-ups does he do
in one day?

612
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,330
- He does 20 push-ups in 1 week?
- It's not too few.

613
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,600
- Not 20 push-ups in 1 day?
- It's not too few.

614
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,720
That means he does 2 or 3 push-ups
per day.

615
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,520
- Exactly.
- Hey, he's still young and healthy.

616
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,160
- Always be healthy.
- I'm surprised that he can do that.

617
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,460
I wish you health and blessings.

618
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,260
The second round is
Ji Hyo versus Ji Hyun.

619
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,310
(Round 2, Ji Hyo versus Ji Hyun)

620
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,380
The third round is
Se Chan versus Jae Suk.

621
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,230
The fourth round is
So Min versus Jong Hyeop.

622
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,440
(Me and Jong Hyeop?)

623
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,970
The fifth round is
Do Kwon versus Jong Kook.

624
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,580
- Look how happy So Min is.
- So Min seems excited.

625
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,320
- It's not like that.
- Look at her.

626
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,410
- She's smiling happily.
- It's not like that.

627
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,850
I don't like it. No.
We'll change players.

628
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,160
But Jong Hyeop and So Min...

629
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,360
- Your team has one more man.
- Is it fair?

630
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,560
Then I'll play against So Min
instead of him.

631
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,020
- No. Why?
- Don't be like that.

632
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,660
- We don't want to see her happy.
- I'll do it.

633
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,800
- I'll do it.
- Why?

634
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,930
- Or let Suk Jin do it.
- Why?

635
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,070
- I'll do it.
- It annoys me.

636
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,400
I hate it
when So Min acts like this.

637
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,340
- I mean...
- No. It's unacceptable.

638
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,540
- We'll decide. I'll do it.
- Absolutely no.

639
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,810
You do it no matter what.
This is not acceptable.

640
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:25,930
- Why not?
- I don't like it.

641
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,610
Hey, it's tough love.

642
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,810
- Guys...
- We won't let that happen.

643
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,850
Jong Hyeop, what do you say?

644
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,510
- Absolutely no. Don't even ask him.
- Let's hear him out.

645
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,180
- Don't say anything.
- Who do you want to play against?

646
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,390
- I...
- Who do you want to play against?

647
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,910
I wouldn't mind playing
against anyone.

648
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,120
- Then play against Se Chan.
- Play against Se Chan.

649
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,950
Then play against Se Chan.

650
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,330
(They stopped Love Frog
from the get-go.)

651
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,750
All right. Play against me, kid.

652
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,450
- I'll teach you a lesson.
- Great.

653
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,070
They look a little alike.

654
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,260
- Taste the power of South Africa.
- Exactly.

655
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,370
- I'll show him Dongducheon's power.
- Okay.

656
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,990
Then we'll change the players
to Se Chan versus Jong Hyeop...

657
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,070
- and So Min versus Jae Suk.
- Why?

658
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,140
Yes. Sounds great.

659
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,810
- That's neat.
- Look at Jae Suk's face.

660
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,880
The fifth round is
Do Kwon versus Jong Kook.

661
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Nice!

662
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,910
I can't believe
Jong Kook and Jae Suk.

663
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,050
Don't even dream of it.

664
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,650
(Team Ji Hyo versus Team Ji Hyun)

665
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,590
The first round is
Haha versus Suk Jin.

666
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,710
Why is Do Kwon tying his shoelaces?

667
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,980
(The only person
who is too serious to laugh)

668
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,990
- Do Kwon is serious about this.
- He's tying his shoelaces.

669
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,330
- He looks weird.
- Why...

670
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,190
Do Kwon is determined to win today.

671
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,490
I hate it when people like him
come on the show. I hate it so much.

672
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,610
- He said he got sick of it.
- I meant it.

673
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm worried. He's really strong.

674
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,040
(Suk Jin versus Haha)

675
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,140
He might lose.

676
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,230
I think it'll end quickly.

677
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,440
Ready.

678
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,150
Suk Jin has been working out
at home.

679
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,170
Get set.

680
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,050
(The game begins.)

681
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,360
He's so strong.

682
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,060
What an amazing speed.

683
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,120
(The match between a strong old man
and a fast kid)

684
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,180
It won't be easy.

685
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,330
- You shouldn't move that way.
- Exactly.

686
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,300
- That was good.
- It's a ground fight.

687
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,400
That's good.

688
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,070
(The little wrestler succeeds
in getting him on the ground.)

689
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,760
Just keep pressing him down, Haha.

690
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,230
- That's good.
- Hey, Haha.

691
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,410
Okay.

692
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,810
Suk Jin is in his 50s.

693
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,810
(Laughing)

694
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,850
That's so funny.

695
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,170
(The elder is being toyed with
by the fast kid.)

696
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,650
Haha, Suk Jin is in his 50s.

697
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,660
(The dirty fight
between a kid and an old man)

698
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,130
This is no joke.
I bet our ratings just hit the roof.

699
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,720
Good. You should do things like that
to win.

700
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,720
Roll it. That's it!

701
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,370
(The kid wins in the end.)

702
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,960
(He had to fight with all his might
to defeat the man in his 50s.)

703
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,500
- Okay!
- Great job!

704
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
Hey.

705
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,930
I guess nothing can beat youth.

706
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:38,930
(The kid in his 40s is
still full of energy and vigor.)

707
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:42,240
- Haha is quite...
- I went easy on him. That's why.

708
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,740
Haha won the first round.

709
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,410
Haha's name will be added
to the Wish Box.

710
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,180
Now, the next round is...

711
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,850
Ji Hyo versus Ji Hyun.

712
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:50,950
- Okay!
- Oh, my.

713
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,360
They finally meet.

714
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,720
This is a big event.

715
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,250
Teach her a lesson
with your strength.

716
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,330
Ji Hyo, show us what you can do.

717
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,990
- Go, Ji Hyo!
- Ji Hyun, Ji Hyo is strong.

718
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,960
- Oh, no.
- She's practically a man.

719
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,900
- Really?
- Yes.

720
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,960
I'm in trouble.

721
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,340
Ji Hyun, you can't beat her.

722
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,870
- Oh, no.
- She's incredibly strong.

723
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,430
- What should I do?
- Good luck.

724
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,270
- Ready.
- Go, Ji Hyo!

725
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,640
- It's obvious.
- Ji Hyun, do your best.

726
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,850
- Get set, go.
- Ji Hyo, please.

727
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,850
- Go, Witch Song!
- You can do it, witch!

728
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,150
- Ji Hyo, don't go easy on her.
- Look how relaxed Ji Hyo is.

729
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,480
- Ji Hyo, finish it now.
- Ji Hyun, just pull it away.

730
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,620
- Pull it away now.
- Pull it! That's good.

731
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,860
- Ji Hyo, she might take it away.
- Just pull it away. Pull it.

732
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,250
(Ji Hyun caught Ji Hyo off guard.)

733
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,790
- Ji Hyo, she might take it away.
- Pull it! That's good.

734
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,750
(Song Jeoktoma got startled
by her unexpected strength.)

735
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,900
Seeing how she's playing,
Ji Hyun is not easy to defeat.

736
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,460
She is so strong.

737
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,800
She's not easy to defeat.

738
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,810
(Chuckling)

739
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,000
Look how she's chuckling
while pulling the ball.

740
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,110
- This is so funny.
- Actually,

741
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,050
I guess Ji Hyun is the type who acts
cheeky while playing games.

742
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,670
- True.
- She keeps smiling and laughing.

743
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,320
- That's true.
- Ji Hyo, it's time to finish it.

744
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,550
- Ji Hyo, finish it now.
- It's time.

745
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,150
Jong Kook, can you fix my hair?

746
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,890
- Sure. I'll fix your hair.
- Gosh. I'm exhausted.

747
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,750
(Sure. I'll fix your hair.)

748
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,920
She asked me to do it.

749
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,950
That'll become a boyfriend meme.

750
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,800
But he's on my team.

751
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,250
I'm sure the clip will be
all over the Internet.

752
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,020
- She asked me to do it.
- What's going on?

753
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,100
- She asked me to fix her hair.
- What was that? She's on that team.

754
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,870
- She asked me to fix her hair.
- Gosh, seriously.

755
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,300
I said, she asked me a favor!

756
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,870
Should I have ignored it?

757
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:20,050
Let it go. Don't do it.
Don't say a word.

758
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,770
- Okay.
- Eun Hye, I'm sorry.

759
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,050
(Eun Hye, I'm sorry.)

760
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,440
(He mentioned her again as always.)

761
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,320
- I told you not to talk about her.
- Fine.

762
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,590
(This man has been teasing Jong Kook
by talking about her.)

763
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,920
"Eun Hye, I'm sorry."

764
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,490
Ji Hyun seems quite strong too.

765
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,760
Their endurance will decide
the winner after some time...

766
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,690
(So Min came to straighten
Ji Hyo's clothes.)

767
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,640
Let's see. She's lying on her belly.
That's good.

768
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,910
Okay. That's good.

769
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,340
(She's hitting Ji Hyun afterward.)

770
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,470
(She cheats
before anyone could stop her.)

771
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,310
- Hey, stop it!
- Hey!

772
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,320
What? She just helped Ji Hyo.

773
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,050
- Nice.
- Good job.

774
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,440
- Nice!
- Okay. Great job.

775
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,290
- Good job.
- Wasn't that foul play?

776
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,410
- All right. That was great.
- Let's go!

777
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,420
(They don't care if it was cheating.
They're celebrating the victory.)

778
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,790
You're so cool!

779
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,330
- Good job.
- Good job. That felt so good.

780
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:14,130
- That felt really good.
- Good job. You did well.

781
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,570
- It's okay. It must've been tough.
- She's so strong.

782
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,730
I won't go easy on her.
I don't care that she's a girl.

783
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,910
So Min versus Jae Suk.

784
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,610
(Round 3, So Min versus Jae Suk)

785
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,970
- It's okay.
- We need to win this round.

786
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,500
Jae Suk, just...

787
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,150
- I'll teach her a lesson.
- Yes, do that.

788
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,500
I really don't want to play
against him.

789
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,410
So she can't think of anything else.

790
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,550
- Jong Hyeop...
- Teach her a lesson.

791
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,890
(Her eyes are fixed on him.)

792
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,950
Why are you looking at Jong Hyeop?

793
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,590
- It's not like that.
- She's looking at him.

794
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,130
I'm allowed to look at Jong Hyeop
while playing against him, right?

795
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,160
Yes, that's okay.

796
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,360
- She'll get motivated by doing so.
- Do as you want.

797
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,420
I'll finish it as soon as it begins.

798
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,220
Look at him or not.
Do whatever you want.

799
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,900
- Ready.
- I'll finish it right away.

800
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,840
- What?
- It didn't go as he planned.

801
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,570
- What's wrong?
- Jae Suk is taken aback.

802
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,110
- It must not be easy.
- Look at her.

803
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,500
My gosh. He can't seem to finish it.
What's wrong with you?

804
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,110
- She's looking at Jong Hyeop.
- Hey!

805
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,880
- She's looking at Jong Hyeop.
- I'm impressed.

806
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,770
- My goodness. I can't believe...
- Her eyes are fixed on him.

807
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,970
Look at that.

808
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,590
- The power of love!
- Love!

809
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,360
- She won't look anywhere else.
- I can see...

810
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,950
the determination in her eyes.

811
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,210
Gosh. She's strong.

812
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,160
- Hide behind me.
- Gosh.

813
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,490
(He hid behind Suk Jin
as her affection is too much.)

814
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,420
- It's not easy.
- You should twist it.

815
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,760
- Jong Hyeop, make a finger heart.
- No. Our team might lose.

816
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,960
I won't lose.

817
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,460
That's great. Good.

818
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,370
- That's good!
- Come on.

819
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,310
(The frog provokes him.)

820
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,110
- Pull it away.
- That's good.

821
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,650
(She's pulling his hair.)

822
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,440
- Keep it up!
- You're doing great!

823
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,850
Try everything you can!

824
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,740
- Come on. You shouldn't lose.
- Hey.

825
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,320
It seems that So Min is trying
to get her revenge.

826
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
(Because he stopped her
from playing against Jong Hyeop,)

827
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,590
(So Min starts to take revenge.)

828
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,660
- Keep it up!
- Hey.

829
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,190
Hey, you shouldn't lose.

830
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,100
- You should not lose.
- He's going to butt heads with her.

831
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,490
- My, it's not easy at all.
- Normally...

832
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,100
- Come on!
- Oh, no. Gosh.

833
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,840
- Okay!
- I ran out of energy.

834
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,660
- You did well.
- I ran out of energy.

835
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,670
- Look at him getting all excited.
- I ran out of energy.

836
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,140
Good job. That was great.

837
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,810
- He seems so excited.
- Okay!

838
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,380
- He looks so happy.
- Good job!

839
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,850
Oh, my. What a tough guy.

840
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,940
He's a real man.
He's excited about defeating So Min.

841
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,740
- By the way...
- That was cool. You beat So Min.

842
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,240
- Good job.
- I mean...

843
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,790
(He's celebrating as if he won
a gold medal in the Olympics.)

844
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,560
He looks exhilarated.

845
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,450
- He got too excited.
- Good job!

846
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,630
Next up are Se Chan and Jong Hyeop.

847
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,960
- South Africa!
- Get out here, South Africa!

848
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,730
- He has a muscular body.
- I think...

849
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,660
- he's been working out.
- He has a muscular body.

850
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,260
- He has hard muscles.
- Indeed. He has a muscular body.

851
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,040
But we can't be sure.
Se Chan has a body like a farmer's.

852
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,880
- Unexpectedly...
- He has the body of a servant.

853
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,700
- He has the body of a servant.
- He has a strong lower body.

854
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,150
Se Chan has the body of a servant.

855
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,440
Hey, you...

856
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,620
- He lost some weight.
- Jong Hyeop.

857
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,750
- Jong Hyeop, good luck.
- He has such broad shoulders too.

858
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,360
- Indeed. He looks strong.
- He has such broad shoulders.

859
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,720
- Exactly. He has a strong body.
- Se Chan, you can do this.

860
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
They both have
unexpectedly strong bodies.

861
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,950
- Good. Keep going.
- Hold on. I'm not ready.

862
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,460
- Se Chan, don't get intimidated.
- You can do this.

863
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,070
- You have to win this, Jong Hyeop.
- You can do this!

864
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,070
(It's so tense already.
Who will win?)

865
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,140
You can do it!

866
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,260
- Ready.
- You can do it!

867
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,340
Hey.

868
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,340
(The game begins.)

869
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,700
Jong Hyeop, he's sly.
Watch out for him.

870
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,700
Oh, really?

871
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,050
(Pinching)

872
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,210
(Jong Hyeop starts attacking
fiercely right away.)

873
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,550
- Pull it away!
- Oh, gosh.

874
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,120
- Hey, Se Chan.
- That's good!

875
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,060
Se Chan, you can win this.

876
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,860
Good. Keep going!

877
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,720
- Hey, Jong Hyeop.
- Hey!

878
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,860
Jong Hyeop!

879
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,020
- Jong Hyeop!
- That's good.

880
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,070
- Good. That's great.
- Jong Hyeop.

881
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,160
Good. You're doing great!

882
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,570
You're a pro!

883
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,660
- Jong Hyeop, hit him back.
- No.

884
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,000
(But then, Jong Hyeop got Se Chan
on the ground.)

885
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,700
- Jong Hyeop, hit him back.
- No.

886
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,610
Oh, my. This is like a UFC match.

887
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,740
- No.
- Oh, gosh.

888
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,320
(He lifted Se Chan up!)

889
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,450
(Se Chan is desperately holding
on to the gym ball.)

890
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,590
No!

891
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,360
All right! Take it away from him!

892
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,950
(The servant power is increasing.)

893
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,250
- That's so cool.
- Keep going!

894
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,900
- Lift him up just like he did.
- No.

895
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,660
- Keep it up! You can do it!
- Hey.

896
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,020
Se Chan, you're so cool.

897
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,230
Se Chan, you're way uglier than him.
Just think of that.

898
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,460
Hey, Jong Hyeop.

899
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,000
- Hey, Jong Hyeop.
- Go, Se Chan!

900
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,270
Hey, you won't become a star
if you lose!

901
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,040
Gosh, he's so strong.

902
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,740
Se Chan, you can do this.
You've got this.

903
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,940
Hold on to it!

904
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,470
Okay!

905
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,670
(Jong Hyeop pulled it off.)

906
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,940
Hold on to it!

907
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,890
(South Africa won.)

908
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,410
- That was amazing.
- You're so cool.

909
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,860
- How cool. Take a close-up shot.
- Hey, Se Chan...

910
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,160
Take a close-up shot of him.
Go on and strike a pose.

911
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,160
- Which camera should I look at?
- Okay!

912
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,370
- He's so strong.
- Se Chan...

913
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,760
- didn't look cool at all.
- How much do you weigh?

914
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,230
Jong Hyeop is really strong.

915
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,600
- His body looks strong.
- He's so cool.

916
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,810
- Above all...
- He is incredibly strong.

917
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,160
- He has a good body frame.
- Jong Kook...

918
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
(Jong Hyeop's hidden strength
surprised everyone.)

919
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,840
Jong Kook, here.
Work out your lower body.

920
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,670
- Okay!
- Here. Use this.

921
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,650
- Okay!
- All right! You've got this!

922
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,380
- You've got this! Go for it!
- Okay!

923
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,650
- Don't worry. You can win this.
- You've got this.

924
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,120
- This is our last chance.
- Do Kwon, you can do it.

925
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,860
- Strength is not everything.
- You're absolutely right.

926
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,890
Come on!

927
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,560
- He just lifts up chunks of metal.
- Exactly.

928
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,250
Do Kwon, you should beat him
no matter what.

929
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,870
You're ready to create
a legendary meme.

930
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,260
Let's create a meme of
Jong Kook being humiliated.

931
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,070
- Aim at his left knee.
- Okay!

932
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,140
(Jong Kook Hunter
failed three times.)

933
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,730
Crush him!

934
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,760
(But he came back for his 4th try.)

935
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,730
He's here to bring Jong Kook down.

936
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,740
I have a feeling that the universe
is on my side today.

937
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,440
That's right. Today, he will fall.

938
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,680
You will see the end of the YouTuber
with 1.4 million subscribers.

939
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,320
I can tell how serious Do Kwon is
from the look in his eyes.

940
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,390
- All right. You've got this.
- Okay.

941
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,860
- Hold it.
- Go, Jong Kook! You've got this!

942
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,860
I think it'll end quickly.

943
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,490
- Ready.
- He looks so weak suddenly.

944
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,190
- Good! Ground fighting is good.
- That happened so quickly.

945
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,040
- Suddenly...
- Good!

946
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,570
(As soon as the match began,
Do Kwon got on the ground.)

947
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,570
(He wraps his legs
around Jong Kook's waist.)

948
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,770
That's good. Keep going.

949
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,690
- Oh, my. That's impressive.
- Do Kwon, you're doing great.

950
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,690
(He's holding Jong Kook tightly
to hunt him.)

951
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,520
- Jong Kook will be humiliated.
- His face looks so red.

952
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,780
I'll show people the end
of the YouTuber with 1.4 million...

953
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,620
I'll show people the end
of the YouTuber with 1.4 million...

954
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,090
No, don't!

955
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,410
(Do Kwon's mortifying moment)

956
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,510
Nice one!

957
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,710
(Do Kwon fights back.)

958
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,370
- What was that?
- That was great.

959
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,450
Did you see that?

960
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,610
Isn't it like watching UFC?

961
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,880
- Yes, UFC.
- Gosh.

962
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,690
Oh, no.

963
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,820
(The UFC-like intense game
drained both of their energy.)

964
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,520
Do Kwon is tired now.

965
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,790
It's over for Do Kwon.

966
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,930
He used up all his strength.

967
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,670
Do Kwon!

968
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,120
- Yong Gu.
- Yong Gu. Oh, dear.

969
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,590
You're only producing
humiliating scenes.

970
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,360
He's scratching Jong Kook's hand
with his stubble.

971
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,800
Can't you let me win this one time?

972
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,070
It's already my fourth attempt.

973
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,950
Do Kwon, you look like
such a coward right now.

974
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,950
Can't you at least look charismatic?

975
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,020
- Where's the camera?
- Good job.

976
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,750
Look charismatic.

977
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,750
Do Kwon,
it's time to go back to reality.

978
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,660
- Do Kwon...
- Just think that you're...

979
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,160
(But then)

980
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,990
That's the spirit!

981
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,400
- Nice one.
- It's his last bit of energy.

982
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,790
Do Kwon, push him away.

983
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,120
(Do Kwon squeezes out
the energy he has left.)

984
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,500
(Jong Kook stands strong though.)

985
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,940
Do Kwon, push him away.

986
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,170
(He pushes with all his might...)

987
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,440
(and wins!)

988
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,510
Did you push him with your feet?

989
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,710
Let him have the win.

990
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,300
- What just happened?
- Do Kwon!

991
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,650
No way.

992
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,180
- He pushed with his feet.
- Yes, his feet.

993
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,220
- Nicely done.
- He used his feet.

994
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,760
- Hold on.
- It's like he lost though.

995
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,960
Why does it feel like you lost?

996
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,430
It's obvious that
Jong Kook let you win.

997
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,060
(He feels iffy
despite getting payback.)

998
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,240
Win a lot against me today
and stop coming on the show.

999
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,530
And so Team Ji Hyo wins.

1000
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,600
Okay!

1001
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,870
Nicely done.

1002
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,570
The members of Team Ji Hyo...

1003
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,910
got to add their names
in the Wish Box.

1004
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,250
- It's okay though.
- It's okay.

1005
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,480
- It's okay.
- Good job, guys.

1006
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,650
Ji Hyun can't hide...

1007
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,020
her disappointed expression.

1008
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,520
It'll be all right.

1009
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,380
- I'm fine.
- We let them have that one.

1010
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,610
- We'll...
- Just wait until the next round.

1011
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,030
(Here's a gift for Ji Hyun
who's clearly disappointed.)

1012
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,800
(Just like
how your wish is granted...)

1013
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,800
(when you eat at the Witch's Diner)

1014
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,090
Here's the first juice.

1015
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,170
(To have your wish granted,
you must drink the green juice.)

1016
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,000
It will protect your stomach
and skin with antioxidants...

1017
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,800
and also lower
your cholesterol levels.

1018
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,500
It's cabbage and onion juice.

1019
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,880
(The first juice has
cabbage and onions.)

1020
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,820
(Nothing else was added
than the vegetables themselves.)

1021
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,880
But...

1022
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,880
I mean...

1023
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,190
It's full of antioxidants...

1024
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,530
and will lower
your cholesterol levels.

1025
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,190
It smells like kimchi sauce.

1026
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,690
(The scent of onions
stings their nostrils too.)

1027
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,400
- Hold on.
- This is too much.

1028
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,500
It'd be better not to eat things
that elevate your cholesterol level.

1029
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,800
Must we drink all of it?

1030
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,440
- All of it?
- Then our names won't be added?

1031
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,030
The ones that are already in there
will stay there.

1032
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,440
Let's do it.

1033
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,400
Then...

1034
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,610
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

1035
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,710
(Only Jae Suk wins.)

1036
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,920
Jae Suk's pleased with himself.

1037
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,170
Jae Suk gets to go first!

1038
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,750
Let's go ahead with it.

1039
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,980
- Let's do it.
- I feel bad about this.

1040
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,250
As long as
I don't have to drink it last.

1041
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,750
Rock-paper-scissors

1042
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,050
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Scissors.

1043
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,980
- Okay.
- Okay.

1044
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,480
- Okay.
- Okay, we're good.

1045
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,630
(He has to finish whatever's left.)

1046
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,770
- It'll be a nice scene.
- That happened seamlessly.

1047
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,920
(They let him take the last spot.)

1048
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,730
Welcome to the world
of variety shows!

1049
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,690
This looks like fun.

1050
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,900
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Scissors.

1051
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,030
- Okay.
- Good.

1052
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,730
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Step aside.

1053
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,880
(They don't mind letting the guests
take the short straw.)

1054
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,380
In order,
you'll drink as much as you want.

1055
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,440
(The order: Jae Suk, Jong Kook,
Suk Jin, Ji Hyun, Jong Hyeop)

1056
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
- I can drink as much as I want?
- That's right.

1057
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,570
Since you're the first one
to drink it,

1058
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,880
show an example.

1059
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,190
Of course.

1060
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,480
I'm ready to drink a lot.

1061
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,920
Just send it down your throat.

1062
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,110
Open up your throat.

1063
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,250
This...

1064
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:08,980
Are you sure this is drinkable?

1065
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,590
(Are you sure this is drinkable?)

1066
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,750
(A key question)

1067
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,130
- Right.
- You know,

1068
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,670
I'm curious about that too.

1069
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,230
That's a question I have too.

1070
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,730
They wouldn't try to kill us,
so just drink it.

1071
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,070
Everything in it
is perfectly healthy.

1072
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,070
What can be bad
about cabbage and onions?

1073
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,800
Yes, exactly.

1074
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,610
Why don't we clink our glasses
and drink together?

1075
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,750
Okay.

1076
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,340
- Let's say cheers.
- All right.

1077
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,340
And then we'll...

1078
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,250
- You know...
- Cheers.

1079
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,590
(He samples the drink.)

1080
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,520
What's wrong?

1081
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,550
(Happy that his cholesterol level
is going down)

1082
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,650
How is it?

1083
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,730
- Is it all right?
- I...

1084
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,860
I'm sorry to say this,
but I can't drink it.

1085
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,500
- Wait.
- We must do this.

1086
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,170
- Just do it.
- Jong Hyeop...

1087
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,070
Jong Hyeop has to drink
whatever is left.

1088
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,960
- Him and Ji Hyun.
- I can't possibly drink this.

1089
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,230
Leave them with a reasonable amount.

1090
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,880
- I can't possibly drink this.
- Cheers.

1091
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,210
- I'll consider this champagne.
- Just drink it.

1092
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,610
Let me make a toast.

1093
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,000
Say, YIN.

1094
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,250
YIN.

1095
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,610
- Youth is now.
- Youth is now.

1096
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,710
Cheers!

1097
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,280
They're drinking it.

1098
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,380
Keep going, guys.

1099
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,820
- Check out Jae Suk.
- How admirable.

1100
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,110
(He drinks it to save their names
from going in the Payment Box.)

1101
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,480
- Look at him.
- You can drink more.

1102
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,360
Please put it down
when you've had enough.

1103
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,800
Keep going. I know you can.

1104
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,800
Jae Suk is drinking it all.

1105
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,630
Suk Jin, you weak man.

1106
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,730
Suk Jin,

1107
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,270
it's drinkable.

1108
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,860
It's perfectly drinkable.

1109
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,170
It's a group effort,
so the others can finish it off.

1110
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,630
Suk Jin, you can quit then.

1111
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,730
The next one should drink.

1112
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,050
- You can quit.
- Go ahead and quit.

1113
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,610
- I'll drink the rest.
- This is crazy.

1114
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,070
I have a weak stomach, you know.

1115
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,610
Think of it as a protein shake.

1116
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,340
Look at Jong Kook.

1117
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,150
- It's like he's drinking a shake.
- How admirable.

1118
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,110
- That...
- All but one is willing to drink.

1119
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,420
(He's embarrassed.)

1120
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,550
He finished it.

1121
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,730
Open your throat wide.

1122
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,090
- That's super cool.
- Nice!

1123
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,250
- He added water and drank it all.
- He's a true man.

1124
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,770
It'll look weird
if they don't drink this.

1125
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,320
They have no choice but to drink it.

1126
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,500
(On eggshells)

1127
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,170
It'll seem like I'm a coward
if they drink it all.

1128
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,840
Exactly. Nicely done.

1129
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,130
- She drank it all.
- Nice.

1130
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,500
She finished her drink.

1131
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,550
- Unbelievable.
- Nice!

1132
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,900
Have a little taste.
It's not as bad as you think.

1133
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,340
Don't push yourself too hard,

1134
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,780
but drink it if it's okay.

1135
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,610
- Go, Jong Hyeop.
- Nice!

1136
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,650
(Jong Hyeop pours the drink down.)

1137
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,020
Just keep drinking.

1138
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,380
Suk Jin's feeling embarrassed now.

1139
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,820
I'll drink the rest.

1140
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,920
No, save it.

1141
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,030
Step aside.

1142
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,820
Move. Let me drink that for you.

1143
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,730
Why are you stopping him?

1144
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,690
This isn't how it's supposed to be.

1145
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,860
It's making me look weird.

1146
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,460
- Okay!
- Nicely done.

1147
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,500
Nice!

1148
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,210
(They polish off the penalty juice.)

1149
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,860
- It's drinkable.
- What did I tell you?

1150
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,670
The drink was shared
among the four members.

1151
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,070
Unbelievable.

1152
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,250
Only the four of them?

1153
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,550
I drank some of it too, you know.

1154
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:46,020
The four members
played their part...

1155
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,380
which resulted in your names
not being added to the box.

1156
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,710
You'll now move on to the next game.

1157
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,360
- Nice!
- No way!

1158
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,030
- Gosh.
- Jong Hyeop,

1159
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,960
you were on the fence, weren't you?

1160
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,360
I bet it was hard to drink.

1161
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,900
(They're onto the second game.)

1162
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,570
It must be a quiz.

1163
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,570
You're here for your second game.

1164
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,630
You must be quick-witted...

1165
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:08,670
to be able to add your name
to the Wish Box.

1166
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,000
This is Speak With Your Actions:
Quartet Edition.

1167
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,130
It's the Speak With
Your Actions game.

1168
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,280
Each team will take turns...

1169
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,880
to describe a word
with their actions.

1170
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,690
One member will try to guess
what the other four are describing.

1171
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,520
- Only one has to guess?
- The four...

1172
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,880
must describe the word...

1173
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,050
as a quartet.

1174
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,280
- As a quartet?
- In one group?

1175
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,550
However,

1176
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,460
two members
from the opposing team...

1177
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,320
will sit facing the other way...

1178
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,730
and try to guess the word
by using a mirror.

1179
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,230
(The opposing team
will use a mirror to guess.)

1180
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,340
Using the reflection in the mirror.

1181
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,860
The mirror isn't that big.

1182
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,500
I know.

1183
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,800
(It'll be a race against
2 members of the opposing team.)

1184
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,360
A cuckoo clock.

1185
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,130
Which team will go first?

1186
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,300
- Go ahead.
- Losers should go first.

1187
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,380
You should go first.

1188
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,440
- But you lost.
- That's not a crime.

1189
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,670
Then you should've won.

1190
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,880
Do Kwon, speak up for us.

1191
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,020
Then you should've won.

1192
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,820
(He uses the moment
to provoke Jong Kook.)

1193
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,920
- Then you should've won.
- Exactly.

1194
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,090
You should've won then.

1195
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,980
- Exactly.
- You should've won then.

1196
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,980
- I see.
- Then you can speak up.

1197
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,550
But we're back to square one now.

1198
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,730
- That's not how it goes.
- We should start over.

1199
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,590
Those minions.

1200
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:09,860
- You guys...
- Did you see their expressions?

1201
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,090
You guys stay behind.

1202
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,000
- How about another game then?
- Suk Jin.

1203
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,130
We'll grab a bite to eat.

1204
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,130
- They could easily take you on.
- We'll grab a bite to eat.

1205
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,730
He wants us to stay for a meal.

1206
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,000
- I'll be the guesser.
- Me too.

1207
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Go inside.

1208
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,880
Jong Hyeop, you be the guesser.

1209
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,280
- Nice.
- All right.

1210
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,520
- Pull it closest to you.
- Are you sure you can do this?

1211
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,020
- You can do this.
- Let's go!

1212
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,320
- Come on.
- I'll try and guess the answer.

1213
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,960
- Sure thing.
- Know what to focus on.

1214
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,090
Let's guess at least ten of them.

1215
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,730
- I think I'll be bad at this.
- It'll be all right.

1216
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,280
I'm slow at guessing things.

1217
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,420
- Really?
- Yes.

1218
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,500
This is bad.

1219
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
It'll be hilarious though.

1220
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,920
I think this will be fun.

1221
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,860
(Jong Hyeop says
he can be quite slow.)

1222
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,900
This is bad.

1223
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,000
Why don't I be the guesser instead?

1224
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,000
- I'll do it.
- Sure thing.

1225
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,070
(The two offer to change seats,
not realizing So Min's excitement.)

1226
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,480
- I lack wit.
- Sure thing.

1227
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:55,170
But Jong Hyeop is adorable.

1228
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,840
Jong Hyeop...

1229
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,050
- Jong Hyeop...
- Why though?

1230
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,320
Jong Hyeop wanted to be the guesser.

1231
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,150
He wanted a chance at it.

1232
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,440
I'll be sticking close
to So Min today.

1233
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,360
But Jong Hyeop
was seated here just now.

1234
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,550
I'll be by Jong Hyeop's side today.

1235
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,190
A 1-on-1 defense.

1236
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,460
Sure thing.

1237
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,500
- Jae Suk, do your best.
- Are you ready?

1238
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,690
This will be easy.

1239
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,400
- Okay, let's go.
- Here we go.

1240
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:17,770
Ji Hyun should be in the front.

1241
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,500
- Right.
- We can't get in her way.

1242
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,940
It's best
if she stands in front of us.

1243
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,400
Are you ready?

1244
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,630
Let's go.

1245
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,940
Guys, be witty about this.

1246
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,170
(The word?)

1247
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,440
Ji Hyun, sit there...

1248
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
and just do this.

1249
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,070
Just do this.

1250
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,340
(The first question)

1251
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,520
Like this.

1252
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,780
The sun.

1253
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,980
(Is Ji Hyun supposed to be the sun?)

1254
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,150
The sun.

1255
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,590
Is it hot? Is it sunscreen?

1256
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,400
(Chopping)

1257
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,630
- Something's being cut.
- Sliced. Hairtail.

1258
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,690
Mackerel.

1259
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:49,800
It's something we eat.

1260
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,090
- Korean cuisine.
- Squid.

1261
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,770
It's something edible. Sushi?

1262
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,210
(It must be something
you cut up to eat.)

1263
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,860
- Small octopus.
- Octopus.

1264
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,940
(Small octopus?)

1265
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,280
(Keep going.)

1266
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,380
Raw fish?

1267
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,050
Sushi?

1268
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,320
What kind of octopus?

1269
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,340
Long-legged octopus!

1270
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,780
What kind of octopus?

1271
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,880
- Long-legged octopus!
- What are you doing?

1272
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,690
(Suk Jin tried to cheat
but Se Chan caught on first.)

1273
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,190
Long-legged octopus!

1274
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,690
(They were doing well, but he went
ahead and gave a hint.)

1275
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,630
(Thanks to Jong Hyeop,
Team Ji Hyo earns a point.)

1276
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,090
They're practically giving us
the answer.

1277
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,920
- What kind of octopus was it?
- Long-legged octopus.

1278
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,300
Oh, long-legged octopus?

1279
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,570
(Team Ji Hyun lost their chance
to get the answer.)

1280
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,900
(Here's the next question.)

1281
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,840
You're the smoke.

1282
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,800
Bird, nest, swallow.

1283
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,280
(Is Jong Kook imitating a bird?)

1284
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,920
- Seahorse.
- Sparrow.

1285
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,110
- Ji Hyun, you should...
- Fly.

1286
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,360
Blowfish, eagle.

1287
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,420
Jellyfish!

1288
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,130
Jong Kook... Mosquito!

1289
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,150
No, it's not.

1290
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,480
- Something sharp.
- Fly?

1291
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,820
Seaweed.

1292
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,320
We're rolled up here.

1293
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,320
Keep quiet!

1294
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,460
- Sea anemone?
- You're rolled up?

1295
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,000
What on earth is that?

1296
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,530
They're imitating it very well!

1297
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,610
Hummingbird!

1298
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,030
Venus flytrap?

1299
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,070
Bee!

1300
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,280
Why is he pointing at himself?

1301
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,400
Mosquito... Mosquito net!

1302
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,710
- Mosquito!
- Hummingbird!

1303
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,300
It's related to a mosquito net.
What's it called?

1304
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,070
- Bird!
- It's related to a mosquito net.

1305
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,340
Mosquito repellent incense!

1306
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,050
(Mosquito repellent incense)

1307
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,590
(The answer is
mosquito repellent incense.)

1308
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:18,860
It's mosquito repellent incense.

1309
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,030
It's mosquito repellent incense.

1310
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,650
How does that
look like a bee to you?

1311
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,590
How does that
look like a bee to you?

1312
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,320
(The actor who acted mosquito
loses his temper.)

1313
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,230
- I got it.
- We got two. Let's do this, So Min!

1314
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,300
Se Chan, we can do this!
We can get them all.

1315
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:31,940
Don't let Jae Suk get any of it.

1316
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,190
Gosh, Jae Suk.

1317
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,210
- What do we do?
- What do we do?

1318
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,070
Why did he volunteer to answer?

1319
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,340
(Embarrassed)

1320
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,550
Wait. I'll get the answer this time.

1321
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,940
I will...

1322
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,670
I'll get the answer this time.

1323
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,250
- Think simply.
- I'll get the answer this time.

1324
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,420
I should get ready.

1325
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,690
You can start.

1326
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:49,920
- "The Little Mermaid"!
- "The Little Mermaid"!

1327
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,650
("The Little Mermaid")

1328
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,780
- "The Little Mermaid"!
- "The Little Mermaid"!

1329
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,530
Who got the answer?

1330
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,500
(They did.)

1331
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,860
That was great, Se Chan.

1332
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,070
- What is he doing?
- Let's do this!

1333
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,460
I can see everyone!

1334
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,590
Okay.

1335
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,170
What is he doing?

1336
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,630
- Get on my back.
- They're flustered.

1337
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,170
Okay.

1338
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:12,610
We need to see it
from their perspective.

1339
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,000
Motorcycle!

1340
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,900
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong with you?

1341
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,020
(Motorcycle)

1342
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,880
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong with you?

1343
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,980
Motorcycle!

1344
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,150
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong with you?

1345
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,320
Okay!

1346
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,550
Why wouldn't you answer?

1347
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,050
He can't even open his mouth.

1348
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,360
(He can't even open his mouth.)

1349
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,960
(This is already the last question
for Jae Suk who's facing a crisis.)

1350
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,190
I'll shoot it.

1351
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,920
1, 2, 3.

1352
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,130
- Curtain.
- Firecracker!

1353
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,170
A gun salute!

1354
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:40,900
- Bang!
- Firecracker!

1355
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,300
Firecracker!

1356
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,070
- A gun salute! Fireworks!
- Fireworks!

1357
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:45,280
All right.

1358
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:47,340
- Firecracker! Fireworks!
- A gun salute!

1359
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,710
- Fireworks!
- Fireworks! All right, we got it.

1360
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:50,500
- Fireworks!
- Fireworks! All right, we got it.

1361
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,650
(He copies So Min's answer
a little too late.)

1362
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:52,880
- I got it.
- Come on.

1363
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,550
Time is up.

1364
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,320
You did really well.

1365
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,520
He's so bad at it.

1366
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,480
(Team Ji Hyo: 5, Team Ji Hyun: 1)

1367
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,550
You missed all the questions.

1368
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,650
Come back in
when they play Round Two.

1369
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,730
So Min should do it.
So Min is good at this.

1370
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:09,960
- So Min is good at it.
- You should do it, So Min.

1371
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,170
Should I sit down?

1372
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:12,730
- All right.
- It was too difficult.

1373
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,710
- Last round.
- Ji Hyun, you should answer.

1374
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,710
- Can I do it? I want to answer.
- Should the two of us do it?

1375
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,800
Should the two of us do it?

1376
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,630
Jong Kook, Ji Hyun, please do well.

1377
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,070
Jong Kook is good at this though.

1378
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,340
Look at Jong Kook.

1379
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,150
He's incredible.

1380
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:27,110
- You're incredible.
- You're incredible.

1381
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:29,090
You look really scary from there.

1382
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:30,440
They can see your eye
from the mirror.

1383
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,320
I love it when you're on my team,
but when you're not...

1384
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,530
- It's hard when he's our opponent.
- Right.

1385
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,960
Get ready.

1386
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:39,300
Let's do it.

1387
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,130
(After setting his eye,
Round 2 starts.)

1388
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:42,690
- Let's do the highlighted part.
- I'm so nervous.

1389
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,530
(Given word)

1390
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,610
- Let's do this.
- Get on my back.

1391
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,270
Come behind me.

1392
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,210
Behind me.

1393
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:52,840
Horseback riding.

1394
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,340
(Horseback riding)

1395
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,670
- Slide!
- Slide!

1396
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,980
- All right!
- I almost got it.

1397
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,840
Slide!

1398
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,110
(Thanks to his snake-like eye,
he quickly gets the answer.)

1399
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:05,650
(Jong Kook was faster than So Min,
so he wins a point.)

1400
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:07,280
This is really hard.

1401
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,360
Crane!

1402
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:09,960
- Look at Do Kwon's face.
- Claw machine!

1403
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,300
Brachiosaurus?

1404
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,320
Look at Do Kwon's face.

1405
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,320
(Claw machine)

1406
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,960
(No, that's not it!)

1407
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,960
Snake!

1408
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,300
Snake!

1409
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,670
Oh, it's giraffe!

1410
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:22,730
All right!

1411
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:25,030
Oh, it's giraffe!

1412
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:27,000
(Disappointed)

1413
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,550
- All right.
- How is that a giraffe?

1414
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,670
- It looks like...
- That was great!

1415
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:31,840
Our team is doing so well.

1416
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,440
- Giraffe?
- Only one should be standing.

1417
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,780
Only one person should be standing.
Now, turn.

1418
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:35,820
What could it be?

1419
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,920
(Given word)

1420
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:40,190
- Propeller! Helicopter!
- A ride!

1421
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:41,630
- Who got the answer?
- Jong Kook is getting them all.

1422
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,480
- Jong Kook is really good at this.
- He's too good.

1423
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,030
- Propeller! Helicopter!
- A ride!

1424
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:48,000
(He gets the answer
with the snake-like eye.)

1425
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,170
You look like a venomous snake.

1426
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,860
He's incredible. He really is.

1427
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,900
Jong Kook is really good at this.

1428
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,110
What do we do?

1429
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:58,400
You can start.

1430
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,210
- I'll get down.
- A sled.

1431
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,000
- We need a sled.
- He's really good.

1432
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,840
- A sled.
- A sled.

1433
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,380
(They quickly assemble a sled.)

1434
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:08,840
Carriage.

1435
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,380
Carriage.

1436
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,380
(He must be the Rudolph.)

1437
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,750
What is that?

1438
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,590
Santa Claus!

1439
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:19,030
- Santa Claus.
- Santa Claus?

1440
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:21,000
Hercules.

1441
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:23,270
Hercules.

1442
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:24,690
- Santa Claus.
- Santa Claus?

1443
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,070
- Rudolph.
- Hercules?

1444
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,170
(Rudolph)

1445
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,360
- Rudolph?
- It's Rudolph!

1446
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,710
(Ji Hyun got the answer.)

1447
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,280
- Rudolph?
- Good job, Ji Hyun!

1448
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,500
That's good!

1449
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:35,050
Ji Hyun is good.

1450
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,840
So Min, you didn't get any correct.

1451
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,920
She's unbelievable.

1452
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,750
So Min! What are you doing?

1453
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,710
- Why are you so bad at this?
- This is driving you crazy, right?

1454
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,090
Jong Kook is incredible.

1455
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,780
(Given word: Diffuser)

1456
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,650
Diffuser? Let's stand like this,
and Ji Hyo, put your hands up.

1457
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:50,860
So Min is hilarious.

1458
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,590
(Given word: Diffuser)

1459
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,130
Wi-Fi!

1460
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:56,800
Antenna!

1461
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,570
Pine tree!

1462
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:01,840
The Statue of Liberty?

1463
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,070
Phytoncide?

1464
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,570
What is she saying?

1465
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:05,980
Diffu...

1466
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,800
Diffu...

1467
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:09,400
- What are you saying?
- Diffu...

1468
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,940
- Diffu...
- Air purifier.

1469
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,340
(The faulty diffuser
keeps making a noise.)

1470
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:15,980
- Diffu...
- Air purifier.

1471
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:20,520
(Using their whole body
to tell So Min the answer)

1472
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,780
- What is that?
- Diffu...

1473
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,750
- What on earth are you saying?
- Diffu...

1474
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:25,000
Diffuser!

1475
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,960
(Diffuser!)

1476
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,770
What was that? A diffuser?

1477
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:29,920
Diffuser!

1478
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,300
So Min is hilarious.

1479
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,530
It's okay. We can get the answers.

1480
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:34,840
We can get the answers.

1481
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,230
- We can get the answers.
- Let's get them.

1482
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,980
Let's stand like this.
You should spew out water here.

1483
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,000
(Given word: Fountain)

1484
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,440
You should spew out water here.

1485
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:43,940
Fountain!

1486
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,250
- What?
- That was fast.

1487
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:46,980
Fountain!

1488
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,880
(It ended before she could
spew out water.)

1489
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,480
- The answer is "fountain".
- Your eye!

1490
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,520
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
- What are you doing, So Min?

1491
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,520
(The snake-like eye
keeps stealing the answer.)

1492
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,960
- He is...
- He's immersed in it.

1493
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,820
- Jong Kook is incredible.
- Let's go!

1494
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,030
Jong Kook is incredible.

1495
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:02,590
Bird!

1496
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:03,800
- Woodpecker!
- What is that?

1497
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,500
(Woodpecker!)

1498
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,000
Woodpecker!

1499
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,030
(Annoyed)

1500
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,570
Well done, Jong Kook!

1501
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:11,380
You said
it's your first time playing.

1502
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,730
You're not really good at this.

1503
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:13,840
It's so funny.

1504
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,880
Jong Kook and Ji Hyun
are really good at this.

1505
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,110
- It's the last question.
- Let's show them!

1506
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,170
(It's the last question
as they're running out of time.)

1507
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,820
- I'll get on the floor.
- Get on the floor.

1508
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,610
Get on top of us.
Act like you're eating us.

1509
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,520
Get on top of me.

1510
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,480
- Sandwich! What is that?
- Jenga.

1511
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:31,250
Sandwich! What is that?

1512
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,300
Jenga.

1513
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,400
Sandwich! What is that?

1514
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,460
Jenga.

1515
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:36,920
Hamburger!

1516
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,440
- That guy...
- Seriously...

1517
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,840
- Hey, So Min!
- Darn it!

1518
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,570
(She got her answer stolen again.)

1519
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:46,300
(Team Ji Hyo became a hamburger
for Team Ji Hyun's benefit.)

1520
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,400
(Hey, So Min!)

1521
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,110
For whom are we doing this?

1522
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:53,570
(So Min became helpless
in front of the snake eye.)

1523
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,380
- He's so good at this.
- It's over.

1524
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,750
(End of the mission)

1525
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:59,090
Hey, what was that, So Min?

1526
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:03,190
I kept meeting Jong Kook's eye.

1527
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:05,590
It was so scary when he looked
at us through the mirror.

1528
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,960
I know. It was scary.

1529
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,070
Is this how you look at it?

1530
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:09,090
- It's like a side-view mirror.
- How?

1531
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,360
All I could see was Jong Kook's eye.

1532
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,190
I look at the side-view mirrors well
when I drive.

1533
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:13,440
It was so funny.

1534
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,800
Team Ji Hyun won the mission.

1535
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,230
(Team Ji Hyun turns the table
and takes the win.)

1536
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,380
What a relief.

1537
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,170
Bring in the juice, please.

1538
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:23,610
We lost?

1539
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:24,940
- It's not a problem.
- That was incredible.

1540
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:25,940
Let's drink it.

1541
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,320
- This is... What is that?
- We're drinking it?

1542
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,690
Jong Kook was too good at it.

1543
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,110
- What's that red juice?
- It must be beet juice.

1544
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,090
- Beets are good for your health.
- It's much better than what we had.

1545
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:34,920
- This is much better.
- Let's drink it.

1546
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,130
- This is...
- This is tasty.

1547
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:40,190
The next juice is a mix of
noni, beet, and garlic...

1548
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:42,070
which helps you strengthen
your immune system.

1549
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:43,530
- What? Garlic?
- Garlic?

1550
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,670
- They added garlic too.
- Then ours was better.

1551
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:47,340
It has garlic, so it must taste bad.

1552
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,460
It must taste bad.

1553
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,800
It must be bad.

1554
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,070
The order is important.

1555
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:53,340
Let's pour it into five glasses
and finish it at once.

1556
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:56,380
- That's enough.
- Let's all take turns to drink it.

1557
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,340
- We've been doing well so far.
- Right.

1558
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,670
Ready, go!

1559
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:01,880
Do Kwon is drinking it.

1560
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,110
(They start drinking
extremely sour juice...)

1561
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:06,960
(without hesitation.)

1562
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,130
I'm done. I finished it.

1563
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,920
- Look at Do Kwon.
- I'm done.

1564
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:12,230
Our team... We finished it.

1565
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,860
Do Kwon looks like Dracula.

1566
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,400
Do Kwon must've come today
with a strong determination.

1567
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,440
(He keeps declaring war
against Jong Kook.)

1568
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,670
There's some juice left.

1569
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,000
- Do Kwon.
- There's a lot of juice left.

1570
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
- Do Kwon, they didn't drink it.
- What's this?

1571
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,730
- Fail!
- I don't think I can drink it.

1572
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:25,980
(Are they giving up?)

1573
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,900
(What's this?)

1574
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,980
I can't drink it.

1575
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:31,480
- It's...
- It's too sour.

1576
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,610
You're giving up, right?

1577
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:33,710
What is it?

1578
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:35,820
I'll drink it.

1579
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:37,210
(Putting on an act)

1580
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:38,690
I can't even take a sip.

1581
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:39,780
You nasty people.

1582
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:43,030
Team Ji Hyo, your names
will be added to the Payment Box.

1583
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,130
Okay. We're sorry.

1584
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,550
- It's bitter.
- I'm sorry.

1585
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:48,300
Let's move on to the next spot.

1586
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,360
(What's the next mission
that'll grant their wishes?)

1587
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,860
It was really sour though.

1588
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,940
I'm the only one who finished it?

1589
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,030
That was incredible.

1590
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,270
(The long-awaited final mission)

1591
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:57,030
It's summer, so they prepared
a refreshing mission.

1592
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,210
Of course, since it's summer...

1593
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,280
Goodness, it's refreshing.

1594
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,210
(Two huge buoys
are waiting for them in a big pool.)

1595
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,170
It's really cold!

1596
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,020
- Is it cool?
- It's summer.

1597
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,710
It's too cold.

1598
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,690
Can we pour some hot water?
It's too cold in here.

1599
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:12,610
- But they already...
- Suk Jin, try this.

1600
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:14,420
This will help you get warmer.
Try it.

1601
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,030
You darn jerk.

1602
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:20,130
He's cussing now.

1603
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:21,420
It's really cold.

1604
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,130
Sit with your team, please.

1605
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:26,570
- Let's sit down.
- It's like underground water.

1606
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,000
- My goodness.
- This is...

1607
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,300
Everyone.

1608
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,840
Before you play the final mission,

1609
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,610
you'll play a preliminary mission
to earn a chance card...

1610
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:34,750
that'll be helpful
in playing the final mission.

1611
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,980
You're going to play Good Image.

1612
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,380
- Good Image?
- Good Image?

1613
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,780
It's a game played to
the beat of Break Up Strawberries.

1614
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,090
This one is hard.

1615
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:43,710
- My gosh.
- It's a team match.

1616
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:48,590
The one attacking should say
an image and a number.

1617
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:49,650
You can say...

1618
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,690
"Ugly person, two".
Something like this.

1619
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:56,270
The person who thinks the image
fits him or her...

1620
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,900
will defend.

1621
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:00,940
If two people defend
at the same time,

1622
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,500
the offensive team gets a point.

1623
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,780
The defensive team...

1624
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:07,980
could study each other's face
up to three times.

1625
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,480
- Among the team members.
- Up to three times?

1626
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,980
We can say something like,
"Do it, do it."

1627
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,480
Someone must defend
at the third beat.

1628
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,280
We need to decide who will go.

1629
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,480
For instance, you said an image
and a number.

1630
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:19,960
Then the defensive team
should defend.

1631
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,230
There should be only one Empty Head.
Play rock-paper-scissors to decide.

1632
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:23,360
(Play rock-paper-scissors
to decide.)

1633
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,960
- Haha.
- That team...

1634
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,300
- We...
- has four Empty Heads.

1635
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,590
- We should all say it.
- There are too many Empty Heads.

1636
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:30,190
- I'll take that title.
- You can't decide in advance.

1637
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:31,800
"Sexy" is Haha's.
We shouldn't steal it.

1638
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,130
- It's his no matter what.
- Okay, you can take that.

1639
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:34,670
"Cute and sexy" is mine.

1640
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:37,610
- "Cute and sexy"?
- "Cute and sexy".

1641
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:38,610
"Cute and sexy".

1642
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,230
(He's calling himself
cute and sexy.)

1643
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:43,710
We have two guests, so we can't
tell which one is Empty Head.

1644
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,170
I don't think Ji Hyun is.
Jong Hyeop seems like one though.

1645
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,190
Right? You're a bit dumb, right?

1646
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:50,590
- He's not witty at all, and...
- You are?

1647
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,380
It's good that you're admitting it.
I like it.

1648
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,820
- Of course. I admit it.
- Jong Hyeop is...

1649
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,730
Who do you want to go against
if you were to play a quiz?

1650
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:00,500
(His gaze is fixed at someone.)

1651
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,460
- Of course I'll pick...
- Who?

1652
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,170
- Who?
- How dare you look at me?

1653
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:07,570
Hey! I'm smarter than you think!

1654
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,670
- This is insane!
- He chose Se Chan right away.

1655
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:11,230
- He knows his opponent.
- I...

1656
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:12,300
How dare he pick me?

1657
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,980
Let's hurry up and play.

1658
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,780
By the way, Do Kwon...

1659
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,980
looks like a cameraman.

1660
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,250
He looks like
a documentary cameraman.

1661
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,940
He looks like one.

1662
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,380
You're lucky that you became
an actor.

1663
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,420
That's true.

1664
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,050
- How come you're so quiet now?
- He's lucky.

1665
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,960
- He's...
- He's tired now.

1666
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,190
- Ever since...
- He's been down since earlier.

1667
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:34,730
Ever since we played
with the bouncy ball...

1668
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:35,960
- You're a bit down, aren't you?
- He's out of energy.

1669
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,170
He's less excited now.

1670
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,400
Which image should we come up with?

1671
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,210
Would you like to start?

1672
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:43,670
Who... Do you want to
go first, Jae Suk?

1673
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:44,670
Okay.

1674
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:47,980
- Good image, good image
- Good image, good image

1675
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:49,610
Empty Head, two.

1676
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:51,710
- Empty Head, Empty Head.
- Good.

1677
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,840
Old fossil, three.

1678
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,250
Old fossil, old fossil, old fossil.

1679
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,280
- What's with the beat?
- It's a practice round.

1680
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,320
- Suk Jin.
- It's a practice round.

1681
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,750
You said we can clap
three times before defending, right?

1682
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,980
- Okay, got it.
- Let's skip one beat.

1683
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,820
- Old fossil.
- Why did I answer that?

1684
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,960
It was natural.

1685
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,400
Let's start with So Min.

1686
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,460
- We're playing it for real.
- Let's do this.

1687
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:12,670
- Good image, good image
- Good image, good image

1688
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,460
Someone who'll go out with me, two.

1689
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,960
(Someone who'll
go out with me, two.)

1690
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,380
("Someone who'll go out with me"?)

1691
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:20,380
Who will it be?

1692
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,250
- Me?
- Ji Hyun, Ji Hyun!

1693
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,210
- You could've just said it!
- Why didn't you say it?

1694
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:31,460
(No matter how long she waited,
she couldn't get the answer.)

1695
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:34,550
(You could've just said it!)

1696
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:36,360
- How can I go out with her?
- It was me?

1697
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,590
- It's just a game!
- No, that's not it.

1698
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,590
He's so slow-witted!

1699
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:41,960
- He's so slow.
- Come on, Jong Hyeop.

1700
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,300
You should've said it
even if you hated the idea!

1701
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,300
He's right, Jong Hyeop.

1702
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,860
Who else would go out with her
among us?

1703
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,460
- My gosh.
- Who else would go out with her?

1704
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,610
I get it.

1705
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:52,500
If I answered that,

1706
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,500
- that'd have been weird.
- Of course.

1707
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,000
- You're the only option.
- I'm glad we won,

1708
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:59,420
I'm glad we won,
but it doesn't feel so good.

1709
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,570
It doesn't feel so good.

1710
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,840
(I'm sorry, but...)

1711
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,860
- I'm sorry, but...
- My gosh.

1712
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,090
can I go to the bathroom?

1713
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:07,090
Why?

1714
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:09,750
When I'm in water...

1715
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,130
- for a long time...
- When you're in water...

1716
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,360
Is it number 1 or number 2?

1717
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,500
I want to pee.

1718
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:16,230
- He's so weird!
- Goodness!

1719
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,130
(He's been grabbing his pants
as though he's anxious.)

1720
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:22,770
- He's so weird.
- But don't you have to be...

1721
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:23,800
in the water this deep to feel that?

1722
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,980
Only our feet are in the water.

1723
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,110
- It's just my habit.
- Don't you have to be deep in it?

1724
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:28,110
(It's his bad habit.)

1725
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:30,300
Don't you have to be in the water
this deep to feel that?

1726
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,520
- Is that part of your routine?
- Yes, it is.

1727
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,650
- Then you can go.
- My body reacts to it.

1728
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:33,750
Hurry up then!

1729
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,340
- If I'm in the water for too...
- Got it.

1730
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,940
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Ji Hyun.
- Not at all.

1731
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,550
- You should run.
- I'll be right back.

1732
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,130
- This is so random.
- He's actually going.

1733
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,920
It's not like he was deep
in the water.

1734
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,230
We only had our feet in the water.
Why would he want to pee?

1735
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:46,650
Who goes to the bathroom
for getting their feet wet?

1736
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,960
Maybe it's because of the sound
the water is making.

1737
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,000
- That must be why.
- You feel nature's call...

1738
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,230
when you shower.

1739
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:53,670
There must be something wrong
with his prostate gland.

1740
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:55,000
He's susceptible to
the sound of water.

1741
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,670
- Right.
- That's how kids are like.

1742
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:59,030
Kids pee when they hear
the sound of water.

1743
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:02,110
No one among the actors teases
someone with this topic, right?

1744
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:03,300
- They don't.
- Of course.

1745
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,840
This is so new to me.

1746
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,210
- It is, right?
- Yes.

1747
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:07,840
You'd just politely tell the person
to use the bathroom.

1748
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:11,050
He's one of the seniors here,
and he had to apologize.

1749
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:13,980
- And he was harshly criticized.
- Everyone scolded him.

1750
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:17,590
When we attack, we attack
until that person gets knocked out.

1751
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,960
- That was a short trip.
- All right now!

1752
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,360
- It must've been only a little.
- All right now!

1753
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,360
- Did you pee well?
- I did.

1754
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,670
Did you pee well?

1755
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,300
It was incredible.

1756
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:29,800
It wasn't much,
and you feel refreshed?

1757
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,840
(He quickly felt the refreshment.)

1758
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:34,730
Why did you...

1759
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:35,980
Seeing how fast he made it back,
there must've been only three drops.

1760
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,110
It was incredible.

1761
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:39,550
- It was incredible.
- It must've been only a few drops.

1762
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,280
He said it was incredible.

1763
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,980
- He said it was incredible.
- He said it was incredible.

1764
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:45,860
- He only went to pee though.
- That was hilarious.

1765
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,520
- It was great.
- Whom should we start with?

1766
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:48,980
- So Min.
- It's me again?

1767
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,480
Let's play Image Game

1768
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,800
- It's "good image".
- Oh, right.

1769
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:56,030
- Good image, good image
- Good image, good image

1770
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:57,860
Someone who likes me, four.

1771
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:00,770
(Someone who likes me, four.)

1772
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:03,110
Someone who likes me,
Someone who likes me,

1773
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:04,130
Someone who likes me,
Someone who likes me.

1774
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,780
(She finally got the answer
she wanted.)

1775
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,110
(Looking happy)

1776
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,440
You should keep going.

1777
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,420
- Empty Head, three.
- You should take it, Se Chan.

1778
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,880
Empty Head, Empty Head, Empty Head.

1779
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,380
Bedwetter, four.

1780
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:16,440
(Bedwetter, four.)

1781
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,550
It's you. Here we go.

1782
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:19,690
Bedwetter, bedwetter, bedwetter,

1783
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:20,980
- bedwetter.
- He defended.

1784
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:23,590
Hairy man, three.

1785
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:25,090
(Hairy man, three.)

1786
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,750
- Hairy man, hairy man, hairy man.
- Hairy man, hairy man, hairy man.

1787
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,090
- Why would you answer that?
- Darn you!

1788
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:31,400
- Why would you answer that?
- Why did you do that?

1789
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,730
(A sudden intrusion of So Min
evens the scores.)

1790
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,710
- I thought he wouldn't...
- Why did you answer that?

1791
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:39,300
- It looked like he wouldn't...
- It needs to make sense!

1792
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,980
I'm hairy too.

1793
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,980
Not there! Someplace else.

1794
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,820
He's the hairy man.

1795
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,050
He was getting ready to answer.

1796
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,280
Don't forget to look at
each other's faces, okay?

1797
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,880
Let's meet each other's eyes.

1798
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,750
When you think that the given image
fits you, yell out, "My!"

1799
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,090
- "My!"
- You can't directly claim it.

1800
00:58:57,090 --> 00:58:59,630
Let's do this then.
To say that you'll take it.

1801
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:01,000
That's it.

1802
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,770
- How? Do it again.
- Like this.

1803
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:04,190
"That's me."

1804
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:05,500
("That's me.")

1805
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,940
Then you go,
"Empty Head, Empty Head!"

1806
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,090
- "Empty Head, Empty Head!"
- What is that?

1807
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,400
- What is that?
- Someone looks like him.

1808
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,300
- One actor who looks like him.
- Ugly person, three!

1809
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,000
Ugly person, ugly person!

1810
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,110
(Obviously, I'm the ugly person.)

1811
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,110
Do this to say that it's your turn.

1812
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:16,710
- It's like saying, "My."
- This one?

1813
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:18,520
We should think of the images
we can attack them with.

1814
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,340
I can't think of one
after defending.

1815
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,750
Let's start. Image

1816
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,920
- Image, image
- Image, image

1817
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,190
(Getting excited)

1818
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:27,980
- Image, image
- Gosh, those punks.

1819
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,090
(Here comes the excited duo.)

1820
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,750
(Making so much fuss with the intro)

1821
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,920
Image, image

1822
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,300
- Image, image
- I want to join.

1823
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,800
- Image, image
- Aren't you going to start?

1824
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,960
- So Min couldn't hold herself back.
- So Min joined them.

1825
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:42,960
Look at her.

1826
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,400
(Thanks to the co-ed trio,
the intro has become splendid.)

1827
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:48,710
- Let's go!
- Aren't you going to start?

1828
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,000
- Gosh, my head hurts.
- Haha.

1829
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,280
Let's do it.
We need to keep this up.

1830
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:53,650
My head hurts.

1831
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,940
This is so fun!

1832
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,550
- Are you having fun?
- It's so fun!

1833
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:00,980
- Good image, good image
- Good image, good image

1834
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:02,750
Old fossil!

1835
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:04,460
How many beats, you punk?

1836
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,030
- Oh, right.
- How many beats?

1837
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:08,190
- Nice one.
- I'm so sorry.

1838
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:09,190
I'm sorry.

1839
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:10,690
Good image, good image

1840
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,170
- Good image, good image
- Good image, good image

1841
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,940
Gangnam, three.

1842
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,610
Gangnam, Gangnam, Gangnam.

1843
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:17,110
Gangseo, four.

1844
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,230
Gangseo, Gangseo, Gangseo, Gangseo.

1845
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:22,300
Glasses, two.

1846
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,400
Glasses, glasses.

1847
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,020
Sexy guy, two.

1848
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:27,820
Was that on the beat?

1849
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,690
- Sexy guy, two.
- Sexy guy, sexy guy.

1850
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,090
Sexy guy, three.

1851
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:32,710
(Using the same image one more time)

1852
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,730
Sexy guy, three.

1853
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:36,730
(They fail to defend.)

1854
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:37,960
- You see...
- We let you take it!

1855
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,130
- But...
- We let you take it!

1856
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:42,190
- I should've taken it instead!
- We let you take it!

1857
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:43,590
(I should've taken
sexy guy instead!)

1858
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:45,900
- Anyone could've taken it.
- What? You're not even sexy!

1859
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,670
- I should've taken it!
- Just stay still!

1860
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:49,500
- I should've taken it instead!
- Why would you?

1861
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,030
- What was that?
- I was going to take it too.

1862
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:52,780
If you think it's yours,
just take it.

1863
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,000
- All right.
- Let's start.

1864
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:57,210
White T-shirt, four.

1865
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:58,520
(Everyone is wearing
a white T-shirt.)

1866
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,280
White T-shirt, white T-shirt,
white T-shirt, white T-shirt.

1867
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:01,820
Protein, three.

1868
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,480
Protein, protein, protein.

1869
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:04,980
Youngest, two.

1870
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,590
Youngest, Youngest.

1871
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,050
Cap, three.

1872
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:09,730
(Everyone is wearing a cap)

1873
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:10,730
- Cap, cap...
- Cap, cap...

1874
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:13,030
All right!

1875
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:15,920
(The two of them
defended at the same time.)

1876
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,000
- Well done!
- We won!

1877
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,090
- We won!
- That was a good one.

1878
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:21,170
Since everyone is wearing a cap...

1879
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,230
Why didn't you go
when you had the chance?

1880
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:25,280
I thought I'd get told off
for not going for it again.

1881
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,610
Why did you defend
when you didn't need to?

1882
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,050
- My gosh, we were almost there.
- Let's just win the next round.

1883
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:31,880
- Let's just win the next round.
- Let's just win the next round.

1884
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,280
- We can win the next round.
- Let's come up with a few images.

1885
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,650
What? What did you say?

1886
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,480
Okay, got it.

1887
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,190
That's all we need. Keep it down.

1888
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:41,110
The word you're attacking with
is important.

1889
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:43,030
We need to come up with a word
we can attack the whole team with.

1890
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,650
We should shake them up.

1891
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:45,650
(They're going to shake them up?)

1892
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:47,920
This is... You're so mean though.

1893
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,190
- I can't say this in advance.
- Let's play.

1894
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:50,770
- That's a game changer.
- They're done now.

1895
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:52,000
Let's attack just one person.

1896
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:53,690
- Who's going first? You?
- I'm going first.

1897
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:55,030
- I'll go first.
- He's nervous.

1898
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:56,460
It's nerve-wracking.

1899
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,860
- It's nerve-wracking.
- Image

1900
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:00,840
- Good image, good image
- Good image, good image

1901
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,670
Cap, three.

1902
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:04,500
(Cap, three.)

1903
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,020
Cap, cap, cap.

1904
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,550
(Do Kwon manages to defend.)

1905
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:10,480
Yoon Eun Hye, four.

1906
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,480
(Yoon Eun Hye, four.)

1907
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,480
Yoon Eun Hye, Yoon Eun Hye,
Yoon Eun Hye, Yoon Eun Hye.

1908
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,630
Is that what you came up with?

1909
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:19,550
(The fans of Absolutely Game
from "X-Man" love it.)

1910
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,170
Anyang, two

1911
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:23,900
Anyang, Anyang.

1912
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,360
(He shouts "Anyang" cheerfully.)

1913
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:27,230
Workout, four.

1914
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:30,230
Workout, workout, workout, workout.

1915
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:32,730
(He responds to the attack
that was aimed at him.)

1916
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:33,800
That little...

1917
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:35,440
Jong Kook, don't get angry!

1918
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,110
(He didn't hide his excitement.)

1919
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:39,150
That little...

1920
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,650
Jong Kook, don't get angry!

1921
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:42,090
Don't get angry!

1922
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:44,380
- That little jerk.
- Jong Kook.

1923
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:45,820
I told you not to do that.

1924
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:47,960
(He runs away.)

1925
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,420
They are so annoying.

1926
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:51,230
What? Jae Suk could have taken it.

1927
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:53,530
- It suits Jae Suk too.
- Jae Suk could have taken it.

1928
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,460
They are so annoying.

1929
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,860
It was a nice attack.

1930
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,090
We should help each other.

1931
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:00,130
You could have helped me
by taking care of the keyword...

1932
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:01,270
on Round One.

1933
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:03,900
- I couldn't take care of "Eun Hye".
- Why not?

1934
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:06,940
I couldn't take care
of "Eun Hye" either.

1935
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:08,900
I know you couldn't,
but Jae Suk could.

1936
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:10,980
- I couldn't take care of "Eun Hye".
- You should protect the team.

1937
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,550
What would have happened
had I taken the keyword?

1938
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:13,820
That attack worked so well.

1939
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:16,090
- Seriously.
- It was hilarious.

1940
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:18,750
- Eun Hye had to come up someday.
- Stop it already.

1941
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:20,920
- Stop it already.
- Seriously.

1942
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,590
Thus, Team Ji Hyo won
the preliminary mission.

1943
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:27,820
(It's time to move on
to the last mission!)

1944
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:29,090
The last mission is...

1945
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:30,860
the Strategic Floating Mat Battle.

1946
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,360
It will be about pushing people off.

1947
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,570
You start on the two floating mats
in the pool...

1948
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:38,030
and win if you push off
all members of the opposing team.

1949
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:40,030
- We have an advantage.
- The matches...

1950
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:43,210
will be 1-on-1, 2-on-2, 3-on-3,
4-on-4, and 5-on-5.

1951
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:45,210
You will have five rounds in total.

1952
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:48,050
Each member can participate
in three or fewer rounds.

1953
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,690
So the teams should come up
with plans for the matches.

1954
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:52,820
- I think Jong Kook will kill me.
- Okay.

1955
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,860
However, Team Ji Hyo has
an advantage.

1956
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,190
Once Team Ji Hyun is done planning,

1957
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:58,250
we will reveal their lineup
for the 3-on-3 match.

1958
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,500
You can take a look
and adjust your plan.

1959
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,130
- Then we can...
- Still...

1960
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,900
Still, we need to be strategic.

1961
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,690
That way, you can choose
which matches to focus on.

1962
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,440
We should give up on one round.

1963
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,610
Don't say that as you look at me.

1964
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:13,340
- You are the referee.
- Please put down the lineups here.

1965
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:14,610
- Okay.
- We will do that.

1966
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:16,500
- All right.
- How many matches?

1967
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,940
We need to choose
the rounds to give up on...

1968
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,650
since Jong Kook can only participate
in three rounds.

1969
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:21,940
We could give up
on the first two rounds.

1970
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:25,110
Wouldn't it be best to put me
in the less important rounds?

1971
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,780
(Captain Ji Hyun volunteers to take
the 1-on-1 match.)

1972
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,480
It's a good idea.

1973
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:30,320
She can take the 1-on-1 match.

1974
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,750
We need to win
the 2-on-2 and 3-on-3 matches.

1975
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:32,900
In this round,
all of us will participate.

1976
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,820
Jong Kook should take
the 2-on-2 match.

1977
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,030
- Jong Kook should participate.
- Yes.

1978
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,670
And you should join
the 3-on-3 match.

1979
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,500
Here you go.

1980
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,710
I will reveal Team Ji Hyun's lineup
for the 3-on-3 match.

1981
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:44,530
Team Ji Hyun's lineup
for the 3-on-3 match is...

1982
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:48,880
Jong Kook, Jong Hyeop, and Suk Jin.

1983
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:52,610
(The ace member,
Jong Kook, will participate!)

1984
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:53,880
- Let's give up on the round.
- Come here.

1985
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:54,880
Let's give up on it.

1986
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,340
Here. Give it to me.

1987
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:57,420
(Team Ji Hyo will give up
on the 3-on-3 match.)

1988
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:59,590
- Will you give up on it?
- That's right.

1989
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:01,780
Who wants to participate
in this round?

1990
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:03,530
Add Do Kwon.

1991
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:04,920
- Do Kwon.
- Me?

1992
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,960
(What will be their lineups
for the other matches?)

1993
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,730
Both teams turned in their lineups.

1994
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:11,960
All right.

1995
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:14,670
Let's begin with the 1-on-1 match.

1996
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:15,800
The 1-on-1 match.

1997
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,340
The 1-on-1 matchup is...

1998
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:19,400
The 1-on-1 matchup is...

1999
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,570
(Which member of Team Ji Hyo
will take on Ji Hyun?)

2000
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:22,780
Ji Hyun versus Do Kwon.

2001
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,610
(Ji Hyun versus Do Kwon)

2002
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:27,480
We lost.

2003
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:30,190
(Team Ji Hyo expected Jong Kook.)

2004
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:31,320
Ji Hyun.

2005
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:32,750
- That's good.
- We chose well.

2006
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:33,980
- What do I do?
- You need to win.

2007
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:35,750
You need to win no matter what.

2008
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:38,130
We need to win
at least a single round.

2009
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,750
You can lose.

2010
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:40,920
You can lose, Ji Hyun.

2011
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,170
Still, do your best.

2012
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:45,230
All right. Get ready.

2013
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:46,340
You can't lose.

2014
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:48,770
- Good luck. You need to win.
- Let's go, Ji Hyun.

2015
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,840
(Ji Hyun has no pressure
whatsoever.)

2016
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,280
(Who will be
the winner of this match?)

2017
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,630
- I don't know what to do.
- You know,

2018
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:56,800
- you might just win.
- Do Kwon, show us...

2019
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:58,070
what you can do.

2020
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:59,780
Do Kwon, don't go easy on her.

2021
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:04,050
Your wife will find it strange
if you go easy on her.

2022
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:05,880
- That's right.
- Your wife.

2023
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,650
No one asked him to go easy on her.

2024
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,090
Ji Hyun can do this.

2025
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,590
He doesn't need to go easy on her.

2026
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:12,150
- What?
- Just push her.

2027
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:13,250
What are you doing?

2028
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:17,860
Don't fall for that laugh.

2029
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,670
Look at her eyes.

2030
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:21,940
- How am I supposed to push her?
- Come on!

2031
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:23,800
I should have gone.

2032
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,940
- Go over to her mat.
- Lift her up...

2033
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,440
and put her in the water.

2034
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:29,340
Come on.

2035
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,000
(He decides to let his daughter
have fun in the water.)

2036
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,050
That's good.

2037
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:34,980
That's good.

2038
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,520
He can't lift her up.
He can't lift her up.

2039
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:43,460
- He can't lift her up.
- Dad.

2040
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:44,780
- He can't do it.
- My goodness.

2041
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:47,530
- Do Kwon, what are you doing?
- It looks strange.

2042
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:49,920
- It looks strange.
- Do Kwon, what are you doing?

2043
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,420
(Do Kwon's legs are weak
after the gym ball game.)

2044
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,230
He can't lift her up.

2045
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:56,270
- He can't lift her up.
- No.

2046
01:06:56,270 --> 01:06:57,800
(The daughter refuses to
play in the water.)

2047
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,670
(They enter the water together.)

2048
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,340
- He won.
- Isn't it a tie?

2049
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,210
- She entered the water first.
- Ji Hyun, are you okay?

2050
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:08,110
- It should be a tie.
- Do Kwon won.

2051
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:09,520
Okay.

2052
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:11,110
Get ready.

2053
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:12,690
Your face went in first.

2054
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:14,520
The beet juice I drank earlier
is about to come back up.

2055
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:18,050
(He gained victory
by sacrificing his face.)

2056
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:19,250
My goodness.

2057
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,590
Ji Hyun, good job.

2058
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:22,590
Next up is the 2-on-2 match.

2059
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:26,670
(What's the lineup
for the 2-on-2 match?)

2060
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:29,300
Jong Kook and Jae Suk...

2061
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,460
versus Do Kwon and Se Chan.

2062
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,570
Okay.

2063
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:35,480
(Team Ji Hyo put the ace members
in the 2-on-2 match.)

2064
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:36,980
- We have a chance.
- There we go.

2065
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,920
- What should we do?
- Listen.

2066
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:42,480
I don't know what will happen.

2067
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:45,190
It's a big match.

2068
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:46,590
I don't know what will happen.

2069
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:47,960
I am drowsy.

2070
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,550
Make sure
you throw us into the water.

2071
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:52,730
- Of course.
- Let's begin.

2072
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,030
Don't get intimidated.

2073
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,320
Bring it on. Bring it on, you punks.

2074
01:07:58,570 --> 01:07:59,770
Okay. Bring it on.

2075
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:00,900
- Bring it on.
- They look weak.

2076
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,400
Don't get intimidated
by a bedwetter.

2077
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:05,340
- Bring it on.
- He might start peeing.

2078
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,610
- Come here, you punks.
- Bring it on.

2079
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,210
- What?
- Bedwetter, bedwetter.

2080
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:12,880
There you go.

2081
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:15,480
Come on.

2082
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:18,110
What are you two doing?

2083
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:19,460
Are you fencing?

2084
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,520
There is tension in the air.

2085
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:22,780
All right.

2086
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:24,250
(Jae Suk versus Se Chan)

2087
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:25,920
All right.

2088
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,860
Cowards do this.

2089
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:29,590
Come on.

2090
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:31,370
Come here. Come here.

2091
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:32,370
(They fight with their tongues,
not swords.)

2092
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:34,200
(For goodness' sake.)

2093
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,130
- That's what the weak ones do.
- Let's put the mats together.

2094
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:39,280
Let's grab them.

2095
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,300
Let's grab them first.

2096
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,940
Hold on. Jae Suk.

2097
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:42,980
Hold his hand.

2098
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,780
Jong Kook, this brings back
memories of "X-Man".

2099
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:47,150
- We were on the show.
- It does bring back memories.

2100
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:48,740
- We were on the show.
- Okay.

2101
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:51,650
- They are testing the waters.
- Bromance, bromance.

2102
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:54,990
(At that moment,
Do Kwon charges forward.)

2103
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:56,030
What are you doing here?

2104
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:58,920
(He gets on their mat
while they think about the past.)

2105
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,590
Do Kwon, don't do that.

2106
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:04,200
Do Kwon.

2107
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:07,590
(He enters the water by himself.)

2108
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:09,770
What was that?

2109
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:12,130
(He had too much faith
in his short legs.)

2110
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:14,080
What was that? For goodness' sake.

2111
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:16,800
- What was that?
- What did you do?

2112
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:18,170
- Come here.
- Hold on.

2113
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:19,520
- Hold on.
- Come here.

2114
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,580
It's 2-on-1.

2115
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,290
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Come here.

2116
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:23,450
- Hey.
- Come here.

2117
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:25,490
(Hold on, my foot!)

2118
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,710
(The big match ends
in a lackluster way.)

2119
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:29,690
What was that?
That was disappointing.

2120
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:30,860
Hey!

2121
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:33,250
- What?
- Seriously.

2122
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:36,590
The floating mat was too far.

2123
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:38,460
- You should have jumped over.
- What was that?

2124
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:40,130
That was lackluster.

2125
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,410
- Okay.
- I am sorry.

2126
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:44,330
- Hey.
- It was good.

2127
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:46,910
- Next up is the 3-on-3 match.
- We should have won.

2128
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:48,910
Jong Kook, Jong Hyeop, and Suk Jin.

2129
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:49,980
- Okay.
- And...

2130
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:51,080
Ji Hyo, So Min, and Haha.

2131
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,370
Ji Hyo, So Min, and Haha?

2132
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:55,410
Did you say
Ji Hyo, So Min, and Haha?

2133
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:57,210
They chose the weakest members
for this round.

2134
01:09:57,210 --> 01:09:58,520
Ji Hyo, So Min, and Haha?

2135
01:09:58,710 --> 01:09:59,790
Charge at them.

2136
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:01,880
Protect me, okay?

2137
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:03,360
- No.
- Haha.

2138
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,290
Go!

2139
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:07,920
(Mr. Dirty Mustache tries
to sacrifice the female members.)

2140
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,460
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

2141
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:11,330
- Get ready.
- Good luck.

2142
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:12,590
Let's go.

2143
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:14,040
Go, go.

2144
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:15,490
Come here, you punks.

2145
01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:16,740
- Attack!
- Don't push.

2146
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:20,830
Come here.

2147
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:21,830
What? Do you want me to go?

2148
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:22,980
- Come here.
- Come here.

2149
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,280
- Move back.
- Come one at a time.

2150
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,540
- Firstly,
- Bring it on.

2151
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:27,040
- the one in a green cap.
- Hey.

2152
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,240
Come. Come on.

2153
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,740
- Come one at a time.
- The "twu" of you should step back.

2154
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:32,020
- Okay.
- He said "Twu".

2155
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:33,190
(What was that?)

2156
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:34,250
I mispronounced it.

2157
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:37,330
(His rival's provocation
got his tongue tied.)

2158
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:38,380
Okay.

2159
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,200
(The matchup
between the weakest members)

2160
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,730
- Come on. Come on.
- We swear...

2161
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:42,920
we won't help.

2162
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,400
- We will sit down.
- No touching.

2163
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,900
- Let's have a 1-on-1 match.
- It's neck and neck.

2164
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,700
- Come on over.
- It's neck and neck.

2165
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,610
My goodness.

2166
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:52,440
You are provoking me.
That puts me in a bad mood.

2167
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:55,370
You can't come over, right?

2168
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,450
Come over. Come over.

2169
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:59,410
(The provocation and mockery...)

2170
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:00,950
(make him charge forward.)

2171
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:02,520
There you go.

2172
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,120
- My goodness.
- So Min, hang in there.

2173
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:05,820
(Glancing over)

2174
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:06,860
Good luck.

2175
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,750
(When he sees Haha approach,)

2176
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,160
(he makes a sudden retreat.)

2177
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:12,190
(What?)

2178
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:13,250
What was that?

2179
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:15,900
(Suk Jin tried to go back.)

2180
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:17,590
(He fails.)

2181
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:18,700
What was that?

2182
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:22,440
(He jumped when there was a distance
between the floating mats.)

2183
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,610
What was that?

2184
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:28,830
(The lack of jumping ability
created slapstick comedy.)

2185
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,080
What were you doing?

2186
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:34,950
(Humiliated)

2187
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:36,290
- Suk Jin.
- He can't jump at all.

2188
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:37,490
(He can barely jump over
the doorsill.)

2189
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:39,160
- How embarrassing!
- What was that?

2190
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,580
That was so embarrassing.

2191
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:43,420
- That was so funny.
- What was that?

2192
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:45,450
- I am so embarrassed.
- Suk Jin, you looked so cute.

2193
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:46,750
It was exactly what I wanted to see.

2194
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:48,120
We could win.

2195
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,420
We could win. We could win.

2196
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:52,370
You!

2197
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:54,130
- No. It will be me.
- No.

2198
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:55,200
You can't go against Jong Hyeop.

2199
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:57,000
You!

2200
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:58,500
Come on.

2201
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,700
Either one of you
should come on over.

2202
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,330
Go over there and fight!

2203
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:02,410
No.

2204
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:03,540
Go!

2205
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,370
Don't just sit around like a fool.

2206
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,480
Shall we go on over?

2207
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,620
- Shall we go on over?
- Okay.

2208
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,190
Be careful when you go on over.

2209
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:11,520
The gap gets quite big.

2210
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,080
Finish them off.

2211
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,290
- No.
- Let's go.

2212
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,950
- Let's go over there.
- Come here.

2213
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:19,050
All right.

2214
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,120
You should go to the front
and protect me.

2215
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,490
Hold each other.

2216
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:24,160
He came over.

2217
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,370
- Come here.
- Hey.

2218
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:27,830
(Did he just come alone?)

2219
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:30,160
Push him. Push him.

2220
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:31,630
Hey.

2221
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:33,740
Come on.

2222
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,870
Hey. There you go.

2223
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:37,340
(One day, destruction entered
their floating mat.)

2224
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,840
You should be careful.

2225
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,840
(Jong Hyeop joins him.)

2226
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:43,320
Hold on.

2227
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,820
- Hold on.
- Hold on.

2228
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:45,880
Hold on.

2229
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:47,710
Jong Kook.

2230
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,550
- Come on.
- Don't do it.

2231
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:51,120
Move out of the way.

2232
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:54,590
(Lu Bu on the floating mat
has no mercy.)

2233
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,230
Come here.

2234
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:57,590
Ji Hyo, run away.

2235
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,960
(Ji Hyo is out.)

2236
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,700
- Hey.
- Haha, hang in there.

2237
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:03,940
Come on.

2238
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:05,610
- Hey.
- Haha, hang in there.

2239
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:06,740
(Haha is the only one who remains.)

2240
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:09,200
It's over.
Finish him off without pain.

2241
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:11,610
- Finish him off without pain.
- It's over.

2242
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:13,450
- Haha.
- My goodness.

2243
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:15,020
Gosh, I feel bad.

2244
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:18,290
Gosh, I can't watch this.

2245
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:19,910
I can't watch this.

2246
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:21,210
(Screaming)

2247
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,420
(Jong Kook pulls his underwear.)

2248
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,700
(Screaming)

2249
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,160
(Throwing)

2250
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:33,870
(He feels pain
from the deep valley.)

2251
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,630
He shouldn't have held out.

2252
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:38,700
You have done enough.

2253
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,740
- Okay.
- It was time to give up.

2254
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:41,980
Are you okay?

2255
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,480
Are you not okay?

2256
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,450
The left ball came off.

2257
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:46,740
The left ball.

2258
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,340
- Hey, hey.
- The right ball. The right ball.

2259
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,410
Next up is the 4-on-4 match.

2260
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:53,190
Ji Hyo, Haha, Se Chan,

2261
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:54,360
- and So Min.
- Me?

2262
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:56,290
Ji Hyun, Jong Hyeop,
Suk Jin, and Jae Suk.

2263
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:57,730
This match is neck and neck.

2264
01:13:57,730 --> 01:13:58,730
Let's go.

2265
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:00,790
- We have a chance.
- We have a chance.

2266
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:01,950
Let's go.

2267
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:05,620
- Hey, hey.
- I am glad I am on this team.

2268
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:07,040
(He acts flippantly
because he has other members.)

2269
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,570
- What is he doing?
- Okay, okay.

2270
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:10,910
- Go.
- No, no, no.

2271
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:13,170
You will fall into the water.

2272
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:14,870
- You will fall into the water.
- You will fall into the water.

2273
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:16,170
- Okay.
- Be careful.

2274
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:17,980
Se Chan, now is your chance.

2275
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:19,710
Now is your chance.

2276
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:21,580
Don't huddle close.
Don't huddle close.

2277
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:22,910
- Jong Hyeop.
- Now is your chance.

2278
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:24,490
- Now is your chance.
- Watch closely, Ji Hyun.

2279
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:26,290
- I am going over.
- So Min, get Jae Suk.

2280
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:28,080
(The bedwetter is in a hurry.)

2281
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,250
(Faltering)

2282
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:32,750
All right.

2283
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,090
(He charges forward
when Se Chan falters.)

2284
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:35,860
He is here. All right.

2285
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:39,200
Finish off Jae Suk.
Finish off Jae Suk.

2286
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,900
(Jong Hyeop joins him.)

2287
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,040
It's too far.

2288
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,800
- Guys!
- Sit down.

2289
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,980
I want to go there,
but it's too far.

2290
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:49,280
- It's too far.
- Push it.

2291
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,580
- Hurry up and go over there.
- Push it.

2292
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:51,870
- All right.
- Push it.

2293
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:53,280
(It's 2 against 1.)

2294
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,410
Jong Hyeop.

2295
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:55,410
(Jong Hyeop is out.)

2296
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:57,690
Hurry up and go over there.

2297
01:14:57,690 --> 01:14:59,150
(Ji Hyun and Suk Jin come to help.)

2298
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:00,380
Hold on.

2299
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:02,290
- Go over there.
- Okay, okay.

2300
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:03,360
Hold on.

2301
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,950
(He misses his steps.)

2302
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:06,290
My goodness.

2303
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:08,420
He is out.

2304
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,120
(Suk Jin is out
while jumping over the mat.)

2305
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,830
What was that?

2306
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:14,070
(JI Hyun gets attacked.)

2307
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:16,240
All right. All right.

2308
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,630
It's over.

2309
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:19,440
- Let's lift him up.
- Let's lift him up.

2310
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,700
Let's lift him up. Come here.

2311
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:24,080
Hey! Where is everyone?

2312
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:26,240
What happened?

2313
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:27,650
We are out.

2314
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:28,950
Where is everyone?

2315
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:31,650
Come on.

2316
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:32,710
(It's now 4 people
versus 1 bedwetter.)

2317
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:34,210
Jae Suk, don't tire yourself out.

2318
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,660
Just get eliminated.

2319
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:37,550
Take off his shorts.

2320
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,400
(They no longer care about
the match.)

2321
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,420
Hey.

2322
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:42,490
(Taking off)

2323
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,530
We did it.

2324
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:45,590
(The pee-stained shorts
get discarded.)

2325
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:46,900
Get off the mat.

2326
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,790
Come here. Slap, slap.

2327
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,110
Get off the mat.

2328
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:51,200
Hey.

2329
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,460
Get off the mat.

2330
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:54,040
Get off the mat.

2331
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:56,280
(It's time to let
the grasshopper go.)

2332
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,370
Go.

2333
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,670
(In the end, he is out.)

2334
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:02,880
We won thanks to the strategy.

2335
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:06,250
(Team Ji Hyun got destroyed
one at a time.)

2336
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,910
What happened to everyone?

2337
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:09,160
I was jumping over...

2338
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,790
- when I missed my steps.
- You should go over at once.

2339
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:14,590
These guys ganged up on me.

2340
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:17,420
- Seriously.
- Jae Suk, put on your shorts.

2341
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:18,730
- Here are your shoes.
- No!

2342
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:21,040
I will go around like this.

2343
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:23,700
(An eyesore in a swimming suit
appears.)

2344
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,110
What are you doing?

2345
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:26,130
Hey.

2346
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,940
What are you doing? Stop it.

2347
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:30,200
Stop it.

2348
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,610
- Why?
- Don't jump.

2349
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:33,210
I got beaten up!

2350
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:34,320
Don't jump.

2351
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,190
Put on your shorts.

2352
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:37,840
I am wearing a swimming suit.

2353
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,880
Don't be ridiculous.

2354
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,380
- Why are you making a fuss?
- For goodness' sake.

2355
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,380
Hey.

2356
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:43,830
Put on your shorts.

2357
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:45,450
- Hey.
- Hurry up.

2358
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:48,620
I got beaten up so much.

2359
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:51,900
You went over too hastily.

2360
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,590
We wanted to follow you,
but the gap was too wide.

2361
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:54,830
You should have told us
ahead of time.

2362
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,460
- Gosh.
- What are you doing?

2363
01:16:59,070 --> 01:17:00,780
What are you doing?

2364
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:02,410
He did that on purpose.

2365
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,110
He did that on purpose.

2366
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:05,980
Put on your shorts!

2367
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:08,370
I won't put them on.

2368
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:10,520
- He thinks I did it on purpose.
- Put on your shorts.

2369
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,020
I didn't do it on purpose.

2370
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,620
- You know,
- Are you a seal or what?

2371
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:15,860
the water must be pretty cold.

2372
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:18,880
(Shy)

2373
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:20,120
For goodness' sake.

2374
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,960
- Hey, put on your pants.
- It's very cold. It's very cold.

2375
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,490
Don't make a fuss.

2376
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:25,730
It must be cold.

2377
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:27,870
It must be as cold as ice.

2378
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:30,240
- Hurry up and put them on.
- The water turned a bit yellow.

2379
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,270
- What is your problem?
- The water turned a bit yellow...

2380
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:33,280
around Jae Suk.

2381
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:37,200
I am even more exhausted
because I drank so much water.

2382
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:40,480
I feel like only Jae Suk
is taking an active part.

2383
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:43,320
He is the most exhausted one.

2384
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,190
- I guess it was a 1-on-5 match.
- A 1-on-5 match.

2385
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,410
Suk Jin, what did you do today?

2386
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:49,580
- What did you do?
- Suk Jin, what did you do?

2387
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:50,830
Let's begin the match.

2388
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:52,660
- Okay.
- Let's go. Let's end this.

2389
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:53,860
Go, go.

2390
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,120
We should be careful
about going over.

2391
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,830
We should go over at once.

2392
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:58,900
Okay.

2393
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:00,700
(Come here!)

2394
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:01,770
- Okay.
- The mats are coming closer.

2395
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:03,610
(The 2nd match
between the weakest members)

2396
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:06,800
Ouch!

2397
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,280
My goodness.

2398
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,980
(Stepping)

2399
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:14,540
What?

2400
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:15,670
He stepped on Suk Jin's hand.

2401
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,020
- What?
- Does it hurt?

2402
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:19,190
- My team is attacking each other.
- Does it hurt?

2403
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:20,790
My team is attacking each other.

2404
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:22,410
- Hey.
- You should be careful.

2405
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:24,290
- I was here.
- We shouldn't attack each other.

2406
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:25,330
(He is unapologetic.)

2407
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:26,730
I can't believe it.

2408
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:30,730
(The weakest members
resume their match.)

2409
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:33,960
- Come here.
- Hold my hand.

2410
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,200
Be brave and come here.

2411
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,440
(They hold each other's hands.)

2412
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:41,110
(Shouting)

2413
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:42,440
There you go.

2414
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,670
Hold on. I will hold off Jong Kook.
Come here.

2415
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:45,840
Come here.

2416
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:47,950
We need to work together.

2417
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:49,170
(A human tug-of-war)

2418
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:50,320
Hold still.

2419
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,820
- Let go of her.
- No, hold her.

2420
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:53,790
Hold So Min. Hold So Min.

2421
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:55,120
Hold So Min.

2422
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,830
(Saving Private So Min)

2423
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:58,580
- Hold So Min.
- Is this an execution?

2424
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,620
Don't give up on So Min.

2425
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:03,920
- Save So Min.
- You said you will come back.

2426
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,160
- Why are you here?
- Save her no matter what.

2427
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,440
All of us will die, you fool!

2428
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,160
- Don't worry.
- Let's save her.

2429
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,410
So Min, hang in there.

2430
01:19:10,410 --> 01:19:11,540
So Min, no.

2431
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,830
- Let go of me.
- Don't give up.

2432
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:14,630
Let go of me.

2433
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:16,800
- No.
- Let go of me.

2434
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,370
So Min, we will never let go.

2435
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:19,820
We will never let go.
You are our comrade.

2436
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:21,410
Come down. Come down.

2437
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:25,490
- Her joints will get stretched.
- Is So Min made of rubber?

2438
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:27,620
- Let go of me.
- Let her go.

2439
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:28,690
Let So Min go.

2440
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:30,330
- They are letting go of So Min.
- Let go of me.

2441
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:32,380
They are letting go of So Min.
There we go.

2442
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:33,830
Get some rest.

2443
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,030
So Min. Medic! Medic!

2444
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:39,530
Medic! Bring an energy drink.

2445
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,570
Are you okay?

2446
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:43,110
She needs some rest.

2447
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:44,570
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

2448
01:19:44,830 --> 01:19:47,110
- Shall we go?
- Jong Kook will go back and forth.

2449
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:50,200
- All right.
- Grab him now. Grab him now.

2450
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,410
He is here.

2451
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:52,700
- Did you grab Jong Kook?
- No, no.

2452
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:54,120
What are they doing?

2453
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,910
(Suk Jin charges forward.)

2454
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:59,190
- What?
- I got him.

2455
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:00,360
Suk Jin.

2456
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:01,690
(Suk Jin's fall acts as a signal.)

2457
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:03,190
- I got him.
- Grab her.

2458
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:04,490
They are here.

2459
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:06,730
(A close combat)

2460
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:08,030
They are here.

2461
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:09,360
Come on.

2462
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:10,920
Why are you doing this to me?

2463
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,270
Come on.

2464
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:13,400
(Do Kwon aggravated Protein Monster
all day long.)

2465
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,900
(Throwing)

2466
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,800
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Se Chan.

2467
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,040
Grab him.

2468
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,300
Come on.

2469
01:20:23,870 --> 01:20:27,210
(He escapes, but Jong Kook's push
eliminates him.)

2470
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:28,670
Ji Hyo, watch out for Suk Jin.

2471
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:30,340
You... You...

2472
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:31,840
(So Min is out as well.)

2473
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,120
- Hey.
- All right.

2474
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:36,290
(After holding out for a while,)

2475
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:38,330
(Haha gets eliminated
in a lackluster way.)

2476
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:40,790
Let's get her.

2477
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:41,950
I am sorry.

2478
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:44,090
Do Kwon.

2479
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:45,770
- It's over.
- Do Kwon.

2480
01:20:45,770 --> 01:20:46,790
(Do Kwon is the only one left.)

2481
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:48,990
I will take one person with me.

2482
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:51,910
(The hairy man is ferocious.)

2483
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:53,300
Do Kwon is holding out
until the very end.

2484
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:54,980
Gosh, Do Kwon is so annoying.

2485
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,000
(Flipping over)

2486
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:01,370
(The hairy man
eliminates one member.)

2487
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:02,820
- There you go.
- Push him off.

2488
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:05,020
Do Kwon, hold out until the end.

2489
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:06,410
Push him off.

2490
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:08,290
Suk Jin should participate.

2491
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:10,660
He should stop watching
and participate.

2492
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:11,690
(The man of 3 losses
stands back and watches.)

2493
01:21:11,690 --> 01:21:13,360
Suk Jin should use his strength.

2494
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,120
- Go down the mat.
- What is he doing?

2495
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,460
Is he there to watch?

2496
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:20,400
(Jae Suk shampoos his hair
after washing his face.)

2497
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,900
- Come on.
- He is shampooing his hair.

2498
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,130
Let's get your hair shampooed.

2499
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,460
(It's refreshing.)

2500
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:28,630
This hair salon is nice.

2501
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,670
Suk Jin should go against him.

2502
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:34,370
(Suk Jin jumps in
only after he is out of strength.)

2503
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:35,870
(In the end, Do Kwon is out.)

2504
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:37,710
Okay.

2505
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:39,080
(Team Ji Hyun won the last match.)

2506
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,190
It's impossible to beat them.

2507
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:43,250
We can't beat them.

2508
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:45,120
- Do Kwon.
- Good job.

2509
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,990
After a fierce match,
Team Ji Hyun won.

2510
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:48,990
(Team Ji Hyun won.)

2511
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:50,460
- Good job.
- Okay.

2512
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:51,770
I did my best.

2513
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,830
- We fought well.
- We fell apart...

2514
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:55,200
after one member got eliminated.

2515
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,130
The fight started
when Suk Jin came over.

2516
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:59,200
I don't think I can drink this.

2517
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:02,040
(Se Chan openly gives up.)

2518
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,780
We will fail.

2519
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:06,080
I think we will fail.

2520
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,980
The five members' names
will go into the Payment Box.

2521
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:10,080
It's impossible to drink it.

2522
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,150
- The smell is too strong.
- Okay.

2523
01:22:11,150 --> 01:22:12,740
- It's impossible.
- Okay, okay.

2524
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:15,190
Everyone, here is the Wish Box.

2525
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:17,450
- It's all set.
- You're at a disadvantage.

2526
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,900
If your name is in the capsule,
you'll be the winner.

2527
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:22,550
If we pick the same name,
we will pick again.

2528
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:23,570
Okay.

2529
01:22:24,070 --> 01:22:26,540
And the Payment Box
is for a penalty.

2530
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:27,570
Today's penalty is...

2531
01:22:27,570 --> 01:22:29,700
random ink buckets.

2532
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,940
That's the worst.
It's the worst penalty.

2533
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,780
(If they're covered with ink,
they have to wash here.)

2534
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:35,280
So we might avoid the penalty.

2535
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:38,170
Sure. One will pick confetti,
and the other will pick ink.

2536
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:39,580
We have little chance
of getting a penalty.

2537
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:41,450
If we get a penalty after winning
the race, it will be the worst case.

2538
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:42,670
- It's the worst.
- It can happen.

2539
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:46,450
All right. Who will pick a capsule
from the Wish Box then?

2540
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:48,450
Ji Hyun will do that.

2541
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:49,750
- Okay.
- Ji Hyun.

2542
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:52,030
- Please.
- To grant a wish.

2543
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,790
I hope Se Chan will get an iPad.

2544
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:56,570
Sure. That's what I want.

2545
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:57,620
I want to see Kwang Soo.

2546
01:22:57,620 --> 01:22:59,370
(Haha's wish is that Kwang Soo will
be a crew member for a day.)

2547
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:02,540
In the drama, you make wishes.

2548
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:04,160
- I want an iPad...
- My gosh.

2549
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,960
(So Min wants the crew members
to tell the answers only to her.)

2550
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:09,200
(It will be decided by sheer luck.)

2551
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:11,450
I hope she will pick mine.

2552
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:12,580
(Jae Suk wants Seok Sam to be
his younger brother for a day.)

2553
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,040
Open it one by one.

2554
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,990
- Open it.
- I'll be happy to be picked.

2555
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:19,450
Please. I want to get
a tablet computer.

2556
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:21,410
(The first winner is...)

2557
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:22,410
What?

2558
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,530
- It's Jong Hyeop.
- Chae Jong Hyeop.

2559
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:27,120
- Speakers.
- Speakers!

2560
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:31,230
(I want Haha to buy me
a high-performance speaker.)

2561
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:33,660
(A pain in the back of his head)

2562
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:35,900
So Min? What was So Min's wish?

2563
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,040
It's So Min.

2564
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,610
She gets to hear
the answers to quizzes.

2565
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:40,080
I get to hear the answers.

2566
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:41,670
My wish.

2567
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:44,670
We will grant your wishes.

2568
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:48,240
I've only known Jong Hyeop
for less than eight hours.

2569
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:50,790
You should buy him
a high-performance speaker.

2570
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:52,340
He should buy it.

2571
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:53,520
Okay. Good.

2572
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,950
Thank you, Haha.

2573
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:56,320
Thank you.

2574
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,250
(Haha granted Jong Hyeop's wish
as he promised.)

2575
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:00,360
- So Min...
- You should tell me the answers.

2576
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,360
We will tell her the answers...

2577
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,660
and make it look like
she answered them.

2578
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:05,530
Okay. Now, pick capsules
from the Payment Box.

2579
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:06,790
Our team should pick.

2580
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,070
All right. Do Kwon.

2581
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:11,440
Let's pick one each.

2582
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,000
Do Kwon, please.

2583
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,980
If my name is picked...

2584
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:17,500
- It will be the worst.
- If I get picked...

2585
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,700
I feel like I'll get picked.

2586
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:22,320
- It will be the worst.
- If I get picked...

2587
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,040
This is the worst.

2588
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,580
- I don't want to get picked.
- No way.

2589
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,990
- I can't watch it.
- Why are you looking at me?

2590
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:29,050
- Is it you?
- Is it me?

2591
01:24:29,050 --> 01:24:30,250
- Who is it?
- It's not me.

2592
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:31,550
- Who is it?
- Is it me?

2593
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:32,950
Song Ji Hyo!

2594
01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:34,550
- It's Ji Hyo. Who is it?
- Song Ji Hyo.

2595
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:36,830
(Me?)

2596
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:39,570
(Who did Ji Hyo pick?)

2597
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:41,370
It will be amazing
if Ji Hyo picks Do Kwon.

2598
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:44,070
(Did Ji Hyo pick Do Kwon?)

2599
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:46,700
- Kim Jong Kook!
- It's Jong Kook.

2600
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:47,700
(Kim Jong Kook is picked.)

2601
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:50,580
Nice!

2602
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:52,740
- I did it!
- It's great.

2603
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:54,580
- It's done. I won.
- Ji Hyo!

2604
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:56,740
- Well done, Ji Hyo.
- I won.

2605
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:58,120
They did it!

2606
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,450
Let's just go home right away.

2607
01:25:00,450 --> 01:25:02,050
- Hey, too bad.
- Let's just go home...

2608
01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:03,160
right away.

2609
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:04,830
Let's go home.

2610
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:06,660
Jong Kook, this is the worst.

2611
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:08,120
Let's go home.

2612
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,450
I'll just get changed and go home.

2613
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:11,490
When she picked it,
I had a bad feeling about it.

2614
01:25:11,490 --> 01:25:13,120
- A bad feeling?
- That's ridiculous.

2615
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:16,130
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo...

2616
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:18,660
will pick a bucket now.

2617
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,300
You should pick 1 of the 2.

2618
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,670
It's a random game.

2619
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:22,980
Pick a number.

2620
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:24,450
I pick number two.

2621
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:25,670
Then number one for Jong Kook.

2622
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:28,040
Then bring in the buckets.

2623
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,240
You're not supposed to look yet.

2624
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:32,020
- What's Jong Kook's number?
- What's Jong Kook's number?

2625
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:33,020
He's number one.

2626
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:34,750
- Should we do it on our knees?
- Yes, on your knees.

2627
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:37,530
All right. Pour it
as I count to three.

2628
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:41,700
(Jong Kook has a bad feeling
because he met Yong Gu again.)

2629
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:45,120
(Ji Hyo is always lucky
when it comes to a random game.)

2630
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:47,490
One, two, and three.

2631
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,660
(Ji Hyo picked the ink.)

2632
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:51,200
One, two, and three.

2633
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,280
Seriously? I can't believe this.

2634
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:56,540
I really didn't want to pour this.

2635
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,870
I can't believe you poured
confetti on my head.

2636
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:00,480
Look at the ink.

2637
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,580
- It's scary.
- Ji Hyo.

2638
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:04,210
(The dark energy is spreading.)

2639
01:26:04,210 --> 01:26:05,240
My goodness.

2640
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,710
- She looks like a witch.
- There's a witch!

2641
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:10,290
- It's a witch.
- She looks like a witch.

2642
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:12,120
These days, you're really...

2643
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,160
Wipe it with this, Ji Hyo.

2644
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,090
You look like a witch. My gosh.

2645
01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:16,920
- That's cool.
- My gosh.

2646
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:17,920
It's scary.

2647
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,540
Please watch "The Witch's Diner".

(Lee Yong Jin, Term 3)

2653
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:50,000
I have an official
announcement to make.

2654
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,840
We need some money to do something.

2655
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,190
So I will collect membership fees.

2656
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:58,820
(They don't know how
the membership fee is used.)

2657
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:00,660
- I'll pay too.
- You should cover all the expenses.

2658
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:03,330
(When the president
is about to give a speech...)

2659
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,030
- The news is on.
- This is news that's just come in.

2660
01:27:06,030 --> 01:27:09,230
There was a robbery in the office
of the Comedian Association.

The police say the 2m-tall comedian
Lee Kwang Soo is the suspect.

2662

I can't believe this.

2663
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:17,110
He got us some gifts before.

2664
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:19,410
So that's how
he bought all the gifts?

2665
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:20,870
He's a jerk!

2666
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:22,200
What do we do then?

2667
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:25,740
