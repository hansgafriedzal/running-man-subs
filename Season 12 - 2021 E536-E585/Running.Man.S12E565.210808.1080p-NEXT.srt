00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,500
(A summer day with the sun
beating down on your head)

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,090
I used to practice a lot
on the fourth floor.

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,960
This is where I waited.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,960
(The Comedian Association office
located in SBS open hall)

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,900
Hey, hurry up and come.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,870
(This place is the cradle
of a lot of comedy shows.)

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,210
(Jae Suk in 2002)

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,290
(From senior to young comedians,)

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,680
(they could do all the comedy skits
they wanted here.)

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,180
(Se Chan from 13 years ago)

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,000
Turtle and red-crowned crane

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,600
(In this place
full of comedians' happy memories,)

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,930
(they will have
a general meeting of comedians.)

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,570
Gosh, this place is...

15
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,070
Oh, hello.

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,640
Hello.

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,640
(Stay quiet.)

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,470
- Stay quiet.
- Yes, Jae Suk.

19
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,280
Suk Jin, come here.

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,320
Come here.

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,850
- What?
- I'm Term One.

22
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,920
- I know.
- You're my junior.

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,960
- I am, but...
- Why do you think we're here?

24
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,710
- You know we are...
- Today...

25
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,380
- Stay quiet.
- You're my senior,

26
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,490
but you're younger than me.

27
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,600
- What?
- You're younger than me.

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,750
But we're here as comedians.

29
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,390
- What's so funny?
- Hello, Suk Jin.

30
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,100
- Why are you laughing?
- We weren't in the same company.

31
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,800
- You're not supposed to laugh now.
- Excuse me.

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,710
- I'm sorry.
- I'm teaching him a lesson.

33
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,070
- Don't laugh.
- I'm sorry.

34
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,070
- Wait.
- What?

35
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,040
You're not supposed
to tighten discipline...

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
among your juniors like that.

37
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,050
- You're tightening discipline.
- What did I do?

38
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,820
- Don't talk back to your senior.
- You stay out of this.

39
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,270
You're not supposed to treat
your senior like that.

40
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,240
What? I'm just trying to get along
with my seniors and juniors.

41
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,110
Anyway, I'll try hard.

42
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,550
Try hard for what? You don't
even know what we're doing.

43
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,660
Since I'm Term Two...

44
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,690
- That's what I was going to say.
- Okay.

45
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,220
Where's our colleague?

46
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,220
- Who?
- Our colleague?

47
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,220
Se Chan's colleague.

48
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,390
Who's Se Chan's colleague?

49
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,270
- Let's call the rookies first.
- Okay.

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,570
- Do we have rookie comedians?
- Yes.

51
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,270
We're having rookies today.

52
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,100
- Those guys...
- Are they my juniors?

53
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,910
- I need to teach them a lesson.
- I should...

54
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,270
Suk Jin, I'll give them
a good scolding.

55
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,880
- You should.
- Hey, hurry and come.

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,770
He's worked hard for a long time
as the youngest one here.

57
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,080
- I know. Thank you.
- Hey.

58
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,410
- Come running.
- Hurry up and come.

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,220
- They're coming.
- Those punks.

60
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,090
- They are so...
- Why aren't they coming?

61
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,290
(Why aren't they coming?)

62
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,060
- I'm sorry.
- But...

63
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,320
- You stay out of this.
- Jae Suk.

64
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,660
As far as I know,

65
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,500
when you worked as a comedian,

66
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,600
you really hated
the seniority system.

67
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,660
I'm the one who got rid of it.

68
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,000
- It's not...
- But I have no choice today.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,370
It's not like you got rid of it.
You just avoided your seniors.

70
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,940
- That's right.
- So you were ditched.

71
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,310
- You were ditched.
- Are you laughing?

72
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,700
Why are you being like this to me?

73
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,280
You're treating me like that
because I'm Term Three.

74
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,650
Hey, will you stay quiet?

75
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,440
Don't pull out his longevity hair.

76
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,040
It's not a longevity hair.

77
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,540
- Don't pull it out.
- I don't have a longevity hair.

78
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,220
Gosh, that's ridiculous.

79
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,560
I should teach the rookies a lesson.

80
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,790
- Hey.
- Hurry up.

81
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,980
- Hey, you chicklings.
- Hurry and come.

82
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,500
You rookies, come running.

83
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,760
Come right here, you rookies.

84
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,000
You punks.

85
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,400
- Hello.
- Come here.

86
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,470
- Hey.
- Are we rookies?

87
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,700
(Term 4: Kim Jong Kook,
Haha, Song Ji Hyo, Jeon So Min)

88
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,870
Hello.

89
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,260
(Disciplined)

90
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,470
You don't have to be so polite.

91
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,170
- Hello.
- Hello.

92
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,280
- Take off your mask.
- Hello.

93
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,280
- Hello.
- Hey, take off your mask. Gosh.

94
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,570
- Hey.
- Okay.

95
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,290
- Hey, take off your mask.
- Hello.

96
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,380
I'm taking off the mask.

97
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,850
We have a term breaker here.

98
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,690
- Hey, stand up.
- Gosh, So Min.

99
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,690
(Hey, stand up.)

100
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,850
- Hey, stand up.
- Gosh, So Min.

101
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,450
- Hey.
- That's not what we do.

102
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,290
This isn't a place like that.

103
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,470
My goodness.

104
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,870
Hey, what happened to your nose?

105
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,190
That's because of the mask.

106
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,000
- It's the mask.
- That's not what we do now.

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,700
All right.

108
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,260
- As you can see...
- What are we doing today?

109
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,840
They are the new members
of the Comedian Association.

110
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,670
Do you know
why you're wearing yellow?

111
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,280
- Because we're rookies.
- Exactly.

112
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,540
Make sure you don't ruin
the mood of the meeting today.

113
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,540
(Smiling like a chick)

114
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,220
- Hey.
- I want you to try your best.

115
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,560
- Okay.
- You stay out of this.

116
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
(You stay out of this.)

117
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,380
(A punch in the stomach)

118
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,380
Don't meddle in.

119
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,000
- Don't step up.
- Stay out of this.

120
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,290
- Hang on.
- I said, don't meddle in.

121
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,400
This is what we should do.

122
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,600
- Se Chan.
- Do you have a problem?

123
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,000
- You should get a penalty.
- Why did you...

124
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,870
- He looks into your eyes.
- You make eye contact with me?

125
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,870
Can't I?

126
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,100
- Are you good at fighting?
- Yes, I am.

127
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,700
My gosh.

128
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,630
We don't have a good fighter here.

129
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,840
- Really?
- Yes. We rarely fight.

130
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,070
Hey, when it comes to fighting...

131
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,650
What did you do before
becoming a comedienne?

132
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,570
I worked at a cafe.

133
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,980
I heard that
you had a boyfriend before.

134
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,020
But you're not seeing anyone, right?

135
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,050
Yes. Oh, right.

136
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,760
And I heard you devoted yourself
to taking care of your boyfriend.

137
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,030
That's not true. I've never
had a boyfriend before.

138
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,490
- My gosh.
- Excuse me,

139
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,100
but you don't have to do this.

140
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,770
- That's... She has bad habits.
- You shouldn't...

141
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,900
- That's a bad habit.
- She learned weird stuff.

142
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,360
And I've never had
a girlfriend before.

143
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,540
- Why?
- That's enough.

144
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,910
I'll punch you in the stomach.

145
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,470
- Stay quiet.
- You can punch him when I hold him.

146
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,910
All right, So Min.
What did you do before?

147
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,650
I studied abroad.

148
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,670
(I studied abroad.)

149
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,790
- Hey.
- Again?

150
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,390
You should stop saying
that you studied abroad.

151
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,090
- Where did you study?
- To be a comedian...

152
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,050
What did you do before? Gosh.

153
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,830
You look so cute in the picture.

154
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,290
- Pardon?
- You look really cute.

155
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,760
This is from Yeong Ja's bus.

156
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,220
That's a long time ago.

157
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,990
- When was that?
- Only top stars can get on the bus.

158
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,060
("Yeong Ja's Golden Days",
November, 1995)

159
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,010
(He was only 19.)

160
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,470
With your eyes open wide.

161
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,580
(Straining his eyes)

162
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,450
Open them wide. Start.

163
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,310
(He had cute snake eyes
25 years ago.)

164
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,220
(Sending a message to his mom)

165
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,590
Send a message to your classmates.

166
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,290
Say your school and class. Start.

167
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,600
(My classmates from Grade 12,
Class 9 of Shinsung High School!)

168
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,490
(I'm on TV.
I said I would be on TV.)

169
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,210
(Jong Kook was on Yeong Ja's bus
at the age of 19.)

170
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,470
Isn't he Term One's senior?

171
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,780
- That was a long time ago.
- Yeong Ja's bus.

172
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,170
Have you been on Yeong Ja's bus?

173
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,170
No.

174
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,470
Only top stars could join the show.

175
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,580
- Is it "That's it. All right?"
- Yes.

176
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,080
- Well...
- My gosh.

177
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,040
Only top stars could
join the show back then.

178
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,810
- Did you really do that?
- I did it in this very building.

179
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,480
- You look really cute.
- "That's it. All right."

180
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,980
- "That's it. All right."
- I look cute, don't I?

181
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,960
So what did you do before?

182
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,980
I was a bully.

183
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,330
- A bully?
- I was released two days ago.

184
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,220
I was released two days ago.

185
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,900
Don't feel small.

186
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,100
- It's not like that.
- I'll take care of him.

187
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,910
- What did you say?
- Go ahead and deal with him.

188
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,600
I'm not going. He should come to me.

189
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,780
Why would I go to him?

190
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,870
- Wait.
- What?

191
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,670
You two can go outside
together for a while.

192
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,870
You can go.

193
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,170
- No.
- Go ahead.

194
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,580
- Just go.
- Okay. I'll go with him.

195
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,040
- Bye.
- See you.

196
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,080
Hang on.

197
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,240
- I don't have to go.
- Okay.

198
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,180
- Let's just go.
- Jong Kook.

199
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,920
- Yes?
- Take him to Seoul for sightseeing.

200
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,220
That's a good idea.

201
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,050
I'll take you to Seoul.
In 1, 2, and 3.

202
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,490
(He feels dizzy
after the sightseeing.)

203
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,700
All right. Let him
go sightseeing to Seoul.

204
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,660
- He just went sightseeing in Seoul.
- Okay.

205
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,930
It's so convenient
to have him around.

206
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,660
You can go sightseeing
to Seoul right away.

207
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,010
- All right, guys.
- Yes.

208
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,540
So we just met the members
from Term Four.

209
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,540
And you have a colleague
who's from Term Three.

210
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,370
- I called him.
- Your colleague.

211
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,020
- I have a colleague.
- Where is he?

212
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,020
Love your colleague and love your
country. Come on out, my friend!

213
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,450
- Love your colleague.
- His colleague?

214
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,890
- Hello.
- Hello.

215
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,960
- Hey, Yong Jin.
- Hello.

216
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,660
- Hello.
- Hello.

217
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,920
He's Term Three. He's my colleague.

218
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,620
They are our seniors.

219
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,700
(He's Se Chan's best friend
from Term 3.)

220
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:26,100
(He made his debut on "People
Looking for a Laugh" in 2005.)

221
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,660
(He spent his youth
in this open hall with Se Chan.)

222
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,220
(He looks like a tiring
and demanding senior.)

223
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,670
He brought coffee for the seniors.

224
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,890
This is for the seniors.

225
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,890
Hey, you should watch and learn.

226
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,680
He walks with a swagger though.

227
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,460
What is this? I want something weak.

228
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,350
- This is weak.
- This is a multigrain shake.

229
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,660
There's nothing for us.

230
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,790
- This is a multigrain shake.
- I'll have a multigrain shake.

231
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,420
- I want a multigrain shake.
- Do you have anything for us?

232
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,860
- Is she our junior?
- Yes, she is.

233
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,490
- She's...
- Excuse me.

234
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,230
Don't you see us here?

235
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,510
Is he our junior?

236
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,710
- He used to be a bully.
- I see.

237
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,450
They are our seniors.

238
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,670
You have big shoulders.

239
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,110
I like them.

240
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,110
He was a bully.

241
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,450
Is the picture someone else
with the same name?

242
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,810
I see. It looks good.

243
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,760
- Let's have a seat.
- Okay.

244
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,460
- Let's sit.
- Everyone's here.

245
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,120
I'll sit here.

246
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,480
Okay. Sit there.

247
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,400
I haven't been here for a long time.

248
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,970
It's been ten years.

249
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,920
(Staring)

250
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,840
What are you looking at?

251
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,040
(He forgot about his character.)

252
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,160
Suk Jin.

253
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,330
If you keep doing that, we will
have to treat you the same way.

254
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,880
You can't talk to me like that.

255
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,330
The situation is...

256
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,170
- The cameras are still on.
- They are on.

257
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,510
We were taking a break.

258
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,250
- Did he talk down to you again?
- Yes.

259
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,540
(Shaking his head)

260
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,680
Hey.

261
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,890
Hey, you...

262
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,540
Pardon?

263
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,710
You stay out of this. Hey.

264
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,890
- Yes?
- He's not good at skits.

265
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,260
You keep looking into my eyes.

266
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,920
- Where am I supposed to look at?
- Yong Jin is...

267
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,790
- Avoid my eyes.
- Avoid?

268
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,230
I've been here only for
a few minutes,

269
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,630
but I can tell
who the weakest one is here.

270
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,060
It's so obvious.

271
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,430
(He's done identifying
the weakest one here.)

272
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,870
- You know who's weak here.
- I do. You don't have to tell me.

273
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,770
Hey, I guess you don't know it well.

274
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,510
I can barely feel his touch.

275
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,110
He's so weak.

276
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,200
He's like a cat.

277
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,750
- What happened to your face?
- What?

278
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,410
You have black powder on your cheek.

279
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,440
Where do we have black powder here?

280
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,310
You got it when you took
Suk Jin to Seoul for sightseeing.

281
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,860
- You look like Rambo.
- Where is it?

282
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,990
- It's on your cheek.
- My gosh.

283
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,550
(The black powder
on Jong Kook's cheek is from...)

284
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,590
He looks like Rambo.

285
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,770
(He was taking his senior
to Seoul for sightseeing.)

286
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,140
(And he got the powder
on his cheek.)

287
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,010
(He was sitting there for a while
with the black powder on.)

288
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,880
Where is it?

289
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,250
I thought he was injured.

290
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,650
This is hilarious.

291
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,520
- It's so funny.
- I can't believe this.

292
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,180
I like your black powder joke.

293
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,120
Your black powder joke
is really funny.

294
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,620
- Excuse me, Suk Jin.
- What?

295
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,990
What term are you in
for black powder?

296
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,390
I'm from Term One.

297
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,860
- Term One?
- Yes.

298
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,180
I guess Myung Soo is his colleague.

299
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,500
- Myung Soo is my colleague.
- He's from Term One.

300
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,420
- That's funny.
- All right then.

301
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,730
What do we do now?

302
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,290
Will you open the safe behind you?

303
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,660
This one?

304
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,740
(There's a safe
for the association membership fee.)

305
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,570
(Jae Suk from Term 1
opens the safe.)

306
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,980
Do you know the code, Jae Suk?

307
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,150
It's open.

308
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,520
- Why?
- What?

309
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,250
There's a mission card.

310
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,210
(There's no money
but a message in the safe.)

311
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,160
"My dear fellow comedians."

312
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,130
"I need some quick cash,
so I'm taking..."

313
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,550
"the association membership fee
of 4,000 dollars."

314
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,590
"I'll spend the money
on good causes."

315
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,230
"Special term comedian,
Lee Kwang Soo?"

316
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,920
(Special Term Comedian,
Lee Kwang Soo)

317
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,900
"Special term comedian,
Lee Kwang Soo?"

318
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,640
It was Kwang Soo.

319
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,690
(Did Kwang Soo take the membership
fee of 4,000 dollars?)

320
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,910
He did it again.

321
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,160
He took the money.

322
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,410
He took 4,000 dollars?

323
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,480
- There's news.
- The news is on.

324
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,280
(There's breaking news delivered
to the Comedian Association.)

325
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,520
This is news that's just come in.

326
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,620
There was a robbery in the office...

327
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,680
of the Unofficial
Comedian Association...

328
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,260
where Yoo Jae Suk is the president.

329
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,520
What?

330
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,950
(There was a robbery!)

331
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,420
The amount stolen is...

332
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,400
four thousand dollars, which is for
the rent of the Association office.

333
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,660
On the basis of the evidence,
the police say...

334
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,530
the 2m-tall comedian...

335
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,660
Lee Kwang Soo is the suspect.

336
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,370
(Suspect Lee Kwang Soo)

337
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,800
- Lee Kwang Soo is the suspect.
- My goodness.

338
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,330
- It's been a while.
- Did Kwang Soo leave our show?

339
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,510
The police checked
the CCTV footage...

340
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,380
and found out that Lee Kwang Soo
stole the money in the safe.

341
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,520
(Did Kwang Soo
take 4,000 dollars...)

342
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,950
It turns out he bought
seven expensive gifts...

343
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,860
including a shirt, a bag,
and speakers.

344
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,900
So that's how
he bought all the gifts?

345
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,530
(Now the truth behind
the expensive gifts is revealed.)

346
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,920
He's a jerk!

347
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,130
That's how he got us the gifts.

348
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,930
(The gifts were too expensive
for a stingy guy like him.)

349
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,140
(And there's another message
in the safe.)

350
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,240
"Reminder."

351
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,070
"Your association has defaulted in
paying the rent of 4,000 dollars."

352
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,020
"We'd like you to pay the rent
by 4 p.m. today."

353
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,710
"If you fail to pay it off,
under the terms of the contract,"

354
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,650
"two of the comedians will
have to pay the balance."

355
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,390
"July 6, 2021, Creditor SBS."

356
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,890
"Debtor the Unofficial
Comedian Association."

357
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,530
Gosh, what is this?

358
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,190
All right.

359
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,360
As you just saw
the reminder and news,

360
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,770
you were supposed to pay
the rent of this office yesterday.

361
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,240
But you failed to pay it...

362
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,330
because Kwang Soo stole your
membership fee of 4,000 dollars.

363
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,740
- Oh no.
- What do we do?

364
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,570
But according to Article 3 Clause 47
of the Comedian Association Rules,

365
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,250
the members should be divided
into Team Senior and Team Junior...

366
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,650
and pay half of the rent each.

367
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,340
If the two teams
pay 2,000 dollars each...

368
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,360
by four o'clock today,

369
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,990
all the comedians won't
get a penalty.

370
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,760
But if only one of the teams
manages to pay,

371
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,130
one member of the team that failed
to pay will get a penalty.

372
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,000
If both teams fail to pay,

373
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,540
one member
from each team will get a penalty.

374
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,140
I don't think we can pay it today.

375
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,460
I'll tell you
how to collect the money.

376
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,010
After a mission, the winning team
and the losing team...

377
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,910
will choose a debit card.

378
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,250
Each card has
different amounts of money,

379
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,650
and the cards for the winning team
have more money in them.

380
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,910
You will go...

381
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,990
to the ATM with a card you picked.
Once you complete the mission,

382
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,680
you can withdraw the money.

383
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,840
(They can withdraw money
if they complete their mission.)

384
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,120
Let's try the first withdrawal then.

385
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,320
(It's time
for the first withdrawal.)

386
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,790
According to
the Comedian Association Rules,

387
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,260
for the first withdrawal,

388
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,530
seniors will be the winning team,
and juniors will be the losing team.

389
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,690
- And now you will choose a card.
- Okay.

390
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,330
- The winning team gets ten cards,
- Okay.

391
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,610
and the losing team
gets eight cards.

392
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,300
(10 cards for the winning team
and 8 cards for the losing team)

393
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,750
There are cards that have 100
to 800 dollars for the losing team.

394
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,810
And for the winning team, there are
cards with 100 to 1,000 dollars.

395
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,810
We can pick 800 dollars.

396
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,890
And...

397
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,020
we need leaders for each team.

398
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,520
These two seniors
will be the leaders first.

399
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,990
And you can pick two leaders here.

400
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,180
The leaders will pick a card each,

401
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,860
and they will scratch the back
of their cards to see the amount.

402
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,900
(They will scratch the card
to see the amount.)

403
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,400
But it's not that...

404
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,060
you get the amount right away.

405
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,540
- You see the ATMs here.
- Right.

406
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,010
You will go to the ATMs...

407
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,510
and answer quizzes there.

408
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,930
- Quizzes?
- Then you can get the amount...

409
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,510
(They should answer a quiz
to get the amount on the card.)

410
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,410
(Quiz?)

411
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,510
on the card.

412
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,810
- That means we won't get the money.
- My gosh.

413
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,280
- What is Yong Jin like?
- What do you think of Yong Jin?

414
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,340
He's no different
from the Empty Heads.

415
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,210
- That's not true.
- But...

416
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,550
he reads a lot.

417
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,160
- I read a lot.
- He does read a lot.

418
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,230
But he doesn't have good knowledge.

419
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,180
I know things like the four
precious things of the study.

420
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,130
Do you know the four
precious things of the study?

421
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,590
I do.

422
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,370
- What are the four precious things?
- I know the word, "treacherous".

423
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,730
- Do you know "treacherous"?
- Yes.

424
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,060
I know a lot of idioms.

425
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,960
And I'm conversant
with the stock market.

426
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,800
Can you spell umbrella?

427
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,930
U.

428
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,300
- Go ahead.
- You watched the episode.

429
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,570
- U, B...
- U?

430
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,910
- U and B?
- U and B?

431
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,980
B comes after U?

432
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,750
I mean it has a U and a B.

433
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,910
- What comes after U?
- Don't ask me.

434
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,340
Suk Jin, you don't have to do this.

435
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,990
Just tell me what comes after the U.

436
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,620
- It also has an R in it.
- Okay.

437
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,360
- So what comes after the U?
- Why are you being like this?

438
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,630
Tell me what the next letter is.

439
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,950
Hang on.

440
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,360
- Suk Jin.
- My gosh.

441
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,500
- What?
- Stand up.

442
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,900
- What did I do?
- Hang on.

443
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,060
- The juniors are watching.
- When we're with others...

444
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,320
Why do you try to humiliate
your junior around others?

445
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,740
- Is it my fault?
- Is an umbrella that important?

446
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,740
- Hey, is it my bad?
- Hey, Jong Kook.

447
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,610
- Did you work out?
- Yes.

448
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,670
Please help Seok Sam...

449
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,170
- run up the stairs.
- Come on out.

450
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,510
- No.
- This is...

451
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,070
what my senior asked me.

452
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,250
Hey.

453
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,520
It's been "Three Meals for Jae Suk"
for the past few weeks.

454
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,490
(What the members hate the most...)

455
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,710
(is the combination
of Yoo Jae Suk and Kim Jong Kook.)

456
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,630
(He's Lord Yoo's guard
who stands up for his tyranny.)

457
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,290
"Three Meals for Jae Suk"
never ends.

458
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,820
(Lord Yoo and Servant Kim
show up every week.)

459
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,690
- Did you meet Jong Kook in private?
- No, I didn't.

460
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,160
Why would I meet him?

461
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,200
How could he...

462
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,610
Keep running.

463
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,410
- Why is an umbrella so important?
- My point.

464
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,780
U-M...

465
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,340
B-R-E-L-L-A.

466
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,980
- Hey.
- Umbrella.

467
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,020
- She knows it.
- Look at Se Chan.

468
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,210
Your boyfriend seems happy.

469
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,080
(Shush!)

470
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,730
(She encourages false rumors.)

471
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,950
(She wants everyone to know
about her secret relationship.)

472
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,760
Strict discipline.

473
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,770
(The march ends.)

474
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,590
- Strict discipline.
- Well done.

475
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,640
(Seok Sam is back after the
running with the drill instructor.)

476
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,040
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

477
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,010
Well done.

478
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,800
"Three Meals for Jae Suk"
never ends.

479
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,410
When is it going to end?

480
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,670
How many seasons are there?

481
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,910
- Pull yourself together.
- Okay. It was my bad.

482
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,570
- We should respect each other.
- It's B that comes after U.

483
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,490
- Yes.
- Have a seat.

484
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,490
So we have two seniors here.

485
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,790
Who will go first in this team?

486
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,450
Ji Hyo goes first.

487
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,490
Will the person who picks a card
answer the question?

488
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,530
Yes, she will.

489
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,790
But you all will have to
do it at least once.

490
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,160
- Just decide who goes first.
- You should mix them well.

491
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,830
When I made my wish yesterday,
I didn't say how many times.

492
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,660
(So Min got her wish granted
in the last episode.)

493
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,040
(Tell me the answers to quizzes and
make it look like I got it myself.)

494
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,300
So Min, you shouldn't
use your wish for this.

495
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,610
My wish is too good
to use for this though.

496
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,210
- You think?
- You should give it a try.

497
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,710
Just use it.

498
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,070
She wants to use it
for one-on-one games.

499
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,840
It's too good for this, So Min.

500
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,420
What is this thing?

501
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,760
- What?
- Oh, it's sigma.

502
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,080
All of a sudden...

503
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,380
Why are you saying that
all of a sudden?

504
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,200
They sometimes have
the same problems.

505
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,430
Can we pick a card first?

506
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,590
Pick a card,
and go to the ATM with it.

507
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,770
There will be a quiz.

508
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,930
We have to answer the quiz
to get the money.

509
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,630
If you answer the quiz, we will
give you the amount of money.

510
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,560
But, if you fail,

511
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,180
you can try again. You can enter
the code up to three times.

512
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,440
It's possible.

513
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,800
But the amount will be halved.

514
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,870
(If they give a wrong answer,
the amount will be halved.)

515
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,010
We have to keep trying.

516
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,750
So you have two extra chances.

517
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,720
That means we should pick
a card with big money.

518
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,580
It will be great
if we pick 100 dollars, right?

519
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,990
Then you can get
at least 25 dollars.

520
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,380
- Exactly.
- That's right.

521
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,920
Now, I want the two leaders
of each team to pick a card...

522
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,620
and scratch the back.

523
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,930
Can I give it to another member?

524
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,050
No, you can't.

525
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,590
- Who should do it? So Min?
- So Min.

526
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,620
- So Min and Ji Hyo will do it?
- Ji Hyo, will you do it?

527
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,860
Should I pick first?
What do you say?

528
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,440
- You go first, Jong Kook.
- Go ahead, Jong Kook.

529
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,540
I'll pick one in the middle row.
I choose this.

530
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,170
- Let's check.
- Good. I thought of choosing that.

531
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,100
- Really?
- Yes, I picked it at first.

532
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
- Start from the corner.
- I got 300 dollars.

533
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,340
- Not bad.
- Gosh.

534
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,600
- Let me check.
- Okay.

535
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,070
- I got 300 dollars.
- Not bad.

536
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,340
(So Min obtained a 100 dollar card.)

537
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,640
How much? 100 dollars?

538
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,140
- That's a shame.
- You got the lowest amount?

539
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,760
- If it's a 100 dollar card...
- Oh, my. It's 1,000 dollars!

540
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,230
- One thousand dollars?
- It's 1,000 dollars.

541
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,290
- It's 1,000 dollars.
- See? I said I had a good feeling.

542
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,530
(They're making such a fuss.)

543
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,430
- It's 1,000 dollars.
- No, it's 100 dollars.

544
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,970
(One hundred dollars)

545
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,360
- One hundred dollars?
- See?

546
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,060
- Is 100 dollars the lowest amount?
- One hundred dollars...

547
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,940
- Gosh. Out of all these cards...
- I said I had a good feeling.

548
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,540
- You should do better than that.
- I got a 300 dollar card.

549
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,300
- Oh, yes. I got 800 dollars.
- That's great.

550
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,140
- Oh, my.
- That's so great.

551
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,540
- See? I told you.
- The lowest is 100 dollars.

552
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,780
Why did you pick a 100 dollar card
out of all these cards?

553
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,220
Jong Kook, how did you pick that
out of all these cards?

554
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,350
There will be a new set of cards
in each round.

555
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,810
- Oh, really?
- I see.

556
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,050
- Okay.
- Oh, gosh.

557
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,350
Then can we go now?

558
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,990
All four of you
picked a card, right?

559
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,030
You must put this on
since you all get the same question.

560
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,930
- We all receive the same question?
- Although it's only 100 dollars...

561
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,930
Oh, it's not that?

562
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,470
I really should get it right.
Could it be very difficult?

563
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,300
Jong Kook, you've got this.

564
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,300
Get the right answer no matter what
even if you fail in three attempts.

565
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,900
I trust you, Jae Suk.

566
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,070
Gosh, I'm nervous.

567
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,370
Okay.

568
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,640
How does this work?

569
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,220
(To withdraw cash,
insert your card into the machine.)

570
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,380
"To withdraw cash..." I get it.
Here we go.

571
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,690
- Oh, here. Should I put it in here?
- You shouldn't just put it in.

572
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,580
(He put in the 100 dollar card
that he just obtained.)

573
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,290
(To withdraw cash,
insert your card into the machine.)

574
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,200
(To withdraw the balance,
solve the following quiz.)

575
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,230
(Write the meaning of the following
Gyeongsang Province dialect.)

576
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,240
("I'll kickya witma foot.")

577
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,860
Goodness. What's this?

578
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,510
(The 1st question)

579
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,940
Oh, gosh.
This isn't an easy question.

580
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,370
(All the quizzes are related
to Korean and foreign languages.)

581
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,340
(Jae Suk, 300 dollars, So Min, 100,
Suk Jin, 100, Jong Kook, 800)

582
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,600
- Oh, no. What should I do?
- What's with this notepad?

583
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,310
(Jae Suk, 300 dollars, So Min, 100,
Suk Jin, 100, Jong Kook, 800)

584
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,750
(Translate the following
dialect expression.)

585
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,750
(Since they have never heard
the expression before,)

586
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,520
(they're thinking hard
to figure it out.)

587
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:06,730
("I'll kickya witma foot"?)

588
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,060
"Remove one cue card..."

589
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,030
(Jae Suk starts writing the answer
after thinking hard.)

590
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,920
- Oh, should I remove this?
- This?

591
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,260
Does it come out once I remove it?

592
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,390
- That's right.
- Does it come out right away?

593
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,300
(I will kick you with my foot.)

594
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,540
Is it not the right answer?

595
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,900
(Correct.
You will receive 300 dollars.)

596
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,270
Okay!

597
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,540
Oh, I think...

598
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,170
(Jae Suk withdrew 300 dollars.)

599
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,050
(Jae Suk succeeded in the 1st try
and got all 300 dollars.)

600
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,440
Wait. It's confusing.

601
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,110
What... What should I do?

602
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,140
(Correct.
You will receive 800 dollars.)

603
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,090
Oh, my. Hold on a second.

604
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,650
(Jong Kook also succeeded
and got 800 dollars!)

605
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,490
(The Term 1 senior member returned
with 300 dollars.)

606
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,730
- I knew it. That's Term One.
- Did you succeed?

607
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,000
Of course.

608
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,330
(Elated and proud)

609
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,920
- Okay!
- Did you get the right answer?

610
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,120
All right! I knew you'd succeed.

611
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,000
He's good at everything
that's related to kicking.

612
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,190
Okay!

613
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,460
- Good job. You got 800 dollars?
- You see...

614
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,740
- Yes, I got 800 dollars.
- Nice.

615
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,980
- Great job.
- Okay.

616
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,900
He's close friends with gangsters
from Gyeongsang Province, you know.

617
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,140
I'm going to kick you with my foot.

618
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,280
(Meanwhile, in the bank...)

619
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,290
(Big Nose is struggling.)

620
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,020
(He wrote down something.)

621
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,530
(I'll kick you with my shoes off.)

622
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,920
(I will kill you.)

623
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,960
(Incorrect. Try the next question.)

624
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Is it incorrect?

625
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,240
(Suk Jin: 100 dollars,
So Min: 100 dollars)

626
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,040
(Half has been deducted.)

627
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,160
I think...

628
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,740
Next question.

629
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,930
(He failed to get the lowest amount
and even lost half of it.)

630
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,010
(Write the accurate name
of the object in the picture.)

631
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,820
What's this?

632
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,250
Oh, that... It's confusing.

633
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,590
(Kelp noodle)

634
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,590
The two of them are solving
the second question.

635
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,730
What's the question?

636
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,150
- Is it shredded radish?
- No, it's not radish.

637
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,530
The thing that you see
at a sashimi restaurant.

638
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,600
- Kelt noodle.
- Kelt noodle.

639
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,040
- Kelt noodle.
- No, it's not kelt noodle.

640
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,770
- No, it's not kelt noodle.
- It's kelf noodle.

641
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,800
- Jellyfish?
- No.

642
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,860
- Gosh.
- Is it correct?

643
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
(Kelt noodel)

644
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,100
(She even misspelled "noodle.")

645
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,080
- This is what So Min wrote.
- Isn't this correct?

646
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,870
(Empty Head's incorrect answer makes
everyone laugh at her.)

647
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,550
I'm worried about So Min.

648
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,710
I give up. I have no idea.

649
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,980
(Suk Jin: 50 dollars)

650
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,090
I give up.
I'll try the next question.

651
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,060
(Write the accurate English title
of "Running Man.")

652
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,380
"Write
the accurate English title..."

653
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,330
(Write the accurate English title
of "Running Man.")

654
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,300
(The easiest question that shows
how they look down on the cast.)

655
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,660
All right.

656
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,630
I know the answer.

657
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,340
(Following the confident Suk Jin,
So Min also wrote the right answer.)

658
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,960
- Okay! Did you get it right?
- Okay.

659
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,040
- You know...
- Good job. I knew it.

660
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,600
Did you come back out
after spelling "Running Man?"

661
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,400
- Running Man!
- I was even confused...

662
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,200
whether there should be
1 or 2 Ns in "running".

663
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,870
To tell you the truth.

664
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,080
(So Min reacted
just as the staff expected.)

665
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,910
- They're so mean.
- That's the intention of the staff.

666
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,680
- You tried to make me look stupid.
- No, we didn't.

667
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,060
As a result, Jong Kook and Jae Suk
with the most seniority...

668
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,290
- in their teams succeeded at once.
- I'm relieved.

669
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,850
- Great.
- I knew it.

670
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,850
Jong Kook got 800 dollars,
and Jae Suk got 300 dollars.

671
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,620
- We won.
- Hey...

672
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,730
- Did you pick an 800 dollar card?
- Yes, I did.

673
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,630
He picked an 800 dollar card.

674
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,360
Both So Min and Suk Jin succeeded
on the third level...

675
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,460
and gained 25 dollars.

676
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,460
That's good.

677
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,700
- She succeeded.
- Great job.

678
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,250
The preliminary round is over.
We'll begin the first mission now.

679
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,550
What's this?

680
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,940
What's going on?

681
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,640
What's this? I guess
we'll be pouring water on one other.

682
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,990
I think it's flour.

683
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,090
It is flour?

684
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,210
- Is it not water?
- Oh, it's flour.

685
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,290
(Gourd bowls and flour are
essential props for comedians.)

686
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,490
Everyone, gather around!

687
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,650
- Term Two!
- Gather around!

688
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,600
(The Term 1 senior member gathered
his junior members.)

689
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,390
- We should bend over backward.
- What's going on?

690
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,920
- Take your hand out of your pocket.
- Stand straight!

691
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,270
Take your hand out of your pocket.

692
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,300
(He gets most excited
when he scolds his junior comedian.)

693
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,960
You can put your bags down
for a while.

694
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,100
- Okay.
- Yes.

695
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,980
We're all so obedient.

696
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,980
We all listen to him.

697
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,370
- Yes, sir.
- Got it.

698
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,100
- You don't have to do it to me.
- Yes, we should, sir.

699
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,580
This is the difference
between a director and cast members.

700
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,780
The seniority among us
doesn't matter.

701
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,850
Sir, why don't we eat together
sometime?

702
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,260
The first mission where you can
show off your slapstick skills is...

703
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,230
Flour Marionette.

704
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,230
"Marionette?"

705
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,270
Three of the team members hold
a gourd bowl.

706
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,800
One of them sits on the chair.

707
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,960
Another sits on the floor,

708
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,400
and the last one lies down
with the bowl on the belly.

709
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
- I see.
- On the belly?

710
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,200
The remaining member of the team
will move flour to the bowls...

711
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,640
with both of the arms
tied to those ropes.

712
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,850
It sounds simple.

713
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:32,250
The total weight of the flour
in the bowls will decide the winner.

714
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,790
The flour in the farthest bowl
will be tripled,

715
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,710
and the flour
in the second farthest bowl...

716
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,090
will be doubled.

717
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,210
(The farther the bowl with flour is,
the better chance they have to win.)

718
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:43,260
However, the opponent team members
will sit on both sides...

719
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,420
and pull ropes that are
tied to the wrists.

720
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,160
- Of course, it wouldn't be easy.
- We should pull it hard.

721
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,460
We won't be able to move ahead.

722
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,430
Oh, no. We won't be able to put
any flour in our bowls.

723
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,540
We can win this.

724
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,740
There will be two rounds,

725
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,200
and the team with more flour
will win.

726
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,370
You have to decide
which team will go first.

727
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,480
They'll go first.

728
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,750
- Junior comedians always go first.
- They're juniors.

729
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,940
- Am I right, sir?
- Why? Sir.

730
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,080
- All right.
- Why is that?

731
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,250
We'll go first.

732
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,250
- Pardon?
- You're awesome, sir!

733
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,820
- He's taking the lead as always.
- Why should we go first?

734
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,910
- As their senior comedians.
- Exactly. We'll go first.

735
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,210
- Let's decide the positions.
- Okay.

736
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,830
The flour that the lying one has
will be tripled, sir.

737
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,650
- Really?
- Yes, that's the best spot.

738
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,150
- Then he should take the position.
- Then...

739
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,690
- As your junior comedians, we'll...
- Right.

740
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,390
- Then you guys lie down.
- Pardon me?

741
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,530
- You two lie down.
- But only one of us...

742
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,630
- No.
- You two lie down.

743
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,500
We'll lie down
as your senior comedians.

744
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,510
- My, he's so cool.
- Of course.

745
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,600
- Sir, you're awesome!
- Indeed.

746
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,780
Sir, you're so cool.

747
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,170
- You're respected for a reason.
- Gosh, seriously.

748
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,670
Why would you keep making
your juniors do the hard work?

749
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,170
- That's not my intention.
- Then why...

750
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,250
- They should be in that position.
- Are you willing to get floured?

751
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,550
Then you'll get...

752
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,940
both black and white powder
on your hair.

753
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,490
- Black and white powder?
- Hey.

754
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,560
- You'll get white powder too?
- You'll look like Cruella.

755
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,120
- Hey, don't be cheeky.
- He'll look like Cruella.

756
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,230
- That's okay.
- Understood?

757
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,060
He's okay. He and I served
in the same military unit.

758
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,860
- I adore him.
- We served in the same unit.

759
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,530
- I adore him.
- Yes, we served in the ROK Navy.

760
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,300
- Suk Jin.
- We both served in the ROK Navy.

761
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,190
- Yes? Why?
- We're not in the military.

762
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,740
- We served in the same unit.
- That doesn't matter here.

763
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,310
- This won't work. Jong Kook.
- Come with me.

764
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,930
- Show him the stairs.
- Let's go.

765
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,550
- Why won't you listen to me?
- Come on.

766
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,810
- Let's go.
- Hey.

767
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,370
- Start with your left foot.
- Okay.

768
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,440
How many more times will we do
"Three Meals for Jae Suk?"

769
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,640
- Strict discipline.
- Good. I like this.

770
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,320
- Shouldn't three times be enough?
- He should get it together now.

771
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,120
- But he doesn't seem to do so.
- He should get it together now.

772
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,680
- Why? He's so stubborn.
- What is wrong with him?

773
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,800
- Strict discipline.
- Strict discipline.

774
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,730
(Seok jin came back looking pale
after getting disciplined.)

775
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:30,770
Okay. Good.

776
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,130
- Strict discipline.
- Look at his face.

777
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,860
- He's improved.
- Stop. In 1, 2.

778
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,040
- He's improved.
- Stop.

779
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,200
(He does well now.)

780
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,780
- I'm back, sir.
- Good job.

781
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,280
- Good job.
- Thank you, sir.

782
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,350
- He can do it well now.
- I will get floured.

783
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,980
- He pulled himself together.
- It worked.

784
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,480
- Suk Jin, you take that position.
- Yes, sir.

785
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,410
- You take the lying position.
- The weight will be tripled.

786
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,020
I feel heavy responsibility, sir.

787
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,350
How about I sit here instead?

788
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,180
- Then you sit here.
- Here? Can I?

789
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,090
- I'll take this position.
- Okay.

790
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,350
- Shall I scoop and move flour?
- Yes, you do that.

791
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,420
- Yong Jin, you sit here.
- Do I sit here?

792
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,230
- Hey, Se Chan.
- Yes?

793
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,070
- Overcome it.
- Yes, I'll overcome it.

794
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,770
Especially when So Min pulls it,
you should...

795
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,660
The tether between you and me

796
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,800
(The tether between you and me)

797
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,390
(She's simply excited
about being tethered to him.)

798
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,540
- This is the sound inside of us
- My gosh.

799
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,900
The one on this side clearly looks
like a rope.

800
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,540
Then why does the other one look
like a metal chain?

801
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,010
- It looks scary.
- Right?

802
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,550
- Yes, it looks like a metal chain.
- I can see that.

803
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,250
Isn't Jong Kook pulling too much?
Hey, stop.

804
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,990
I'm holding the rope
just as the rule allows.

805
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,020
- I never go against any rules.
- I know.

806
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,790
- Get ready, everyone.
- Let's do this.

807
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,290
- Let's say a chant.
- Should I lower the bowl?

808
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,490
Yes, please lower it for me.

809
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,680
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

810
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,990
- Shout a chant.
- Put it over your head.

811
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,950
When I say, "We win",
you say, "no matter what".

812
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,690
- Gosh, you.
- Where's your sense of humor?

813
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,270
- Suk Jin.
- You don't like it?

814
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,770
- That chant is so lame.
- I'll come up with something else.

815
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,340
That's not cool in this era.
"We win no matter what"?

816
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,860
That's what people hate the most
these days.

817
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,600
- Then what?
- JRS!

818
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,310
- What does JRS stand for?
- JRS!

819
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,900
(No one has heard
the chant "JRS" before.)

820
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,410
Just like a robot and steel!

821
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,590
(Just like a robot and steel!)

822
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,790
(What?)

823
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,940
That's funny.

824
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,610
Just like a robot!

825
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,180
- What's that?
- Just like steel!

826
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,060
Let's be as strong as a robot
and steel!

827
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,060
- Understood?
- Understood, sir!

828
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,770
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

829
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,390
- Say "JRS"!
- Let's go with "JRS".

830
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,660
- JRS!
- That's a funny chant.

831
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,800
- My, that's so funny.
- That's our team chant.

832
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,430
- JRS!
- Just like a robot and steel.

833
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,570
And steel.

834
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,900
(They finished getting ready
with the JRS mindset.)

835
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,900
- We can do this.
- Be strong.

836
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,670
- Got it?
- I'll be strong, sir.

837
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,100
- Understood, everyone?
- Yes, sir!

838
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,750
- We're ready.
- Let's go!

839
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,750
Ready.

840
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,590
(They begin the 100-second mission
with a mindset of steel.)

841
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,110
(He's ready to be strong enough
to scoop flour.)

842
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,290
(No extra points,
double score, triple score)

843
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,990
(Jong Kook and So Min started
pulling Se Chan's arms.)

844
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,300
Throw it now.

845
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,120
- Oh, my gosh.
- Throw it.

846
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,800
- Throw it now.
- Oh, my gosh.

847
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,120
(It's not easy to put the flour
in the bowl.)

848
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,600
Come on. Throw it.

849
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,600
(Covered with flour)

850
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,540
- Hey, throw it.
- I'll focus on my left arm.

851
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,600
You have no other way.
Just throw it as hard as you can.

852
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,980
- I'll focus on my left arm.
- Hey, throw it.

853
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,550
- Hey!
- Se Chan!

854
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,310
Hey! JRS! Remember it!

855
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,020
What is Jong Kook doing?

856
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,870
Just like a robot!

857
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,140
It's not against the rule.

858
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,380
Put it in the bowl here.

859
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,790
It's a shame that I have to wait
to watch this on TV.

860
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,910
Put it in this bowl.

861
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,290
Throw it!

862
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,590
- Hey!
- Gosh. Darn it.

863
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,150
(The white powder festival)

864
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,190
Throw it.

865
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,000
(Unlike what he expected,
Jae Suk is covered with flour.)

866
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,300
- Throw it.
- Jae Suk.

867
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,330
- JRS!
- JRS!

868
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:19,600
- Just like a robot!
- Just like a robot and steel!

869
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,690
Just like a robot!

870
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,010
(Time's up.)

871
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,400
- Gosh. That was so hard.
- I got a lot in my bowl.

872
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
- Gosh.
- All right. Time's up.

873
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,810
(The team collected quite a lot
with the JRS mindset.)

874
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,400
- We got more than we expected.
- Indeed.

875
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,580
Exactly.

876
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,940
- Please pour it into this bowl.
- I got some in my bowl.

877
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,320
- I got some too.
- That's right.

878
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,850
- We'll weigh it separately.
- Let's weigh Jae Suk's first.

879
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,180
- We got some despite that.
- It was really hard.

880
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,950
It was no joke.

881
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,450
Pour it all.

882
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,790
True. Suk Jin got flour
only on his nose.

883
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,060
Let me take a look.

884
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,800
(The player from Team Junior is
Jong Kook, an athletic comedian.)

885
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,300
- My goodness.
- Don't pull it yet.

886
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,770
I tried pulling it,
but he wouldn't even budge.

887
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,860
- Are you doing a chest workout?
- Yes.

888
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,510
This is nice. Hold it tightly.

889
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,900
Still, Jong Kook,
I'm a young, healthy man.

890
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,010
I know.

891
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,400
(The young, healthy man is
playing with the rope frivolously.)

892
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,780
Could the rope snap?

893
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,850
No, it won't snap.

894
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,020
(Acting up)

895
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,290
(He disappeared.)

896
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,380
(An urgent meeting
has been arranged.)

897
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,760
Come on, Jong Kook.
You should've given me a heads-up.

898
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,120
What was that? Enough is enough.

899
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,500
- "Enough is enough."
- Oh, boy.

900
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Don't go overboard.

901
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,030
- Were you dragged all the way here?
- That was scary.

902
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,600
You should at least give me
a heads-up.

903
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,890
It's amazing that he can be dragged
that far.

904
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,600
- We'll begin now.
- Yes.

905
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,660
- Here we go.
- Ready.

906
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,070
- Don't hold there. That's good.
- Hold it.

907
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,700
Get set. You shouldn't hold that.

908
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,170
Don't let him scoop any flour.

909
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,280
(The young, healthy man and Mr. JRS
will fight against Jong Kook.)

910
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,280
- That's good.
- Don't cross the red line.

911
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,750
(The fitness YouTuber grits
his teeth and stands up.)

912
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,380
(He started pouring flour
into the bowl.)

913
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,990
No, wait. Pull it when he stands up.

914
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,020
That's good.

915
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,060
(The healthy man interferes
Jong Kook.)

916
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,790
I'm a healthy man just like you.
Here we go.

917
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,790
(I'm a healthy man just like you.
Here we go.)

918
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,650
- Great. Keep going.
- Here we go.

919
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,850
(Mr. JRS is trying his best too.)

920
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,890
- That's good.
- Great. Let's do this.

921
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,300
(Shouting)

922
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,930
- Jong Kook can't scoop any.
- That's right.

923
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,350
He can't scoop any flour.

924
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,670
- He can't seem to do it.
- Gosh, you.

925
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,370
(Gosh, you.)

926
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
(Jong Kook began showing off
his strength.)

927
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,110
- Hurry up and go back.
- No.

928
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,290
(Jong Kook began showing off
his strength.)

929
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,490
Pull it.

930
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,520
(They succeeded in irritating
Jong Kook.)

931
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,680
(Jae Suk and Yong Jin are
shouting.)

932
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,920
- He can't scoop any.
- Hurry up!

933
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,950
- Jong Kook can't do it.
- He can't do it.

934
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,770
He can't do it.

935
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,460
(Mr. JRS got so excited.)

936
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,660
Stop him.

937
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,160
- Stop him.
- Don't come here.

938
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,400
(The 2nd urgent meeting)

939
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,310
(The young, healthy man was
dragged helplessly again.)

940
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,980
Where are you? Hurry up!

941
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,170
(Time is passing by
even at this moment.)

942
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,170
Hey, don't...

943
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,940
Jong Kook, Ji Hyo got no flour
in her bowl.

944
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,880
- Jong Kook, where are you?
- Pull it.

945
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,110
(The healthy man and Mr. JRS are
keeping him from moving.)

946
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,260
Pull it. Don't let him
scoop any flour.

947
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,450
Are you exercising?

948
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,230
- Okay!
- What?

949
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,380
- What was that?
- It was our first try.

950
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,890
(So Min and Ji Hyo's bowls
are empty.)

951
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:01,300
- I think it was...
- I can't believe this.

952
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,770
- What's this? My bowl is empty.
- Gosh, seriously.

953
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,340
That was funny.

954
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,500
Haha, you can pour it.

955
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,400
- I have too little.
- You tripled my score, right?

956
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,240
- Yes.
- Only Haha got flour in his bowl.

957
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,840
So Min's bowl is almost empty.

958
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,700
I mean... Our bowls are empty.

959
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,780
So Min has no flour.

960
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,140
We should've looked
just as they did.

961
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,170
Now...

962
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,480
- I'll announce the result.
- Okay.

963
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,520
Team Junior collected more flour,

964
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,410
but Team Senior won
since they got more extra points.

965
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,760
(Team Senior won
with the tripled score.)

966
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,420
- I knew it.
- We're senior comedians.

967
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,290
Right. The person in the front...

968
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,800
- I guess...
- How did this happen?

969
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,420
I think they got more flour
in the farthest bowl.

970
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,030
It was fun to see Jong Kook's arm
moving as I pulled the rope.

971
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,130
- Right?
- As the person pulling the rope.

972
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,600
- It was fun to see him move.
- It feels good.

973
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,840
I could see that he got flustered.

974
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,430
I got so excited.

975
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,900
- It feels good.
- I defeated only one arm.

976
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,350
- Then why am I so excited?
- It's fun.

977
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,510
It's funny.

978
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,980
- We'll begin the final round.
- Okay.

979
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,440
Come here.

980
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,290
- Suk Jin, will you scoop flour?
- Yes.

981
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,250
- The strong Suk Jin will do it.
- Really?

982
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,950
- We're leading the game, you know.
- I see.

983
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,150
- Suk Jin will do it?
- The strong Suk Jin will do it.

984
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,380
- Yong Jin, cover your head.
- I'm okay.

985
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,380
(So Min gave him a bowl.)

986
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,760
Hey, come over here.

987
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,530
- Why?
- Look at this.

988
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,430
(There's a hole in the bowl.)

989
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,570
- Hey... My gosh.
- Why?

990
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,860
- Are you kidding?
- What is it?

991
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,360
I can see through the hole.

992
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,430
(Earlier on)

993
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,870
(She put a hole in their bowls
without letting them know.)

994
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,250
(Then she gave the bowls to them
playing innocent.)

995
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,870
(But she got caught right away.)

996
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,020
Are you kidding?

997
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,140
- Hey...
- That's too visible.

998
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,260
- Did you think I'd be fooled?
- Come on.

999
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,520
Do you think we're stupid?

1000
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,680
- Hey, do you think we're stupid?
- My gosh. Frog.

1001
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,030
Bring me another bowl, Frog.

1002
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,390
(Shouting)

1003
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,420
(The veteran comedian is
psyching himself up.)

1004
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,920
That's great. Keep going, Suk Jin,
the strong man.

1005
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,390
- He looks so weak.
- He looks like a grandpa, right?

1006
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,390
He looks cute.

1007
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,340
- That's enough.
- I'll hold it like this and...

1008
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,600
(He's wasting his energy
to make himself look cool.)

1009
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,100
This reminds me of quartering
in a period drama.

1010
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,350
- Show us what you've got, Suk Jin.
- Let's do this.

1011
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,350
The strong Suk Jin!

1012
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,440
Let's begin. Ready.

1013
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,210
Put the flour in here.
It'll be tripled.

1014
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,590
(Their 100 seconds started.)

1015
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,250
It's not so easy to put flour
in the front bowl.

1016
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,880
(It's important to aim to put flour
in Yong Jin's bowl.)

1017
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,260
(The strong Suk Jin
grits his teeth.)

1018
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,060
That's good.

1019
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,600
(He's shouting loudly, but...)

1020
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
Go, Suk Jin.

1021
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,040
He's just shouting.

1022
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,060
- The strong Suk Jin.
- Go, Suk Jin!

1023
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,810
- Go, Suk Jin.
- The strong Suk Jin.

1024
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,980
- The strong Suk Jin!
- Suk Jin!

1025
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,210
- Come on. Cheer up, Suk Jin.
- The strong Suk Jin!

1026
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,520
- Go, Suk Jin.
- Your bowls are almost empty.

1027
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,980
Come on, Suk Jin.

1028
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,310
The strong Suk Jin is
moving to the right.

1029
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,580
- He's mine!
- No, he's mine!

1030
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:41,150
- No, he's mine!
- He's mine!

1031
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,060
(They're fighting over Big Nose.)

1032
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,690
I like him more than you do.

1033
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,190
- He's mine.
- Suk Jin.

1034
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,860
- Come on. What are you doing?
- He's mine.

1035
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,130
Suk Jin is so adorable.

1036
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,230
You know, I can even make
eye contact with him.

1037
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,330
He lets them drag him around.

1038
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,810
- Please!
- The strong Suk Jin!

1039
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:59,310
What are you doing, Suk Jin?

1040
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,400
Gosh, seriously. What was that?

1041
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,880
He looked like a zombie tied up
in a zombie movie.

1042
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,040
(He's exhausted
after getting covered in flour.)

1043
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,420
- Gosh, the strong Suk Jin.
- You try it.

1044
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,020
It's just impossible.

1045
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,580
This is the final round.
It's Team Junior's turn.

1046
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,880
Let So Min pour the flour.
So Min, you do it.

1047
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,650
- Me?
- Aren't you strong?

1048
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,690
- No, Ji Hyo should do it.
- Yes, I really am strong.

1049
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,790
She's Suk Jin's rival.

1050
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,080
Exactly. You should do it.

1051
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,360
I'll show you that I can do
better than my rival did.

1052
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Oh, really?

1053
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,790
- It's hard to put it in there.
- True.

1054
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,670
It requires much more energy.

1055
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,860
- Gosh, Jae Suk.
- Why?

1056
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,330
- How could you put a hole in it?
- Why?

1057
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,170
What's this? How are we supposed
to play the game with this?

1058
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,650
Hang on. This is too much.

1059
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,380
Come on, Jae Suk.

1060
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,270
- I understand that you're anxious,
- Is it a mask or what?

1061
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,250
but we can't use this.
Why did you...

1062
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,790
- What is this?
- Hey...

1063
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,580
Play jokes like this
when you're at home.

1064
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,690
- Gosh, seriously.
- We can see your face through it.

1065
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,480
I mean we can't use it. Seriously.

1066
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,190
You should've at least
done it quietly.

1067
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,750
- I mean...
- Come on.

1068
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,270
Call me Super So Min.

1069
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,040
- Go, Super So Min.
- That's good.

1070
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,190
You'll win if you just collect
as much as you did earlier.

1071
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,440
- Okay.
- That's good to know.

1072
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,000
Right. We got so little flour.

1073
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,900
First, try to put some
in Haha's bowl in the beginning.

1074
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,400
- She won't put any in the bowls.
- Me?

1075
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,250
- You're wrong.
- I know.

1076
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,270
Ready.

1077
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,480
(Here goes Super So Min.)

1078
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,750
I knew it.

1079
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:20,150
(They can turn the game around
if they collect as much as before.)

1080
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,480
Call me Super So Min.

1081
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,190
Okay.

1082
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,790
(Fluttering)

1083
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,400
(Swaying)

1084
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,600
- So Min.
- Super So Min.

1085
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
The game has begun.

1086
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,770
(So Min, the game has begun.)

1087
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,770
So Min.

1088
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,500
(She won't be pouring flour
any time soon.)

1089
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,310
Super So Min!

1090
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,610
(Fluttering)

1091
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,210
(Giggling)

1092
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,440
Super...

1093
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,710
- Super...
- You should put it into the bowl.

1094
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,380
- Super...
- You should, but you can't do it.

1095
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,750
(You should, but you can't do it.)

1096
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,790
- You can't do it.
- You should put it into the bowl.

1097
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,420
Super So Min!

1098
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,750
- How foolish.
- How foolish.

1099
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,980
(The crazy coachman)

1100
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,730
- What an idiot.
- An idiot.

1101
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,400
(Suk Jin gets his energy back
and pulls again.)

1102
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,520
So Min!

1103
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,770
Super...

1104
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,440
Super So Min!

1105
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,270
I bet you can't do it.

1106
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,940
You can't do it.

1107
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,540
Hey, wait!

1108
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,380
(She obtains the bucket.)

1109
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,480
(Wild horse So Min
looks to tip the bucket instead.)

1110
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,650
You can't do it.

1111
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,670
(The crazy horseman
keeps tugging at the reins.)

1112
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,520
You won't be able to do that either.

1113
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,920
Stop trying.

1114
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,420
That's impossible to do.

1115
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,380
You won't be able to do that either.

1116
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,730
(Super So Min now causes mayhem.)

1117
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,150
Hey, that's cheating!

1118
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,150
- You can't do that.
- I can't?

1119
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,190
So Min going crazy
is absolutely hilarious.

1120
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,670
You've already cheated.

1121
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,860
Super...

1122
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,000
So Min!

1123
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,360
- So Min.
- Super...

1124
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,540
Super!

1125
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,400
- Super!
- Super!

1126
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,560
Super So Min!

1127
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,710
- So Min...
- Do you even know how to spell it?

1128
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,440
(Do you even know
how to spell "super?")

1129
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,110
It's S, U, P, E, R.

1130
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,880
(He attacks her with her weakness.)

1131
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,650
That's how you spell "super."

1132
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,350
So Min's mad.

1133
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,060
She's...

1134
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,920
So Min's mad.

1135
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,880
(She takes it out
on those watching instead.)

1136
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,400
She's causing mayhem again!

1137
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,630
She's going wild.

1138
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:09,020
- She's going wild.
- So Min...

1139
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,900
(Flour bombs!)

1140
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,860
Suk Jin, don't!

1141
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,860
- Suk Jin, don't!
- Pull it.

1142
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,940
(The bucket is used as a helmet
to block the flour.)

1143
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,380
As if that's possible.

1144
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,580
(While the relentless Super So Min
attacks them with flour...)

1145
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,810
- I lost our grip at the end.
- Yes, near the end.

1146
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,380
I have some in mine though.

1147
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,770
They made me so angry.

1148
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,290
- Especially Yong Jin, right?
- Yes.

1149
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,080
You fool.

1150
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,290
The spelling of "super?"

1151
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,290
(What hurt the most
was him asking her the spelling.)

1152
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,960
Do you know how to spell it?

1153
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,330
- I can't believe it.
- It's harder than it looks, right?

1154
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,690
It's nearly impossible.

1155
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,600
If you think about it,

1156
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,060
we did a good job against Jong Kook.

1157
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,730
Yes, you did.

1158
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,400
All right.

1159
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,230
We have the flour you collected.

1160
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,400
(The result)

1161
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,380
(Did Suk Jin put up a good fight?)

1162
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,940
(Or did So Min
turn the tables around.)

1163
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,080
However, the winner is Team Senior.

1164
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,250
(Team Senior wins the game.)

1165
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,650
- Nice!
- All right!

1166
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,980
- Go, seniors!
- I knew it.

1167
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,750
It's okay.
Just do well in the picking stage.

1168
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,290
It's all about picking
the right card.

1169
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,560
The two who didn't play
will pick the cards.

1170
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,860
- So Se Chan and...
- Really?

1171
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,880
- Here you go.
- Pick the one with 1,000 dollars.

1172
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,690
Here are the options
for Team Junior.

1173
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,750
(Team Senior: 100 to 1,000 dollars,
Team Junior: 100 to 800 dollars)

1174
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,750
(Yong Jin and Se Chan
will represent Team Senior.)

1175
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:15,860
Let me see.

1176
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,000
- I think I chose a good one.
- It's 1,000 dollars.

1177
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,560
- It's 900 dollars.
- Okay!

1178
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,730
- Nice.
- Okay!

1179
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:20,860
- It's 900 dollars.
- I have 400.

1180
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,000
- Okay.
- That's good enough.

1181
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,210
We can just win both.

1182
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,270
Okay!

1183
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,110
Look. Ji Hyo picked the card
with 800 dollars.

1184
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:28,980
- Nice, Ji Hyo.
- Is it 100 dollars again?

1185
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,000
- It's 100 dollars.
- Why is it always the same?

1186
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,920
But even though Ji Hyo
has the card with 800 dollars,

1187
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,150
if you divide that by three...

1188
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,980
- It's still good enough.
- Come on.

1189
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,610
She still managed
to pick 800 dollars though.

1190
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,710
- I can do it, you know.
- Nice.

1191
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,980
- Nicely done.
- Of course.

1192
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,330
Those who picked the cards
will head to the ATM machine.

1193
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,460
Head inside.

1194
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,520
(They enter the bank
with the cards they chose.)

1195
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,230
(Yong Jin picked the card
with the largest amount.)

1196
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,790
How do we do this?

1197
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,630
- Does the card go in here?
- How...

1198
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,040
- Does it go in here?
- Let me see.

1199
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,210
- I got this.
- Let's do this.

1200
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,500
We can do this.

1201
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,880
(The first question is revealed.)

1202
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,750
(Chairman Yoo Jae Suk's birthday
is August 14, 1972.)

1203
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,690
(Write all the numbers
in Chinese characters.)

1204
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,350
How can one know all these?

1205
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,710
You've got to be kidding me.

1206
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,460
(Write all the numbers
in Chinese characters.)

1207
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,080
- It's...
- One...

1208
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,900
- How do you write eight?
- Ten.

1209
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,100
- I know what 8 is.
- This is 4.

1210
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,670
- No one will be able to do it.
- This is eight.

1211
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,000
- There's no way.
- This is nine.

1212
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,960
Maybe Yong Jin could step up.

1213
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,270
We'll get to see
how smart Yong Jin is.

1214
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,610
(Out of all of them,
Yong Jin seems most reliable.)

1215
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,730
What's the character for eight?

1216
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,540
(Why is he writing down
the year 1800?)

1217
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:44,310
(Does he think this is 7?)

1218
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:47,860
(He boldly designs
a new numbering system.)

1219
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,730
(He ends it with a question mark.)

1220
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:51,730
I'm going crazy over here.

1221
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:52,860
Please...

1222
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,690
(He thinks he only doesn't know 4,
but even the first number is wrong.)

1223
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,130
- One last number...
- Why can't I remember it?

1224
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,600
These days, Ji Hyo...

1225
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,560
Well, she's been receiving lessons.

1226
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:04,730
She's been studying up
on calendars too.

1227
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,330
I have a feeling
she'll know these numbers.

1228
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,670
This is killing me.

1229
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,940
In Chinese characters?

1230
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,110
(She manages until number 4.)

1231
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,310
So Min would know this.

1232
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,110
How am I supposed to know this?

1233
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:26,230
(One, two, three, four...)

1234
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,690
I don't know what seven is.

1235
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,060
Eight.

1236
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,920
Hold on a second.

1237
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,100
(Instead of 5, she wrote "won.")

1238
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,540
(She suddenly changes it to pi.)

1239
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,000
Hold on a second.

1240
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,810
I can't remember the numbers!

1241
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,900
- Me neither.
- Same here.

1242
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,250
This is driving me crazy.

1243
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,580
Eight.

1244
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,210
I don't know what 7, 8, and 9 are.

1245
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,540
- No way!
- I don't know.

1246
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,290
I just don't know.

1247
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,420
(Incorrect. Try the next question.)

1248
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,600
(Ji Hyo: 800 dollars to 400 dollars)

1249
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,630
(He's trying to figure out
the same question.)

1250
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,360
I can't remember what nine is!

1251
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,420
This shouldn't air on TV!

1252
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,670
(It's another episode
his son shouldn't watch.)

1253
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,230
- I don't know the answer.
- This can't air on TV!

1254
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,610
(Thump)

1255
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,310
- Please!
- I don't know.

1256
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,000
I think I got the most right though.

1257
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,500
(After long consideration,
Haha puts up his answer sheet.)

1258
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:21,350
(Year 1972)

1259
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,480
(Haha: 100 dollars)

1260
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,580
(Incorrect. Try the next question.)

1261
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,710
I give up.

1262
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,080
Next!

1263
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:29,860
I give up.

1264
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,130
(Se Chan gives up too.)

1265
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:33,020
Is this 5? Maybe it's 6.

1266
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,230
Seven?

1267
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,000
- I give up!
- It's seven.

1268
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,770
- Unbelievable.
- What's eight?

1269
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,860
What do I do?

1270
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,400
It's too hard.

1271
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,540
- What's the second question?
- Did anyone get it?

1272
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,830
(All of them move on
with the amount now cut in half.)

1273
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,670
- "I'm new to the world."
- "To the world."

1274
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,440
"I cry a lot."

1275
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,000
"Please give me milk."

1276
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,500
"Everyone smiles at me."

1277
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,020
- "Please give me milk."
- "Everyone smiles at me."

1278
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,520
- What now?
- I cry a lot.

1279
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,980
- It wants milk.
- I know what it is.

1280
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,750
- It's a baby.
- Here.

1281
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,580
I know what it is. It's a baby.

1282
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,020
A baby.

1283
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,190
(What am I? Answer: Baby)

1284
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,290
Could they not know this?

1285
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,420
(Answer the question in English.)

1286
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,600
(Thinking)

1287
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,130
"I'm new to the world."

1288
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,600
I don't know what this is.

1289
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,770
What do I do?

1290
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,270
It's too hard.

1291
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:19,130
Are you kidding me?

1292
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:22,400
(A cow?)

1293
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,940
(Incorrect. Try the next question.)

1294
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,310
Why? Just give me one more chance.

1295
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,310
- This...
- I don't know the answer.

1296
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,520
(The other Empty Head
has the same question.)

1297
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,110
- Please...
- Unbelievable.

1298
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,150
My son will see this, you know.

1299
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,080
(The spelling is based on
how the vowel sounds.)

1300
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,630
(Incorrect. Try the next question.)

1301
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,770
My son will see this, you know.

1302
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,690
How can one know this? Next!

1303
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,400
This is bad.

1304
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:52,580
(This consonant is written as giyok.
How do you write this next one?)

1305
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,330
(Thankfully, he doesn't hesitate...)

1306
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,110
(when it comes to a quiz
on the Korean alphabet.)

1307
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:57,770
(This consonant is written as giyok.
How do you write this next one?)

1308
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,520
(Incorrect: The answer is tieut.
You can no longer withdraw money.)

1309
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,190
This shouldn't air on TV!

1310
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:04,580
This can't air on TV!

1311
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:07,020
- I don't know the answer.
- This can't air on TV!

1312
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,730
(Only yelling resonates
around this gruesome scene.)

1313
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,150
Please!

1314
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,230
This is bad.

1315
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,900
- My son will see this, you know.
- This can't air on TV!

1316
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,190
- I don't know the answer.
- No!

1317
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:22,310
- Darn it.
- This is bad.

1318
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:24,400
My son will see this, you know.

1319
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,810
(He's desperate.)

1320
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,980
This can't air on TV!

1321
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,150
(This can't air on TV!)

1322
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,400
No!

1323
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,310
- Gosh.
- I feel for you.

1324
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,650
- You...
- Please head back inside.

1325
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:36,020
- Your son Dream...
- Oh, no.

1326
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:38,380
My son will see this.

1327
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,480
What do I do?

1328
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,080
I'll probably do the worst today.

1329
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,980
Come to think of it,
I get how this can be upsetting.

1330
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,230
Yong Jin, how did you do?

1331
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,250
Me?

1332
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:50,000
- Did you get any right?
- No.

1333
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,360
Gosh, Haha...

1334
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,630
- Unbelievable.
- You're an Empty Head too.

1335
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,400
He's an Empty Head.

1336
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,440
Darn it.

1337
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,330
- Let me see.
- I almost had it though.

1338
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,670
(The original Empty Head
comes back out empty-handed.)

1339
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,040
I couldn't guess any one of them.

1340
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,580
- You two...
- A cowboy?

1341
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,400
Did someone write "cow?"

1342
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,670
- Seriously?
- Was it you?

1343
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,020
What did you write as the answer?

1344
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,810
How do you spell "cow?"
With an A or an O?

1345
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,310
It's O. What did you write?

1346
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:10,520
Cow with an A.

1347
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,040
I thought it meant...

1348
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,420
that you were milking something
in a new world.

1349
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,210
- I thought it was milking too.
- Still...

1350
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,980
It's why I came up
with a part-time worker.

1351
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,360
This is super annoying.

1352
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,960
Are you kidding me?

1353
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,420
Milk? A baby?

1354
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:30,060
(Incorrect. Try the next question.)

1355
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,500
(Ji Hyo: 400 dollars to 200 dollars)

1356
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,170
"I cry a lot."

1357
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,440
"Please give me milk."

1358
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,940
Please give me milk, right?

1359
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,920
(Surprisingly enough,
he gets it right.)

1360
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,040
A baby.

1361
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,190
(That is correct.
50 dollars will be withdrawn.)

1362
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:48,380
I don't know what the answer is.

1363
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,560
(Haha: 50 dollars)

1364
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,920
(Haha manages to withdraw money
in just two questions.)

1365
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,420
- Still...
- Why?

1366
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,190
- You got the second question?
- He studied in Germany.

1367
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,860
- You answered "baby" correctly?
- Yes.

1368
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:00,790
- Wasn't that an easy one?
- I'm surprised.

1369
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,230
They thought of cows.

1370
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,900
- Cows?
- Because of the milk.

1371
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,040
I thought it was a cowboy.

1372
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:07,400
(Ji Hyo tries to answer
the last Korean alphabet question.)

1373
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,750
(Incorrect: You no longer have
a chance to withdraw the money.)

1374
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,850
Why is her hair all messed up?

1375
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:13,880
Did you not get any of them right?

1376
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,020
I got all of them wrong.

1377
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,440
A dog?

1378
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,920
What's the answer to that one?

1379
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,920
- You guys are killing me.
- A dog?

1380
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:23,480
Out of those that competed,
only Haha managed to win the money.

1381
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,830
Really?

1382
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,330
- You guys are hilarious.
- I thought it could be a baby too.

1383
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,020
This is why
you're on the smarter side.

1384
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,020
You really didn't know it?
Seriously?

1385
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,440
We're too ashamed
to look you in the eye.

1386
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,040
You two are unbelievable.

1387
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:36,540
Now that it's over,

1388
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,500
- you'll clean up and head to eat.
- Sure thing.

1389
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,670
- I'm sure you're all hungry.
- We are.

1390
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,480
Before you eat though,

1391
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,000
you'll play another game.

1392
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,350
You'll be playing
for instant cash...

1393
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:49,190
in this game of
Colorful Slurping Noodles.

1394
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,520
Slurping noodles?

1395
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,110
On the white t-shirt you'll wear...

1396
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,690
will be circles that indicate...

1397
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,520
the addition
or subtraction of points.

1398
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:59,190
Next, you'll have jjajangmyeon
with a blindfold on.

1399
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,400
As you slurp in the noodles,
try getting jjajangmyeon...

1400
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,020
in that area. We'll give you money
depending on the number of spots.

1401
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,060
That sounds fun.

1402
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,540
The more jjajangmyeon you get,
the more money you get.

1403
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,540
Four areas will get you 100 dollars,
and 2 areas will take your money.

1404
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,880
Your team members will draw
the areas to earn 100 dollars.

1405
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,610
The other team will draw the areas
where your money will be taken.

1406
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,270
Put on the blindfold
as you have jjajangmyeon.

1407
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,350
We'll combine the number of areas
where you got jjajangmyeon on...

1408
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:26,480
and give money to your team.

1409
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,810
That sounds fun.

1410
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,020
Who's going to eat it?

1411
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,920
We can't shake the noodles.
We need to slurp the noodles.

1412
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,980
You can't shake the noodles.

1413
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,560
Jae Suk is good
at slurping noodles.

1414
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,190
I'm good at getting food
on my shirt.

1415
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,270
Each team can pick an area
to write "double",

1416
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,290
and if you get jjajangmyeon in
that area, you'll get twice as much.

1417
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:44,210
- Okay.
- Who is going first?

1418
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:45,940
- Yong Jin will go first.
- I'll go.

1419
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,540
- Let's go!
- Let's go, Yong Jin!

1420
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:49,400
- Let's have So Min go first.
- Okay, she can go first.

1421
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,500
(So Min versus Yong Jin)

1422
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,380
When we were playing a game earlier,
these two were really annoying...

1423
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,610
during So Min's turn.

1424
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:55,920
- I guess we were a bit...
- You were really annoying.

1425
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,290
But it was fun to watch.

1426
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:58,290
We need to make fun of So Min.

1427
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:02,110
They teased her after a long time.
Last time, So Min shook with anger.

1428
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,460
I'll keep teasing you.

1429
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,520
You can't bear it, can you?

1430
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:08,020
We'll keep going.

1431
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,330
That tone though...

1432
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:10,630
How annoying!

1433
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:13,270
The thing about noodles...
The sauce gets on your shirt.

1434
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:14,270
Put on the blindfold.

1435
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:17,310
But the noodles are long,
so they hit your shirt too.

1436
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:18,560
They'd hit somewhere around here.

1437
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,170
- Over here. They'd hit the shirt.
- I think this area will get a lot.

1438
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:23,350
Hold on. The area under the mic.

1439
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:25,810
The noodles are short. If they
were long, then they'd hit here.

1440
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:27,670
They're short, so we should draw
an area around here.

1441
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,150
That's right. Let's leave no space
for the red circles.

1442
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,710
- Exactly.
- Draw them in the center.

1443
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:34,250
All right. If you're done,
hand the shirt to the other team.

1444
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,360
- Use the red marker...
- I think So Min won't drop it.

1445
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,650
You're so sneaky.

1446
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:39,250
There you go.

1447
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,360
(This will be counted as
minus 200 dollars.)

1448
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,830
The circles cannot overlap.

1449
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,360
Let's eat now.

1450
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,420
(Yong Jin of Team Senior
goes first.)

1451
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,770
You saw it, right? Keep your head up
and slurp the noodles.

1452
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,040
- All right!
- Slurp the noodles.

1453
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,500
I'll slurp the noodles.
Chinese food!

1454
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,500
That's the spirit!

1455
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,130
There you go.

1456
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:56,400
Okay.

1457
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,540
- That's great!
- Ready.

1458
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,810
- You should eat without thinking.
- They picked the good spots.

1459
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:00,810
They picked excellent spots.

1460
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:02,170
We'll win for sure.

1461
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:03,250
Let's go.

1462
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,310
(How will it turn out?)

1463
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:05,540
Let's go!

1464
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,420
- They need to be longer.
- That's not strong enough!

1465
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,360
- Come on.
- That's not strong enough!

1466
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,290
- You're eating it too neatly.
- Come on!

1467
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:15,730
Bring back the energy you had
when you were...

1468
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:17,060
on "People Looking for a Laugh".

1469
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,730
(As soon as he hears
"People Looking for a Laugh",)

1470
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,330
(he gets jjajangmyeon
on the 100-dollar area.)

1471
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:23,730
- This is like "Comedy Big League"!
- You're doing great!

1472
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:24,830
- That's great.
- Keep going!

1473
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:26,110
- We got one.
- Make the noodles long.

1474
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:27,170
- We got one.
- We got one.

1475
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:28,380
Eating the noodles is not important!

1476
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,610
- That's not good!
- Slurp more!

1477
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:30,900
- We got one.
- Hey!

1478
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,350
Eating the noodles is not important!

1479
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:34,150
- Just slurp the noodles.
- Slurp more!

1480
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:35,980
- That's good.
- There you go.

1481
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,080
- Come on, what's that?
- Shake them. That's it.

1482
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,210
- Shake them.
- Come on!

1483
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:40,750
- What are you doing?
- Yes!

1484
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:41,810
(He got it on minus 100 dollars.)

1485
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:42,980
- That's it.
- Shake them.

1486
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,060
Come on.

1487
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,060
- What are you doing?
- Yes!

1488
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,150
- Hey!
- No!

1489
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,060
Well done!

1490
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,130
- Gosh.
- Gosh, Yong Jin.

1491
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,330
Keep going!

1492
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,670
It's even.

1493
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,710
- This is...
- Shake the noodles!

1494
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,610
We drew the circles
in the wrong spots.

1495
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:02,750
There's so much on the red circles.

1496
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,110
All right!

1497
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,080
He got so much jjajangmyeon
on the red circles.

1498
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,480
We should've drawn one here.

1499
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,520
My gosh, he got so much
on the red circles.

1500
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,710
- What a mess.
- All right.

1501
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,110
He got it on only one red circle.

1502
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:15,830
- They got 2.
- He got 2 black circles.

1503
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:17,080
There's more on the right side.

1504
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,830
We got one on this circle.

1505
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:20,100
- Where?
- We'll get 100 dollars.

1506
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,150
(There's a tiny spot here.)

1507
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,770
- We'll get 100 dollars.
- Please take a look at it.

1508
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,190
- Be honest.
- Over here. Be honest.

1509
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,270
There's a spot here, right?

1510
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:26,440
(She wipes it off with her finger.)

1511
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,830
No, there's nothing here.

1512
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:29,000
- There's nothing.
- Don't erase it off!

1513
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,540
- Why would you erase it?
- There's nothing!

1514
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,500
You got 300 dollars
and 2 minus 100 dollars.

1515
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,830
- Yes.
- We'll give you 100 dollars.

1516
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:36,310
It's not bad.

1517
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:38,400
So Min is good at this kind of game.

1518
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,540
Let's see how well you slurp
the noodles.

1519
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:43,520
I'm not so good
at slurping the noodles,

1520
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,040
but I'm good at spilling food.

1521
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,360
I've been doing it for 36 years.

1522
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,560
She always spills food.
I'm not even kidding.

1523
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,330
I always spill food.

1524
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,080
(Will she be able to eat
in a messy way in front of them?)

1525
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,690
All right. Let's start.

1526
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,290
- You can do it.
- So Min, many people are watching.

1527
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:56,000
- All right!
- Let's do this.

1528
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,500
You need to sit up straight.

1529
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,630
- It's the first round.
- Ready.

1530
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:01,130
- Let's do it.
- Enjoy it little by little.

1531
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,290
(Team Senior drew their circles
on top.)

1532
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:03,610
(Slurping the noodles starts.)

1533
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:04,960
- Let's go!
- That's it.

1534
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,170
That's a lot of noodles.

1535
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,610
(She grabs a lot at once.)

1536
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:10,350
- Hurry up.
- Don't eat neatly!

1537
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:11,880
There you go.

1538
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,440
(She's at risk already.)

1539
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,770
There you go.

1540
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,710
(The seniors find it entertaining.)

1541
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:17,810
Slurp them.

1542
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,460
You're so cute
eating the noodles like that.

1543
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,230
That's it.

1544
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:26,290
(She tilts her head more
as they find her cute.)

1545
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,790
Who eats jjajangmyeon in braids?

1546
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,630
How can you eat it
while tilting your head?

1547
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,770
No, don't tilt it to that side.
Tilt it to the other side.

1548
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,540
- It's not even close.
- Hey.

1549
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,460
- It's not even close.
- Why are you lowering your head?

1550
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:39,330
Since when did you start
eating neatly?

1551
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,540
Make it messy!

1552
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:43,350
It's more difficult
than you thought, isn't it?

1553
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,500
No!

1554
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,750
(She gives up on using chopsticks.)

1555
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:48,980
- No, you can't use your hand.
- You can't use your hand.

1556
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,150
- Just eat it normally.
- Slurp them in.

1557
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:53,060
That's it.

1558
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,060
(Shaking)

1559
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,150
My gosh. You must be
on a blind date.

1560
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:57,420
It's too close to the red circles.

1561
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,420
Is there a guy
you want to look nice to?

1562
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:01,790
So Min...

1563
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,770
- There's a spot here.
- That was incredible.

1564
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:04,830
- There's one here.
- No, there's nothing.

1565
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,830
There's nothing.

1566
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:07,100
- It's not in that area.
- The noodles touched the area.

1567
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,360
- No, it's not in that area.
- It's not in that area.

1568
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,270
No. Look at this.
It's not in that area.

1569
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,770
- There's a spot in that area.
- It's not in the area.

1570
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:13,480
- It's not in the area.
- I swear, it's not in the area.

1571
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,670
Come take a look.

1572
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:15,730
Pick the next players.

1573
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:17,210
Ji Hyo will go next.

1574
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,770
I'll go next.

1575
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,580
- Let me see yours.
- It's risky to draw it there.

1576
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:22,880
- No, it's fine.
- Let me see yours.

1577
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,380
- It's risky to draw one here.
- Let's draw one here.

1578
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:28,420
Jae Suk is good
at slurping the noodles.

1579
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,790
Are Jae Suk's front teeth
crooked to the right side?

1580
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,860
Then we should draw a circle
on the right.

1581
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,060
- Yes, it's this side.
- It's under here.

1582
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,900
(They draw all their circles
on the right.)

1583
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,730
His teeth... Wait, they're crooked
to the left side!

1584
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:43,060
Suk Jin, they're crooked
to the left side.

1585
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:45,540
We should've drawn the circles
on the left.

1586
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:48,110
- It's okay. It doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter.

1587
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,650
With teeth like his,
we can draw circles on his shorts.

1588
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:52,040
Also...

1589
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,080
Can we draw them on your socks?

1590
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,310
Hey!

1591
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,440
I think it'll splatter to his socks.

1592
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,750
We're done drawing them.

1593
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,190
- We're done!
- Please exchange the shirts.

1594
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:00,210
(They're done marking
the 100-dollar area.)

1595
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,830
- Give it to me.
- You can mark...

1596
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:04,750
- Collect it.
- Here comes our ace.

1597
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,290
- Let's not cheat.
- All right.

1598
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:07,460
The master of slurping noodles.

1599
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:10,860
All right. He'll make use
of his crooked teeth.

1600
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,270
His favorite dish is jjajangmyeon.

1601
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:16,230
Can I draw a circle here?
I think it'll splatter up to here.

1602
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,770
What if it splatters up to here?

1603
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:18,860
The crooked teeth.

1604
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,830
- All right.
- You can do it!

1605
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,750
- Ready.
- You don't have to grab a lot.

1606
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:23,850
Of course.

1607
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,670
(The master looks relaxed.)

1608
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,610
- His shirt...
- Jjajangmyeon was delicious.

1609
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:29,290
All right. There you go. That's it!

1610
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:30,710
Yes!

1611
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:31,790
(What happened?)

1612
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:34,250
- There you go!
- There you go!

1613
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,310
(He already lost 300 dollars.)

1614
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:37,060
- Strike!
- All right!

1615
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:39,250
(He leaks lots of noodles
on the left side.)

1616
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,330
(It was the left side.)

1617
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,100
- What are you doing?
- That's it.

1618
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,770
- Make them longer.
- We knew his teeth were crooked.

1619
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:49,040
I told you the noodles
will sway to the left side.

1620
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,830
- The left side?
- His teeth are crooked.

1621
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:52,980
- I told you! It's the left side!
- It should've been the left side!

1622
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,170
You didn't know?

1623
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,440
The noodles follow
the shape of his teeth.

1624
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,650
(Fascinated)

1625
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,710
He got it. It's going great.

1626
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,040
- All right. Good job.
- Good job.

1627
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,310
- Good job!
- That's too much.

1628
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:02,690
He's just getting them on his shirt.

1629
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:04,290
Don't put the noodles on your shirt.

1630
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:05,810
He's incredible.
How is he eating it like that?

1631
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:07,150
He's being too obvious.

1632
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:08,790
- The noodles stopped there.
- I'm sorry,

1633
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:10,080
but isn't he done?

1634
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,730
How can he spill so well?

1635
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,130
He's...

1636
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:14,190
(He's excited after getting
jjajangmyeon all over his shirt.)

1637
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:16,290
Even my daughter doesn't spill
like he does.

1638
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:18,060
Five, four, three,

1639
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:19,560
- two,
- He's done with the noodles.

1640
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,730
- One.
- He finished the noodles.

1641
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:23,040
There aren't enough noodles.

1642
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,610
- There's more on the left side.
- He was like a two-year-old.

1643
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:26,610
Oh, it was here.

1644
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:27,630
You did well.

1645
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:28,900
It's a total mess.

1646
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,150
- You got some on the red ones.
- He got it on all circles.

1647
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:32,500
He got it on all four circles.

1648
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,250
You're getting 200 dollars.

1649
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,210
- Yes!
- Nice!

1650
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,690
- Well done.
- Nice.

1651
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:38,940
Keep going!

1652
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,880
- Could you...
- Lift your head! That's it!

1653
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,480
Could you give her
some pickled radish?

1654
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,560
You should shake your head.

1655
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,580
You shouldn't eat it like that.

1656
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,500
You're eating it too neatly!

1657
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,100
- Don't you know what slurping is?
- You're trying to avoid it.

1658
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,100
- She spat it out.
- That wasn't slurping.

1659
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,500
She got a spot on one circle.

1660
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,330
- You're getting 100 dollars.
- All right!

1661
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:56,830
You are tied.

1662
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,960
The team that picks
a longer noodle will win.

1663
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,040
- All right.
- Sounds good.

1664
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,540
We'll have Suk Jin pick it.

1665
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,540
Okay.

1666
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,540
- Then let's have So Min go.
- So Min, you should pick it.

1667
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:09,020
- No, Ji Hyo will go.
- So Min loses to him all the time.

1668
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,610
What do we get if we win?

1669
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:12,540
If you win, you'll get a chance
to withdraw 1,000 dollars.

1670
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,650
Look at Suk Jin.

1671
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,880
Let's do this.

1672
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,380
His name is so cute.

1673
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,520
- I'll destroy you.
- Sure.

1674
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,730
- Should I go first?
- Sure.

1675
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:21,000
What if it gets cut in the midway?

1676
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
- Then you're done.
- Then that will be it.

1677
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,270
I'll mix the noodles first.

1678
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:24,960
- Come on.
- No, just pick one right away.

1679
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,360
- You can't mix them.
- Once you mix them, you're done.

1680
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,400
Just grab one.

1681
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,060
- It's okay if it gets cut.
- He grabbed one.

1682
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,500
- That's it. Stay still.
- You're done.

1683
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,440
He grabbed one.

1684
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,770
- That's it. Stay still.
- You're done.

1685
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:34,830
(He grabbed the shortest noodle.)

1686
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:36,440
What's wrong with you?

1687
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,170
- What was that, Suk Jin?
- Ji Hyo, pick a good one.

1688
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,770
- Ji Hyo, get a good one.
- What was that?

1689
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,480
Why did you pick that?

1690
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,790
- What's wrong with this?
- He's done.

1691
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:45,350
- It got cut in the middle.
- All right!

1692
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:47,250
- All right!
- Yes!

1693
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,880
(Pulling it out)

1694
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,460
- We won.
- Suk Jin!

1695
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,980
- All right.
- What was that, Suk Jin?

1696
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,100
This was...

1697
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:54,920
- Ji Hyo is indeed amazing.
- This one is long though.

1698
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:56,500
Why did you pick that?

1699
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,360
- This is fun. She's good.
- How would I know?

1700
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:01,190
Thanks to Ji Hyo,
Team Junior takes the win.

1701
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,810
We need to withdraw
1,000 dollars this time.

1702
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:05,500
- Please pick one.
- All right. This is our chance.

1703
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:06,980
- We need to pick a good one.
- Who's going from our team?

1704
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,000
Us two.

1705
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,080
(Se Chan and Yong Jin
are withdrawing the money again.)

1706
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,400
- But...
- Trust us this time.

1707
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,670
- You can trust us.
- You can do it.

1708
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,250
- Trust us.
- Which one should I pick?

1709
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:14,440
(The two Empty Heads
are full of confidence.)

1710
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,480
You can pick one.

1711
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,020
We got 400 dollars and 700 dollars.

1712
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,250
(Team Junior got a chance to
withdraw 400 and 700 dollars.)

1713
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,960
- Good job.
- You guys are really good.

1714
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,020
- I got 400 dollars.
- Why are you guys so good?

1715
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:22,860
- I got 200 dollars.
- He got 200 dollars.

1716
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,060
(Team Senior can withdraw
400 and 200 dollars.)

1717
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,690
It's okay. Our team is going great.

1718
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:27,290
Ji Hyo, you never know.

1719
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:28,690
- You can do it.
- I can do it.

1720
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:30,020
Jae Suk, I'll go and play it.

1721
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,360
- Okay, let's go!
- Let's go!

1722
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,940
- Yong Jin.
- Okay. Don't worry.

1723
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,360
(Yang Se Chan, 400 dollars)

1724
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,400
Here I go.

1725
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,360
(He enters the bank
with headphones on.)

1726
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,710
(Lee Yong Jin, 200 dollars)

1727
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:43,710
(Jeon So Min, 400 dollars)

1728
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:44,940
Let's play this.

1729
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,270
Hello.

1730
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,170
(The first ATM quiz
that the Empty Heads will play)

1731
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:51,350
After removing one cue card,
you'll be given a question to solve.

1732
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:52,440
I can do this!

1733
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,520
All right!

1734
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,650
("Beautiful" and "Tomorrow"
are the words...)

1735
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:55,790
(that Americans misspell the most.)

1736
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:56,790
(Please write the correct spellings
of the two words.)

1737
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,560
- How can I...
- I have no idea!

1738
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,420
Not many people know
the correct spellings of these!

1739
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,690
I have no idea.

1740
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:06,400
I don't think any of the members
know the correct spellings.

1741
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,130
Oh, no.

1742
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:11,060
(Se Chan wrote down
his answer confidently.)

1743
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:13,440
(As expected, it's wrong.)

1744
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,830
This is so frustrating!

1745
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,080
(He lets out his anger at the ATM
out of embarrassment.)

1746
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,080
Let's see.

1747
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:20,170
This is so upsetting!

1748
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,750
(Yong Jin is really upset.)

1749
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:22,980
This is...

1750
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,110
It'd be faster to rob the bank
with a mask on!

1751
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:28,060
This is so upsetting.

1752
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:30,750
If they push me like this,
I won't comply.

1753
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,000
Do I have to write both?
Can I just guess one?

1754
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,230
(Incorrect. Try the next question.)

1755
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:35,830
- It's wrong, isn't it?
- I give up!

1756
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,900
(Ji Hyo is thinking carefully.)

1757
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:43,270
(We can see how hard
she's been thinking.)

1758
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:44,330
What could it be?

1759
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,770
There's an "I" in it.

1760
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,580
(She can't recall the spelling
of "beautiful".)

1761
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:52,150
This is really upsetting.

1762
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,750
(It's wrong.)

1763
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:56,980
I have no idea.

1764
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,210
I give up. I'll try this one.

1765
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:00,420
(So Min tries for an answer
after thinking hard.)

1766
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,230
Do I have to write both?
Can I just guess one?

1767
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,250
(Even So Min got it wrong.)

1768
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,860
- It's wrong, isn't it?
- I give up!

1769
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,460
- I don't want to do it.
- I don't think this will work.

1770
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:10,170
- I won't go for this next time.
- How come?

1771
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:11,690
- I have no idea.
- This is...

1772
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,900
(All of them failed to get
the correct answer.)

1773
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,730
Yong Jin, you don't look so good.

1774
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,130
I have an upset stomach
after having jjajangmyeon.

1775
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,130
(Current Amount of Team Money,
Team Senior, Team Junior)

1776
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,610
What is this?

1777
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,330
Isn't it something scary?

1778
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,580
It's something scary, isn't it?

1779
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,080
Is this "Let's Go, Dream Team"?

1780
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,380
The set itself is the highlight
of today.

1781
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,750
- They put a lot of effort into it.
- Right.

1782
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:31,690
I guess we need to push
the other and stand on top of that.

1783
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:33,650
- How do we play it?
- Let's say you're there.

1784
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:35,580
If someone approaches,
you should punch him...

1785
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,230
- and make him pass out.
- I can punch them?

1786
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,600
You know how comedians
are all talented.

1787
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,230
- That's right.
- So this time,

1788
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:43,900
we'll see how well
they can use their bodies.

1789
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,600
- I'm good at that.
- The last mission...

1790
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,960
is Let's Fly, Tarzan.

1791
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,560
We're flying?

1792
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,900
Each team will take turns
to attack and defend.

1793
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
The members of Team Defense can
stand on the column of their choice.

1794
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,480
If one of you falls
while trying to get on it,

1795
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,380
then he or she will be eliminated.

1796
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,480
After Team Defense
takes their places,

1797
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,650
the members of Team Offense will
take their places on the columns.

1798
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:05,710
The team that dominates
more columns wins.

1799
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,860
(The team that dominates
more columns wins.)

1800
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:09,080
Sir, I have a question.

1801
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,730
Can we get in the way of the member
who's flying by?

1802
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,000
- You can do that.
- Of course, that's what it's about.

1803
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,360
If you fall while trying to attack,
then you'll be eliminated.

1804
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,460
Even if we take a place
on the column, Jong Kook...

1805
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,770
- He'll attack us.
- "Hey!"

1806
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:19,790
(He'll turn this game
into a super-strength performance.)

1807
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,270
When the director confirmed
that we can kick our opponent,

1808
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:23,860
Jong Kook quietly nodded.

1809
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:24,860
(He nodded when the director
gave them his permission.)

1810
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,880
- He nodded. He's so scary.
- Team Defense...

1811
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,380
can push off the members
who attack them.

1812
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:31,380
I think we should jump off
with Jong Kook.

1813
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:33,710
So our balance and core muscles
are important in this game.

1814
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:34,980
- "Balance and core muscles"?
- "Balance"?

1815
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,150
- "Balance"?
- "Balance"?

1816
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:38,710
Do you know how you spell that?

1817
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:40,150
You keep... There's a "B", right?

1818
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:41,150
(There's a "B", right?)

1819
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:44,580
- There's an "A" too.
- You used up all your knowledge.

1820
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:45,860
I'm sure there's a spelling
of it on your shoes.

1821
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,960
It's on my shoes.

1822
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:47,960
Do you want to go for it?

1823
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,230
What do you say?

1824
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:50,360
You'll read it off your shoes?

1825
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,630
That's not allowed.

1826
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,440
- Bring it on.
- It's an open-book quiz.

1827
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,860
Bring it on.

1828
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,170
Let's fight.

1829
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:57,900
"Let's fight"?

1830
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,270
- I'm confident.
- I love fighting too.

1831
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,270
You'll play each round
attacking and defending.

1832
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:06,750
We'll give the team money
according to the number...

1833
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:07,940
of members that survived.

1834
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,650
Good. Let's do this.

1835
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:11,850
- Yes, let's do this.
- They have So Min and Ji Hyo.

1836
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:14,880
It's disadvantageous for us
since we have two women.

1837
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:17,380
- Let's do this.
- Let's play it.

1838
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,060
- Okay.
- I should grab somewhere higher.

1839
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,630
I should grab somewhere higher.

1840
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,670
- I'm ready.
- Go for it.

1841
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,670
- That was fast.
- But this is...

1842
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,400
It's hard to land on the column.

1843
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,730
- You'll do a run-up from behind?
- Right?

1844
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,270
I should grab around here?

1845
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,500
I got this.

1846
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,000
- We must go that far.
- Is this how it's done?

1847
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:40,080
For the female members,
you can step on the third line.

1848
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,250
- Over here?
- Yes.

1849
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:42,980
Okay.

1850
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,880
- Let me give it a try.
- Ji Hyo, try it from here.

1851
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,480
Ji Hyo, you should
stretch out your arms.

1852
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,830
Grab as high as you can.
There you go.

1853
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:51,880
You should swing just like this.

1854
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,020
Let's go. 1, 2...

1855
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,790
Hey. You brat.

1856
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:58,790
What are you doing?
You were supposed to jump from here.

1857
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:00,170
Why would you jump to this column?

1858
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:01,690
She's a true comedienne.

1859
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:02,860
- She's a comedienne indeed.
- That was funny.

1860
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,860
She fooled everyone.

1861
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,110
You fooled us, didn't you?

1862
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,540
So Min, you should grab over here.

1863
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:10,750
- Here?
- Then jump off from there.

1864
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,380
Ready, go. You should jump.

1865
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:13,650
- That won't work.
- That's it.

1866
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,880
Hey.

1867
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,610
(The frog fell just like that.)

1868
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:19,540
- You told me to grab there.
- So Min.

1869
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:22,690
So Min, how could you grab there
just because I told you to?

1870
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,060
(Senior Yang teases Junior Jeon.)

1871
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,150
Ji Hyo, try it again.

1872
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,250
- Suk Jin, give it a try.
- No, thanks.

1873
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,250
Why not?

1874
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:31,060
- Why would I?
- You should practice.

1875
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:33,060
- Why would I waste my strength?
- You should practice.

1876
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,770
- Why would I waste my strength?
- Let's do this!

1877
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:37,060
- Get ready.
- Team Defense will go first.

1878
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,630
Will you give it a try now?

1879
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,830
- Let's do it.
- He just did.

1880
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:43,880
- You did it?
- Yes.

1881
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,150
- You need to come here.
- I'll go there.

1882
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:47,170
Se Chan, you need to come here.

1883
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,420
We need to stay together.
Otherwise, Jong Kook will kick me.

1884
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:51,980
- They could fall together.
- Of course.

1885
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,040
I'll hold you.

1886
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,420
- You should hold me.
- Okay.

1887
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,150
Why am I getting nervous?

1888
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:59,130
- Let's go, JRS!
- JRS!

1889
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:01,520
- Just like a robot...
- Just like a robot...

1890
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,790
- and steel.
- Just like steel. Be strong.

1891
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,060
(He sets off
after getting encouraged.)

1892
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,540
There you go, Se Chan.

1893
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,440
- You need to grab me.
- I did.

1894
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:11,860
- I did grab you.
- My stomach muscle...

1895
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:12,900
almost got torn.

1896
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,880
- Nice. You got me.
- I got you.

1897
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,980
It's way better to be with someone
than to be alone.

1898
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,270
It's way better.

1899
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:20,380
We can't fight
against Jong Kook alone.

1900
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:23,380
I meant that it's better for me.
Since there are two of you...

1901
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,420
- Oh, you meant for you?
- Yes, it's better for me.

1902
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:27,690
(Taking aim at his target)

1903
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:29,880
Wait. We should land
on these two columns, right?

1904
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,560
- Or should I join you?
- No, go to the other one.

1905
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,960
- Tell me.
- Go to the other column.

1906
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,250
- We should defend.
- The crane wing strategy.

1907
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,600
But I think it'll be hard
to land on that column.

1908
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,270
- Just hurry up and jump.
- It looks hard.

1909
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:39,460
- How is it hard?
- It's easy!

1910
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,230
The rope is too straight.

1911
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:42,670
- Just jump already.
- It's okay.

1912
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:44,670
- They made it all doable.
- No, it's not prepared for it.

1913
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:45,860
- Yes, it is!
- Just go!

1914
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,730
- I said, it's difficult.
- If you decide that you can do it,

1915
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,810
then you can go.

1916
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:50,380
You should try it.
Try going to that column.

1917
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:51,440
- It's difficult.
- Should I go first?

1918
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,540
Or do you want me to go first?
Should I go to that one?

1919
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,480
- What's wrong with him?
- What are you doing?

1920
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,520
You told me to try it.

1921
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,480
- I told you it's easy to go there.
- This is driving me crazy.

1922
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,060
Hey, Yong Jin.

1923
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:03,250
- Is this your show or something?
- I'll go first.

1924
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:04,750
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1925
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:05,980
Landing there is difficult.

1926
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:07,860
- You need to be determined.
- Just go.

1927
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,560
You need to do a run-up from behind.

1928
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,060
- Go.
- There you go.

1929
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:12,360
- Nice.
- That's it.

1930
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,860
(He's in danger.)

1931
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:14,860
You need to go back.

1932
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:15,860
(You need to go back.)

1933
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,440
You need to go back.

1934
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:19,170
- My gosh.
- This isn't right.

1935
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,000
- Suk Jin is out.
- What's wrong with him?

1936
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,900
- This is driving me crazy!
- How annoying!

1937
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,810
- This is...
- Suk Jin!

1938
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:25,880
Suk Jin.

1939
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,520
I told you it's way easier
to land there.

1940
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,650
That's not true.

1941
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:29,880
It's easier to land there.

1942
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,750
- How is it easier to land here?
- I'm telling you, it's easier.

1943
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,580
If Jae Suk didn't grab me,
I'd have fallen.

1944
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,060
It'd be easy if someone grabs you.

1945
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,060
- Move out of the way.
- Can't I stand here?

1946
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:38,730
You're eliminated.

1947
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:39,960
(Suk Jin is separated from others.)

1948
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,150
Which one should I land on?

1949
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,750
- This one.
- Just pick one.

1950
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:45,730
I can defend against Ji Hyo
and So Min from there.

1951
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:46,940
That's a good idea.

1952
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,170
I think that'd be better.

1953
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:49,770
He looks like Tarzan.

1954
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,560
That's good. You're going to use
only one hand?

1955
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:54,500
- No, I'm getting prepared.
- You'll fall for sure.

1956
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,170
(If you jump off too hard,
you'll fall.)

1957
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,980
If you jump off too hard,
you'll fall.

1958
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,310
(Grunting)

1959
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:06,110
- What are you doing?
- Oh, gosh.

1960
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:08,580
(He flies in the air.)

1961
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,460
He hasn't fallen yet.

1962
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,960
(After taking a trip around,)

1963
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,130
(he falls.)

1964
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:15,150
What was that?

1965
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:16,360
Look at him.

1966
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,960
(This is the slapstick comedy
of a comedian.)

1967
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:21,460
- That was awesome.
- What was that?

1968
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:23,170
- He's good.
- He's good.

1969
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:24,560
- He's good.
- What was that?

1970
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,060
- Hey!
- He stepped on both.

1971
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:27,980
You practically traveled
all over the nation.

1972
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:30,170
- My gosh, you're good.
- It is difficult.

1973
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:31,500
- It's difficult.
- It's difficult.

1974
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,270
- I told you it's difficult.
- What was that?

1975
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:34,940
- This is difficult.
- How is this difficult?

1976
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,610
- Because the two of them...
- It's not easy!

1977
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:37,690
I'll go there next time then.

1978
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:38,710
It's difficult.

1979
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,580
- My gosh, that was terrible.
- It's Team Offense's turn.

1980
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,580
- You can go.
- It's not easy.

1981
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:43,460
- Try it. It's really not easy.
- If one person falls with them,

1982
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,360
and if one manages to land
on a column, we'll win.

1983
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,230
That's right.

1984
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:48,630
Is it okay if we move
to the other column?

1985
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:49,900
- Yes, you can.
- Then I'll go there.

1986
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,000
- Okay. Give it a try.
- Okay.

1987
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,500
I thought it'd be easy.

1988
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,000
(Se Chan moves to the other column
to avoid Jong Kook.)

1989
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:56,860
- What was that?
- I think I could go there too.

1990
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,960
I think you can just kick them.

1991
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,730
I'll fly and kick both of them.

1992
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:01,770
(I'll fly and kick both of them.)

1993
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:04,940
I'll kick both of them.

1994
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:07,210
I'll jump off from here,

1995
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,940
fly, and kick them.

1996
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:10,110
That'd be fun.

1997
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:11,480
It's like billiards.

1998
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,690
- Should I stay here?
- No, move to that column.

1999
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:14,480
You should shoot him
with a high speed camera.

2000
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,360
(Team Senior chose
the less dangerous option.)

2001
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,580
- Okay. I got this.
- He's pretty nimble.

2002
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:20,360
(We'll be done for
if we don't stop Jong Kook.)

2003
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,630
We'll be done for
if we don't stop Jong Kook.

2004
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,420
He looks so determined.

2005
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,600
Look at his face.

2006
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,960
(Roaring)

2007
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,170
I'd fall on my own if I were you.

2008
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:31,270
- I'm glad I'm on his team.
- Look how he's clenching his teeth.

2009
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,060
Here I go.

2010
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,730
(And these two need to stop him.)

2011
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,110
I should go back when he jumps off.

2012
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,170
(Roaring)

2013
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:40,770
(Here he comes!)

2014
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,850
(Kicking)

2015
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:48,960
There you go!

2016
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,060
(Killing two birds with one stone)

2017
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:54,150
(After destroying them,)

2018
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,060
(he relaxedly lands on a column.)

2019
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,500
(Impressed)

2020
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,770
(A cruel fairy tale,
"Protein Tarzan")

2021
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:02,170
He actually kicked us.

2022
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,730
He kicked us for real!

2023
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:05,110
What's wrong with that?

2024
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:06,560
- We won, right?
- Hey.

2025
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,500
He actually kicked
the inside of my thigh.

2026
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,500
- I mean...
- Team Junior won,

2027
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,270
but they can get more money
if more members get on the columns.

2028
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:14,670
- It hurts.
- He's right.

2029
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:16,440
He actually kicked us.

2030
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,210
I think it's better to go first.

2031
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:19,710
You actually kicked us?

2032
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,690
- Good job. All right.
- Good job!

2033
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:25,460
- I'll try it again.
- Our team is good at this.

2034
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:29,000
- Team Junior wins the first round.
- Yes!

2035
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,520
And you'll get the team money
for the three members who survived.

2036
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,600
- They'll start first, right?
- Yes, it's their turn.

2037
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:35,730
This time, Team Junior
will defend first.

2038
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:36,960
Should I go first or not?

2039
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:37,960
You should.

2040
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,670
We can definitely defend
against them.

2041
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:41,980
- Jong Kook is...
- Shall we start?

2042
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,650
I shouldn't join Jong Kook
on that column, should I?

2043
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,270
(I hope he falls!)

2044
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,610
I hope he falls!

2045
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:49,440
- There.
- That was smooth.

2046
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,520
How did he do that?

2047
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:52,850
I know. He must be really strong.

2048
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:53,860
(Ji Hyo goes next.)

2049
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:56,360
- I don't think stepping on it...
- There you go. Good job.

2050
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:57,860
- She is good.
- She is really good.

2051
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:58,920
Is it better to stand alone?

2052
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,360
- Of course.
- I can reach this far.

2053
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:01,520
- Okay.
- Okay. That's good.

2054
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,190
- Where do I go?
- Well...

2055
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,060
- As for you...
- Come here.

2056
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:06,290
Come here.

2057
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:07,540
I don't think
anyone would come here.

2058
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:08,630
Make space for me.

2059
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:09,690
I will make space for you.

2060
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:10,830
Be careful.

2061
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:12,440
Don't swing too hard.
You will bump into her.

2062
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:14,330
- Be careful.
- You don't need to swing hard.

2063
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,500
- Swing hard.
- There you go.

2064
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,000
- You don't need to swing hard.
- Swing hard.

2065
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,110
- There you go.
- Look at that.

2066
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:21,480
- There you go.
- Look at that.

2067
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,250
(Hanging)

2068
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,690
It's over.

2069
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:28,460
(At that moment)

2070
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:29,920
You need to get up there.

2071
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,190
- Grab him.
- There you go.

2072
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:32,360
(Got him.)

2073
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,060
There you go. Grab him.

2074
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,630
Grab him. There you go.

2075
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:36,830
- You did it.
- Good job.

2076
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,020
- Good job.
- So Min grabbed him.

2077
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:39,290
Thank goodness.

2078
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:40,860
(He managed to survive
thanks to So Min's help.)

2079
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:41,940
Hold on to me until the end.

2080
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,000
All right. Bring it on.

2081
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,500
(All right. Bring it on.)

2082
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,630
- Suk Jin.
- What?

2083
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:49,810
(It's time for Team Senior
to attack.)

2084
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:50,810
What's the strategy?

2085
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:51,880
You should go this way.

2086
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,580
I know that you will come this way.

2087
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:54,650
I can tell
from the direction of your body.

2088
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:55,810
I will hit your face.

2089
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:57,040
If you do that, I will kick you.

2090
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,520
- I will hit you for real.
- I will spit on you.

2091
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,790
- I will kick you.
- Suk Jin.

2092
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:02,610
I don't know about Haha and So Min
or Ji Hyo,

2093
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:04,750
but you should take off your glasses
if you are after Jong Kook.

2094
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:07,460
Are you serious?

2095
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,230
(He takes off his glasses.)

2096
01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:10,730
- Let's do this.
- The glasses are in the way.

2097
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,460
- Hey.
- Show us what you can do.

2098
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,940
I will knock him off.

2099
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,170
- Show us.
- Come on.

2100
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,170
I will knock him off.

2101
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:19,170
- Come on.
- Show us.

2102
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:20,810
(Determined)

2103
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:22,500
What was that?

2104
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:23,540
Crouch down.

2105
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:25,250
(Jae Suk shows
his mischievous side.)

2106
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:27,410
- What?
- We weren't ready.

2107
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:28,980
I jumped with determination.

2108
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:30,150
We weren't ready.

2109
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:31,540
- You startled me.
- We weren't ready.

2110
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:34,160
- Come to your senses.
- We weren't ready.

2111
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,450
In my opinion,

2112
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:37,190
you wouldn't have succeeded
with that shout.

2113
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:38,280
You should shout louder.

2114
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,360
- Okay.
- It wasn't loud enough.

2115
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,660
- We need to do well.
- Hit high notes.

2116
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:42,060
Let's go.

2117
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:43,920
I don't know where to go.

2118
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,960
(With Jae Suk's permission,
he gets ready to take off.)

2119
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,370
- I know you made up your mind.
- You are coming here.

2120
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:48,270
There you go. Is it a feint?

2121
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,910
(After a no-look pass,)

2122
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:52,370
(he gets thrown on the ground.)

2123
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:54,000
There you go. Is it a feint?

2124
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,350
(Suk Jin went down after a shout.)

2125
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:01,240
- Next.
- Next. Come on.

2126
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:03,690
I grabbed the rope too low.

2127
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:06,040
- The first jump was good.
- If you jump from here...

2128
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:08,250
That's too bad.

2129
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:09,520
Will he come here?

2130
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,320
He will use his elbows to jump high.

2131
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:12,880
There you go.

2132
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:14,160
He will use his elbows to jump high.

2133
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,320
There you go.

2134
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,370
- Go backward.
- The trajectory is scary.

2135
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:18,990
The trajectory is scary.

2136
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:21,240
- He will come here.
- That's good.

2137
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,630
- It's like a dance.
- Jump.

2138
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,240
- How scary!
- Here I go.

2139
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:27,780
Haha is scared already.

2140
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:30,980
There you go!

2141
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,110
(Strike)

2142
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:35,780
There you go!

2143
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,150
(He lands on the column
after taking out both of them.)

2144
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,620
- Nice!
- Nice.

2145
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,280
Good job.

2146
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,880
- One shot, two kills.
- Nice.

2147
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,080
Doing a run-up helped.

2148
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,620
- Okay.
- Good job.

2149
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:48,730
- They took one column.
- Good job.

2150
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:51,120
Se Chan's body was like a rock.

2151
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:52,990
I think Yong Jin will come to me.

2152
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,570
Here I go.

2153
01:09:55,570 --> 01:09:57,370
Are you aiming for Ji Hyo?

2154
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,570
- Let's turn the tables.
- Of course.

2155
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:02,280
Let's show the seniors' spirit.

2156
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,810
(The seniors will teach you
a lesson.)

2157
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:04,950
Spirit.

2158
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:12,350
(I fooled you, didn't I?)

2159
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:14,120
What was that?

2160
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,910
- Why are you so nervous?
- Good job.

2161
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:17,780
- Why are you so nervous?
- That's...

2162
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,420
- I can't believe him.
- For goodness' sake.

2163
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,290
- She became nervous.
- You are so mean.

2164
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:22,730
You were sweating, weren't you?

2165
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:23,870
Yes, you probably did.

2166
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:24,870
I just did this.

2167
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:26,100
Why did you become nervous?

2168
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,700
- I didn't see that coming.
- Okay. I got it.

2169
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:31,440
- He is so pretentious.
- I know.

2170
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,610
- Here I go.
- It will be a hit...

2171
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:34,700
if you go to Jong Kook.

2172
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,480
- It will look cool.
- No. Don't even think about it.

2173
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,110
- Bring it on.
- Don't go.

2174
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:39,740
- Bring it on.
- Go.

2175
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,780
- Go.
- There you go.

2176
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:41,980
Gosh.

2177
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:43,690
- Go.
- There you go.

2178
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,210
(He missed,
but Ji Hyo fell off the column.)

2179
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:46,350
That's good.

2180
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,160
- That's good.
- Nice.

2181
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,360
- I did it.
- Why did you fall off?

2182
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,250
I fell off in my attempt
to grab him.

2183
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:52,950
I did it.

2184
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:55,450
- We will win.
- You just need to go up there.

2185
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,200
You should have stood still.

2186
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:59,490
But Jong Kook could come here.

2187
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:01,530
If Jong Kook moves to that column,

2188
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:02,740
I will move to this column.

2189
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:03,960
- That works.
- Yes.

2190
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:05,960
Will you move here?

2191
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,130
(Will you move here?)

2192
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,450
You motivated Jong Kook.

2193
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:12,110
- Jong Kook will jump over.
- I know.

2194
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:13,950
- Jong Kook will jump over.
- Then I will move to that column.

2195
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:15,410
- Don't worry.
- That's right. Okay.

2196
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:18,080
- Will that work?
- He might think about going back,

2197
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,080
so you need to decide wisely.

2198
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,360
Why are you strategizing
when he can hear everything?

2199
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:22,950
- What's the meaning of this?
- Hey.

2200
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,190
He didn't hear anything.

2201
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:25,280
It's an unspoken rule.

2202
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,280
- That's how it works.
- We don't hear these things.

2203
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,450
- He didn't hear anything.
- That's right.

2204
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,900
- He didn't hear anything.
- He doesn't understand.

2205
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,060
He doesn't know our strategy.

2206
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:31,270
Really? Is that how it works?

2207
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:33,070
Think of it as a monologue.

2208
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:34,160
- I see.
- Think of it as a monologue.

2209
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,830
- He didn't hear anything.
- A monologue.

2210
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:37,160
- That's right.
- I didn't hear anything either.

2211
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,500
- It's an unspoken promise.
- I see.

2212
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:39,960
- I had no idea.
- Really?

2213
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:43,410
You could get kicked when I jump.
Be careful.

2214
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:46,910
You need to go up there.

2215
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:47,910
If I do that,

2216
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:49,320
Jong Kook will push me off.

2217
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,820
- Then I will take his column.
- You are right.

2218
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:51,950
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

2219
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:53,120
(What will be his decision?)

2220
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,320
- There he goes.
- All right.

2221
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:56,020
- There he goes.
- All right.

2222
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,060
Good job.

2223
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:58,230
Hold on.

2224
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:00,360
(Jong Kook doesn't fall off
despite staggering.)

2225
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:03,620
- Out.
- What was that?

2226
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:05,070
What was that?

2227
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:08,100
(Jae Suk attacked Se Chan
instead of Jong Kook.)

2228
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,940
What was that?

2229
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:11,500
What was that?

2230
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:12,910
- I mean...
- What was that?

2231
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:14,030
He is out.

2232
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,480
I will say...

2233
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:17,850
one member from each team survived.

2234
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:19,350
Round Three will determine
the winning team.

2235
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:20,780
Okay.

2236
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:21,950
(Round 3 will determine
the winning team.)

2237
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:24,910
- For goodness' sake.
- In Round Three,

2238
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:26,910
two members from each team
will attack and defend alternately.

2239
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:28,060
- Okay.
- What do you mean?

2240
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:29,160
Oh, two members at a time.

2241
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:32,060
Team Senior,
do you want to go first?

2242
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:33,280
Shall we go first?

2243
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,450
- Let's go later.
- Okay.

2244
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:35,790
- Have them go first.
- Go ahead.

2245
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:36,920
- Are we going first?
- Yes.

2246
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,230
Two members at a time.

2247
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,490
Her helmet broke.

2248
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:41,940
- Use this one.
- That won't do.

2249
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:42,960
Use this one.

2250
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:45,370
- How about you?
- It's okay.

2251
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:47,200
- How about you?
- It's okay, you punk.

2252
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:49,480
You could get hurt.

2253
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,310
No one will know if you keep quiet.

2254
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:52,310
(They suddenly begin
a melodramatic skit.)

2255
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:53,370
In the end...

2256
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:54,820
Give me a break.

2257
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,650
(Their terrible acting
would have offended the audience.)

2258
01:12:57,650 --> 01:12:59,210
Yong Jin is laughing
because he is incredulous.

2259
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:01,560
That was a ridiculous skit.

2260
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:03,360
We can't hear that line.

2261
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,120
- Did you hear something?
- We can't hear that line.

2262
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:06,820
- Jong Kook will begin.
- Here I go.

2263
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:08,120
Come on.

2264
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,770
That's nothing for him.

2265
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:12,790
- How does he do that?
- The next person.

2266
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:15,740
Face outward and swing.

2267
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:16,940
Face outward. There you go.

2268
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:18,630
Okay. She did it.

2269
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:19,960
- She doesn't make a mistake.
- She is good.

2270
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:22,170
Who will attack?

2271
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:23,700
- Suk Jin and I will go first.
- Okay.

2272
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:24,850
- Go first.
- Yes.

2273
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:26,000
- We will go first.
- Yes.

2274
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,020
Go first and give me a hand.

2275
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:29,450
You should be able to take
that column.

2276
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:31,120
I think will hate myself
if I don't succeed.

2277
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,210
- Of course.
- Go ahead.

2278
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:34,380
- Yong Jin, you can do it.
- Jump from here.

2279
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:35,560
Okay.

2280
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:36,780
- Good job.
- Had I failed,

2281
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:39,190
- I would have hated myself.
- It's the easy one.

2282
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,420
Suk Jin, will you come here?

2283
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:41,620
No. I will attack her.

2284
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:44,370
- He declared war.
- Lower your body.

2285
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:45,990
Lower your body.

2286
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:47,240
I will attack her and go to you.

2287
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,490
- I will grab you.
- Okay.

2288
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,070
- Okay.
- You should kick him then.

2289
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:51,570
I will grab him on his way.

2290
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:52,630
(I will grab him on his way.)

2291
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:55,030
I am sorry, Ji Hyo.

2292
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:56,630
Come on.

2293
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,370
Come on.

2294
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:01,710
Okay.

2295
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:03,850
- I got you.
- Okay.

2296
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:05,740
I got you.

2297
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:07,190
I got you.

2298
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:08,860
(He fails to make anyone fall off.)

2299
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:10,360
Stay still.

2300
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:11,450
Okay.

2301
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:12,690
Don't get excited.

2302
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:15,790
(A senior from Term 2 gets help
from a junior.)

2303
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:17,600
I couldn't kick her
because I was too softhearted.

2304
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:19,620
- I was too softhearted.
- Softhearted?

2305
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:21,240
You kicked me here.

2306
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:24,030
You should have gone straight
to that column.

2307
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,610
Why did you take a detour?

2308
01:14:26,610 --> 01:14:28,110
- I kicked her.
- You took a detour.

2309
01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:29,200
Yong Jin and Suk Jin,

2310
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,870
- defend the column.
- Okay.

2311
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:31,910
We need to defend the column.

2312
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:33,980
So Min, just kick them.

2313
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,570
It's hard to find a balance
when there are two people.

2314
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:38,020
- Super So Min.
- Get eliminated with them.

2315
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,120
Get eliminated with them.

2316
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,150
You can't kick me, right?

2317
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:41,560
- He is so annoying.
- You can't come here, right?

2318
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,620
You can kick them, right?

2319
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:44,530
- No way.
- Kick Suk Jin.

2320
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:45,690
Just kick Suk Jin.

2321
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,920
- Come on.
- Dodge.

2322
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,460
(He touches her nose.)

2323
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,530
- Okay.
- He touched her face.

2324
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,500
(He cheated
in the speed of lightning.)

2325
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,660
There you go.

2326
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,270
I can't believe it.

2327
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:01,570
You are useless.

2328
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:03,500
Did you see that? I don't know who,

2329
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:06,310
but someone hit my nose like this.

2330
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:07,520
Who did it?

2331
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,320
- Who did it?
- Good job. Nice defense.

2332
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,950
- Who did it?
- I am sorry.

2333
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:12,580
I am sorry.

2334
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,120
Who did it?

2335
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:15,860
(Manages to get 1 win
by playing dirty)

2336
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:17,360
- So Min, I am sorry.
- How could you play so dirty?

2337
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,560
Who else would it be?

2338
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,580
That was so dirty.

2339
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:21,290
- It has to be Suk Jin.
- How could you play so dirty?

2340
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:22,750
It has to be Suk Jin.

2341
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:25,490
I am so upset.
I couldn't even solve the quiz.

2342
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:28,130
I will take both of them out.

2343
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,740
Okay. You can do it.

2344
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:31,630
- You can do it.
- I have no mercy.

2345
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:32,770
You will succeed.

2346
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:33,910
You will get hurt.

2347
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:35,570
Gosh, Haha.

2348
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,540
He will attack hard.

2349
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,200
He will attack hard.

2350
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:40,740
That's...

2351
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:41,870
(Kicking)

2352
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:45,710
(He succeeded in taking them
both out.)

2353
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:48,820
Help him.

2354
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,880
- You got it. Okay.
- There you go.

2355
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,530
- Your feet are on the column.
- You can do it.

2356
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:54,250
- Haha.
- You can do it.

2357
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,400
- Haha.
- Dream is watching.

2358
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,450
- You can do it.
- No.

2359
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:57,700
You can do it. Dream is watching.

2360
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:00,030
- No.
- You can do it. Dream is watching.

2361
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,240
- Haha.
- You can do it.

2362
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:02,330
- Okay.
- Ha Dream!

2363
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,570
- You can do it. Okay.
- Ha Dream!

2364
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:06,330
(Dream, I did it.)

2365
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:07,500
- Ha Dream.
- He succeeded.

2366
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:08,830
Ha Dream.

2367
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:10,370
(He succeeded with love
for his son.)

2368
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:13,170
He kicked without any mercy.

2369
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,170
Haha, just hug the person...

2370
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:18,040
who tries to take your column, okay?

2371
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,410
I should go this way.

2372
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,190
What will you do? What's your plan?

2373
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:23,820
- I will kick Haha.
- Haha?

2374
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,360
Would it be okay to go this way?

2375
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:27,620
Jong Kook might get you
if you go this way.

2376
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:28,820
It will be better to go this way.

2377
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:29,920
- Everyone can hear...
- Gosh.

2378
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,370
Everyone can hear the strategy.

2379
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:32,960
Did you hear something?

2380
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,240
Everyone can hear the strategy.

2381
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,830
- Even the microphones picked it up.
- I didn't hear anything.

2382
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:36,960
- Really?
- I didn't hear anything.

2383
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,410
- Get Haha.
- Okay.

2384
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:40,070
- I will get Ji Hyo.
- Okay.

2385
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:42,530
Don't let him go to another column.

2386
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:44,350
It should end at your column.

2387
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,240
If he comes this way,
I will hit him like this.

2388
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,370
I learned kickboxing.
You never know what will happen.

2389
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:50,280
Hang on to him.

2390
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,040
(They need to beat
Team Senior no matter what.)

2391
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,210
Hang on to him.

2392
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:55,060
- That's...
- Good job.

2393
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:56,450
That's...

2394
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,060
- Good job. Nice.
- He did it.

2395
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:59,490
- Nice.
- That's good. Get up there.

2396
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,360
(He needs to get up
on the column now!)

2397
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,030
- You got it. There you go.
- Get up there.

2398
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:04,460
- Nice.
- That's good. Get up there.

2399
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:05,900
- You got it.
- Get up there.

2400
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,700
There you go.

2401
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,490
There you go.

2402
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:10,490
(He lands on his back.)

2403
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:12,500
- Hold on.
- You did it.

2404
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,570
- Jae Suk did it.
- I told you to hold on to him.

2405
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:15,830
All right.

2406
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:17,780
- I got scared.
- I told you to hold on to him.

2407
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,650
- Se Chan.
- I will kick.

2408
01:17:19,650 --> 01:17:20,950
You need to eliminate Ji Hyo.

2409
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:22,870
- Don't become soft.
- Guard yourself like this.

2410
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:24,350
Looking into her eyes
makes you soft.

2411
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:25,850
- That doesn't apply to me.
- Don't look into her eyes.

2412
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,080
- Be careful.
- Don't look into her eyes.

2413
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,990
- Don't get hurt.
- Don't get hurt.

2414
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:30,750
You need to aim for the edge.

2415
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,380
- Should I run up like this?
- Yes.

2416
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:34,450
- No.
- Start from here.

2417
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:35,530
- Se Chan.
- Here.

2418
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:38,530
Don't listen to Suk Jin.
He never succeeded.

2419
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:41,370
- No. Start from here.
- Go with your gut feeling.

2420
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:44,460
- Here.
- Fall off the column with him.

2421
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:46,370
- Go.
- This is hard.

2422
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,810
- I need to go that far.
- Go.

2423
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:49,700
If you push Ji Hyo off
and take the column, we win.

2424
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:50,740
I know.

2425
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:54,240
Judging from how nervous he is,
I think he will come to me.

2426
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,210
What? Are you nervous?

2427
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:57,540
- No, not at all.
- Go.

2428
01:17:57,650 --> 01:17:59,650
I hate those pink shorts.

2429
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,080
He looks too strong.

2430
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:03,560
Here I go.

2431
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,110
Good. Okay.

2432
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,260
- Slowly.
- Okay.

2433
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:20,330
- There you go.
- Grab him.

2434
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:21,670
- Slowly.
- Okay.

2435
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:25,950
- There you go.
- Grab him.

2436
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:28,670
(Se Chan must take the column
to bring victory to Team Senior.)

2437
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:31,620
(Team Senior's fate
depends on Se Chan.)

2438
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:32,840
There you go.

2439
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:34,210
Hold on.

2440
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:36,920
Come on.

2441
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:39,720
We did it.

2442
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,390
You took out Se Chan.

2443
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:42,720
Okay. You did it.

2444
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,570
- I couldn't balance myself.
- It was like a cartoon.

2445
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,590
You were like Tom
from "Tom and Jerry".

2446
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:49,170
Okay. That was good.

2447
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:50,570
Team Junior won.

2448
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:51,870
(Team Junior won.)

2449
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:53,300
We came close.

2450
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,880
I know. We would have won
had Se Chan taken the column.

2451
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:56,880
Seriously.

2452
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,210
We did it.

2453
01:18:58,210 --> 01:19:00,300
- Okay.
- All right. We lose all the time.

2454
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,420
- We came close.
- You came close.

2455
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:06,120
You will receive 50 dollars
per surviving member.

2456
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,790
So Team Senior gets 100 dollars
and Team Junior gets 250 dollars.

2457
01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:10,920
We did well.

2458
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,180
We need to multiply the money.

2459
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:13,720
That's right. We need to do well.

2460
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,860
We need to multiply the money.

2461
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:17,130
- Can we turn the tables?
- We need to choose well.

2462
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:18,170
If you choose well...

2463
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:19,390
- and get the quiz right...
- Get it right at once.

2464
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:23,290
If I combine the money
you have just earned,

2465
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:26,000
Team Senior has 945 dollars.

2466
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,540
- How much?
- 945 dollars.

2467
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:28,910
- That isn't much.
- How about us?

2468
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:31,450
Team Junior has 1,535 dollars.

2469
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:33,500
- That's good.
- That's good.

2470
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:36,010
- Let's choose well.
- If you get the remaining amount,

2471
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:37,990
there is a high chance
you will avoid the penalty.

2472
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:39,450
That's good. Let's choose well.

2473
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:41,290
The 2 of us need to get
over 1,000 dollars.

2474
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:42,460
Let's choose well.

2475
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,010
- How about 1,100 dollars?
- That works.

2476
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:45,790
- Get 600 and 700 dollars.
- Let's get 1,100 dollars.

2477
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:46,920
(Team Senior needs 1,055 dollars.)

2478
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,330
Why don't we choose the one
in the middle?

2479
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:52,870
I did that before,
but the amount was small.

2480
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:54,430
- Like 100 dollars.
- All right.

2481
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:55,870
- Please pick one.
- Then the quiz...

2482
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:57,260
The one who picked the card
solves the quiz?

2483
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:58,300
The ones who didn't pick earlier.

2484
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,710
- Jong Kook and me.
- Then we have a chance.

2485
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:02,240
We are good too.

2486
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,580
Let's go.

2487
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:04,640
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2488
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,380
(Team Senior with 945 dollars
goes first.)

2489
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:07,750
- I will pick this one.
- Okay.

2490
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,780
(Team Senior must get
as much money as possible.)

2491
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:11,340
- The number of cases...
- We need a big amount.

2492
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,990
We need a big amount
like 700 dollars.

2493
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:15,250
The other one should be
400 or 500 dollars.

2494
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:17,380
We did it.

2495
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:18,580
- We did it.
- 700 dollars.

2496
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:19,660
All right. 700 dollars.

2497
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:21,200
(Jae Suk got 700 dollars.)

2498
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,700
And I got 400 dollars.
That's 1,100 dollars.

2499
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:25,570
- That's 1,100 dollars.
- How did this happen?

2500
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:27,170
You need to get the quiz right
in one go.

2501
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:28,390
Get it right in one go.

2502
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:30,630
Do we have a chance?
Can we still win?

2503
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:32,300
Did they get 700 and 400 dollars?

2504
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:33,800
Pick one without thinking.

2505
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,470
Don't think.

2506
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,910
You and I didn't succeed once.

2507
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:38,080
Don't think.

2508
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:40,800
- This is good.
- The top ones have more amount.

2509
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,210
Okay. I got 600 dollars.

2510
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:43,470
- You are set.
- That's good.

2511
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:44,540
Please.

2512
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:46,040
- What is it?
- Please let it be 1,000 dollars.

2513
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,660
- Please let it be 1,000 dollars.
- I got 400 dollars.

2514
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:49,660
- Did you get 1,000 dollars?
- 600 and 400 dollars. So yes.

2515
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:51,180
- You got 1,000 dollars.
- 1,000 dollars. That's good.

2516
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:54,180
The four members will go now.

2517
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:55,250
Okay.

2518
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:56,700
We need to get
the first question right.

2519
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,000
We will get
the first question right.

2520
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,070
Let's get the second question right
at the very least.

2521
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:02,890
All right. Let's go.

2522
01:21:03,890 --> 01:21:05,430
I need to get it right in one go.

2523
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:06,630
(With 1,050 dollars remaining,)

2524
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:07,800
Let's go.

2525
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:08,910
(Team Senior must get
the question right in one go.)

2526
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:09,970
Please.

2527
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:11,610
Please.

2528
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:14,640
(Team Junior could meet the goal
if they don't retry many times.)

2529
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:18,380
(Haha, Jong Kook,
Suk Jin, and Jae Suk)

2530
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,140
Please.

2531
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:22,680
(Write the meaning
of the Chinese characters.)

2532
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,920
(1. Yong Jin saw "Blank" Kwang Soo
and became "Blank" surprised.)

2533
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,790
(Being good with Chinese letters,
Jae Suk writes the answers fast.)

2534
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:34,220
(2. The "Blank" trend is
to increase the number of "Blank".)

2535
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:37,570
(Thinking)

2536
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:40,460
(Sighing)

2537
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:41,540
Thankfully, I know these.

2538
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,130
(Does Haha know
these Chinese characters?)

2539
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:46,470
Let's take a look.

2540
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:48,950
Yong Jin saw lanky Kwang Soo...

2541
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:51,340
This character is "Kim".

2542
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,140
"Kim".

2543
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:55,080
Isn't it "Won"?

2544
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,380
"Wongeum"?

2545
01:21:56,490 --> 01:21:58,030
No way.

2546
01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:01,050
What did you figure out so far?

2547
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:02,360
- "Geum" and "Sae".
- What?

2548
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,590
"Kim" and "Geum".

2549
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:04,720
What are the words?

2550
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:05,960
Yong Jin.

2551
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:08,760
- Yong Jin saw "Blank" Kwang Soo...
- Kwang Soo.

2552
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:12,070
- It can't be "Handsome Kwang Soo".
- No way.

2553
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:13,910
- Okay. I know the answer.
- What is it?

2554
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:16,670
Yong Jin saw Mickey Kwang Soo...

2555
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:19,470
(He brings up Mickey Kwang Soo.)

2556
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:20,500
Is it incorrect?

2557
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,340
- "Mickey"?
- Is it incorrect?

2558
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:24,120
Isn't it "Mickey Kwang Soo"?

2559
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:26,290
Isn't it "Mickey Kwang Soo"?

2560
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:27,820
(The four Empty Heads
can't figure out one character.)

2561
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:31,080
(These four members are solving
the same question.)

2562
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,330
(1. Tall, totally
2. Global, holidays)

2563
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:34,220
(Jae Suk holds up his answer!)?

2564
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:35,330
(Write the meaning
of the Chinese characters.)

2565
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:38,500
(Tall, totally, global, holidays)

2566
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:41,170
(Correct.
You will receive 700 dollars.)

2567
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:43,830
(He succeeds in withdrawing
700 dollars.)

2568
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:45,960
I did it.

2569
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,260
(Jae Suk gets the question right
and obtains 700 dollars!)

2570
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:48,380
I did it.

2571
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,040
(What remains is
Suk Jin and his 400 dollars.)

2572
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:52,610
(If he gets it right,
Team Senior will avoid the penalty!)

2573
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:54,140
I need to get it right in one go.

2574
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:56,580
(Suk Jin, 400 dollars)

2575
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:59,790
(He knows many Chinese characters.
How will he do?)

2576
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,210
All right.

2577
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:03,550
(Suk Jin is correct!)

2578
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,330
(He succeeds in withdrawing
400 dollars.)

2579
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:06,460
Okay.

2580
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:10,920
(Team Senior succeeded in
withdrawing 1,100 dollars.)

2581
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,420
- We did it.
- We did it.

2582
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:14,000
What was the second blank?

2583
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,460
- Totally.
- Totally.

2584
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:18,300
- Really? Oh, it was "Totally".
- "Global" and "Holidays".

2585
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:19,910
Global.

2586
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:21,880
Then we have 2,000 dollars.

2587
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,380
We did it. We have 2,000 dollars.

2588
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:26,470
We did it.

2589
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:29,380
(Team Junior remains.)

2590
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:33,320
(With the 1st try, he has a chance
to withdraw 400 dollars.)

2591
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,490
(Jong Kook, 400 dollars)

2592
01:23:34,490 --> 01:23:36,790
(Jong Kook is correct.)

2593
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:37,830
All right.

2594
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:38,860
(He succeeds in acquiring
400 dollars.)

2595
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:40,360
- Jong Kook, are you done?
- Yes.

2596
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:43,390
(Only Haha remains.)

2597
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:45,260
(Haha, 600 dollars)

2598
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,130
(Haha writes something down.)

2599
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:48,460
I got this.

2600
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,870
(1. Crazy, utterly
2. Economical, chores)

2601
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,540
(He becomes the only one
to fail Level 1.)

2602
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:56,930
(Haha, 600 dollars)

2603
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:59,080
(He shouts
because he is embarrassed.)

2604
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,450
(Haha's lonely fight begins
in a shabby way.)

2605
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:03,420
What's the last blank
if it isn't "Chores"?

2606
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:09,360
Haha's answers were
"Crazy", "Utterly"...

2607
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,680
Let's see.

2608
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:14,750
Yong Jin saw crazy Kwang Soo
and became utterly surprised.

2609
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:18,570
The economical trend is to increase
the number of chores.

2610
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:21,000
- Did you get the first one right?
- Of course.

2611
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,740
- You got the first one right.
- I did it right away.

2612
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:25,910
Team Senior succeeded
with 2,045 dollars.

2613
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:27,740
How much did you get just now?

2614
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:28,910
- I got 400 dollars.
- Four hundred dollars.

2615
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:30,740
(Team Junior needs 465 dollars.)

2616
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:34,000
Then Haha needs
to get a question right.

2617
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,140
Seriously.

2618
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:36,210
(Haha needs to get
a question right!)

2619
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:37,920
That's the problem.

2620
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,620
- I don't know if he will succeed.
- Seriously.

2621
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:43,490
(Haha gets the second question.)

2622
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:44,490
(Haha, 300 dollars)

2623
01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:48,750
(Will he be able to solve
the second question?)

2624
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:52,920
Hold on. He started
with 600 dollars, right?

2625
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,200
He just needs to get
one question right.

2626
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,740
(Getting the 3rd question right
will give him 150 dollars.)

2627
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:57,070
If he gets one question right...

2628
01:24:58,070 --> 01:25:00,170
Let's get the second question right
at the very least.

2629
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:03,080
(His hands move hurriedly,
but the end is nowhere in sight.)

2630
01:25:03,410 --> 01:25:07,000
If Haha failed, Team Junior
will receive the penalty.

2631
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,340
Jong Kook, did you get it right?

2632
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:10,540
(Haha returns!)

2633
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:12,420
Did Haha get a question right?

2634
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:14,490
(What's the meaning of his smile?)

2635
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:15,920
I think he got it wrong.

2636
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,490
What's the current situation?

2637
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:20,180
- Say you got a question right.
- If you got a question right,

2638
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:22,390
both teams have 2,000 dollars.
But if you failed,

2639
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:24,000
one member will receive the penalty.

2640
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:26,390
- I am sure he succeeded.
- We suddenly got...

2641
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:29,390
university-level questions.

2642
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:31,330
University-level, my foot!

2643
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:34,040
Please tell us
if you got a question right.

2644
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,610
(Haha has been building up
a smart image recently.)

2645
01:25:35,610 --> 01:25:37,240
I think he got it wrong.

2646
01:25:37,950 --> 01:25:39,580
You are our hope.

2647
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:40,800
(It's a big opportunity for him.)

2648
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:42,950
- I got it right.
- Which one?

2649
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:45,290
(Haha got a question right!)

2650
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:46,340
- The second one?
- That's good.

2651
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:48,490
- I am a YouTuber.
- That's right.

2652
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:50,210
I am a YouTuber.

2653
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:54,750
(What's the popular phrase
that is used on the web, L.C.S.S.?)

2654
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:58,220
(He wrote down the answer
without hesitation.)

2655
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:01,460
Like, comment, subscribe,
and set the alarm.

2656
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:03,960
(Like, comment, subscribe,
and set the alarm.)

2657
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,540
Haha PD!

2658
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:08,210
Let me catch up with Kim Jong Kook.

2659
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:10,610
- Haha.
- I had no idea.

2660
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:11,950
He knows some stuff.

2661
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:15,170
So the 4,000 dollars
of the Comedian Association...

2662
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,450
that was stolen by Lee Kwang Soo...

2663
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:19,140
- We took it back.
- was paid by both teams.

2664
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:20,380
- Okay.
- I'm so glad.

2665
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:23,420
And none of you will get a penalty.

2666
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,490
- So there's no penalty?
- Thank you.

2667
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:26,960
Kwang Soo, don't do that again.

2668
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,160
You jerk.

2669
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:29,530
We have breaking news.

2670
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:32,420
The membership fee of 4,000 dollars
stolen by Lee Kwang Soo...

2671
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:34,670
was just paid
by the Comedian Association members.

2672
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:38,500
Now, the association can
maintain its existence.

2673
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:42,470
Meanwhile, the thief Lee Kwang Soo's
whereabouts are still unknown.

2674
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:45,710
If you ever see Lee Kwang Soo,
please report it to us.

2675
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,780
(At the crossroad of choice)

2676
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:51,340
Do you choose an easy option
or a challenging option?

2677
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:52,710
(I choose a challenging option.)

2678
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:55,510
(Selection Type 1: Tiger Moth)

2679
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:57,290
(For me, it depends
on the situation.)

2680
01:26:57,290 --> 01:26:59,290
(I always go with an easy option.)

2681
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:00,660
(I never risk my choices.)

2682
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:02,200
(Selection Type 2: Safety First)

2683
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:04,550
This is 100 percent chance,
and that is 50 percent chance.

2684
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:06,870
(They are in a dilemma
where they have to make a choice.)

2685
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:09,370
(Will they choose an easy option...)

2686
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:11,760
(or dangerous luck?)

2687
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:13,460
(They have no one to trust...)

2688
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:15,800
(in the series of choices.)

2689
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,910
(They decide their own fate.)

2690
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:20,040
(They can either hit the jackpot...)

2691
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:22,380
