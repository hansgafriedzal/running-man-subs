1
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,220
- Let's go.
- Hello.

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,860
Let's go.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,460
- Hello.
- Hi.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,500
(So Min looks cute today.)

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,910
So Min is...

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,140
(Cute and lovely)

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,070
When someone says you look cute,

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,710
you usually feel shy,
but that's not the case for So Min.

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,280
I just try to look cuter.

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,350
- So Min shows her...
- Hello.

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,350
It seems like
you've lost some weight.

13
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,580
- Hello, MC Hammer.
- Hello.

14
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,960
- Hey.
- Ji Hyo.

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,580
- Ji Hyo.
- What were you working on?

16
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,780
- Ji Hyo, we...
- A jumpsuit?

17
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,830
Isn't she wearing our uniform
from the first episode?

18
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,600
- Isn't that it?
- The one from the first episode.

19
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,620
To remember my first intention.

20
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,870
- Hello.
- Hey.

21
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,800
- A man in a white shirt.
- Why are you wearing mint shorts?

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,190
- Me? Because it's summer.
- It's not pink.

23
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,410
And he's not wearing slippers.

24
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,540
Gosh, that's...

25
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,980
I didn't wear slippers before.

26
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,980
Slippers?

27
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,680
When did I wear slippers
for the opening?

28
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,080
- Gosh.
- Did I wear slippers or not?

29
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,370
- Jong Kook, you should...
- Wait.

30
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,580
- I mean...
- He's upset in the morning.

31
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,880
He's being ridiculous.

32
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,050
Is it something
you have to be this upset about?

33
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,510
- When did I wear slippers...
- Jong Kook started menopause.

34
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,860
- It's menopause.
- Menopause?

35
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,880
- For the opening...
- I'm so surprised.

36
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,980
He's going through menopause.

37
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,520
For the opening, when did I...

38
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,530
I don't wear slippers
at least for the opening.

39
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,590
I wear them somewhere else.

40
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,620
- I read an article yesterday.
- Is it that upsetting?

41
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,700
One of the menopausal symptoms is...

42
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,860
- flying into a rage.
- Is that so?

43
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,110
- Yes. That's what it is.
- Is it?

44
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,000
- You easily get upset.
- My gosh.

45
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,640
- By the way...
- It looks like we are...

46
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,580
- The thing is...
- What is it?

47
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,580
How could you be alone
with Ji Hyo at your place?

48
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,670
I watched that too.

49
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,220
How could you...

50
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,220
(A great number of people
watched the video of them.)

51
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,590
(It had about 13.54 million views.)

52
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,860
(At Jong Kook's place, not a gym,)

53
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,980
(they worked out together
in a sweet but brutal way.)

54
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,220
- It's not like that.
- Just the two of them?

55
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,750
We just worked together.

56
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,000
We're just confused.
So what's the deal?

57
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,140
Hang on.

58
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,530
Hang on. Suk Jin.

59
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,000
- You... Ji Hyo, hang on.
- In Jong Kook's place...

60
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,910
- Again...
- Wait. You...

61
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,000
Did you promise
to join my channel or not?

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,910
- I did.
- What about you?

63
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,410
- I did.
- What about you, Suk Jin.

64
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,580
I promised.

65
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,140
They all promised to do it.

66
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,250
- As Jae Suk brought it up...
- I...

67
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,110
He just started yelling.

68
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,610
- He's being like this on purpose.
- Let go of me.

69
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,090
He's doing this on purpose.

70
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,890
- Hey.
- She just did it first...

71
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,090
because her new drama
was coming out.

72
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,750
- He's blushing to his ears.
- Hang on.

73
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,000
- Look. He's blushing.
- Don't make things up.

74
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,430
- You stay quiet.
- He's going through menopause.

75
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,690
- He's started menopause.
- Your ears are all red.

76
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,160
- Jong Kook.
- Yes.

77
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
I just meant...

78
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,870
- He becomes calm already.
- For your channel...

79
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,560
- I'm scared.
- Ji Hyo can join your channel.

80
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,370
- Of course.
- But what I found surprising...

81
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,710
was that Ji Hyo
seemed so comfortable.

82
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,840
- Totally.
- I know.

83
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,870
(Ji Hyo seemed so comfortable.)

84
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,680
(She had a bowl of cool soup.)

85
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,020
(Then she lied down on the sofa
as if it was her place.)

86
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,720
You can't do that. Get up.

87
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,850
I want to lie down and watch TV.

88
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,380
- It was like...
- It looked like she lived there.

89
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,620
I didn't feel comfortable.
I was just exhausted.

90
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,750
Hang on. When you came...

91
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,590
to my place with the other members
the other day,

92
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,870
did you feel comfortable or not?

93
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,120
Did you not say
you were comfortable or not?

94
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,900
- Why are you so upset?
- Let go.

95
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,030
- Did you say that or not?
- How would she answer?

96
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,130
- Stop yelling.
- How would she answer the question?

97
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,600
- Did you say that or not?
- Say you were uncomfortable.

98
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,810
- What is it that upsets you?
- You said that.

99
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,130
- Right.
- She said...

100
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,340
She felt really comfortable.

101
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,710
But why are you
saying that to Ji Hyo?

102
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,250
Don't be upset.

103
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,590
Don't make things up.

104
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,990
Did she go home after the shoot
or sleep over?

105
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,020
Of course she went home!

106
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,660
(Of course she went home!)

107
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,720
Of course I went home, you punk!

108
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,120
Of course she did.

109
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,250
- I just asked one question.
- Hey!

110
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,750
Why are you guys so upset?

111
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,060
Hey, you two are dating, aren't you?

112
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,120
- They're dating.
- No.

113
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,340
I know you guys are yelling
like this for a reason.

114
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,030
- That's what it is.
- It's not happening yet...

115
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,660
because Eun Hye
finally started talking.

116
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,740
- Eun Hye finally started talking.
- Will you stop it?

117
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,840
(Eun Hye finally started talking.)

118
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,100
Don't do that.

119
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,810
- Stop it.
- What did Eun Hye say?

120
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,370
- What did she say?
- What did Eun Hye say about him?

121
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,680
- What did she say?
- Please join our show sometime.

122
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,910
Eun Hye finally started talking.

123
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,310
- What did she say?
- She didn't say anything.

124
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,940
- She was on "Men on a Mission".
- Really?

125
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,220
She was,

126
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,120
but she didn't say much about me.

127
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,820
(She suffers from "X-Man"
as much as Jong Kook does.)

128
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,090
(Old fans of "X-Man" have been
waiting for her answer.)

129
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,440
(Even their parents fell for
their romance in a variety show.)

130
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,160
(Fans of "X-Man" were
ecstatic at the news.)

131
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,240
She was,

132
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,630
- What I'm saying is...
- but she didn't say much about me.

133
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,500
- This is just strange.
- I'm curious.

134
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,410
(This is just strange.)

135
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,680
Eun Hye is on a lot of TV shows,

136
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,710
but not ours.

137
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,940
(Eun Hye is on a lot of TV shows,
but not ours.)

138
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,440
(Follow me.)

139
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,960
Why are you doing this?

140
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,890
- That's enough.
- I mean...

141
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,280
(The huge fan of "X-Man" is
dragged out of the camera view.)

142
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,160
- Today's opening is so intense.
- It's so intense.

143
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,530
- Okay.
- Enough.

144
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,400
- I get it.
- My gosh.

145
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
(The former MC of "X-Man"
is intimidated.)

146
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,640
- That's enough.
- This time,

147
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,090
I thought Jong Kook would hit me.

148
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,970
I haven't seen you getting away
from the camera for a long time.

149
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,230
- Where would he hit me...
- They got out of the camera view.

150
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,080
Enough is enough.

151
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,510
- The whole situation...
- I know.

152
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,010
This is just about work.

153
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,520
Anyway, even if you date Ji Hyo,
don't say that for the time being.

154
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,410
Until Eun Hye joins our show.

155
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,680
You have guts.

156
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,520
- You do have guts.
- You're unbelievable.

157
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,660
You've got a lot of nerve
after you moved to a new agency.

158
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,960
Well done.

159
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,180
It's hard, but I'll give it a try.

160
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,200
(He declares that
he will snipe at Jong Kook.)

161
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,030
Eun Hye.

162
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,770
- Don't do that.
- Set up the antenna.

163
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,140
Okay.

164
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,100
Stop talking about her.

165
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,660
She's just doing fine now.

166
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,730
I want to go home.

167
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,970
Please stand in the middle.

168
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,010
- Come this way.
- Okay.

169
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,380
Why are you here?

170
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,110
You're supposed to be there.

171
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,040
- He seems excited.
- I know.

172
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,320
- He's excited.
- He wants to tease Jong Kook.

173
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,110
- My gosh.
- I'm right next to you.

174
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,420
(His snaggletooth charm
melts Jong Kook's heart.)

175
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,630
I like Jong Kook a lot.

176
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,130
- All right.
- He's so fun.

177
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,360
And we have something to celebrate.

178
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,920
- Really?
- What is it?

179
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,660
With the last week's episode,
our show became...

180
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,090
the longest-lived variety show.

181
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,430
- My gosh.
- Really?

182
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,100
- Seriously?
- It was "Infinite Challenge".

183
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,800
- That's right.
- We broke the record.

184
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,710
- Did we beat "Infinite Challenge"?
- Actually, "Infinite Challenge"...

185
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,040
- was about two years longer.
- That's amazing.

186
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,470
But "Infinite Challenge"
was canceled many times...

187
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,280
when the broadcasting company
was on strike.

188
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,950
- So we have more episodes.
- Running Man has more episodes.

189
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,410
So these two broke
their own records.

190
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,410
That's right.

191
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,460
That's so cool.

192
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,460
- No, not me.
- Why not?

193
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,850
- You did.
- Why would you say that?

194
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,130
- He's...
- I didn't do anything.

195
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,720
He served in the military,
so he wasn't in all the episodes.

196
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,330
- He was on the show anyway.
- Still, he was a member there.

197
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,830
Why would you
belittle his achievements?

198
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,590
- My gosh.
- Don't diminish his career.

199
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,090
Now that you're
on "How Do You Play?"...

200
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,140
(Suk Jin's become confident
after he made his way to MBC.)

201
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,410
It's over.

202
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,710
I'm not on the show anymore.

203
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,880
- He's Kim Tae Ho's son.
- What?

204
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,380
Kim Tae Ho's half son.

205
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,650
Hey, Kim Tae Ho's son.

206
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,910
Suk Jin is loyal to MBC.

207
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,240
- Kim Tae Ho's son?
- He loves Kim Tae Ho.

208
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,820
If that's the case,

209
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,160
count out the time when you were
on Running Man half-heartedly.

210
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,520
That's right. That doesn't count.

211
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,090
You should count out
two and a half years.

212
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,760
- You never know how I feel.
- Three years should be excluded.

213
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,790
- How would you know how I felt?
- It should be excluded.

214
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,760
We should exclude 2 to 3 years
of his time. I know that.

215
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,970
We all know that because
you talked about it all the time.

216
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,220
- Sure.
- You know that.

217
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,490
Today's race is
all about your choices.

218
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,410
You will make your first choice
before we start a race.

219
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,010
- Please bring it in.
- What?

220
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,140
- Did it start already?
- I...

221
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,340
What is this?

222
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,450
What's this machine?

223
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,080
- What is it?
- Do we start it right away?

224
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,410
Today,

225
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,820
if you make a good choice,
you'll get a lot of money.

226
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,340
- I mean real money.
- Really?

227
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,910
You can make money in the race.

228
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,180
You will pick...

229
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,660
one of the two buttons you see
and press it.

230
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,130
If you press the green button,

231
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,590
you get 200 dollars right away.

232
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,590
- My gosh.
- It's either 100 or 50 percent.

233
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,220
But if you press the red button,

234
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,700
you will get
either 500 or 0 dollars.

235
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,640
(If they press the red button,
they get either 500 or 0 dollars.)

236
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,470
(Will you get 200 dollars
or go with a 50-percent chance?)

237
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,780
It's either 100 or 50 percent.

238
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,540
- This is hard.
- I'll go with a 100-percent chance.

239
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,670
My right hand is itchy.

240
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,280
I'll go with
a 50-percent chance for sure.

241
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,470
No, I will go with a safe option.

242
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,450
Those who want to choose
a safe option can try later.

243
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,850
I'll go with the safe one.

244
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,590
- A safe option?
- Let's go with a safe option.

245
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,960
(Suk Jin chooses the button first.)

246
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,130
Here I go.

247
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,890
Here I go.

248
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,660
Let's go.

249
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,350
Let's go.

250
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,720
(He has a 50 percent chance
of winning 500 dollars.)

251
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,790
What?

252
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,070
(Will he succeed in
his first challenge?)

253
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,360
This is it. It goes straight to...

254
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,860
This is it. It goes straight to...

255
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,100
- Yes!
- Nice. He gets nothing.

256
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,140
This is why you should go with
a safe option.

257
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,450
You failed.

258
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,910
Let's go with a safe option.

259
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,080
I can't believe this.

260
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,170
You always fail.

261
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,540
You should give it a try though.

262
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,670
You fail all the time.

263
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,820
All right.

264
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,320
- You know me, right?
- I do.

265
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,220
Obviously... Do you want
to try your luck?

266
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,050
- Of course I do.
- He tries his chance.

267
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,390
(Jae Suk tries
the 50-percent chance.)

268
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,900
- Really?
- It's going that way.

269
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,200
(Will he be able
to win 500 dollars?)

270
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,360
It's going well.

271
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,660
- Okay.
- He gets nothing as well.

272
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,840
(He failed and got 0 dollars.)

273
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,070
I guess we should
go with a safe option.

274
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,590
- Let's go with a safe option.
- We will just...

275
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,010
go with a safe option
to make things easy.

276
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,360
- I'll do that.
- Isn't it that it always fails?

277
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,140
It's a fight between these two.

278
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,910
Two people just failed,
so if you give it a try now,

279
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,380
- you are highly likely to win.
- That's right.

280
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,650
- I'll go next.
- Haha.

281
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,150
- Haha, you can win.
- Do you want to try?

282
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,350
- Will you take your chance?
- I'll give it a try.

283
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,380
- Seriously?
- The safe option...

284
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,390
Should I put it in here?

285
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,850
- Press it yourself.
- You want to press it?

286
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,350
I will press the button myself.

287
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,410
(The prankster couldn't wait,
so he pressed the button.)

288
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,820
(Two people just failed.
Where will Haha's ball go to?)

289
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,420
- I was going to press it.
- It's over for you.

290
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,660
I should press it.

291
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,060
I was going to press it.
I should press it.

292
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,790
I'm supposed to press it.
That doesn't count.

293
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,560
- I should do it myself.
- That doesn't matter.

294
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,740
- Don't be like that.
- It's over.

295
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,060
- Hey.
- I should do it.

296
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,060
- It's over.
- I should press it myself.

297
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,010
- Darn it! I have to press it.
- No, Haha.

298
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,300
I'm the one who makes the choice.

299
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,980
- No.
- It's fun this way, Dong Hoon.

300
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,250
- Get out of the way.
- I'll press it myself.

301
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,480
You should draw your eyebrows.

302
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,910
This doesn't feel right.

303
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,540
No. It's over.

304
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
It's hot today.

305
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,910
It's hot, so stay away from me.

306
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,890
- That was really fun.
- Who's next?

307
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,280
Those who want to take a chance
should go first.

308
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,450
Look.

309
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,790
Three people just failed.
Now it's time to succeed.

310
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,690
- I'm highly likely to win.
- You're right.

311
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,060
Why did you push the button?

312
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,430
(Haha really wanted
to press the button.)

313
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,830
- Darn it.
- No way.

314
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,200
(Failing 4 times in a row?
Or will Se Chan win as he expected?)

315
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,280
- Yes!
- We should do it again.

316
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,380
(Se Chan wins 500 dollars.)

317
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,110
Do it again. Haha pressed it.

318
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,110
- Why?
- Haha pressed it.

319
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,540
Jae Suk pressed the button
for you earlier.

320
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,070
- It just stopped.
- That counts.

321
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,250
Yes!

322
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,890
Good. We need winners as well.

323
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,910
- That's what makes it tempting.
- Nice.

324
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,660
We all should take our chances then.

325
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,280
For your information,
it's not for R coins.

326
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,320
- Do we get real money?
- Did I win 500 dollars?

327
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,360
Is it real money?

328
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,530
- So Min.
- That's right.

329
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,770
She's got carried away.

330
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,000
So Min's completely carried away.

331
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
(They just had a winner.
Will she win this time as well?)

332
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,100
Good, So Min.

333
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,410
So Min's completely carried away.

334
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,830
- That's right.
- Failed.

335
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,480
This is just right.

336
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,800
Failed.

337
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,380
(The tiger moth failed as expected.)

338
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,070
- I knew it.
- She's just like us.

339
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,280
I'll go with a safe option.

340
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,980
- Jeon So Min.
- Yes.

341
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,020
- It's safe.
- I was going to do that.

342
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,910
Did you choose
the safe option already?

343
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,440
I was going to choose
the safe option.

344
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,890
- Ji Hyo, you're up.
- That's how my life goes.

345
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,760
- I wanted to pick the safe option.
- Go with the red one.

346
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,360
You are quite lucky,
so you should give it a try.

347
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,100
Let's split it in half.
I'll give you 200 dollars.

348
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,690
- Give it a try.
- How would you do that?

349
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,690
With my money.

350
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,400
- You should take your chance.
- Pick what you want.

351
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,690
- Okay.
- You are lucky.

352
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,430
If she wins...

353
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,140
- If she wins...
- It's coming down.

354
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,640
(Will Ji Hyo be able
to win 500 dollars?)

355
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,250
- My gosh.
- It's coming down.

356
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,250
- Failed.
- Ji Hyo is not different.

357
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,570
- What's up with you these days?
- She's not lucky anymore.

358
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,310
(She's being unlucky these days.)

359
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,860
Jong Kook, we got 500 dollars
and 200 dollars. Okay.

360
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,390
- We can't win 500 dollars.
- You made it fail.

361
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,450
We didn't do it.

362
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,730
I don't think so.

363
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,950
Can I try it one more time?

364
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,500
When we tried, we won many times.

365
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,530
Really?

366
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,870
- That's not true.
- It's not working.

367
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,460
You should save money as I do.

368
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,460
- Look at that.
- I won.

369
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,140
- It only works for lucky guys.
- It works for lucky guys.

370
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,660
- I'm lucky.
- It just works for him.

371
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,780
You are meant to win.

372
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,670
This isn't a fake. It works.

373
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,350
What's wrong with me?

374
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,300
This is really strange.

375
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,120
- It's strange.
- Is someone controlling the ball?

376
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,350
It's so strange.

377
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,020
All right. Today,

378
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,890
you can make a lot of money
if you make a good choice.

379
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:41,030
During the race, you will keep
pressing one of these two buttons.

380
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,360
I should keep choosing 200 dollars.

381
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,950
The green button is
for a safe option.

382
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,270
And the red button is
for a risky option.

383
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,270
I'll go with an easy one.

384
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,900
- No, I'll take my chance.
- All right.

385
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,100
In August,

386
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,030
Jae Suk, Haha,
and Ji Hyo were born.

387
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,030
That's right.

388
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,910
It's the month that has
the most birthdays of our members.

389
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:00,540
For your parents who gave
birth to you and raised you,

390
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,410
we prepared the first
Protect Money For Your Parents Race.

391
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,410
- Is it for our parents?
- The money you win today...

392
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,910
is for your parents.

393
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,360
You can spend the money
on your parents.

394
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,520
(The money they win during the race
is for their parents.)

395
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,030
Just like you did earlier,
you will make choices...

396
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,860
to win money.

397
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,770
You will select a button
every 30 minutes...

398
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,560
and save your money
according to your choice.

399
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,460
You gain the amount of money
according to your choices.

400
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,510
But not all of you get a chance
to obtain money in every mission.

401
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,030
There will be 2 regular missions
and 2 hiding missions.

402
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,910
Only the person in last place...

403
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,520
will press
a different kind of button.

404
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,620
That is, six of you can get money
just as you did after every mission,

405
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,850
but the person in last place...

406
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,450
will press
a different kind of button.

407
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,890
- I guess we have to hide something.
- I feel at ease this way though.

408
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,730
After you change your clothes,
we'll begin the hiding mission.

409
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,900
- Let's go.
- Okay.

410
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,030
(It's all up to your choice.
Who will get the most money?)

411
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,660
(Se Chan, 500 dollars,
Jong Kook, 200 dollars,)

412
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,870
(Jae Suk, Suk Jin, Haha,
Ji Hyo, So Min, zero)

413
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,560
What's this?

414
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,790
So I'm supposed to hide this?

415
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,510
It's an 80cm-long piece of chalk
that you have to protect...

416
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,980
in order to get a chance
to choose a button.

417
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,510
What? Is this chalk?

418
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,350
Oh, my. I had no idea.

419
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,170
- Oh, is this chalk?
- Yes, it is.

420
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,440
It's so long. I have to hide this?

421
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,780
Each of you gets a different color.

422
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,180
And you're allowed to hide it.

423
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,680
Even if it breaks,

424
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,550
the length of the chalk you have
at the end decides the rankings.

425
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,630
(Protect your chalk for 30 minutes!
The length decides the rankings!)

426
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,790
(The owner of the shortest chalk
will be in last place,)

427
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,330
(and will be given
different choices of buttons.)

428
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,870
You can do anything you want
in the next 30 minutes...

429
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,530
- to protect your chalk.
- I see.

430
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,530
(Who will be the last place?)

431
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,700
Doesn't it stand out too much?
Why is it pink?

432
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,010
It's pink.

433
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,280
It's so big.

434
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,850
It's too long. It's 80cm long.

435
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,750
How will anyone find it there?
No one can find it.

436
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,660
Okay. I'm going to hide it here.

437
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,360
Behind this.

438
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,890
(While Big Nose hides his chalk
like he hides pocket money...)

439
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,420
I think it's not possible
to keep this intact.

440
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,320
It's better to break it
and hide the pieces.

441
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,230
If I can protect just this much...

442
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,400
Oh, gosh. I'll have a chance to win
if I protect just this much.

443
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,460
- Can I hide it outside?
- Yes.

444
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,030
I'm going to go outside
and hide it in the back.

445
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,610
(Se Chan plans to hide his chalk
far away from the starting point.)

446
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,510
Can you do that?

447
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,780
- Can you detach it?
- You mean the pole?

448
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,410
How do you set this up?

449
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,120
(He's trying to take off
the camera pole.)

450
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,150
Done. Give me a second.

451
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,440
(He successfully takes it off.)

452
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,450
This is awesome.

453
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,020
What a great idea.

454
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,580
If anyone finds this,
I'll be impressed.

455
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,260
I wonder if anyone else
came up with this idea.

456
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,030
I'm sure
no one will be able to find this.

457
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,370
(He became so smart
after 11 years on Running Man.)

458
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,790
(He's proud of himself.)

459
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,510
(While the king of petty tricks
feels proud of himself...)

460
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,030
I don't think anyone can find it
even if they come right now.

461
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,640
Oh, gosh. Jong Kook went outside.

462
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,280
- He's out there walking around.
- Oh, man.

463
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,380
Should I carry this with me
just like this?

464
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,380
(The chalk bandit roams around.)

465
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,210
(He's relaxed since he's at the top
of the food chain of Running Man.)

466
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,580
I think I can hide it
somewhere here.

467
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,390
But if I hide it in the bush...

468
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,160
(He hid his chalk
where anyone could easily find it.)

469
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,160
(He's satisfied with his decision.)

470
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,870
My gosh. He already came out. Hey.

471
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,270
(An annoying voice
reaches his ears.)

472
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,960
My friend who's going through
menopause is out here.

473
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,690
I said that's not true.

474
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,910
I guess
everyone else is staying inside.

475
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,660
We should go and find them.

476
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,780
Oh, we should go and find them.

477
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,670
I thought it wouldn't be fun
if I hid it too well.

478
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,910
So? "Come and find it if you can."
Is that what you're thinking?

479
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,980
No.

480
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,670
Well, I'll go
to the weakest man's place...

481
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,490
- Good.
- and crush his chalk.

482
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,620
- Shall we crush it?
- Yes.

483
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,620
I'm planning to crush it.

484
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,260
How about we break it into tiny bits
like what we used in school?

485
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,450
What? Hey.

486
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,160
Why are you carrying it around?

487
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,400
I'm going to run away
from the others.

488
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,960
(He's holding the large chalk
in his hand.)

489
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
- But that's too dangerous.
- It's too risky.

490
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,600
Please pretend you didn't see me.

491
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,430
- You see...
- You said you'd run.

492
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,460
But it's too dangerous.

493
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,510
- I ran out of time while hiding it.
- Hey.

494
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,510
You must think we can't see it...

495
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,530
since it's blue
like a chroma key background,

496
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,200
- but you're wrong.
- This is too dangerous.

497
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,670
You shouldn't just carry it around
like this.

498
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,880
It'll break so easily.

499
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,480
I'll be running away,
so please pretend you didn't see me.

500
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,610
- No, Jae Suk.
- You can't run away.

501
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,170
- You should know...
- This is...

502
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,480
- Please pretend you didn't see me.
- You made the decision.

503
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,350
- Hey, why would you...
- It'll break anyway.

504
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,040
- Exactly.
- I don't think it's a good idea.

505
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,260
- I know. Wait.
- This is a bad idea.

506
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,260
Please pretend... Don't take it...

507
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,550
Wait. Stop.

508
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,130
(Wait. Stop.)

509
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,160
Jong Kook, stop.

510
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,100
(It snapped.)

511
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,660
Hey, you had it coming.

512
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,870
You punk.

513
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,100
- I'll break it into pieces.
- Please stop it.

514
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,530
- You should...
- That's enough. Stop it.

515
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,110
- Write something with these.
- Stop it.

516
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,460
- Use these to write something.
- I said, enough.

517
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,060
You've done enough damage!

518
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,930
Use them to write something.
Why did you...

519
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,280
- I'm not even carrying mine around.
- Hey.

520
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,110
- I even hid mine.
- Why would you carry it around?

521
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,910
- Even I wouldn't do that.
- Why did you do that?

522
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,410
You've got some nerve.

523
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,520
That's exactly my point.

524
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,120
- Don't you know the rules?
- Why would you do that?

525
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,780
We're supposed to go around
with our chalks...

526
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,910
and get into brawls.
That's the point of this game.

527
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,630
- Why would you...
- You should have hidden this.

528
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,130
- Why did you bring it out?
- Even I hid mine.

529
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,630
It could break by accident
just by bumping into someone.

530
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,290
- You can keep only the biggest one.
- Hey.

531
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,190
- What's wrong with you?
- Gosh. I'm done for.

532
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,400
- The longest piece?
- Exactly.

533
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,960
Let me see. This one is the longest.

534
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
- Let me see.
- Is this one...

535
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,010
- Oh, I think it's the longest.
- Right.

536
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,270
Come on, guys.

537
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,430
(Jae Suk and Jong Kook
turn into a gangster duo.)

538
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,570
(They crushed his chalk.)

539
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,940
- Gosh, no.
- You shouldn't have...

540
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,150
- I mean why...
- Hey.

541
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,120
- I'm done for.
- Hey, you punk.

542
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,650
I'm going to find yours.
Where is Jae Suk's room?

543
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,040
Where is his room?

544
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,990
- Upstairs in this building?
- Downstairs.

545
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,790
Gosh, that punk. Seriously.

546
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,010
- Okay.
- I'll check upstairs.

547
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,680
I won't hide it here.

548
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,950
I'll hide it somewhere else.

549
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,720
(Meanwhile, So Min who decided to
keep one piece intact...)

550
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,260
Should I go down?

551
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,490
It's too obvious.
Is there any place I can hide it?

552
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
I'll measure the depth.

553
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,230
(The kitchen sink drain)

554
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,570
I think it'll be safe here.

555
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,820
Okay. I'm done.

556
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,940
(They won't be able to find it here,
right?)

557
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,940
Perfect.

558
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,970
This is Suk Jin's room, right?

559
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,890
Where did he hide it...
Oh, my. What's this?

560
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,450
(Big Nose's room)

561
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,450
(He's searching Big Nose's room
since he's known to be clumsy.)

562
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,590
I wonder where he hid it.

563
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,950
Is this Suk Jin's room?

564
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,220
Yes, this is Suk Jin's room.

565
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,370
There's so much stuff in his room.

566
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,300
I think someone's in my room.

567
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,600
(Running hastily)

568
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,310
Gosh. Why are there two of you here?

569
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,660
(Big Nose got so anxious
that he rushed in.)

570
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,910
Gosh. You came too?

571
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,640
(He seems suspicious.)

572
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,770
Of course I came.

573
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,320
Come on. I'm not that stupid.

574
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,050
I think you're looking at the place
you hid it unlike what you said.

575
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,620
No way. I would never do that.

576
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,950
(Suk Jin's entire body
exudes anxiety.)

577
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,330
I don't think he hid it
somewhere like this.

578
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,300
Suk Jin, you didn't see
what happened to Se Chan's, right?

579
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,760
(He keeps walking back and forth
with an awkward smile.)

580
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,900
Where did he hide it?

581
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,260
(But it's surprisingly hard
to find Suk Jin's chalk.)

582
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,610
Hey, no.

583
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,850
What's going on?

584
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,550
(Big Nose stopped him suddenly.)

585
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,440
- What's going on? Is it in there?
- Hey.

586
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,480
(The bandit is coming.)

587
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,090
- What's going on? Is it in there?
- Hey.

588
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,060
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- Don't do that.

589
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,060
- Where?
- It's in there.

590
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,130
- Here?
- Down there.

591
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,130
- You mean here?
- Check down there.

592
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,490
- Where?
- Is it there?

593
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,760
- I'll check.
- No.

594
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,870
- Oh, it's here. I found it.
- Where?

595
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,430
(Jae Suk's camera)

596
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,690
(He found the chalk.)

597
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,910
I found it.

598
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,810
(Actually, when Suk Jin hid it,)

599
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:15,240
(he was sure
that no one would find it.)

600
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,050
Okay. Good.

601
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,180
(He hid it with confidence.)

602
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,510
There's no way they will find it.

603
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,750
(Big Nose smiled happily,
feeling certain that he would win.)

604
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,220
No one will find this.

605
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,830
There's no way.

606
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,100
(He was so anxious that he ended up
revealing the location.)

607
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,300
(He practically told Jae Suk
just as he was about to give up.)

608
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,300
(He laughed weirdly
because he was embarrassed.)

609
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,370
Stop it.

610
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,160
Please stop.

611
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,370
(They start crushing his chalk.)

612
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:45,970
- Hey.
- How did you find this?

613
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,080
- Why did you hide it in there?
- I can't believe this.

614
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,110
(Hopeless)

615
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,620
How could you hide it in there
and walk around outside?

616
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,940
- My goodness.
- How did you find it?

617
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,350
Only the biggest piece
will be accepted.

618
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,850
- Oh, boy. Suk Jin.
- Darn.

619
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,680
It'll be hard to find
the biggest piece.

620
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,890
I might not have found it.

621
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,160
- He went in there to check.
- He practically confirmed it.

622
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,420
- All right. Who's next?
- Okay.

623
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,860
Gosh. I didn't know.

624
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,990
He seemed to have no idea
while looking in there.

625
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,020
Why did I do that?

626
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,640
Darn it.

627
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,460
You know, you can say...

628
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,080
that this is the type of game
that Jong Kook likes the most.

629
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,380
- This is so exciting.
- I know.

630
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,380
(Jong Kook's favorite game
where he can break things)

631
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,580
(Jae Suk runs into Ji Hyo
while looking for the next victim.)

632
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,850
Ji Hyo, where is your room?

633
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,980
I wonder where she hid hers.

634
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:27,940
Come on.

635
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,360
(Ji Hyo goes back into the room
after Jae Suk.)

636
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,360
I see that someone already came here
and searched everywhere.

637
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
(Jae Suk starts to search hastily.)

638
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,560
What is it, Ji Hyo?

639
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,250
Come on, Jae Suk.

640
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,360
Why?

641
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,460
(Ji Hyo can't seem to leave him.)

642
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,520
Let's not do this
when none of us has any money.

643
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,110
(Surprised)

644
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,610
It begins now.

645
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,910
I'm going to hide it in the closet.

646
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,770
(Right after the race began...)

647
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,770
Okay.

648
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,240
(Ji Hyo hid her chalk
inside the closet bar.)

649
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,270
Oh, dear.

650
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,320
I will keep you safe.

651
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,850
(She even talked to her chalk
while hiding it.)

652
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,320
You can't find my chalk.

653
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,480
(Frozen)

654
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,250
(Jae Suk gets closer to her chalk.)

655
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,400
(No way.)

656
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,770
(He looks inside the closet
for a long while...)

657
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,770
(but just turns away.)

658
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,700
Where did you hide it?

659
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,270
Do you think I'll tell you that?

660
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,400
You won't tell me, right?

661
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,740
Why are you still here, Ji Hyo?

662
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,540
- She keeps following me in here.
- Right.

663
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,180
- No, I followed you there too.
- Just in this room.

664
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,340
She followed me
only when I came in here.

665
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,290
- I went into that room too.
- Let's divide the areas to check.

666
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,760
- You check that side, Jae Suk.
- Okay.

667
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,550
- It must be here. I'm sure of it.
- I bet it's here.

668
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,380
You can tell that
Ji Hyo is getting anxious, right?

669
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,500
I'm sure she didn't hide it
in such an obvious place, right?

670
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,090
Gosh. Where did she hide it?

671
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,120
(They're sure
that it's here, but...)

672
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,200
(Ji Hyo pretends to leave for now.)

673
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,000
Seeing how Ji Hyo followed me
in here...

674
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,970
Those punks.

675
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,470
- Jae Suk!
- What is it?

676
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,770
(Jae Suk!)

677
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,800
Where did you find it?

678
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,600
(Haha was searching
around the closet for a while.)

679
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,250
(He even starts searching
the closet bar.)

680
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,020
(Popping out)

681
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,880
(He's gone mad.)

682
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,380
- Jae Suk!
- What is it?

683
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,990
(He starts crushing the chalk.)

684
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,790
- Where did you find this?
- Stop.

685
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:30,360
(Ji Hyo's chalk has been crushed
like the others'.)

686
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,670
All right.

687
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,560
My goodness.
I can't believe I found it.

688
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,890
- Where did you find it?
- Amazing.

689
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,540
- Hey.
- Where was it?

690
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,600
She hid it inside the closet bar.

691
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,780
Only the longest piece
will be accepted.

692
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,800
Really?

693
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,900
(Only the longest piece
will be accepted.)

694
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Good.

695
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,840
Fine. I'll go and find yours.

696
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
We're done here.

697
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,040
We got one.

698
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,790
Okay.

699
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,810
Let's find another one.

700
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,610
You have five minutes left.

701
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,880
Okay.

702
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,760
Finding their chalks is
the only way.

703
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,430
I have to make theirs
shorter than mine.

704
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,090
Gosh. I'm so angry.

705
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,790
Where did he hide it?

706
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,060
I wonder if mine is intact.

707
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,860
Let's go and see
if it's still there.

708
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,740
The fourth floor.

709
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,360
Was my place in this building?
Oh, I'm at the right place.

710
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,010
I heard you hid yours in the drain.

711
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
What?

712
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,570
(What?)

713
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,840
(Why am I hearing this from you?)

714
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,720
- I heard you hid it in the drain.
- Who?

715
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,980
Did someone find it?

716
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,580
- So Min...
- Did someone really find it?

717
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,080
- So Min...
- Did someone find it?

718
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,580
- Was hers crushed?
- Your chalk was crushed.

719
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,760
How did anyone find it?

720
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,690
- Hey.
- How did anyone find it?

721
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,880
- Haha found it.
- Hey.

722
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,290
We're all going crazy now.

723
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,090
- But how...
- I'm so...

724
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,500
It'd be funny
if I crush So Min's too.

725
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,000
(Earlier on, in So Min's room)

726
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,040
(Dream's father went crazy
after finding Ji Hyo's chalk.)

727
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Where did she hide it?
I'm sure she hid it here somewhere.

728
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,200
(Dream's father went crazy
after finding Ji Hyo's chalk.)

729
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,480
(While searching every corner
from the toilet to the sink...)

730
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,780
(Surprised)

731
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,980
Oh, my. I can't believe this.
This is amazing.

732
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,920
(He found it!)

733
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,250
(The member who's been on the show
for 11 years pulled it off.)

734
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,880
(The Little Detective
is exhilarated.)

735
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,260
Oh, dear. That's another one gone.

736
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,090
(So Min's plan is destroyed
along with her chalk.)

737
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,050
So Min, I'm sorry,
but this is a game.

738
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,890
I hope you won't get too upset.

739
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,830
I got most excited
when I found a chalk in here.

740
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,860
Whose chalk did you find?

741
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,000
In the drain.

742
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,800
- Who?
- So Min hid hers in here.

743
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,630
I took it out with chopsticks
right away.

744
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,210
I took it out with chopsticks
and crushed it into pieces.

745
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,780
How did he find it?

746
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,040
You have one minute left.

747
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,520
- Time's up.
- All right.

748
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,540
The game ended.

749
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,110
Good. It's still intact.

750
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,020
(Now they have to gather around
with their chalks.)

751
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,490
Please gather around
with your chalks.

752
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,550
But I cut it a little shorter.

753
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,320
Isn't it inside that pole?
I thought of checking it.

754
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,500
- I saw the pole when I came here.
- You see...

755
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,290
I give up.

756
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,940
- I can't be on Running Man anymore.
- Oh, dear.

757
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,290
- I mean it.
- My goodness.

758
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,700
- He hid it inside this pole.
- I don't think I can do this.

759
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,330
- Inside this pole?
- Haha.

760
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,630
You must not touch this.

761
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,010
- I saw the pole.
- Haha.

762
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,710
The chalk hiding mission ended.

763
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,800
Haha has the longest chalk, right?

764
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,680
- Yes.
- Haha kept his chalk intact.

765
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,720
- Jae Suk is in second place.
- Yes.

766
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,750
- Jong Kook came in third place.
- Yes.

767
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,990
(Jong Kook who broke his own chalk
while bringing it gets 3rd place.)

768
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,460
So Min is in fourth place.

769
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,790
There are three members left now.

770
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,490
- Who's in fifth place?
- Put your chalks on the table.

771
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,890
Ji Hyo, how long is yours?

772
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,000
- I think I'm in last place.
- Ji Hyo's might be shorter.

773
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,170
- It's obvious.
- Mine is as short as his.

774
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,000
- The two of them...
- Put it on the table.

775
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
- I mean...
- Ji Hyo, put yours on the table.

776
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,010
They crushed it.

777
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,470
Ji Hyo, put it here.
It's quite long.

778
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,210
- I think hers is... It's close.
- Oh, gosh.

779
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,040
- Move aside.
- Take a look.

780
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,280
- You have nothing to worry about.
- That's it.

781
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,920
(Seok Sam is in last place.)

782
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,380
(Big Nose's chalk is
exceptionally short.)

783
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,020
- We practically destroyed Suk Jin.
- My gosh.

784
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,150
- Seriously.
- Jong Kook and I found his.

785
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,930
- They found my chalk.
- Out of everyone?

786
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,760
Honestly, I didn't see the chalk,

787
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,930
- but Suk Jin suddenly came said,
- Exactly.

788
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,500
"How did you know it was here?"

789
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,030
- He went like this.
- It was hard to see.

790
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,500
- We couldn't see it.
- It seemed so.

791
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
- Besides, it was white.
- It was hard to see.

792
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,670
You thought it was a part
of the drawer, didn't you?

793
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,710
- That's right. We didn't know.
- Exactly.

794
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,940
- So I...
- What a shame.

795
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,210
- I was going to give up.
- It took me a while to find it.

796
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,210
- It took a long time.
- He should've stayed quiet.

797
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,840
Ji Hyo too. Whenever I went
into the room where she hid it...

798
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,680
- She was like, "Why?"
- Exactly.

799
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,680
- It showed their personalities.
- Indeed.

800
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,490
It's the second time
to make a choice.

801
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,690
Before we begin,
Suk Jin came in bottom place.

802
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,930
All of you except for Suk Jin...

803
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,260
will choose between the same buttons
as before.

804
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,530
If Suk Jin chooses the safe choice,

805
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,000
there will be no change.

806
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,820
But if he chooses
the daring choice...

807
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,940
- I bet he'll make a risky choice.
- He'll lose...

808
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,000
He'll either deduct 200 dollars...

809
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,040
- from everyone else's money...
- Go ahead and do that.

810
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,010
- or lose 200 dollars.
- Think about it.

811
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,100
- Do you think he'll play it safe?
- I bet he'll choose that.

812
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,300
- He would never do that.
- Never.

813
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,100
- He'll definitely take a risk.
- I wouldn't do that either.

814
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,750
- Great. He'll be like a tiger moth.
- My gosh.

815
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,070
- Let's do this.
- Should I get 200 dollars?

816
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,870
I'll choose it no matter what.

817
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,020
Should I go with the safe choice?
How much do I get...

818
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,920
- Hey, of course,
- Haha.

819
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,150
- you should choose the other one.
- Haha, you should take a risk.

820
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,080
Everyone, don't forget
that the money is for your parents.

821
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,890
- That's why I want to play safe.
- Haha.

822
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,290
Would your parents be happy...

823
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,290
if their son gives them
the money he got from gambling?

824
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,530
What is he saying?

825
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,890
You should give them
your hard-earned money.

826
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,360
- It says "Win" and "Fail".
- Don't you agree?

827
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,630
- With your hard-earned money...
- He may...

828
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,100
You shouldn't consider this
as gambling.

829
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,510
- You shouldn't.
- It's not gambling.

830
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,800
- Hey.
- Just go with this button.

831
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,040
- Go ahead.
- No.

832
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,180
- Okay.
- I hope he fails.

833
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,010
- I mean it wouldn't hurt.
- I hope he fails.

834
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,140
(There's a 50 percent chance.)

835
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,880
(Will he win money this time
since he failed earlier?)

836
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,250
- Please. Fail.
- It's just an excuse.

837
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,880
- Fail.
- Oh, my. I think he'll get it.

838
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,150
- Fail.
- It wouldn't hurt.

839
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,520
I won!

840
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,930
Mother!

841
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
(Mother!)

842
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,930
(Safe, Win, Fail)

843
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,700
Gosh, this is annoying.

844
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,770
I made it!

845
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,470
Other people's success
is always annoying.

846
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,040
I'm annoyed. Gosh.

847
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,200
Father!

848
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,510
(The good son is celebrating alone.)

849
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,040
Haha won 500 dollars.

850
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
- Father!
- Next.

851
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,900
I've already made my decision.

852
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,800
Today, I won't even look
at this button.

853
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,400
(Today, I won't even consider
the safe choice.)

854
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,980
(He picked the daring choice.)

855
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,570
- Okay. He'll fail.
- I think he'll win.

856
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,490
(He pressed the button
with confidence.)

857
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,760
(He has a 50 percent chance
to win 500 dollars.)

858
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,550
- I'm sure he'll fail.
- Please fail.

859
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,230
Okay!

860
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,030
- Hold on.
- Okay!

861
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,850
It's weird.
Did you change something?

862
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,290
- It really is a 50 percent chance.
- That's right.

863
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,290
They failed before
and won this time.

864
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,200
- It really is a 50 percent chance.
- Next.

865
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,360
- Who came in third place?
- Jong Kook.

866
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,470
- Me?
- I'm so happy.

867
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,360
Since I picked the safe choice,

868
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,740
I'll have 400 dollars
if I make the same choice.

869
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,300
No way. Jong Kook won't press
the safe button.

870
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,540
Okay.

871
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,280
- He chose "Safe".
- Did he really press that button?

872
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,580
- Yes, I did.
- Next person.

873
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,580
I prefer this.

874
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,720
- So Min will definitely...
- Don't pretend to think about it.

875
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,750
- It's not like that.
- Don't pretend to think about it.

876
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,150
We all know what you'll choose.

877
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,880
- I know you, So Min.
- To be honest,

878
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,490
I know that I'll likely fail again
since it's the same game...

879
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,930
and that I should press this button.

880
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,820
So Min. Do as you always do.

881
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,290
- That's right.
- We know you.

882
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,290
- It's coming down.
- Please.

883
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,470
- Fail.
- Please.

884
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,360
Just as expected.

885
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,100
- Fail.
- I mean...

886
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,800
- It's not like that.
- Okay.

887
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,830
Ji Hyo, you're up.

888
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,600
- You should press the red button.
- Are you sure?

889
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,780
- Of course she chose that.
- Really?

890
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,920
- I think she'll win.
- It's moving toward "Fail".

891
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,140
(Could she restore her honor
as the lucky one?)

892
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,110
(Will she fail
as Suk Jin expected?)

893
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,520
(She won 500 dollars!)

894
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,920
- Did I win?
- I think...

895
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,020
It's broken.

896
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,350
- No, it's just...
- It's broken.

897
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,190
- Hey.
- It really is a 50 percent chance.

898
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,460
It's exactly a 50 percent chance.

899
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,390
Next up is the only person
who won 500 dollars earlier.

900
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,770
I'll get 2,500 dollars in total
if I win every time, right?

901
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,730
- Yes, you'll get 2,500 dollars.
- The thing about Se Chan is...

902
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,590
He gets lucky for trivial things.

903
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,470
- Not for important things.
- He really doesn't.

904
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,940
If you use up your good luck
for things like that,

905
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,210
- Does it bring bad luck?
- you don't get big success.

906
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,210
- That's nonsense.
- It's true.

907
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,750
- You should... Right.
- If you're lucky in trivial things,

908
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,900
- you don't get big success...
- Exactly.

909
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,340
- because you use up your good luck.
- That's right.

910
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,370
All right. Here we go.

911
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,610
(He chose the daring choice.)

912
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,380
Whatever he gets will be good
for him.

913
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,640
He always gets lucky
for trivial things like this.

914
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,490
(Will he get lucky this time too?)

915
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,260
- Please fall into "Fail".
- I think he'll fail.

916
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,930
- What's that?
- Hey, do it again.

917
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,260
Hey, you seemed to push it
toward the right side.

918
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,820
- That's right.
- We can't accept this.

919
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,390
- No. That's ridiculous.
- I'll explain.

920
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,170
- Director, please tell them.
- Let me explain.

921
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,890
The ball stayed on the right side
from the beginning.

922
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:48,890
- I'll do it for you.
- Right?

923
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,740
- He pushed it to the side.
- Yes.

924
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,770
- You shouldn't do that.
- You should put it in the middle.

925
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,480
Since when were you two so close
to each other?

926
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,780
It's not like that.

927
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,780
Listen, Se Chan.
It stayed on the right side.

928
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,950
- Jong Kook...
- It's not fun at all, you know.

929
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,810
- has been nice to me since Eun Hye.
- Come on.

930
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,020
(Jong Kook has been nice to me
since Eun Hye.)

931
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,290
(They're having a deep conversation
with their eyes.)

932
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,790
- It's true.
- They're talking with their eyes.

933
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,810
No, that's not true.
What are you talking about?

934
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:09,880
I was a fan of that show.

935
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,030
Why don't you play...

936
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,990
- rock-paper-scissors to decide it?
- Why rock-paper-scissors?

937
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,150
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

938
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,650
- Why must I play that game?
- Listen.

939
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,270
- Se Chan, listen. The ball fell...
- Let's do this.

940
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,500
You won't be allowed to complain
about it again.

941
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,000
- If I win, will you give up?
- Yes.

942
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,200
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

943
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,390
(Se Chan won.)

944
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,300
Hey, did you say "Start" or not?

945
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,210
Gosh, you crazy punk.

946
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,600
(The petty guy bursts out in anger.)

947
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:35,520
(The youngest member finally got mad
as they kept joking around.)

948
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,720
- I won!
- I must say...

949
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,250
- I'm glad you swore at him.
- Right?

950
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,880
- He is...
- He's the most annoying one.

951
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,490
- Good job.
- Why did you act up before them?

952
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:45,380
By the way, you stopped
before saying swear words, right?

953
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,590
Yes, I did.
I was going to say harsher words.

954
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,260
Children watch this show too.
I'm sorry.

955
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,290
Right.

956
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,390
"I'm sorry."

957
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,240
I felt his true feelings.

958
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,010
Now, it's the bottom place's turn.

959
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,900
- Everyone else loses 200 dollars?
- Yes.

960
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,540
- Please. I don't care about mine.
- He chose the red button.

961
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,010
- I want them to lose 200 dollars.
- But many of us...

962
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,180
already won.

963
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,870
I can deduct 1,200 dollars
from what you guys have.

964
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,140
(The money they barely won is
in Suk Jin's hands.)

965
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,650
- Let's go.
- Press the button. Come on.

966
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,580
- What's wrong?
- You already made a wish...

967
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,820
What do you mean I made a wish?

968
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,460
- You were putting your energy...
- I just...

969
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,760
- into this box...
- Suk Jin, I'll give you a tip.

970
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
(They almost forgot the ritual.)

971
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,850
- I would never...
- Suk Jin.

972
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,230
- What is it?
- Do the slurp.

973
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,470
- The slurp.
- How about this?

974
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,740
- Open sesame!
- Open sesame!

975
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,540
- How about "Come here"?
- Slurp, munch, slurp.

976
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,830
- Not like that, Suk Jin.
- Then how?

977
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,830
- Charge yourself with energy.
- Yes, make it seem fun.

978
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,750
- Take the universe's energy!
- That's it.

979
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,980
- I'm jealous of you, you know.
- Why just me though?

980
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,870
- Let the sky...
- This is an important moment.

981
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,310
The energy from the sky...

982
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,720
and from the ground.

983
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,380
Take energy from here and there.

984
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,310
Yes, let me gather energy.

985
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,530
Give me energy!

986
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,690
Zap!

987
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,150
Did you just say the S word?

988
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,320
(You jerk!)

989
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,590
Did you just swear on camera?

990
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,170
- Why did you swear on camera?
- It was "zap".

991
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,740
You heard him too, right?

992
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,290
- Unbelievable.
- I said, "zap".

993
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,510
Are you kidding me?

994
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,940
- I said, "zap".
- Why did you swear?

995
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,400
- Watch it, will you?
- What's wrong with you?

996
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,040
- It was "zap", everyone.
- Don't swear on camera.

997
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,780
- I'll take the energy from the sky.
- The sky.

998
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,040
- Right here.
- Gather the energy.

999
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,220
- Gather it all.
- Come to me.

1000
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,420
- Do it up front.
- Let happiness and luck come to me.

1001
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,790
- What now?
- Get the energy from Chan Hee.

1002
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,080
- Come on.
- Come to me.

1003
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,720
- Go to Chan Hee.
- Chan Hee, zoom in.

1004
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,120
Zoom in. That's it.

1005
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,730
Let me suck
200 dollars from them all.

1006
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,620
- Pull the energy down.
- Pulling...

1007
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,060
(He's met with reality.)

1008
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,820
- He does everything that's asked.
- Yes, everything.

1009
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,330
- Pull from further up.
- It's an automatic response.

1010
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,670
Pull it from the sky.

1011
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,600
- From up high as well.
- Exactly.

1012
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,860
From up high.

1013
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,300
- Pulling...
- Pull at a certain rhythm.

1014
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,370
Stretch out your lats
and pull from higher up.

1015
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,900
- Stretch!
- Stretching.

1016
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,680
That's the spirit. Nicely done.

1017
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:50,580
- Do it.
- Here I go!

1018
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,490
- Nice.
- This attempt will count.

1019
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,150
(If he makes it,
the others will lose 200 dollars.)

1020
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,550
This attempt will count.

1021
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,620
(If he makes it,
the others will lose 200 dollars.)

1022
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,700
(Will luck come to Suk Jin?)

1023
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,850
It's moving too much to the left.

1024
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,650
(He made it!)

1025
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,320
You all lose 200 dollars.

1026
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,200
(Aside from Suk Jin,
the others lose 200 dollars.)

1027
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,470
You all lose 200 dollars.

1028
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,740
- Nice!
- Suk Jin's balance stays the same.

1029
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,070
Let all the joy in life come my way.

1030
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,480
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

1031
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,140
If your balance is below zero,
we'll deduct it from your paycheck.

1032
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,300
What?

1033
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,020
Anyway, this is
your current balance.

1034
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,110
It'll be deducted from our paycheck?

1035
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,880
- I'm at the top.
- 300 dollars.

1036
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,920
Okay. 300 dollars isn't so bad.

1037
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,040
- Now...
- Nice.

1038
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,960
We'll now move on to the next game.

1039
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
Which is what?

1040
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,730
This next game is called...

1041
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,930
Smelly Dodge Ball.

1042
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,320
- It's dodge ball.
- Dodge ball?

1043
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,620
You'll be playing a version...

1044
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,560
where Ji Hyo and So Min
are the queens.

1045
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,890
The game will consist
of three rounds...

1046
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,670
and the teams will be changed up
after every round.

1047
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,400
Those on the winning team
will all earn one point.

1048
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,370
The one with
the least amount of points...

1049
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,900
will press the loser button.

1050
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
- It doesn't make sense though.
- Sorry?

1051
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,280
Referees aren't allowed to compete.

1052
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:59,380
(Jeon So Min,
expert referee for ball games)

1053
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,220
(The whistle is blown instantly
whenever she plays a ball game.)

1054
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,420
It'll be a game of 3 versus 3.

1055
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,490
So Min's father used to play soccer,

1056
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,460
- so her father...
- He's angry at me.

1057
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,930
- So I've heard.
- Why?

1058
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,930
He can't understand
why she's so bad at ball games.

1059
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,590
"How can you be that bad
at foot volleyball?"

1060
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,940
(Unlike her father,
she's terrible at ball games.)

1061
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,130
But why is it called...

1062
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,360
- Smelly Dodge Ball?
- What's the reason?

1063
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,340
We have prepared
five smelly objects.

1064
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:26,150
Out of 7 available cards,
5 will have them written on them...

1065
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,670
while two will be blank.

1066
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,550
The objects you choose...

1067
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,980
will hang from your helmets.

1068
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,020
- What?
- Really?

1069
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,610
But I have a weak stomach!

1070
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,090
- This is the worst.
- I have a weak stomach.

1071
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,960
We can't hold our breaths
when playing dodge ball.

1072
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,130
(Her frustration is at a maximum.)

1073
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,270
Check out Ji Hyo's expression.

1074
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,190
Ji Hyo wears her emotions
on her face.

1075
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,540
(Anyone can tell
she's super annoyed.)

1076
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,210
What's with your hair?
Are you entering a beauty pageant?

1077
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,800
I thought she was
Dr. Oh Eun Young today.

1078
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,900
(I thought she was
Dr. Oh Eun Young today.)

1079
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,380
They must go to the same salon.

1080
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,610
There's so much volume.

1081
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,300
- That person's hairstyle?
- The parenting mentor?

1082
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,440
- What's with your hair today?
- I blame my hands.

1083
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,590
You'll now choose the teams
for the first round.

1084
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,340
Play rock-paper-scissors...

1085
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,150
- and choose a teammate.
- Do they get to choose?

1086
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,790
The one who wins
at rock-paper-scissors...

1087
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,290
will have one more teammate.

1088
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,250
That's a good thing.
You'll have more members.

1089
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,920
I can already smell something!

1090
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,800
I can already smell something.

1091
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,570
- What?
- No way.

1092
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,190
Hold on. I smell fermented skate.

1093
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,230
But I have a weak stomach.

1094
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,670
- It's strong.
- Too strong.

1095
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,730
It's too strong.

1096
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,230
Is it dung?

1097
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,340
- I smell the skate too.
- Rock-paper-scissors

1098
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,880
Rock-paper-scissors

1099
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,880
(So Min wins.)

1100
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,300
Please choose a teammate.

1101
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,650
You'll then go in turns.

1102
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,710
(So Min chooses first.)

1103
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,710
(They avoid her gaze for now.)

1104
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,880
To make a ball game look funny,

1105
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,320
I need Jong Kook.

1106
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,360
- To make it look funny?
- He had his back turned.

1107
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
Come on, Jong Kook.

1108
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,650
Ji Hyo, please choose.

1109
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,730
- I choose Jae Suk.
- Okay!

1110
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,900
So Min, you're up.

1111
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,960
This is where it gets hard.

1112
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,500
- Why?
- You're at a crossroad.

1113
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,630
Absolutely.

1114
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,040
You're all pretty much the same.

1115
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,360
Haha, why don't you want
to be on my team?

1116
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,540
What do you mean?

1117
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,900
- I choose Haha.
- Why?

1118
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,110
Okay. Ji Hyo, you're up.

1119
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,150
Play rock-paper-scissors again.

1120
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,400
- Why?
- It's her turn to choose.

1121
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,610
- She gets to choose.
- They're now taking turns.

1122
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,880
Ji Hyo, go ahead and choose.

1123
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,650
- Don't they need to play it again?
- Rock-paper-scissors?

1124
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,420
- I choose Se Chan.
- Okay!

1125
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,480
(She chooses Se Chan.)

1126
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,420
- Nice!
- Suk Jin will be on So Min's team.

1127
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,730
This will be a tough battle then.

1128
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,980
But we have one more person.

1129
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,690
- You're bad at dodge ball though.
- We have one more person.

1130
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,050
- No, I'm good at it.
- It's fine.

1131
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,590
We just have to avoid
having the least points.

1132
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,000
It's all about
making the right choice.

1133
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,690
Gosh, the smell.

1134
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,090
My gosh, the smell.

1135
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,540
On the 7 cards in front of you,
5 have objects that smell...

1136
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,170
while the other two don't.

1137
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,900
- Should we just choose?
- Yes, go ahead.

1138
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,020
Go ahead.

1139
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,550
- All right.
- Good.

1140
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,050
Let's reveal it one by one.

1141
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,650
- Sure. In 1, 2.
- Jae Suk, you go first.

1142
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,820
In 1, 2.

1143
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,320
What is it?

1144
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,150
- Fermented cheese.
- What?

1145
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,860
(Smelly fermented cheese)

1146
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,150
- It's not bad.
- Cheese isn't so bad.

1147
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,150
It's not so bad.

1148
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,230
- It's not so bad.
- Is it one of the nicer ones?

1149
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,900
- Why is it that...
- What's with you today?

1150
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,840
- I have luck in trivial things?
- His is blank.

1151
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,340
But what I need
is one big lucky event.

1152
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,170
Ji Hyo?

1153
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,230
I have durian.

1154
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,170
- Oh, no.
- That's the worst.

1155
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,840
So Min, you're next.

1156
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,440
- That's not bad.
- Onions and garlic.

1157
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,750
- It's not bad.
- That's a nicer one.

1158
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,400
- It's not bad.
- That's a good one.

1159
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,570
But they will make my eyes water.

1160
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,070
Isn't mine better?

1161
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,940
(The next...)

1162
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,820
Hers is better compared to mine.

1163
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,980
I chose skate.

1164
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,750
I chose skate.

1165
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,590
That's a strong one.

1166
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,880
It's the worst.

1167
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,860
Nice!

1168
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,070
What can be worse than skate?

1169
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,730
What can be worse than skate?

1170
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,300
- What on earth...
- What is it?

1171
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,690
I chose Se Chan's sock.

1172
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,630
- What is it?
- I chose Se Chan's sock.

1173
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,230
(Where did
Se Chan's sock come from?)

1174
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,250
(The secret weapon: Se Chan's sock)

1175
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,710
His feet stink!

1176
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,000
(Why did Se Chan's sock
make the list?)

1177
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,650
(Episode 538 of Running Man)

1178
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,920
(Someone's stinky feet
invaded the quiz.)

1179
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,920
(The head director led the search.)

1180
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,860
(Darn it!)

1181
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:59,090
(Se Chan was caught red-handed.)

1182
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,550
(They were able
to pinpoint the source.)

1183
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,130
(He made many staff members
lose their sense of smell.)

1184
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,630
(He became known as Sour Feet.)

1185
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,710
His feet stink!

1186
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,880
Darn it.

1187
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,500
- All right.
- Let me...

1188
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,670
I'll let it ripen more.

1189
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,500
- Se Chan, over here.
- Yes?

1190
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,050
- Jump!
- Jump!

1191
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,380
(Sour Feet makes his feet
smell worse for Suk Jin.)

1192
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,380
Suk Jin, today's a bad day for you.

1193
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,520
- Jump!
- Today's a bad day for you.

1194
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,750
- It's the worst.
- Tell me about it.

1195
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,710
Se Chan, please let us
have your socks.

1196
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,880
They will be better
if they're a little damp.

1197
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,230
You should've given me a heads up.

1198
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,570
It's starting to smell a little.

1199
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,730
I can't believe it.

1200
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,340
We're getting his socks
fresh from the source.

1201
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,170
Skate is better.

1202
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,730
At least it's edible.

1203
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,210
All right.

1204
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,610
My gosh, the smell!

1205
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:50,670
(And finally...)

1206
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,500
That could touch your faces.

1207
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,070
Gosh, they stink.

1208
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,170
(Se Chan's socks are added
to the already smelly lineup.)

1209
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,090
Se Chan's socks
are better than the rest.

1210
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,110
(So Min has onions and garlic.)

1211
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,250
- Oh, no.
- Go ahead.

1212
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,250
- What's this?
- They smell awful.

1213
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,550
I didn't expect them
to be this strong.

1214
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,690
(Fermented cheese
hangs from Jae Suk's helmet.)

1215
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,090
Darn it!

1216
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,360
(Darn it!)

1217
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,540
Hey.

1218
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,770
It'll touch my face!

1219
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,710
Darn it.

1220
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,840
The skate stinks.

1221
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,840
(The scent of ammonia
has him groaning.)

1222
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,130
It might touch my face.

1223
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,270
Is this how it's supposed to be?

1224
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,210
Now...

1225
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,380
It touches my face.

1226
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,380
(Ji Hyo who has durian
refuses to breathe.)

1227
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,650
Please wear your cap backwards.

1228
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,290
(There's one person
who has no choice.)

1229
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,920
My socks shouldn't be in a net.

1230
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,520
Darn it!

1231
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,690
This is the worst feeling ever!

1232
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,630
- Darn it!
- He has my socks.

1233
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,800
(Suk Jin has my socks.)

1234
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,730
This is so gross!

1235
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,300
(The sour smell stings his nose.)

1236
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,000
My socks are nearly touching
Suk Jin's lips.

1237
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,540
Darn these socks!

1238
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,750
(The sour socks
hit him in the nose.)

1239
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,840
Forget the smell.
The socks hit me on the lips.

1240
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,840
I'm sorry about this.

1241
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,610
You shouldn't have picked my socks.

1242
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,770
- Darn it.
- I can't do this either.

1243
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,190
My feet are
on the smelly side today.

1244
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,480
Let's get this game over quickly.

1245
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,610
Yes, let's.

1246
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,650
Darn it!

1247
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,590
(The fermented cheese
isn't any better.)

1248
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,090
Just how bad is it? Let me see.

1249
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,690
Check this out.

1250
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,130
The cheese is one of the worst ones.

1251
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,230
(The staff chose the cheese
to be the worst.)

1252
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,070
Smell mine as well.

1253
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,570
It's like a smelly belly button.

1254
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,670
Smell mine.

1255
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,400
Darn it!

1256
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,440
- My gosh.
- Hey...

1257
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,940
It's the smell of
an elementary school restroom.

1258
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,440
I'm sorry, but I can't protect you.

1259
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,900
I won't today.

1260
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,820
This couldn't be more annoying.

1261
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,480
(He's almost in tears.)

1262
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,940
Darn it!

1263
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,920
One male member from each team...

1264
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,590
may play from outside the lines.

1265
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,650
I'll stand outside the lines.

1266
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,050
- Haha, protect So Min.
- Sure.

1267
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,650
Darn it!

1268
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,730
(Forget the dodge ball.
They groan from all over the court.)

1269
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,090
The male members
can't be eliminated in any way.

1270
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,460
The game ends
when the women are eliminated.

1271
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,770
I just ate some!

1272
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,500
(Because of his protruding teeth,
he's forced to eat a bite.)

1273
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,130
- It's in my nose.
- This is too damp.

1274
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,480
I keep eating the durian.

1275
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,400
This stings my eyes.

1276
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,020
(The onions and garlic
sting the eyes.)

1277
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,550
Play like this.

1278
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,150
I'll end up with a sore neck.

1279
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,050
Look.

1280
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,290
I keep...

1281
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:16,610
I keep kissing it.

1282
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,790
Ready.

1283
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,820
Get set.

1284
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,360
(Game on!)

1285
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,130
(Team So Min attacks first.)

1286
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,460
- You punk!
- No!

1287
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,400
(Jong Kook misses the ball.)

1288
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,840
Oh, right. I need to block his ball.

1289
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,860
(He forgot what he was supposed
to do.)

1290
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,770
- This is so annoying.
- You should catch the ball.

1291
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,040
- Darn it.
- Block the ball.

1292
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,610
- Gosh, it stinks!
- Darn it.

1293
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,250
(Se Chan's stinky socks
keep touching Suk Jin's lips.)

1294
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,340
I'll pass it to you.

1295
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
All right. Hey.

1296
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,210
(The socks are still hanging
in front of his mouth.)

1297
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,750
- Stay behind me.
- This is so annoying.

1298
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:49,250
(The ball is back to Team So Min.)

1299
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,290
(His face muscles keep flinching.)

1300
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,730
Bring it on.

1301
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,250
Pass it to me.

1302
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,920
- Darn it.
- All right, I blocked it.

1303
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,960
All right.

1304
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:01,000
I'm going to kick you if you
come close. Don't come near me.

1305
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,630
(The man with fermented skate
became weak because of the stench.)

1306
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,960
Get ready to turn, Ji Hyo.

1307
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,960
(Right then!)

1308
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,400
- All right. She's out.
- She's out.

1309
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,670
Get ready to turn, Ji Hyo.

1310
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,150
(He succeeds in the sneak attack.)

1311
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,340
(The ball precisely hit her leg.)

1312
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,210
- She got hit.
- All right! She got hit.

1313
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,820
Everyone on this team
got one point each.

1314
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,840
Gosh, I should take it off.

1315
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,320
We'll proceed to the second round
right away.

1316
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,360
Pick the team members
and the button again.

1317
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,520
This is really annoying.

1318
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,590
(Picking team members for Round 2)

1319
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,860
Gosh, it stinks!

1320
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,520
Are you going to keep
using my socks?

1321
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,630
- The smell is too strong.
- Yes.

1322
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,570
All right. So Min and Ji Hyo,
play rock-paper-scissors.

1323
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,320
Rock-paper-scissors

1324
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,000
- It's better to win.
- It's better to win.

1325
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,210
I...

1326
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,040
I'm pretty good.

1327
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,630
You saw me play, right?

1328
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,480
I pick Jae Suk.

1329
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,610
All right.

1330
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,000
I pick Haha.

1331
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,110
What?

1332
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,550
(So Min only picks Haha.)

1333
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,320
Why? What's wrong?

1334
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,290
- I pick Se Chan.
- Okay.

1335
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,290
Next.

1336
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,920
Jong Kook and Suk Jin
are remaining.

1337
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,980
Jong Kook.

1338
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,320
Jong Kook and Suk Jin
are remaining.

1339
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,230
(Big Nose doesn't get picked.)

1340
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,250
Suk Jin will join the other team.

1341
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,090
This feels so lousy.

1342
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,270
Of course I should pick Jong Kook.

1343
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,690
- How could you?
- What's wrong?

1344
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:10,170
I kissed Se Chan's socks
about 20 times already.

1345
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,000
- Let's do this!
- Let's go!

1346
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,040
Put your hands together.

1347
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,210
- Let's win this.
- Yes.

1348
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:15,380
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

1349
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,630
- Let's go!
- Take one.

1350
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,710
Just wait and see.

1351
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,000
Take one.

1352
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,440
- Let's open on the count of three.
- Take one.

1353
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,480
You should all take one
at the same time.

1354
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,380
Please... I just hope
it won't be Se Chan's socks.

1355
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,520
I'd hate to have Se Chan's socks.

1356
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,750
- Wait.
- You're not going to hang anything.

1357
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:27,820
(This time, Jae Suk got lucky.)

1358
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,690
- What did you get?
- Look!

1359
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,690
(So Min passed.)

1360
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,320
- I think it's fermented skate.
- I got durian.

1361
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,550
How is durian?

1362
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,650
(I got fermented skate.)

1363
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,300
I got cured cheese.

1364
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,960
I got onions.

1365
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,190
It's not bad.

1366
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,230
It's better.

1367
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,670
(Then the only one remaining,
Ji Hyo...)

1368
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,670
(She got Se Chan's socks.)

1369
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,300
I got Se Chan's socks!

1370
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,710
(Jae Suk smells Se Chan's socks.)

1371
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:52,770
Gosh, this is...

1372
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,570
(He only smelled them for a second.)

1373
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:55,570
(He's already shocked.)

1374
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,940
- Se Chan.
- Yes.

1375
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,550
Is this smell from your socks?

1376
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:02,460
- They smell really weird.
- They ruined your mood, right?

1377
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,520
What is it?

1378
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,550
The smells are mixed.

1379
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,630
- They are, aren't they?
- Wait a minute.

1380
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:08,730
- Yes, they are.
- Goodness!

1381
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:10,730
Hey.

1382
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,020
This can't be from your socks.

1383
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,090
(The socks are ripened to the point
where they seem rotten.)

1384
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,270
No way.

1385
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:17,130
This isn't the smell, right?
You put something on them, right?

1386
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:19,770
Gosh, I think I might throw up.
It's killing me.

1387
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,300
Smell it. I'm not kidding.
It's crazy.

1388
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,540
Smell it.

1389
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,610
Just once.

1390
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:26,610
Try smelling it.

1391
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,150
Why would you scream
when you came up with this?

1392
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,790
Gosh, this is...

1393
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:35,150
Goodness, this is
too close to my face!

1394
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,210
The smell is too strong!

1395
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,550
(They can't get used to
the unique smells.)

1396
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,190
- Gosh.
- How does the cheese smell?

1397
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:41,650
Jae Suk, this isn't right.

1398
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:43,630
I told you.

1399
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,320
(He's about to pass out.)

1400
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,300
Guys, look at Ji Hyo. Poor her.

1401
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,800
Poor Ji Hyo.

1402
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,940
Ji Hyo, we need to win this time.

1403
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,610
- Jae Suk...
- We really need to win this time.

1404
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,130
- I'll throw the ball.
- Let's do this.

1405
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,480
I'll try hitting her.

1406
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:00,250
Let's start.

1407
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,610
- Let's start.
- Gosh, it stinks.

1408
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,710
(The game starts.)

1409
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,520
(Jae Suk passes the ball
to Se Chan for now.)

1410
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,610
(Throwing up)

1411
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,190
(The smell of the fungi doesn't
allow him to receive the ball.)

1412
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,020
Jae Suk...

1413
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,420
It's horrible.

1414
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,420
(The man who got cheese
in the 1st round can relate to him.)

1415
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,590
The smell gets strong
when it comes close to my face.

1416
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:20,800
Jae Suk, here.

1417
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:24,670
- Hey!
- Hey!

1418
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,340
(The fungi boy hands the ball
over to Jong Kook.)

1419
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,440
We got this.

1420
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:28,900
- Are you going to throw it?
- Yes.

1421
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,940
You should throw it.

1422
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,980
Suk Jin, you can't hide behind me!

1423
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,110
(Suk Jin forgot
what he's supposed to do again.)

1424
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:37,750
(Jae Suk blocked the ball
with his face.)

1425
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,920
Why you...

1426
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,790
Suk Jin, you should come
in front of me.

1427
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:41,960
(The onion man
is practically useless.)

1428
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,290
(It's Jae Suk's turn to attack.)

1429
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,230
(Going here...)

1430
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,250
(and there)

1431
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,230
(The players with no helmet on
are the only excited ones.)

1432
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,020
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

1433
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,130
- Stay close to me.
- Hey!

1434
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,170
It stinks! Darn it!

1435
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,130
(Mischievous Jae Suk is
into playing a nimble player.)

1436
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,540
Oh, no! It touched my face! Darn it!

1437
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,340
No! Se Chan's socks touched my lips!

1438
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,210
(Horrifying)

1439
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:04,340
- Throw the ball!
- Se Chan's socks touched my lips!

1440
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,550
I'm dizzy now.

1441
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,650
(Mischievous Jae Suk
finally passes the ball.)

1442
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,980
- They touched my lips!
- Darn it.

1443
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,750
(They besiege Jong Kook
and So Min by passing the ball.)

1444
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,460
(On hair-trigger alert)

1445
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,090
(Throwing up)

1446
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:19,380
Hurry up and end this round!

1447
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,630
Just surrender to them.

1448
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,520
- I'm dizzy.
- This is killing me!

1449
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,590
(They tease Jong Kook
with quick passes.)

1450
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,070
(So Min ends up getting eliminated.)

1451
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:30,940
- All right. She got hit.
- I got hit.

1452
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:31,940
You did?

1453
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:33,840
(Team Ji Hyo wins the 2nd round.)

1454
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,130
Everyone on this team
got one point each.

1455
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,400
(Ji Hyo, Jae Suk, Se Chan,
and Suk Jin got 1 point each.)

1456
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,670
The cheese is...

1457
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:40,940
Here's the result.

1458
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,050
(The result after playing 3 rounds)

1459
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:43,520
Se Chan is on the bottom,

1460
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,820
and the rest of you
get a chance to make money.

1461
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,520
- We're going to get more money.
- Bring in the buttons.

1462
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,920
- I'll pick the safe one this time.
- Me too.

1463
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:53,520
Everyone, time to make
your third choice.

1464
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:56,500
The options are the same as before.

1465
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,570
Is Suk Jin going first?
Who's going first?

1466
00:46:58,730 --> 00:46:59,800
They said anyone can go first.

1467
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,960
They said I should go first.

1468
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,960
Suk Jin, go ahead.

1469
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:03,590
Suk Jin will take the risk.

1470
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,170
He'll take the risk.

1471
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:07,500
- You can pick one now.
- Suk Jin will take the risk.

1472
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,440
- Of course.
- He'll take the risk.

1473
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,610
(He chose to take his chance.)

1474
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:12,670
- I hope he fails.
- Go!

1475
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:13,980
It's going in the right direction!

1476
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,610
(Go! It's going
in the right direction!)

1477
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:17,650
You failed.

1478
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:19,380
(Fail)

1479
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,860
(With a sudden twist toward
the end, it went straight to fail.)

1480
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,050
He said it was going
in the right direction.

1481
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,290
Nice! That was the right direction.

1482
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,880
- Next, Jong Kook.
- It's really strange.

1483
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,130
It's my turn? You know me.

1484
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:28,320
- Will you take the safe one again?
- Can you give it a try this once?

1485
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,550
- I'll pick...
- I'm so sick of him.

1486
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,960
- I'm so sick of you.
- This is boring.

1487
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,000
He only picks the safe one.

1488
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,130
Safety first.

1489
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:35,130
- Next, Haha.
- Haha?

1490
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:37,190
- You failed twice and won once.
- It's me?

1491
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,770
- He chose the safe one too.
- All right!

1492
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,270
- Let's go!
- That's so sneaky of you.

1493
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,940
- He's so annoying. I know.
- He's always like that.

1494
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,000
He's just...

1495
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,380
He's so annoying. I can't take it.

1496
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:46,980
That's so dirty.

1497
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,210
So Min, you can go next.

1498
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:49,940
- Put the ball in.
- You failed twice and won once.

1499
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,550
- All right!
- All right!

1500
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:52,840
(Jae Suk and Ji Hyo
both try their chances.)

1501
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,320
Fail! No!

1502
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,020
- Thank goodness.
- Yes!

1503
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,750
It's Se Chan's turn now.

1504
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,920
Since I won some money,

1505
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:02,130
I'll try my luck for sure.

1506
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,190
- That's for sure.
- Right.

1507
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,500
- Se Chan should...
- No, mine will go negative.

1508
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,020
- Please don't do this.
- I have nothing.

1509
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:09,500
If I press this, everyone except me
will lose 200 dollars.

1510
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,630
You'll lose 200 dollars alone.

1511
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,070
Please...

1512
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:13,730
- I'm...
- You won a lot of times.

1513
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,000
I'm lucky with little things.

1514
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,040
- Fail.
- I'm lucky with little things.

1515
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,540
(The man who's lucky
with little things gives it a go.)

1516
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:18,880
I'm lucky with little things.

1517
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,550
(Will Se Chan be the only one
to lose money?)

1518
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:23,170
(Or will everyone else
suffer a loss?)

1519
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,750
(The man who's lucky
with little things, Se Chan)

1520
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,320
(How will it turn out?)

1521
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:27,750
- I'm lucky with little things!
- He made it!

1522
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,860
There you go!

1523
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,460
(Se Chan succeeds in his challenge.)

1524
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,750
I'm the man
who's lucky with little things!

1525
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,130
Everyone will lose 200 dollars.

1526
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:35,150
All right!

1527
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,130
Jae Suk has 600 dollars.

1528
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,420
Haha has 300 dollars.

1529
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,190
Jong Kook has 200 dollars.

1530
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:41,540
Ji Hyo has 100 dollars.

1531
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:42,860
So Min has 100 dollars.

1532
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,230
Suk Jin has minus 200 dollars.

1533
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:45,300
All right!

1534
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,210
Now let's move to have lunch.

1535
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,270
- All right!
- Yes!

1536
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,770
Guys, you must be hungry.

1537
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:53,400
- Yes, we are.
- Yes, I'm starving.

1538
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,250
Today's lunch menu...

1539
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,440
will be decided by your choice.

1540
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,380
This time, you'll also choose
one button...

1541
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,920
just like you did earlier.

1542
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,750
I should go with the safe option
for food.

1543
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:06,130
The safe button...

1544
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:08,090
will provide basic side dishes
and rice.

1545
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:09,520
Two pieces of ham? It's not bad.

1546
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,860
I like fried eggs and ham.

1547
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,170
Those side dishes are good.

1548
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:15,130
For the red button, if you succeed,

1549
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:17,070
you'll get marinated grilled duck
and chicken and seafood soup.

1550
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:18,570
They sound delicious.

1551
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:21,800
It's too tempting
to have the duck and soup.

1552
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,340
If you fail, you'll get rice
and stir-fried gochujang.

1553
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,270
I'm so torn.

1554
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:28,320
- I love the duck dish.
- I'm torn by the soup.

1555
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,920
It's about time
to consume some protein.

1556
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,710
- I must have the soup.
- I'm going to take the chance.

1557
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,480
- I'll give it a try.
- I'll give it a try anyway.

1558
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,650
That's right.
Let's just give it a try.

1559
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,960
The lucky ones will always be lucky.

1560
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:39,590
(Fail: Se Chan, Haha,
Suk Jin, Jae Suk)

1561
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:40,590
Yes!

1562
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:41,900
Let's have some duck.

1563
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,130
I think we can eat it.

1564
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:44,730
(High-protein chicken
and seafood soup...)

1565
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,800
(and marinated grilled duck
that invigorate you)

1566
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,860
We can eat it right away.

1567
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,670
Perfect timing. It's about time
to take in some protein.

1568
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:50,960
It's so good.

1569
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,340
- You guys are so mean.
- You're not giving us dried laver?

1570
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,540
(The four who failed get only rice
and stir-fried gochujang.)

1571
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,540
Are you serious?

1572
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,710
- You knew the options.
- Give us dried laver, at least.

1573
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:00,300
You should give us dried laver,
at least.

1574
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,820
- It was your choice.
- You punk. Dried laver...

1575
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,920
You guys, don't be so mean.

1576
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:07,550
Give us the fried egg and ham.

1577
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,710
Why didn't you succeed then?

1578
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,920
- What?
- Why didn't you succeed then?

1579
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,130
"Why didn't you succeed then"?

1580
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:17,230
("Why didn't you succeed then"?)

1581
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,730
(He yells at Jong Kook.)

1582
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:20,070
- Wow, Jae Suk.
- Jong Kook.

1583
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,070
(He yelled without thinking
of the consequences.)

1584
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:22,670
Don't get on his nerves.

1585
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:24,400
- Come on, Jae Suk.
- Jong Kook...

1586
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,400
(Flustered)

1587
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,540
(Don't get on his nerves.)

1588
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,110
He was about to open his mind.
Why did you yell at him?

1589
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,230
So Min, I'll give you 20 dollars
for a fried egg and ham.

1590
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,980
- If he pays 20 dollars...
- Good idea.

1591
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,400
- I'll give you 20 dollars each.
- What do you think?

1592
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,840
Let's make him pay 30 dollars
and divide it among us.

1593
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,840
She lowered the price for you.

1594
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,880
She will give them to you
for 30 dollars.

1595
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,290
Okay. I'll give you
ten dollars each.

1596
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,880
- You can have it.
- Okay, ten dollars each.

1597
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,880
I'll give them ten dollars each.

1598
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,050
I'll also give you ten dollars each.

1599
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:45,650
Then Jae Suk will also pay
30 dollars.

1600
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:47,130
- I'll pay 30 dollars for it.
- I got 20 dollars.

1601
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,250
- I got 20 dollars.
- Why did you give it to him?

1602
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,360
Me too.

1603
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,590
Jae Suk, it's really good.

1604
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,730
I know. With these,
we can enjoy our lunch.

1605
00:50:58,070 --> 00:50:59,210
Let me try a piece.

1606
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:00,460
- How much?
- Let me have some.

1607
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,630
(Haha brazenly tries
to take Jae Suk's ham.)

1608
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:02,840
- You...
- Just let me have a piece.

1609
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,210
- You should pay me three dollars.
- That's nonsense.

1610
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,550
Give back my 20 dollars.

1611
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,400
Did you hear what Jae Suk said?

1612
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,570
When I tried to take this,
he told me to pay him three dollars.

1613
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,590
- "Pay me three dollars."
- I need to make some money too.

1614
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:14,960
How much is this again?

1615
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,520
This is 100 dollars.

1616
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,480
Ji Hyo, isn't the duck dish
60 dollars?

1617
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,520
It's 60 dollars.

1618
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,090
Come on, that's too little.

1619
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:23,130
- We're giving you a lot.
- Here's your 30 dollars.

1620
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,500
- We're giving you a lot.
- Wait.

1621
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,690
Haha...

1622
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:29,360
Wait. Haha ate mine.

1623
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:31,400
- How could you?
- What?

1624
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,230
Where did my fried egg go?

1625
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,340
(Se Chan's fried egg is missing.)

1626
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,210
- Don't do this to me.
- What are you talking about?

1627
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,000
- You should pay for it.
- This is absurd.

1628
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,050
What are you talking about?

1629
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:42,210
You stole my egg.

1630
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:43,210
(The precious egg he paid 30 dollars
for disappeared in an instant.)

1631
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,290
- How could you?
- I didn't take it.

1632
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,520
Or...

1633
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,320
Did you take my fried egg?

1634
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,380
No, I didn't. It's mine.

1635
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,710
I swear I didn't take it.

1636
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:52,480
Then who took my egg?

1637
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:55,190
Gosh, this is annoying.
How could you steal it?

1638
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,770
You stole the side dish
from my poor meal.

1639
00:51:58,770 --> 00:51:59,960
(You stole the side dish
from my poor meal.)

1640
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,400
(The petty thief who even steals
rice from the poor meal is...)

1641
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:05,670
- Yes! It's ten dollars each.
- How much is that?

1642
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:09,210
(He quickly and skillfully
steals Se Chan's egg.)

1643
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,210
(Playing innocent)

1644
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,050
(Startled)

1645
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,880
Could you give me just one ladle
of soup?

1646
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:15,150
- One ladle?
- Yes.

1647
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,520
- Can't you just give us some?
- Here's one ladle of it.

1648
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,820
- That's enough.
- Can I try a wrap?

1649
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:19,940
No, that's not allowed.

1650
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,190
(He returns happily
after getting some soup.)

1651
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:25,320
- Who took my ham?
- Give me some too.

1652
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,380
(This time,
Jae Suk's ham is missing.)

1653
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,050
- Hey.
- Hold on.

1654
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,800
- This is ten dollars?
- Where did my ham go?

1655
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,300
- This is...
- Hey!

1656
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,000
- When he takes his eyes off it...
- Hey!

1657
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,570
Me? Is he calling me?

1658
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,500
- Is he calling me?
- No idea.

1659
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,770
Where did my ham go?

1660
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:40,210
- It's five dollars.
- He didn't call me.

1661
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:41,210
Hey!

1662
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:42,480
(Serious)

1663
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,300
- Hey.
- Can I join your table?

1664
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,250
- Hey, was it you?
- You need to get her permission.

1665
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,110
I told you it wasn't me.

1666
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:49,380
- Was it you?
- Why would I steal it...

1667
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,380
when I know I'll be busted?

1668
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,050
Look at him. Check his pockets.

1669
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56,960
(The real culprit Jae Suk
is desperately looking for...)

1670
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,920
(While Jae Suk went to beg
for some soup...)

1671
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,020
(Stealing his ham
at the speed of light)

1672
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,000
(He doesn't care for his teammate.
He's an expert on stealing food.)

1673
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,460
Gosh, this is frustrating.

1674
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,300
You stole it, right?

1675
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,130
- You're just...
- Haha is...

1676
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:14,400
Don't you even have
respect for yourself?

1677
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,400
No.

1678
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,070
Let me tell you something
while you're eating.

1679
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,050
You'll hide something
in the next mission.

1680
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:22,820
- But you won't be hiding chalk.
- Then what is it?

1681
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,480
It'll be a team game.

1682
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,090
You'll be divided into teams of 2,
and 1 will play alone.

1683
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,190
Teams of 2 and 1 plays alone?

1684
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:29,590
- Let's pick our partners then.
- Okay.

1685
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,320
All right! I got Jong Kook.

1686
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,960
- Yes! I got Se Chan!
- This is nice!

1687
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,300
What's this? Is it water?

1688
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,630
It's water in a bucket?

1689
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,500
- What is it?
- The object you'll hide...

1690
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,590
in this round...

1691
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,300
is slime, also known as
a liquid monster.

1692
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,040
How are we supposed to hide this?

1693
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:46,630
- We need to hide this?
- Yes.

1694
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,900
- It's a team game?
- This is driving me crazy.

1695
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,130
We might spill it.

1696
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,770
It looks like sticky rice cake.

1697
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,670
How do we get rid of this?

1698
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:56,250
How do we throw this away?

1699
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,650
- Other teams'...
- You can hide or destroy...

1700
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:59,050
other teams' slime.

1701
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:02,210
You can steal theirs
and stick them on yours.

1702
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:04,550
- We should take theirs.
- We should.

1703
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:05,790
And we shouldn't let them take ours.

1704
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:07,380
It's more important
to keep ours intact.

1705
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:08,820
What's this? Is this it?

1706
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,090
- Yes, this is it.
- This rice cake?

1707
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,820
(What's this? Is this it?)

1708
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,070
Do we take others' slime?

1709
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:14,090
It's slime. Try touching it.

1710
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,590
- Oh, I see.
- Doesn't it feel nice?

1711
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:16,900
It can stretch.

1712
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,230
I thought it was rice cake.

1713
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:19,500
So we take other's slime?

1714
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:23,670
Hey, shall we make some noodles?

1715
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,500
Do you know how to make
hand-pulled noodles?

1716
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:27,150
This is how you do it.

1717
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:28,880
(This is how you do it.)

1718
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,650
So you've seen a few things.
Oh, gosh.

1719
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:35,860
What's wrong with you?
Why do you keep causing trouble?

1720
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,860
- Goodness. Oh, gosh.
- Be careful.

1721
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:40,790
(They should come up with a plan
to guard their slime now.)

1722
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:41,820
Suk Jin.

1723
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,320
(They should come up with a plan
to guard their slime now.)

1724
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:45,630
- This is...
- Put it in your cap.

1725
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,400
Does it look like a scarf?
Or a liquid monster?

1726
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:51,770
You should put this much
in your cap.

1727
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,460
But it's so obvious, right?

1728
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,570
(Screaming)

1729
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,500
- Can you get this off me?
- Hey.

1730
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,800
Hey, you're in trouble.

1731
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:02,520
- What?
- This is... How do I get it off?

1732
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:03,820
I think you should cut your hair.

1733
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,020
- Wait. I'll put it in the water.
- You're in trouble.

1734
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,980
- My goodness.
- You're seriously...

1735
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:09,460
What are you doing?

1736
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,290
You're in trouble. What do we do?

1737
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:14,460
Put this in the water.

1738
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,300
- Wait. I'll go wash it off inside.
- It won't work.

1739
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,190
- Hold on.
- My goodness.

1740
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,190
I didn't know it'd get stuck
like that.

1741
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,230
Don't come in.

1742
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:23,840
- This is unbelievable.
- My goodness.

1743
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,130
(With a big sigh, he struggles to
get it off inside the restroom.)

1744
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:29,040
How come it doesn't come off?

1745
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,900
- My gosh.
- Are you done?

1746
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,000
Sorry?

1747
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,250
Did it come off?

1748
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,420
(He shyly comes back
after washing his hair.)

1749
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,880
Let me see.

1750
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,650
I knew you were going overboard.
You're so mischievous.

1751
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:42,480
Goodness. Did you see this, kids?

1752
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:44,980
Don't put slime in your hair.

1753
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,320
Shall we hide the whole thing?

1754
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,320
Shall we hide it
in our cameraman's case?

1755
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,500
I did earlier,

1756
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,500
and I didn't get caught.

1757
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,820
(They're thinking of hiding it
inside the staff's case.)

1758
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,770
Goodness, it's huge.

1759
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,400
(Approaching the camera case
with their slime)

1760
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,250
Oh, no. I'm in trouble.

1761
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,770
It's stuck.

1762
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:08,820
(A slime disaster)

1763
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,020
(Ji Hyo is packing the slime
in a plastic bag.)

1764
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,050
Oh, no. Ji Hyo...

1765
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:14,380
(So Min calls Ji Hyo
in a timid tone.)

1766
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,420
- What?
- I didn't mean to...

1767
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,820
I didn't know it'd get stuck.

1768
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:21,090
I told you to put it in a bag.

1769
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:22,960
- I...
- Hey.

1770
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,320
(She became one with the slime.)

1771
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,570
I really didn't know.

1772
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:28,300
Come here.

1773
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,210
Goodness,
you're one troublesome girl.

1774
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,300
- I can't believe it.
- What do we do?

1775
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:35,900
Okay.

1776
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:37,770
- I don't think they'll open it.
- Suk Jin.

1777
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,400
No one would use
that elevator, would they?

1778
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,400
Right?

1779
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,610
We'll start now.

1780
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:42,610
Hold on.

1781
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:44,050
(Jae Suk found an elevator
right before the start.)

1782
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:45,290
Suk Jin, let's hide it here.

1783
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:47,380
- Let's put it here.
- Like this.

1784
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,460
(Concealing their slime
with a bucket and a rag)

1785
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,960
Let's make it look like
someone is cleaning it. Hold on.

1786
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,960
(Let's make it look like
someone is cleaning it. Hold on.)

1787
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,820
I think it's a really good idea.

1788
00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:00,670
(Perfectly concealing the slime
with the cleaning supplies)

1789
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:02,590
- Here.
- Like this?

1790
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,340
- This is amazing.
- Let's go.

1791
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,440
They wouldn't open that.

1792
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,570
They wouldn't use the elevator.

1793
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,900
(Haha, who's playing it alone,)

1794
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,420
(tries to throw the whole thing
out the window.)

1795
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,710
I'll pick it up later.

1796
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:21,480
I'll use a stick to pick it up.

1797
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,650
Hey, where are you going?

1798
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:27,090
Where are you going? I'm going to
hide it in your bag. What's wrong?

1799
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,000
I'll leave some here.

1800
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
(Putting a bit of their slime
in the cameraman's bag)

1801
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,320
(She hides
the rest of their slime...)

1802
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:36,460
(behind the staff.)

1803
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,710
Please. I beg you.

1804
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:39,940
Please don't make it obvious.

1805
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,040
(So Min's strategy is to hide it
using many staff members.)

1806
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,710
We'll start the mission now.

1807
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,400
(Mission starts.)

1808
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,840
- My phone...
- Leave the phone here.

1809
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,840
- Are you done hiding yours?
- Gosh, you startled me.

1810
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:49,210
- Are you done hiding yours?
- Are you done?

1811
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,270
- What is it?
- I mean...

1812
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:53,790
- Why did you run over here?
- I heard you washed your hair.

1813
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:55,550
Because it got stuck in your hair.

1814
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:57,110
Did the word spread already?

1815
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,380
- Yes.
- I heard you washed your hair.

1816
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,480
Is that yours? So that's yours.

1817
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,420
- Jong Kook.
- Yes.

1818
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,550
Where did you hide it?

1819
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,570
Wait a minute. This is...

1820
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,690
- What's this on your back?
- What?

1821
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,570
- What?
- Jong Kook.

1822
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,360
- Jong Kook, come over here.
- What?

1823
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,540
Suk Jin, your slime is melting.

1824
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:18,400
- What are you doing?
- Show me your back.

1825
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,380
- What?
- What is this?

1826
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:22,340
Gosh, you should just take it off.

1827
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,020
That was hilarious.

1828
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,650
- I can mix it with mine, right?
- Yes, you can.

1829
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:27,940
It's important to have ours intact.

1830
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:31,020
(Ji Hyo plans to guard the spot
where she hid her slime.)

1831
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,320
Ji Hyo, what are you doing?

1832
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,590
(Ji Hyo, what are you doing?)

1833
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,500
(Jae Suk came to find Ji Hyo
like a demon.)

1834
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,520
What is it?

1835
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,190
You're on this team?
You hid it here?

1836
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,000
Here? No, I came to find something.

1837
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:43,940
I'm looking for other teams' slime.

1838
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:45,190
Gosh, it's hot.

1839
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,610
(The spot where Ji Hyo
walked past...)

1840
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:53,300
(is where So Min hid her slime.)

1841
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,440
You just got out of here?

1842
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:58,480
(Jae Suk already knows
Ji Hyo's habit.)

1843
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,480
It's hard to find one.

1844
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,480
(He thoroughly looks for slime
in nearby objects.)

1845
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,820
It's not here.

1846
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:12,960
It's sliding down. Wait.

1847
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:14,190
Hold on.

1848
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:16,630
Did you drop something?

1849
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,300
- Wait.
- Jae Suk.

1850
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,570
(Jae Suk ends up finding
the slime So Min hid.)

1851
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:21,000
Why did you have to find this?

1852
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:24,000
- It's ours!
- It's sliding down.

1853
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
(The cameraman runs away.)

1854
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:28,610
What's this? It's running down
from the bag.

1855
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:29,710
(He found plenty of slimes.)

1856
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:31,520
Jae Suk! Give it to me.

1857
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:32,590
Give it back!

1858
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:33,650
(Give it back!)

1859
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,690
Give it to me...

1860
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:36,880
(He meticulously collects the slime
the cameraman took off.)

1861
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,420
Why did you give it to him?
You should've given it to me!

1862
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:42,690
Darn it! Why did you give it to him?

1863
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:43,690
(The slime owner is sad
to lose even 1g of slime.)

1864
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:44,690
What's going on?

1865
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:46,820
- So Min.
- What's going on?

1866
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,960
- Where did it go?
- What happened?

1867
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,000
- It slid down.
- Hey! Where did my slime go?

1868
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,460
Yours slid down the bag.

1869
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,300
I could save only this bit.

1870
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,540
You promised to guard it.

1871
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:59,610
You promised... I'm so sorry.

1872
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:01,610
- So Min...
- I'm sorry.

1873
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:03,710
You put him in trouble.

1874
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:05,550
I'm so sorry.

1875
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:08,690
I'm sorry. I caused all this mess.

1876
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,650
I'm sorry.

1877
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:14,190
I didn't know it was that hard
to take it off.

1878
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:17,520
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1879
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,770
I feel so bad.

1880
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,020
(Ji Hyo and So Min
lost a lot of their slime.)

1881
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,770
Time over.

1882
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:26,000
As a result.

1883
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,670
Ji Hyo and So Min
are in the bottom place.

1884
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:29,670
Play rock-paper-scissors.

1885
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:31,500
Either one of you
will be in the bottom place.

1886
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,670
The cameraman was sitting on it,
and it ran down the chair.

1887
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:35,940
(Jae Suk shares the details
of the story.)

1888
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:36,980
Really?

1889
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:38,980
- You two are at the bottom.
- Rock-paper-scissors

1890
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,750
- That's right.
- Ji Hyo is in the bottom place.

1891
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:44,460
- Don't talk to me.
- Bring in the buttons.

1892
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:47,050
So Min, could you move?

1893
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:48,960
(He's bringing another button?)

1894
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,230
How come there are two?

1895
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,050
What's this?

1896
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,230
(What is it?)

1897
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,190
- There's "Lucky".
- There is?

1898
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:57,300
What does "Vague" mean?

1899
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,960
Everyone, we have another button.

1900
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,040
- Yes.
- What's this?

1901
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,210
This will put you to the test.

1902
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:04,940
We added another button.

1903
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:10,270
From now, you'll have a blue button
where you can go for "Lucky".

1904
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,920
If you choose the blue button,

1905
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,750
you'll get 1,000 dollars
if the ball ends up in "Lucky".

1906
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:14,840
We'll get 1,000 dollars?

1907
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,380
(Lucky, Vague, and Unlucky)

1908
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,250
If you get Vague,
you will get 100 dollars...

1909
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,090
and other people will get
200 dollars.

1910
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,250
- Vague would be nice for us.
- I know.

1911
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,300
- Jae Suk, thank you in advance.
- I hope people get Vague.

1912
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,670
- What happens if you get Vague?
- If you get Unlucky,

1913
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:28,170
only you will lose 300 dollars.

1914
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,230
My goodness.

1915
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,000
You could lose 300 dollars.

1916
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,110
If you lose that much...

1917
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:35,980
- Let's see how it goes.
- Shall I go first?

1918
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,400
- Okay.
- Here I go.

1919
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:39,340
- I will press the blue button.
- Let's go.

1920
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,710
It will be good for you
if I get Vague.

1921
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:43,340
- Let's go.
- For everyone else, 200 dollars.

1922
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,210
In 1, 2.

1923
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:46,340
(Lucky, Vague, and Unlucky)

1924
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,980
- I hope he gets Vague.
- I hope I get Lucky.

1925
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:49,320
- Vague.
- Go.

1926
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:51,020
- Go.
- Vague.

1927
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:52,250
Vague.

1928
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,690
- Turn.
- Vague.

1929
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:55,460
- Please let him get Vague.
- Turn.

1930
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,520
(Se Chan hopes for Lucky
and everyone else hopes for Vague.)

1931
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,250
- Turn.
- Vague.

1932
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,320
- Gosh.
- Unlucky.

1933
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,360
(Se Chan loses 300 dollars.)

1934
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:05,540
- Hold on.
- He should have gotten Vague.

1935
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:06,710
This is driving me crazy.

1936
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:08,460
- I am so annoyed.
- Gosh.

1937
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:10,940
Se Chan went first and got Unlucky.

1938
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,110
- I don't want to take chances.
- I can't press the blue button.

1939
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,150
Are you scared?

1940
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,210
- You won't be at the bottom.
- With Vague, you get 100 dollars.

1941
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:17,210
Do you want to go first?

1942
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:19,210
- Go first.
- Okay. I will go.

1943
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:20,980
- It's an individual match...
- Go.

1944
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,710
- anyway.
- I don't like this color.

1945
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:23,860
I will use a red one.

1946
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,380
(He chooses the blue button
with hopes for Lucky.)

1947
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,630
- I need this.
- With Lucky, you win 1,000 dollars.

1948
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:30,630
- I am at minus 210 dollars.
- I want to see someone get Lucky.

1949
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:32,500
- I need this.
- He is at minus 210 dollars.

1950
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,590
I really need this.

1951
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,170
- He needs Lucky.
- I am at minus 210 dollars.

1952
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:36,570
- Go.
- I will get it.

1953
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,190
Let's go.

1954
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,630
Let's go.

1955
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:41,300
No, don't go there.

1956
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,610
(Will he turn the tables
with Lucky?)

1957
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:45,940
- I need to start over.
- Okay.

1958
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,550
(In reality, he's always unlucky.)

1959
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,670
- I need to start over.
- No.

1960
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:50,920
- You are done.
- No.

1961
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:51,980
No.

1962
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:53,920
- I need to start over.
- Unlucky.

1963
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:55,050
Unlucky.

1964
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,980
- I need to start over.
- All right.

1965
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:58,290
It can't be helped.

1966
01:02:58,290 --> 01:02:59,380
So Min.

1967
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:02,630
Let me remind you
that there are other two buttons.

1968
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:03,960
Come on.

1969
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,300
Come on. Go with the blue button.

1970
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:08,670
There you go. That's So Min.

1971
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:09,670
So Min, that's good.

1972
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:10,770
There you go. That's So Min.

1973
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:11,940
So Min, that's good.

1974
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,900
- Lucky. Vague.
- Vague.

1975
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,800
- Lucky. Vague.
- Vague.

1976
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,300
- Vague.
- Vague.

1977
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,300
- Vague.
- Nice.

1978
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,110
- Vague.
- Vague.

1979
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:22,710
- Nice. 200 dollars.
- 200 dollars.

1980
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:23,820
(So Min gets 100 dollars
and everyone else gets 200 dollars.)

1981
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,980
- Okay.
- 200 dollars.

1982
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,150
Do I get 200 dollars as well?

1983
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:27,320
Then it's minus 310 dollars.

1984
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,750
I will be set
if people get Vague two times.

1985
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,520
Okay.

1986
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,960
All right. I will go next.

1987
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:33,590
I think he will get Lucky.

1988
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:35,050
- Vague.
- Let's get Lucky.

1989
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:37,090
- I think he will get Lucky.
- Let's surprise the world.

1990
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:41,300
Go. It's out. He will get Lucky.

1991
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,460
- Come on.
- He will get Lucky.

1992
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,900
(Is the ball heading towards Lucky?)

1993
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,360
- He will get Lucky.
- Vague.

1994
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,400
Lucky.

1995
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,070
(He gets Lucky.)

1996
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:51,840
(He gets 1,000 dollars.)

1997
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,210
He got 1,000 dollars.

1998
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,610
- He is so lucky.
- He got 1,000 dollars.

1999
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:57,050
(The former unlucky member
got his big break.)

2000
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:58,110
That came out of nowhere.

2001
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,090
How much will he get today?

2002
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:03,250
- No way.
- This is driving me crazy.

2003
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:04,480
He got 1,000 dollars.

2004
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,610
Is this even possible?

2005
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:06,920
Is this even possible?

2006
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:08,480
All right. Next.

2007
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:10,960
- You are cool.
- He got Lucky with a yellow ball.

2008
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,460
- I used a yellow ball earlier.
- A red ball.

2009
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,590
Give it to me.
Let me use a yellow ball.

2010
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:14,630
(This won't do.)

2011
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,690
- Use a yellow ball.
- He got Lucky with a yellow ball.

2012
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,340
Is no one going to choose
the safe option?

2013
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:21,110
(He erased the safe option
from his brain.)

2014
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:22,900
You should strive to get Lucky.

2015
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:25,480
Press it short and hard.

2016
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,980
How did you get Lucky?

2017
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:29,520
- There you go.
- Let's go.

2018
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,940
- Vague.
- That's good.

2019
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,550
- He did it.
- Lucky.

2020
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:34,480
- Vague.
- That's good.

2021
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,150
- Vague.
- For goodness' sake.

2022
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:40,550
(We got 200 dollars.)

2023
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,460
- All right.
- Okay.

2024
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,090
Let's make money
without doing anything.

2025
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,860
I will be set
if one more person gets Vague.

2026
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,360
(Haha benefited the others.)

2027
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,940
- You haven't gone yet.
- Who hasn't gone yet?

2028
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,860
- Me.
- Jong Kook, go ahead.

2029
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:53,860
- Jong Kook.
- Okay.

2030
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:54,960
Hey.

2031
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,800
(He chooses the safe option
4 times in a row.)

2032
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,070
Come on.

2033
01:04:58,110 --> 01:04:59,170
- What?
- What?

2034
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:01,710
- Okay.
- I can't believe you pressed it.

2035
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:03,440
Live life like Kim Jong Kook!

2036
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:06,550
- What was that?
- I can't believe you pressed it.

2037
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:08,150
- It wasn't even the red button.
- It makes no sense.

2038
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:09,610
I made a lot of money
without doing anything.

2039
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:10,920
You didn't even agonize over it.

2040
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,150
I don't agonize over things.

2041
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:15,190
I am on a smooth sail.

2042
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:16,630
- How much do you have?
- I have 820 dollars.

2043
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:17,860
I have 820 dollars.

2044
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:19,400
- You only chose the safe option.
- Yes.

2045
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:21,400
Okay.

2046
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,900
- Ji Hyo, you are last.
- Ji Hyo.

2047
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,940
You are at the bottom.
If you get Lucky,

2048
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:28,540
you can steal 300 dollars
from a member of your choice.

2049
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,400
If you get Vague,

2050
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,300
three members including yourself
must pay 100 dollars.

2051
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:33,300
If you Unlucky,

2052
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,340
you must give 300 dollars
to a member of your choice.

2053
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:36,570
(Lucky, Vague, and Unlucky)

2054
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:37,750
Understood?

2055
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,380
You either win 300 dollars...

2056
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:40,840
- or lose money.
- Ji Hyo.

2057
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:45,150
Making everyone else lose
200 dollars isn't half bad.

2058
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:47,590
Making everyone else lose
200 dollars isn't half bad.

2059
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:49,320
It's 300 dollars versus 200 dollars.

2060
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,300
Aren't the chances better
for 200 dollars?

2061
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,570
I will go for 200 dollars.

2062
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:54,360
(She chooses the 50-percent chance.)

2063
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:55,800
If you get Failure...

2064
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,730
- She will get Success.
- I think she will get Success.

2065
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,500
I think she will get Success.

2066
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,000
(Who will lose 200 dollars,
everyone else or Ji Hyo?)

2067
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:02,980
- Failure.
- You lose 200 dollars.

2068
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,300
You lose 200 dollars.

2069
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:06,770
- My goodness.
- Currently,

2070
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:08,980
Suk Jin has minus 110 dollars.

2071
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:11,020
No pain, no gain.

2072
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,170
You should know that.

2073
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:13,520
There is ice water.

2074
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,650
(They face the next mission
after learning a life mission.)

2075
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:16,520
I am glad since the day is hot.

2076
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,190
This mission will involve...

2077
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:21,790
the mascots of the show...

2078
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,050
who come to mind
when you think of English.

2079
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,460
The two youngest members.

2080
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:27,190
Are we taking the spotlight?

2081
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:29,190
Se Chan and So Min will give
the questions...

2082
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:30,590
of Speed Quiz.

2083
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,670
But you can only explain in English.

2084
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:33,860
(But you can only explain
in English.)

2085
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,610
But you can only explain in English.

2086
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:36,730
What?

2087
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:38,710
- What?
- The two of them...

2088
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,000
I think So Min would do better.

2089
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,480
- So Min would do better.
- But I have...

2090
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,270
quick wits.

2091
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,920
- Conversational English.
- Okay.

2092
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,050
However,

2093
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:50,360
you aren't allowed to use your body
or say a person's name.

2094
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,460
- Everything should be in English.
- That's right.

2095
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:56,130
The five of you need to answer
with your feet in the ice water.

2096
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:59,170
The person who does the worst
will be the loser.

2097
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:00,420
So Min.

2098
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,840
I am getting goosebumps already.

2099
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,630
I have gone abroad with Se Chan.

2100
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:06,770
- How are his English skills?
- Se Chan?

2101
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:08,300
He always gets caught
at Immigration.

2102
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:10,210
- I keep going, "What?"
- It's just him.

2103
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,300
- Do you have a drug?
- Yes.

2104
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:14,550
Why?

2105
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:16,880
(He always says "Yes"
when he doesn't understand.)

2106
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,920
All right.

2107
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:19,710
- The questions...
- I have a question.

2108
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:21,820
Since when did So Min stoop so low?

2109
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,110
What happened to you?

2110
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,360
It has always been this way for me.

2111
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,090
- What happened to you?
- This is intense.

2112
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:30,690
I am joking when I say this.

2113
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:32,690
- I think I have a fever.
- My heart is beating so fast.

2114
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:33,960
Let's begin.

2115
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,690
Let's go. Show her the keyword.

2116
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,400
- Go ahead.
- My goodness.

2117
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,630
Go ahead.

2118
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,730
Oh, my gosh.

2119
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:43,730
- Come on.
- Watch. Oh, my gosh.

2120
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:45,040
- Cow cancel.
- What?

2121
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,340
Cow cancel.

2122
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:47,880
- What? Cow cancel?
- Cow cancel?

2123
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,670
- Cow cancel?
- Did you say "Castle"?

2124
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:51,570
- Castle.
- Oh, my gosh.

2125
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:53,920
(What is she saying?)

2126
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:57,020
What is "Cow cancel"?

2127
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:58,590
What is "Cow cancel"?

2128
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:00,860
(The answer: Fix the shed
after losing a cow.)

2129
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:03,460
I am seriously in tears.

2130
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:06,230
- This is so embarrassing.
- What is "Cow cancel"?

2131
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:08,070
- Dropping charges?
- Canceling.

2132
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,170
- Dropping charges?
- Canceling.

2133
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,440
- This is so embarrassing.
- Dropping charges?

2134
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:12,730
Cow cancel.

2135
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,670
Cow. Cow cancel.

2136
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:17,040
- "Cancel"?
- Oh, my gosh.

2137
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:20,170
Cow house. After-sales service.

2138
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,480
(Cow, house, after-sales service?)

2139
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,570
Let me answer.

2140
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:26,480
- Fix the shed after losing a cow.
- Fix the shed after losing a cow.

2141
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,640
- Fix the shed after losing a cow.
- Jae Suk is correct.

2142
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:31,110
(I was close.)

2143
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:32,720
- You got the meaning across.
- That's right.

2144
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,480
- The last part helped.
- Cow cancel.

2145
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:35,820
Why?

2146
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:38,150
Why?

2147
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:39,430
Say the last part too.

2148
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:40,430
Oh, my gosh.

2149
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:42,500
Oh, my gosh. Why?

2150
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:44,430
You... You know...

2151
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:46,510
- Is it the next question?
- I don't know. Speaking.

2152
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:47,810
Words travel fast.

2153
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:49,310
- No.
- "Speaking"?

2154
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,810
My...

2155
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:53,640
My answer. I answer.

2156
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,770
"My answer"?

2157
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:57,010
(Give an irrelevant answer.)

2158
01:08:57,010 --> 01:08:58,810
- Hurry up.
- My answer.

2159
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,250
- Answer.
- My goodness.

2160
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,550
My... My question.

2161
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:04,480
- Nice words for nice words.
- No.

2162
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,720
My question.

2163
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,460
You. Why?

2164
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:08,850
- Why?
- For goodness' sake.

2165
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:10,460
Why?

2166
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:13,670
(It would be strange
if they answer this correctly.)

2167
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:15,360
- Why?
- Thank you, So Min.

2168
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,340
Let me answer.
Give an irrelevant answer.

2169
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:20,310
("Give an irrelevant answer"
is correct.)

2170
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,730
How did you get it right?

2171
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,010
How are we supposed to get it right?

2172
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:24,180
- Everyone.
- All right.

2173
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,180
(Gandhi)

2174
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:26,440
How will they get this right?

2175
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,140
(It's a difficult question.)

2176
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:30,110
You should tell us
if it's a proverb or a word.

2177
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:31,270
We need to yell
"Let me answer" first, right?

2178
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:35,850
- Celebrity.
- What?

2179
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:37,090
- Celebrity.
- What?

2180
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:38,310
Celebrity!

2181
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,560
Let me answer.

2182
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:42,060
Let me answer. Celebrity.

2183
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:44,560
(Embarrassment hits her again.)

2184
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,220
I wouldn't be able
to keep my chin up.

2185
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:48,260
Keep going.

2186
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,730
So Min, he is a celebrity.

2187
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:51,230
- Yes.
- Celebrity?

2188
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,900
I don't know what to say.
I can't think of the word.

2189
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:56,230
(Gandhi)

2190
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:58,010
No hair.

2191
01:09:58,210 --> 01:09:59,470
- No hair.
- Let me answer.

2192
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:00,770
Hong Seok Cheon.

2193
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:02,550
- No. While he is a celebrity...
- Are we guessing right now?

2194
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:03,610
Celebrity?

2195
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:07,050
- Always.
- Always.

2196
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:08,350
- Always.
- Sit.

2197
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:10,180
(Does he always sit?)

2198
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,220
Gandhi.

2199
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:13,290
Gandhi.

2200
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:14,930
(Empty Heads understand each other.)

2201
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:15,980
Is he a celebrity?

2202
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:18,150
- Is he a celebrity?
- A celebrity.

2203
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:19,970
A celebrity with no hair.

2204
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,860
A celebrity with no hair
who always sits.

2205
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,300
(Ordinary people
wouldn't understand.)

2206
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,060
- That was incredible.
- Celebrity.

2207
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,340
- Celebrity.
- Okay.

2208
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:29,810
- Next.
- That was incredible.

2209
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:31,510
(They move on to the next question.)

2210
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:33,640
Let me think...

2211
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:34,810
Oh, my gosh.

2212
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:36,570
- Oh, my gosh.
- Why does she keep saying that?

2213
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:38,850
- She keeps saying that.
- Okay.

2214
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:41,250
- One.
- One.

2215
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:42,350
One.

2216
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,060
One. Oh, my gosh.

2217
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:45,460
Nine. One.

2218
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:46,760
- Nine. One.
- Let me answer.

2219
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:48,350
Nine, four, one.

2220
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:50,850
- Nine, four, one.
- Yes. No.

2221
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:53,630
On my birthday...

2222
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,470
Did you just speak Korean?

2223
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:56,840
- That's 941.
- Nine.

2224
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:59,170
- What does 941 represent?
- Nine.

2225
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:01,040
- "Nine, four, one"?
- I don't know.

2226
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,010
I don't speak English.

2227
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:04,970
Ending.

2228
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:06,710
Let me answer.

2229
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:08,050
Nine,

2230
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:10,420
- four, one. I don't know.
- Let me answer.

2231
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:11,640
- I don't know.
- Let me answer. A narrow escape.

2232
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,790
Okay.

2233
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:14,350
(Correct!)

2234
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:16,090
(Okay.)

2235
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:17,150
For goodness' sake.

2236
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:18,310
(She used numbers
that are homonyms.)

2237
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:19,560
"Nine, four, one"?

2238
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:22,390
(So Min got saved
thanks to "9, 4, 1".)

2239
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:24,320
- Nine.
- You are good.

2240
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,320
I have a chance.

2241
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,690
She is good. You will lose.

2242
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:28,760
No. I have a chance of winning.

2243
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,260
(They move on to the next question
in a shocked state.)

2244
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:32,190
I am... Headache.

2245
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:33,670
- Headache.
- Headache.

2246
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:35,510
- Headache.
- You have a headache.

2247
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:37,680
Ge... Geworin.

2248
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:39,810
Not Geworin.

2249
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:41,210
Headache.

2250
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:42,350
Many...

2251
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,640
You said "Many" in Korean.

2252
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,010
Headache, but...

2253
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,290
It's...

2254
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:48,680
(Laughing)

2255
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:51,060
Here is the thing. By implication...

2256
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:53,260
By implication...

2257
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:55,590
(She uses Korean
without holding back.)

2258
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:58,690
- Dog.
- Dog.

2259
01:11:58,690 --> 01:11:59,800
Poo-poo.

2260
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,320
- Dog poop.
- Let me answer.

2261
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,760
- Let me answer.
- No dog poop for medicine.

2262
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,860
No dog poop for medicine.

2263
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:05,140
You need to say
"Let me answer" first.

2264
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:06,400
No dog poop for medicine.

2265
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,230
You need to say
"Let me answer" first.

2266
01:12:08,230 --> 01:12:09,510
- That's right.
- It's over.

2267
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:10,770
How many questions did they answer?

2268
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:11,880
I can't do this.

2269
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,770
- It's so hard.
- It's over.

2270
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:15,850
- Jong Kook is in the first place.
- Okay.

2271
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:18,140
Do you know how frustrating it is?

2272
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:21,640
I couldn't remember the words
that were on the tip of my tongue.

2273
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:22,980
- They just kept circling my mind.
- The next questions.

2274
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,060
- Okay.
- Get ready.

2275
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,590
- I will deliver the key points.
- Go.

2276
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:26,590
Set.

2277
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:29,560
Listen. Let's go.

2278
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:30,630
Set, go.

2279
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:32,600
(The most extraordinary idea)

2280
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,690
(My goodness.)

2281
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:35,390
- Gosh.
- This one is hard.

2282
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:37,390
- Celebrity?
- No.

2283
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:38,730
- Four.
- Four words?

2284
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:40,010
Yes. Four words.

2285
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:41,970
The answer has four words.

2286
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:43,380
- Yes.
- Four words.

2287
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:46,270
How am I supposed to explain this?

2288
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:48,050
Explain the first word.

2289
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:49,250
(Haha asks him to explain
each word.)

2290
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,970
- I told you. It makes you tear up.
- No.

2291
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:52,420
Yes.

2292
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:53,440
Sky.

2293
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:55,390
- I see.
- Sky?

2294
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:58,010
Let me answer.
Only one under the sky.

2295
01:12:58,010 --> 01:12:59,010
No!

2296
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:00,930
- Four words?
- Four words.

2297
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:03,000
Champion.

2298
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,630
Power. Sky.

2299
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:07,060
Okay. Let me answer.
Omniscience and omnipotence.

2300
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,170
Gosh.

2301
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:09,430
- Only one.
- Let me answer.

2302
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:10,470
Power.

2303
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:11,840
Let me answer.
Walk in someone's shoes.

2304
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,260
No.

2305
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,010
- You should explain it like this.
- What?

2306
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:17,470
- Power?
- What do you mean by power?

2307
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:18,640
- Power?
- King.

2308
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,640
You can pass by adding 30 seconds.

2309
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,900
- Okay. Pass.
- Okay.

2310
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,380
(Bolt from the blue)

2311
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:24,470
(It's another idiom.)

2312
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:26,610
How am I supposed to explain this?

2313
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:28,750
- Four.
- Four.

2314
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:29,760
Four.

2315
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,010
Do you know what it means?

2316
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:32,090
No.

2317
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:34,020
- Oh, my gosh.
- Start with the first word.

2318
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:35,720
Start with the first word
and move on from there.

2319
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,460
Jean.

2320
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:38,960
- Jean.
- Jean color.

2321
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,390
- Jean?
- Jean color.

2322
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:43,100
- Jean color.
- Jean color.

2323
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,860
- One.
- Jean color.

2324
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,860
- "Jean color"?
- And two.

2325
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:50,100
- Hey, you are worse than So Min.
- Sky.

2326
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,770
Jean color. One and two.

2327
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,380
- Jean color.
- Come on.

2328
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,070
Let me answer.
Speak fluently like a running river.

2329
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:57,640
(Gosh!)

2330
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:58,810
Okay.

2331
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:00,440
- Okay.
- Then...

2332
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,090
- Sky.
- Let me answer.

2333
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:03,760
- A student exceeds the master.
- No.

2334
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,720
Two. Sky.

2335
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:06,790
- Two. Sky.
- "Sky"?

2336
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:08,260
- You keep saying that.
- Let me answer.

2337
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:09,960
- A student exceeds the master.
- Bolt from the blue.

2338
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,520
Okay.

2339
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,890
Bolt from the blue.

2340
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:16,060
(Empty Heads
were able to communicate.)

2341
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:17,430
- Hey.
- What?

2342
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:18,760
Why did you say "Jean"?

2343
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,730
- Why did you say "Jean"?
- Very easy.

2344
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:22,230
- Haha is really good.
- I know.

2345
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:23,570
Gold.

2346
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:25,380
- Gold.
- Come on.

2347
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:27,470
Let me answer. Icing on the cake.

2348
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:28,750
- Gold.
- Gold.

2349
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:30,380
- Gold.
- Celebrity?

2350
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:31,720
No celebrity.

2351
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:33,140
Four words?

2352
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:35,220
- Yes.
- Four words?

2353
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,960
"Gold" must be a homonym.

2354
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,850
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer. Apple of the eye.

2355
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:40,180
Let me answer. Return in full glory.

2356
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:41,960
Please listen to the explanation.

2357
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:44,560
- Gold.
- There is no explanation.

2358
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,190
Listen.

2359
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:48,000
- Let me answer. A gold spoon.
- No.

2360
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,930
- Gold and...
- Gold.

2361
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:53,260
- O'Clock.
- This is frustrating.

2362
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,470
- O'Clock.
- How are you worse than me?

2363
01:14:55,470 --> 01:14:57,140
- Watch.
- Watch?

2364
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,310
No.

2365
01:14:58,310 --> 01:14:59,880
Let me answer. The unheard news.

2366
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,050
Okay.

2367
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:02,270
("The unheard news" is correct.)

2368
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:04,310
Thank you.

2369
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:05,610
- For goodness' sake.
- For goodness' sake.

2370
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:07,140
You are the best.

2371
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,390
This is too much.

2372
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:09,390
I was better, right?

2373
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:10,590
- Seriously.
- He said, "This is too much."

2374
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:12,560
- I was better, right?
- So Min, you were much better.

2375
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,680
(Clean upstream water
makes clean downstream water.)

2376
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,150
Four words?

2377
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,820
(Four words?)

2378
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:18,060
Celebrity?

2379
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:20,890
- No.
- Proverbs?

2380
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,000
- What is it?
- What?

2381
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:25,140
I feel like I became a foreigner.

2382
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:26,970
Come on.

2383
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,810
- Sky.
- That's wrong.

2384
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:31,380
(Again?)

2385
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:33,810
- He says "Sky" all the time.
- Why are there so many skies?

2386
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:35,250
Sky water.

2387
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:36,380
- "Sky water"?
- No.

2388
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:37,550
Sky water. Clean.

2389
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:38,770
(Clean upstream water...)

2390
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:40,220
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer. Rainbow.

2391
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:41,420
- No.
- Cloud.

2392
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:42,480
No.

2393
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,790
Let me answer.

2394
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:45,920
The ground hardens after the rain.

2395
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,590
- Clean.
- Let me answer.

2396
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:50,600
Hey! You aren't giving us
an explanation!

2397
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,690
- Sky.
- You keep doing this.

2398
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:54,130
- Sky. Clean.
- Sky. Clean.

2399
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:55,390
- Sky. Clean.
- Wait.

2400
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:56,930
- Sky water.
- "Water"?

2401
01:15:56,930 --> 01:15:58,190
- Sky water.
- Clean.

2402
01:15:58,190 --> 01:16:00,470
- Water.
- High water. High.

2403
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:01,860
High water clean.

2404
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:04,210
- Low water clean.
- Let me answer.

2405
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:05,810
Clean upstream water
makes clean downstream water.

2406
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:09,140
- Okay.
- What was that?

2407
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:11,220
- I can't get these questions right.
- What was that?

2408
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:13,350
- What was "Sky water"?
- How were we supposed to guess?

2409
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:15,140
- "Valley" would have been better.
- I can't get these questions right.

2410
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:16,290
(Yi Sun Sin)

2411
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:17,560
- Hey. Celebrity.
- How will you explain this one?

2412
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,590
- Celebrity.
- Hey. Celebrity.

2413
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:20,980
(He is confident when it comes
to questions about celebrities.)

2414
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:22,560
- No hair?
- No hair?

2415
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:26,520
- Yes hair.
- Hair. Long hair.

2416
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,130
- Long hair?
- Long hair.

2417
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,300
- Long hair.
- And a sword.

2418
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:30,390
- Let me answer.
- Long hair.

2419
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:32,170
- And a sword.
- Let me answer.

2420
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:33,360
- Yi Sun Sin.
- Okay.

2421
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,360
("Yi Sun Sin" is correct.)

2422
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,560
- Okay.
- "A sword"?

2423
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,710
- "A sword"?
- That was unbelievable.

2424
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,680
- How was I supposed to know?
- "A sword"?

2425
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,810
Gold.

2426
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:41,880
("JiSuk Jin" is
the last question.)

2427
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,350
This one is easy.

2428
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:45,610
Celebrity?

2429
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:46,920
No celebrity.

2430
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:49,760
- Middle. Middle celebrity.
- Four words?

2431
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,310
- Middle celebrity.
- Middle celebrity.

2432
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:53,520
- Middle celebrity.
- Middle celebrity.

2433
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,790
B-lister?

2434
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:56,820
- Yes. C.
- B-lister?

2435
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,390
- C-lister?
- C and D.

2436
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:59,630
Let me answer. Yang Se Chan.

2437
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:00,630
No.

2438
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:01,860
A Running Man member.

2439
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,540
- Middle.
- Middle.

2440
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:04,890
- Let me answer. Lee Kwang Soo.
- Let me answer. Lee Kwang Soo.

2441
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:06,040
- No.
- Let me answer.

2442
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:07,640
- Haha.
- No.

2443
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,710
Let me answer.

2444
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,140
C-lister. D-lister.

2445
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:11,540
(Frustrated)

2446
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:12,900
- JiSuk Jin.
- Yes.

2447
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:15,250
- JiSuk Jin.
- Yes.

2448
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:17,310
(A C-list celebrity, JiSuk Jin)

2449
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,790
No. I am not.

2450
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:22,720
- C-lister. D-lister.
- I am not a C-lister or D-lister.

2451
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:24,650
- I am not.
- C-lister. D-lister.

2452
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:26,720
I am not a C-lister or D-lister.

2453
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:28,890
A-lister.

2454
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:30,190
(This C-lister is in denial.)

2455
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:31,220
- Not an A-lister.
- No.

2456
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:32,220
- No.
- C-lister. D-lister.

2457
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:33,390
I thought to myself,

2458
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:34,560
- "No way."
- C-lister.

2459
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,560
C-lister. D-lister. Okay.

2460
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,040
(The game ends.)

2461
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,670
- Seriously.
- It was unbelievable.

2462
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:42,540
- I was better.
- So Min, you were much better.

2463
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:43,770
- Seriously.
- I am done.

2464
01:17:43,770 --> 01:17:44,900
- All right.
- That was so much fun.

2465
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:47,380
Thanks to the fancy explanations,
the first place is...

2466
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:48,750
Jong Kook.

2467
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:50,810
The last place is...

2468
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:52,770
Suk Jin with zero correct answers.

2469
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:54,920
That was a close match.

2470
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,310
A close match, my foot.

2471
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:58,010
- We will have another match later.
- It wasn't a close match.

2472
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:00,520
I taught him "High" and "Low".

2473
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:03,020
I taught him "High water"
and "Low water".

2474
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:05,220
Why did you say "Sky" so many times?

2475
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,020
Let's begin the fifth round
of choosing the button.

2476
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:09,930
- Go ahead.
- Who wants to go first?

2477
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,470
How much does the first place have?

2478
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:12,890
The first place should go.

2479
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,540
- Okay.
- Let's hope for Unlucky.

2480
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:16,540
(He goes with the safe option.)

2481
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:18,810
What?

2482
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:20,640
- Hold on. What was that?
- Listen.

2483
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,750
- What?
- What was that?

2484
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:22,940
- He is sneaky.
- What?

2485
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:24,550
Jae Suk got 200 dollars.

2486
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:25,640
Yes!

2487
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,640
Who is next?

2488
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,220
- Go last.
- Since I don't have enough money,

2489
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:30,480
I have no choice
but to take a chance.

2490
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,680
- There you go.
- Yes.

2491
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,290
- I don't have enough money.
- I hope she gets Vague.

2492
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:35,430
(Lucky, Vague, and Unlucky)

2493
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:36,820
- We like Vague.
- Get Vague.

2494
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:38,600
(Lucky, Vague, and Unlucky)

2495
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,630
- Lucky.
- Vague.

2496
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:42,130
(What will happen to the gambler
who dreams of getting Lucky?)

2497
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:43,170
(Lucky, Vague, and Unlucky)

2498
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:44,190
(Unlucky)

2499
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,430
Lucky.

2500
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:46,730
- Unlucky.
- Unlucky.

2501
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:47,810
Unlucky.

2502
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:49,310
So Min lost 300 dollars.

2503
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:51,230
I hope someone gets Vague.

2504
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:52,230
(Next is Se Chan with 820 dollars.)

2505
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:53,600
It will be incredible
if he gets Lucky again.

2506
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,750
(He chooses the blue button.)

2507
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:57,010
I think he will get it.

2508
01:18:57,010 --> 01:18:58,610
- My goodness.
- Vague.

2509
01:18:58,610 --> 01:18:59,640
(Se Chan made a bet for Lucky.)

2510
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,350
- It's Lucky.
- Vague.

2511
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:02,390
(What will be the result?)

2512
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:03,810
Vague.

2513
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:05,390
(Lucky? Vague?)

2514
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:06,390
- It's Lucky.
- Vague.

2515
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:08,850
Lucky!

2516
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:10,190
(It's a jackpot of 1,000 dollars.)

2517
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:11,690
- Lucky!
- He got Lucky.

2518
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:12,960
- Lucky.
- I don't get it.

2519
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:14,820
We did the same thing.

2520
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:17,040
Why did he get Lucky
when I got Unlucky?

2521
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,390
The yellow ball is more likely
to go into Lucky.

2522
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:19,470
Next.

2523
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,640
- All right.
- Your number isn't in the negative.

2524
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,060
I will be happy if he gets Vague.

2525
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:24,430
If he gets Unlucky...

2526
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:26,070
Does he have a bit over 800 dollars?

2527
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:27,510
- He has 820 dollars.
- He has 820 dollars.

2528
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:29,440
If he goes with the safe option,
he will have 1,000 dollars.

2529
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,570
(He will get 200 dollars.)

2530
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:31,640
(He is tempted.)

2531
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,350
- That's right.
- Shall I choose the safe option?

2532
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:34,750
Seriously.

2533
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:36,720
- Vague.
- That's good.

2534
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,010
- Please.
- That's good.

2535
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:39,610
- That's good.
- You will get Lucky.

2536
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:40,930
- Lucky.
- It's turning.

2537
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:42,960
(What will Haha get?)

2538
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,130
- That's good.
- Lucky.

2539
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:46,430
- That's good.
- Lucky.

2540
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:49,190
Lucky!

2541
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:50,430
- Hey.
- What will we do?

2542
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,170
Bo Pil is flustered.

2543
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:54,140
For Bo Pil,
I will go with the safe option.

2544
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:55,170
(The man who is all about safety
will go next!)

2545
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:56,230
You can choose what you want.

2546
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:57,470
- Here I go.
- Go with this button.

2547
01:19:57,470 --> 01:19:58,540
No.

2548
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:00,380
I will go with the safe option.

2549
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:01,440
- Unbelievable.
- Okay.

2550
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,880
He is unbelievable.

2551
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:05,440
He went with the safe option
to get 1,000 dollars.

2552
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:06,890
- I will choose this one.
- Okay.

2553
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:08,140
- Okay.
- That's a good choice.

2554
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:09,310
- How much does Ji Hyo have?
- How much does she have?

2555
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,650
Ji Hyo has 520 dollars.

2556
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:11,650
- That's good.
- That means...

2557
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:13,590
the combined amount is
1,520 dollars.

2558
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,820
Combined with whose money?

2559
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:16,020
Jong Kook's money.

2560
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,060
(Jong Kook's money)

2561
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:19,800
- Stop it already.
- Don't you have something to buy?

2562
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:22,020
- For goodness' sake.
- Look at Ji Hyo.

2563
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:23,340
- Shall we combine the money?
- Ji Hyo.

2564
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,190
Don't you have something to buy?

2565
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:26,540
Don't be ridiculous.

2566
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:28,510
- Will you buy a laptop?
- For goodness' sake.

2567
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,710
- Did everyone else go?
- Yes.

2568
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:31,900
Will you buy a tablet computer?

2569
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:33,810
- Hold on.
- He asked me if I have gone yet.

2570
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:37,250
No cameras are taking
a close-up shot of you.

2571
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,810
They are taking 2-people,
3-people, and 4-people shots...

2572
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:42,310
- and a full-cast shot.
- The last place will...

2573
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:43,720
No cameras are taking
a close-up shot of you.

2574
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:44,890
- If I get Lucky...
- The cameraman went home.

2575
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:46,310
- That's right.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2576
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:47,430
If I go with the safe option,
I will be in the last place.

2577
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:49,320
- Zero dollars?
- His number is in the negative.

2578
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,600
If I go with the safe option,
I will have zero dollars.

2579
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,600
You currently have
minus 110 dollars.

2580
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,020
That means
you need Lucky no matter what.

2581
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,020
(Lucky: Steal 300 dollars
from a member of your choice.)

2582
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,060
(Vague: You and 2 members
of your choice lose 100 dollars.)

2583
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:59,190
(Unlucky: Give 300 dollars
to a member of your choice.)

2584
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:01,760
(The poor man's dilemma
stretches on.)

2585
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,010
Suk Jin, I made this
a two-people shot.

2586
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:07,140
You don't have a close-up shot.

2587
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:08,180
A three-people shot with So Min.

2588
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:09,510
- They will zoom in.
- It's a three-people shot.

2589
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:10,570
A four-people shot.

2590
01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:11,920
- Let's have a full-cast shot.
- A group shot.

2591
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,220
It's a group shot.

2592
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:14,640
You don't have a close-up shot.

2593
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:17,010
Cameras are high-tech these days.

2594
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:18,350
They will edit out people.

2595
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:19,590
They will edit you out.

2596
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:20,630
(His face is fully blocked.)

2597
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:22,680
- Celebrity?
- Don't push the button.

2598
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,260
- Don't push it?
- Earlier, yellow...

2599
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:27,170
Yellow brought good luck.
I'll go with this.

2600
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:29,430
(Suk Jin goes with a risky choice
dreaming of landing a jackpot.)

2601
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:32,170
I'm sure he will get a penalty.

2602
01:21:32,170 --> 01:21:33,170
Please.

2603
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:34,360
- It's Lucky.
- It's going to Lucky.

2604
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,670
(Lucky: Take 300 dollars
from a member of your choice)

2605
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,500
It's heading to Lucky.

2606
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:49,740
(It's a 33 percent chance!
Where is Suk Jin's ball going?)

2607
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:52,200
- It's Lucky.
- It's Lucky.

2608
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,240
Lucky!

2609
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,040
(Lucky)

2610
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:58,450
Who will take 300 dollars from?

2611
01:21:58,450 --> 01:21:59,980
- If I knew this would happen...
- Yoo Jae Suk.

2612
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:02,290
Give me the money, you sly punk.

2613
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:03,340
(He takes 300 dollars
from Jae Suk.)

2614
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:07,050
- Now you'll make the final choice.
- What is it?

2615
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:10,330
(Do they have
another choice to make?)

2616
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:11,950
- This is...
- In the final round,

2617
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:14,330
only the member
with the least money will...

2618
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:16,660
make a different choice from others.

2619
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:19,160
So Min is the last with 140 dollars.

2620
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:20,770
- All right.
- It's a series of choices.

2621
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:23,070
If you press the safe choice,
you'll get the money you have.

2622
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:26,630
Or you will get 1.5 or 0.5 times
as much money as you have.

2623
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:27,650
(Safe, Win, Fail)

2624
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:31,370
(That means they can get
1.5 times what they have.)

2625
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:34,650
And if the loser wins,

2626
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:37,120
she can make three members
of her choice donate their money.

2627
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,120
Me?

2628
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:41,190
(3 members of her choice will
have to donate all their money.)

2629
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:42,620
You can choose three members.

2630
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,230
But if you fail,

2631
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:46,750
you will lose
the two members' money and yours.

2632
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:48,660
(Safe choice: 100 percent,
Daring choice: 50 percent)

2633
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:51,070
(The tiger moth has two choices.)

2634
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:52,130
Now I regret...

2635
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:53,700
that I wasn't being nice to So Min.

2636
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:56,570
- I feel the same way.
- Now I regret it.

2637
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:57,800
I was nice to So Min.

2638
01:22:57,870 --> 01:23:00,370
At least four of you
will keep the money though.

2639
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:02,340
I was really nice to So Min today.

2640
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:04,820
That's not true.
You called her a judge.

2641
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:06,120
Shall we begin?

2642
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,910
I'm the first. I'll give it a try.

2643
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,690
I will get 1.5 times as much money.

2644
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:11,490
(Win: Get 1.5 times what he has,
Fail: Get half of what he has)

2645
01:23:11,490 --> 01:23:13,360
(He made the daring choice.)

2646
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:17,290
- He's cool.
- I bet he will win.

2647
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:21,370
(Will he get 1.5 or 0.5 times
the money he has?)

2648
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:22,870
Fail.

2649
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:25,490
- I bet he will win.
- Fail.

2650
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,460
He will lose half his money.

2651
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:29,270
(The money has halved!)

2652
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:31,780
All right.

2653
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:33,330
Give it a try.

2654
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,670
You should definitely
get 1.5 times your money.

2655
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:36,870
- Please start.
- Go.

2656
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:38,520
(He made the daring choice.)

2657
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:41,950
Will he win?

2658
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:44,950
(Will Se Chan's good luck continue?)

2659
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:47,120
- No.
- It's moving a lot.

2660
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,550
- It's moving a lot.
- What?

2661
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:53,490
(He won 1.5 times his money.)

2662
01:23:53,490 --> 01:23:54,920
What's with him?

2663
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,420
- That's 2,700 dollars.
- Lucky.

2664
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:57,660
He won 2,700 dollars.

2665
01:23:57,660 --> 01:23:59,660
(Se Chan saved 2,730 dollars
for his parents.)

2666
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:01,540
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

2667
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:03,300
All right.

2668
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:04,870
- What's his choice?
- Oh, no.

2669
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:07,170
- He's unbelievable.
- I'm so sick of him.

2670
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:08,950
I should take 1.5 times the money.

2671
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:10,240
(Haha made a daring choice
hoping to get 1.5 times his money.)

2672
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,410
- He will win.
- My gosh.

2673
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:15,910
(He won 1.5 times his money.)

2674
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:17,360
That's cool.

2675
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,360
(He's in 2nd place
with 2,380 dollars.)

2676
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:19,450
I'll go with this.

2677
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:22,690
She won!

2678
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:24,120
(Ji Hyo won 780 dollars.)

2679
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,160
They all won this round.

2680
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:27,790
The door to success is wide open.

2681
01:24:27,870 --> 01:24:29,590
Right. It's on a roll.

2682
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:31,660
Good. It's going well.

2683
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:32,870
(He made the daring choice
to continue the good luck.)

2684
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:35,070
(4 wins in a row or a failure?)

2685
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,410
- Seriously...
- Win.

2686
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:39,910
(Fail)

2687
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:42,280
It's turned around. It's over.

2688
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:43,700
Suk Jin gets...

2689
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:45,780
Can you believe this?

2690
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,650
Hey, how much do I have now?

2691
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:50,410
Suk Jin got Kwang Soo's bad luck.

2692
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:51,580
He took all his bad luck.

2693
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:53,020
Now it's So Min's turn.

2694
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:54,330
I want So Min to win.

2695
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:57,160
I hope she wins and takes the money
from the top three members.

2696
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,290
- It will be great.
- I think so.

2697
01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:00,870
- So Min.
- The top three members.

2698
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:02,030
Of course.

2699
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:03,070
Take the top three members' money.

2700
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:04,400
You should pick
the top three members.

2701
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,940
- I'm sure So Min will do that.
- Of course I will.

2702
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,300
- Otherwise, this is meaningless.
- So Min, why?

2703
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:08,570
- It's just meaningless.
- She's right.

2704
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,870
- It's good to donate the money.
- Of course.

2705
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:12,080
It's a good thing.

2706
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,580
You don't know
whom So Min will pick.

2707
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:15,540
- We don't know.
- That's right. She gets to pick.

2708
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,170
- She will be picking the members.
- Right. So Min!

2709
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:19,340
So Min, why are you being like this.

2710
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:20,820
Hang on. That's right.

2711
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:22,840
So Min, do as you want.

2712
01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:24,050
You can pick me.

2713
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:25,860
Good, So Min. This is a good chance.

2714
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:28,250
If you're going to donate it, you
should pick members with big money.

2715
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:29,550
That would be great.

2716
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:30,550
- Let's go.
- Here I go.

2717
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:31,660
(Members with big money
have a lot to lose.)

2718
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:35,370
(She made the daring choice.)

2719
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:38,270
I hope she will win.

2720
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:39,330
- Win.
- Win!

2721
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:41,770
- What?
- Win. She has to win.

2722
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:46,300
(Where is the ball heading
to end today's race?)

2723
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:53,370
- Fail.
- Three of us will lose our money.

2724
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:55,380
(So Min and 2 members of her choice
will lose all their money.)

2725
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:56,620
My goodness.

2726
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:58,550
All right. So Min and...

2727
01:25:58,550 --> 01:26:00,210
She will lose her money as well.

2728
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:01,660
She gets zero dollars.

2729
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:02,860
That's terrible.

2730
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:05,750
(They can't even
donate their money.)

2731
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:10,070
So Min, you can pick two members
to get zero dollars with you.

2732
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:12,330
- Two members?
- So Min saves us trouble.

2733
01:26:12,330 --> 01:26:14,040
Well... Most of us...

2734
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,660
You can just pick anyone you want.

2735
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:16,660
- It's not good to win...
- It's 5,000 dollars put together.

2736
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:17,670
the 1st and 2nd place.

2737
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:20,700
- It's not good.
- So Min.

2738
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,200
I'm not talking to her.

2739
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,280
- This is...
- The rules of the game...

2740
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:26,020
- tell us not to stand out.
- I know.

2741
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,320
It's always like that.

2742
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:30,550
A cornered stone
meets the mason's chisel.

2743
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:32,410
- I was being too frivolous.
- You were annoying.

2744
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:34,490
- What do I do?
- Pick anyone you can.

2745
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:35,830
Just do it.

2746
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:38,950
I'll pick these two.

2747
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:41,570
I mean, they got too much money.

2748
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:43,070
- That's too much.
- They have too much.

2749
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:44,770
I know. It was too much.

2750
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:48,270
Here. I hope you will
have a great time...

2751
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:50,410
- with your parents.
- Thank you. This is a lot.

2752
01:26:50,410 --> 01:26:52,700
It's no big deal. There won't be
any prizes for a while.

2753
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:54,450
I'll send this to my mom right away.

2754
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:56,950
You can prepare
some prizes with this money.

2755
01:26:57,150 --> 01:27:00,040
Who won 95 dollars? This is for you.

2756
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,040
(Suk Jin won 95 dollars
for his parents.)

2757
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,150
- All right.
- You won the money anyway.

2758
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:04,380
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2759
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,850
It's been a while
since the last shoot.

2760
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:10,940
I spent two weeks
in self-quarantine.

2761
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:13,420
(Jae Suk is back
after the 2-week self-quarantine.)

2762
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:15,760
(And there's something
to celebrate.)

2763
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,020
(Suk Jin got the vaccine shot.)

2764
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:20,430
(They prepared ganoderma lucidum
for the members' health.)

2765
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:22,390
(And there are other Young Jis.)

2766
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:24,190
(Lee Young Ji, Hur Young Ji)

2767
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:26,060
(Young Ji versus Young Ji.
Pick a team you want.)

2768
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:28,170
(The members have a choice.)

2769
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:30,170
Do you want me?

2770
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:31,560
(They are treated differently.)

2771
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:33,170
(And that makes the members
hold their heads high.)

2772
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:35,040
(They start the dance party...)

2773
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,380
(to attract more members.)

2774
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:40,380
(With their attractive dance moves,)

2775
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:41,940
(they get their team members.)

2776
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:44,350
(And the team battle
finally begins.)

2777
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:46,390
(The Young Jis kneel down...)

2778
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:47,650
(in front of the harsh
team members.)

2779
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:50,050
(Can we have decimal places?)

2780
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:53,220
(That's when the Young Jis
rise in revolt.)

2781
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:54,830
If you come to me now,
I'll give you the whole thing.

2782
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:57,390
(The shoe is on the other foot now.)

2783
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,970
(How would the conflict
between them end?)

2784
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:01,560
(Team Selection Race,
Young Ji versus Young Ji)
