1
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,750
Hey.

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,110
- Here we go again.
- Hey, Jong Kook.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,650
- Yes?
- How have you been?

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,880
You have a metal allergic reaction
on the back of your neck.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,450
I'm serious. It's all black.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,830
- Those are so out of style.
- Hello.

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,460
Hello. Good to see you.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,830
- Hello.
- Hello.

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,970
Today... There's a shade here.

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,470
It's good to have a shade.

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,260
You know what?

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,940
On our way here, Suk Jin said...

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,880
Se Chan's outfit is out of style.

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,970
He said that
even before we started the shoot.

15
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,510
You're the one
who looks old-fashioned.

16
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,650
Are you entering
"Show Me The Money?"

17
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,240
- Why would you say that?
- I'm just...

18
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,420
- "Show Me The Money Season Ten."
- My fashion...

19
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,490
"Grandpa Special."

20
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,020
"Grandpa Special?"

21
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,750
"Show Me The Money Grandpa Special."

22
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,780
(Hip Hop Grandpa)

23
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,880
- "Who looks younger?"
- Anyway,

24
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,160
- I just finished self-quarantine.
- That's right.

25
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
How was it?

26
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,460
I heard your phone bill
is like 2,000 dollars.

27
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,800
I did make a lot of calls.

28
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,490
He must've been really bored.

29
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,630
I talked to Jun Ha on the phone,
and he was sick of you.

30
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,670
Really?

31
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,870
He couldn't even work.

32
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,740
- And he wouldn't hang up the phone.
- He didn't let him work.

33
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,670
Hang on. Then did you not
see your children...

34
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,910
- during the quarantine period?
- What?

35
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,910
- He can't.
- He can't see them.

36
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,070
- Of course, I didn't.
- He's not supposed to see them.

37
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,210
I wasn't allowed to see them.

38
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,370
You must've felt at ease.

39
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,040
He must've been excited.

40
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,590
He had no choice.

41
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,010
- You're unbelievable.
- You must've gotten a good rest.

42
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,010
- You're being ridiculous.
- I mean...

43
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,350
- That's not true.
- He just can't say so.

44
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,880
He just keeps it to himself.

45
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,200
You could've finished
the quarantine in a week.

46
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,790
- Right.
- But he did it for another week.

47
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,760
- That's right.
- He had a reason.

48
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,620
He was on a vacation.

49
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,870
Party time!

50
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,790
- We should congratulate Suk Jin.
- What?

51
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,040
- Why?
- What?

52
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,710
He got the Pfizer vaccine.
Congratulations.

53
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,340
I'm jealous.

54
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,370
- That's great.
- Pfizer.

55
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,870
I'm really jealous of him.

56
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,210
Congratulations.

57
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,780
It was just the first shot.

58
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,980
Did you get the shot?

59
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,540
- Did you really get it?
- It was the first shot.

60
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,240
- Pfizer Jee.
- Did you get the shot?

61
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,460
- Pfizer Jee.
- Pfizer Jee.

62
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,090
- Is it something to celebrate?
- Sure.

63
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,320
It's just the first shot.

64
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,790
He's the first member of Running Man
to get the vaccine shot.

65
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,090
The vaccine man.

66
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,230
- Congratulations.
- Pfizer Jee.

67
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,620
I got the Pfizer vaccine shot.

68
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,670
- Cool.
- Go, Pfizer Jee.

69
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,540
He bragged about it
after getting the shot.

70
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,230
- About the Pfizer shot?
- He called me.

71
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,630
"It's me, Suk Jin.
I just got the Pfizer shot."

72
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,210
And two hours later...

73
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,210
- My dad did the same thing.
- He called me again.

74
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,710
"I'm just fine."

75
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,650
("I'm just fine.")

76
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,870
- "Hey."
- He sounds like my dad.

77
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,240
He's just like my dad.

78
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,440
Why did he tell me such a thing?

79
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,940
Seriously, I was fine.

80
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,090
It felt like I didn't even
get the vaccine shot.

81
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,330
We will book
the vaccination this week.

82
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,650
- That's right.
- Yes.

83
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,150
- You should do it on the 14th.
- The 10-day rotation system.

84
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,150
It's based on your birthday.

85
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,190
The ten-day rotation system.
It's based on your birthday.

86
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,430
- Ji Hyo, is it new to you?
- Yes.

87
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,240
You should tell Ji Hyo
what COVID-19 is first.

88
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,740
- That's not true.
- It's not that bad.

89
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,140
I know what the COVID-19 is.

90
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,870
It's not that
influenza is prevalent now.

91
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,810
- I know that.
- And it's not beer.

92
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,940
It's not like masks are in fashion.

93
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,840
So I guess
this isn't about the shade.

94
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,680
They're filming from afar
because of the COVID-19.

95
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,390
- We don't usually do this.
- They are quite far from us.

96
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,390
None of us wouldn't step forward,
which never happened before.

97
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,060
This is just perfect.

98
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,330
We usually take a few steps forward.

99
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,150
We keep stepping
forward while we talk.

100
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,300
- We're not doing that today.
- We just remain behind today.

101
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,690
It's Africa there.

102
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,430
- It's another world.
- Anyway,

103
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,590
I'd like to thank everyone...

104
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,340
for supporting me
and worrying about me.

105
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,060
Thank you so much.

106
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,640
- Welcome back.
- Make sure...

107
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,680
to get the vaccine on time.

108
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,580
Pfizer Jiis proud.
He sounds excited.

109
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,080
- Guys.
- Yes.

110
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,620
We're doing the shoot
after a long time.

111
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,490
So we ordered
some tteokbokki for you.

112
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,090
- I love it.
- Tteokbokki sounds good.

113
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,810
- I like tteokbokki.
- It must be delicious.

114
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,180
- I like it.
- I love tteokbokki.

115
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,900
And anyone can enjoy this brand.

116
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,690
- What is it?
- It has a pleasant flavor.

117
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,220
What's the brand?

118
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,830
- It's just spicy enough.
- It's the product placement.

119
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,660
- So what's the brand?
- It's coming.

120
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,460
Your tteokbokki is here.

121
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,000
It smells great already.

122
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,710
- There's nothing.
- I don't smell anything.

123
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,240
There's no smell.

124
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,680
- Gosh, this is...
- My goodness.

125
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,550
It has butter in it. That's new.

126
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,940
That sounds unique.

127
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,780
The tteokbokki has
fried chicken in it.

128
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,020
It has fried chicken.

129
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,550
I've always wanted to try this.

130
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,780
We all are product placement freaks.

131
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,810
Look at this.

132
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,360
I just dipped this
in the tteokbokki sauce.

133
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,560
This is really good.

134
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,650
(They all show
exaggerated reactions.)

135
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,960
- What do you think?
- This is crazy.

136
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,430
- Why didn't I think of this before?
- Gosh, what is this?

137
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,870
It has butter in it.
It's very unique.

138
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,030
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

139
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,300
You've done enough.
They want you to leave.

140
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,640
(You've done enough.
They want you to leave.)

141
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,270
Move over.

142
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,100
- The most important part...
- They want you to leave.

143
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,580
I'm about to say
the most important part.

144
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,100
Suk Jin's got one
and a half minutes, right?

145
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,150
Go.

146
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,600
Go away, Suk Jin.

147
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,780
(Suk Jin shouldn't be on screen
for over one and a half minutes.)

148
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,670
There's a time limit.

149
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,950
This is amazing.

150
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,280
How could they make
something like this?

151
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,460
It tastes like a paradise.

152
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,150
(Tenacious)

153
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,350
The advertiser must be upset.

154
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,030
The young men did a great job.

155
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,400
(He keeps saying useless things
despite the advertiser's concerns.)

156
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,130
"The young men did a great job?"

157
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,860
- Please listen to me while you eat.
- Okay.

158
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,460
Before we start today's race,

159
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,100
I will show you the prizes first.

160
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,400
- Really?
- What?

161
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,100
Can I get this tteokbokki
as a prize?

162
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,170
(I give up.)

163
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,450
Bring in the first prize.

164
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,080
- I guess it's Korean beef.
- Is it meat?

165
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,750
- The first prize is Korean beef.
- Nice.

166
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,410
Nice. I'll try hard today.

167
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,020
And we have the second prize.

168
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,760
The second one is...

169
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,530
called the modern elixir plant
that will help you...

170
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,900
regain your vigor in summer.

171
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,830
Please bring in
the ganoderma lucidum.

172
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,030
That sounds great.

173
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,940
- You can boil it and...
- It's healthy food.

174
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,030
- It's Young Ji.
- Young Ji.

175
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,440
Young Ji.

176
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,140
(They show up
with ganoderma lucidum.)

177
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,400
It's Young Ji.

178
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,470
- World Cup Young Ji.
- We have two Young Jis.

179
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,600
- Jae Suk, what happened to you?
- Two Young Jis.

180
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,280
It's Young Ji versus Young Ji.

181
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,190
They are Young Jis.

182
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,840
Ganoderma lucidum is here
with Young Jis.

183
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,460
I mean, Young Ji's are here.

184
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,410
- It's Young Ji versus Young Ji.
- Hello.

185
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,590
We said that before.

186
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,330
We talked about this.
Young Ji versus Young Ji.

187
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,350
(However...)

188
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,590
- I'm sorry, but...
- Young Ji.

189
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,460
- This is so good I can't greet you.
- I can't see you.

190
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,630
Hello.

191
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,640
(They greet them for a while
and start eating again.)

192
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,200
- This is really good.
- Let's eat.

193
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,860
- I just can't greet you.
- You guys should try too.

194
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,100
- Hello.
- Come on, let's eat.

195
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,800
- You're enjoying tteokbokki.
- Try it.

196
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
- You like it so much.
- You seem to enjoy it a lot.

197
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,780
You enjoy it a lot.

198
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,840
- We will put away the table.
- Okay.

199
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,410
(They put away the table hurriedly.)

200
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,470
This is really good.

201
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,170
- Seriously, I want to eat more.
- I really like it.

202
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,390
I want to eat more.

203
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,520
We have guests here, guys.

204
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,330
We're here.

205
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,590
I guess the tteokbokki is the guest.

206
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,720
They are like our family.

207
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,770
Is it right that
they focus on the tteokbokki?

208
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,090
(Now that they're close,
they treat the guests differently.)

209
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,460
That's because you're our family.

210
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,270
All right.
This is finally happening.

211
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,960
It's Young Ji versus Young Ji.

212
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,210
- Hello.
- Young Ji.

213
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,340
(Lee Young Ji and Heo Young Ji)

214
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,970
- They're back.
- They are...

215
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,970
- our favorite guests.
- I love them.

216
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,340
They are Young Ji and Young Ji.

217
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,840
Young Ji and Young Ji have
something in common.

218
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,110
It's not just they have
the same name.

219
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,690
- There's something else.
- Passion.

220
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,210
- It's passion.
- They have a fighting spirit.

221
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,410
- And the tension.
- Passion!

222
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,650
- They are passionate.
- Exactly.

223
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,050
- Passion and tension.
- What's interesting is...

224
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,650
- that we never met before.
- This is our first time meeting.

225
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,220
- Really?
- We just met for the first time.

226
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,550
It feels like I met my doppelganger.

227
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,550
She's right.

228
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,400
- So we let you meet each other.
- Exactly.

229
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,920
- You're the best.
- Thank you.

230
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,090
We will try our best.

231
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,940
After my appearance on this show,

232
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,230
people keep telling me...

233
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,570
that it's okay.

234
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,280
- It was...
- "It's okay?"

235
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,650
"Young Ji, it can happen.
The questions were difficult."

236
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,880
They comforted you
and cheered you up.

237
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,340
(About two months ago)

238
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,340
- Hey.
- Young Ji.

239
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,190
(Young Ji failed to read "liter.")

240
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,890
(Isn't liter abbreviated as L?)

241
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,550
(That's an L.)

242
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,650
(She read "sigma" as mountain.)

243
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,000
(Young Ji showed her Empty Head
side of her last time.)

244
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,530
You didn't know the basic things.

245
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,960
In "Comedy Big League,"

246
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,530
- we have online audiences.
- Right.

247
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,380
When Young Ji shows up,
they call her Empty Head.

248
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,400
They all say that
even when I'm not there.

249
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,580
They said that to Young Ji.

250
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,410
- She beat our Empty Heads.
- Totally.

251
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,410
She's Empty Head recognized by me.

252
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,850
He looks like my home economics
teacher from middle school.

253
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,710
(He's a dressed-up
home economics teacher.)

254
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,980
So I want to be nice to him.

255
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,650
Young Ji, I know what you mean.

256
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,720
They always wear modernized hanbok.

257
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,920
Exactly. Modernized hanbok.

258
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,900
Or a Chinese character teacher.

259
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,070
- Right. In modernized hanbok.
- Good.

260
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,570
- Thank you.
- That was a good one.

261
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,140
- Thank you.
- Today,

262
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,400
we will have Young Ji
versus Young Ji Race...

263
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,070
with the two guests who will
revitalize your energy up...

264
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,530
in the sweltering heat.

265
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,470
We will be divided into two teams.

266
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,600
Like Yoo Grand Award
versus Kim Grand Award,

267
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,150
there will be Team Lee Young Ji
and Team Heo Young Ji today.

268
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,840
It's like a tradition.

269
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,110
The rest of you will choose...

270
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,590
a captain they want
before each mission.

271
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,650
And you will perform
a mission as a team member.

272
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,780
Okay.

273
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,760
So you will have different teams
for each mission.

274
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,130
The winning team will
get the point...

275
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,190
which is the number of team members
multiplied by five.

276
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,770
And the captain will distribute
the point as she pleases.

277
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,330
(The point will be distributed
by the captain.)

278
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,510
But when you lose, only
the captain of the losing team...

279
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,070
will lose as many points
as the number of team members.

280
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,030
(Only the captain will lose as many
points as the number of members.)

281
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,110
So the captains should
come up with good plans.

282
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,280
I believe they will
divide the points fairly.

283
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,570
Then I should go to the captain
who will be fair.

284
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,520
And the three members
with the highest points...

285
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,780
will get Korean beef
and ganoderma lucidum as a prize.

286
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,530
That's healthy.

287
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,450
The two members with the lowest
points will get a penalty.

288
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't think she will divide it.

289
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,400
(Their fate depends
on the two captains.)

290
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,530
It's good to have more team members.

291
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,640
Now, I want you to choose
your first team.

292
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,970
The two captains should
step forward.

293
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,870
The rest of you will stand
behind the captain you want.

294
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,170
Hang on.

295
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,880
Is it okay
if we all go to one captain?

296
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,040
- Well... Heo Young Ji.
- Yes?

297
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,570
Do you share things with others?

298
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,810
- Me?
- Yes.

299
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,810
- If you win, will you share...
- Of course.

300
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,080
- I can do that.
- Really?

301
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,350
But I once...

302
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,720
fell for Lee Young Ji's trick.

303
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,450
(Kwang Soo and Haha had a hard time
because of Young Ji last year.)

304
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,990
World Cup Young Ji.

305
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,180
Do you like to share?

306
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,230
Jae Suk, we are friends.

307
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,920
Tell us about your strength.

308
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,560
I need to build
more relationships with people.

309
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,000
- I still have a long way to go.
- Right.

310
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,870
We were together back then.

311
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,200
- Me? When?
- Wasn't it you?

312
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,300
But...

313
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,670
Now that Heo Young Ji is here,

314
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,200
I'm sure there will be
a quiz about common knowledge.

315
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,940
I hate it.

316
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,850
- I can't go to Young Ji.
- What do I do?

317
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,720
All right. The two captains
should look straight ahead now.

318
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,310
The rest of you can
choose a captain you want.

319
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,580
They both have
advantages and disadvantages.

320
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,020
I don't think we will answer quizzes
in the first round.

321
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,630
- You're right.
- We don't do that in the beginning.

322
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,990
- It's usually the 2nd or 3rd round.
- It's the 2nd or 3rd round.

323
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,000
Are you ready?

324
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,360
In 1, 2, 3. Go.

325
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,230
(Which captain
will they choose first?)

326
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,100
- This is hard.
- What do I do?

327
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,790
(Studying each other's faces)

328
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,470
- It feels somewhat chilly.
- It feels like...

329
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,740
no one's behind me.

330
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,430
- As I count to three, you will...
- You know what?

331
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,650
The first poll is
all about popularity.

332
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,150
It's...

333
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,540
- It is a popularity vote.
- I agree.

334
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,020
As I count to three,
the captains will turn around...

335
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,680
and check your team members.

336
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,120
One,

337
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,810
two, and three.

338
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,150
(Team Lee Young Ji: 2 members
Team Heo Young Ji: 5 members)

339
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,360
My gosh.

340
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,030
(She's got only 2 members,
but they both are good.)

341
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,860
(Uncrowded, crowded)

342
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,770
I want to get
on the good side of you.

343
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,030
I can't believe this.

344
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,530
(Captain Heo is loved
by the 5 petty members.)

345
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,560
She took only the good ones.

346
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,270
- Hey, you got the good ones.
- Totally.

347
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,110
- You know what?
- It feels...

348
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,700
- Young Ji is...
- It feels strange.

349
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,200
- She's really strong.
- Of course she is.

350
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,650
The first round might require
physical strength.

351
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,010
If that's true,
we can't predict the result.

352
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,220
Young Ji, Haha and I were
the first to come.

353
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,220
- Please know that.
- Okay.

354
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,680
- This is great.
- Hey, we'll bring you the victory.

355
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,780
- I was the first to come.
- Listen, Young Ji.

356
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,410
I'm happy to be on Young Ji's team.

357
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,630
If Lee Young Ji's team wins
in the first game,

358
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,130
she'll have 15 points to share
with her team members...

359
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,420
whereas the other team gets
30 points.

360
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,500
- We just have to win.
- That's enough for us.

361
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
I agree.

362
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,030
The first mission
where you can get points...

363
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,900
will be carried out
under the team leaders' leadership.

364
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,110
- It's Morning Dance Battle.
- Morning Dance Battle.

365
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,330
A dance battle? Great! Oh, wait.

366
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,370
Lee Young Ji is a great dancer too.

367
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,170
She's such a great dancer.
Oh, right. So is Heo Young Ji.

368
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,670
- She was a member of KARA.
- Heo Young Ji is amazing.

369
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,910
Five of the staff members will
evaluate your performance.

370
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,070
- Oh, really?
- These five will be the judges.

371
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,120
(They're planning to give
a fair and accurate evaluation.)

372
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,810
- I see. Okay.
- The team with more votes...

373
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,760
from the judges wins.

374
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,080
Then I suppose we should
aim to entertain the audience.

375
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,680
The idol group dance style is
different from street dance.

376
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,730
- It's different.
- Absolutely.

377
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,780
- I have a raw style of dance.
- Exactly.

378
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,900
She used to be
in a school dance club.

379
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,650
- That's true. I was.
- That's right.

380
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,190
We'll play random songs,

381
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,630
- and you step forward and dance.
- Freestyle dancing? Okay.

382
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,190
Should we take turns?

383
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,330
- It's up to you.
- Got it.

384
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,430
- Young Ji, we can do this.
- Let's go.

385
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,970
- Let's do this. Go for it.
- Don't forget you're from KARA.

386
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,030
- Show them what you've got.
- Young Ji.

387
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,110
- We must win this. That's good.
- Let's do some warm-ups.

388
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,480
- Young Ji, you know, right?
- Yes?

389
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,540
- Sure. My joints move smoothly.
- That's good.

390
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,620
- Of course.
- I haven't gotten rusty.

391
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,440
The team leaders can dance
at the same time.

392
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,780
She took off her shoes.

393
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,350
Hey, she took off her shoes.

394
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,760
- Are you going to dance barefoot?
- Yes. I can't dance in heels.

395
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,390
- But will you be okay?
- Yes.

396
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,230
I'll be fine. I won't get
scrub typhus here, right?

397
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,650
All right.
We'll begin the first round now.

398
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,770
Play the music.

399
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,100
Look at Young Ji. My gosh.

400
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,430
(She's moving to the center
without hesitating at all.)

401
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,370
(A center member's bounce dance)

402
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,110
(Both are dancing passionately
like on a stage.)

403
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,440
Nice. Keep going.

404
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,110
They're so energetic
and enthusiastic.

405
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,280
(Energetic)

406
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,490
What is she doing?

407
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,990
Heo Young Ji must've gotten anxious.

408
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,410
(Going down)

409
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,230
(She got anxious
and laid down on the grass.)

410
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,390
(Getting overly energetic)

411
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,630
Oh, my. It's so funny.

412
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,900
The ground is shaking.

413
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,160
Isn't that a martial art move?

414
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,530
Hold on.
Stop the music for a second.

415
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,370
- Stop the music.
- Maybe we should take turns.

416
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,800
- They're both really enthusiastic.
- I like their energy.

417
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,470
- Young Ji, come back.
- They're so energetic.

418
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,670
- They're amazing.
- They're incredibly enthusiastic.

419
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,030
- They overwhelmed the cameras.
- Great job.

420
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,670
They overwhelmed the cameras.

421
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,350
Young Ji, did you learn
a martial art?

422
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,940
No, I've never learned it before.

423
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,650
- You looked like a martial artist.
- Drunken fist.

424
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,650
(Unlike somebody, they're
full of energy without vaccination.)

425
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,850
- You see...
- It looked like a martial art move.

426
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,220
- Do you know what's amazing?
- What is it?

427
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,150
- You don't know that song, right?
- No, I don't.

428
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,760
- She just improvised despite that.
- I've never heard that song before.

429
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,320
- True.
- We can't compete with them, right?

430
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,530
- We're no match for them.
- They're just amazing.

431
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,650
They're on another level.

432
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,320
They performed a freestyle dance
as a warm-up.

433
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,100
- Was it a warm-up?
- Let's let them dance individually.

434
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,190
- Individually.
- Was it a warm-up?

435
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,790
- Yes.
- Take turns this time.

436
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,830
(I know this song.)

437
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,470
(Young Ji walks to the center
of the stage again.)

438
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
There she goes!

439
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,440
My, she's amazing.

440
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,850
- Awesome!
- Oh, my.

441
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,810
- She's really awesome.
- Look at her feet.

442
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,550
(She was worried about scrub typhus
but is dancing with light steps.)

443
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,950
(Jumping with bare feet)

444
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,780
Hey, you might hurt your feet.

445
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,550
Hey, be careful
not to hurt your feet.

446
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,630
You might hurt your feet.

447
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,860
I think she already
got some scratches.

448
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,270
Here we go. It's the highlight.

449
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,160
(Young Ji is doing well!)

450
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,740
- She's just incredible.
- Oh, my.

451
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,610
- My, I'm impressed.
- Awesome.

452
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,610
(She's unbelievable.)

453
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,750
(Everyone is watching
her energetic morning dance in awe.)

454
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,150
I must say, she's really amazing.

455
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,490
I know that part.

456
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,650
(Se Chan is enjoying himself
without interrupting her.)

457
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,390
She's incredible.

458
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,730
- Hey, are your feet okay?
- Okay. That was great.

459
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,900
- I'm fine.
- Really?

460
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
- Be careful with your feet.
- I don't...

461
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,730
even take my puppy out for a walk
in heat.

462
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,790
Are you sure
you didn't hurt your feet?

463
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,190
I won't get
scrub typhus here, right?

464
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,400
Put your shoes back on
at least when you're not dancing.

465
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,930
- That's okay. I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

466
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,430
- Yes, I'm okay.
- By the way, Young Ji,

467
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,660
you have large feet.

468
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,330
My foot size is 260mm.

469
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,030
- Her shoes...
- They might grow to 280mm.

470
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,900
- Your feet are so...
- Exactly.

471
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,400
- How?
- Young Ji.

472
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,480
My foot size is 260mm.

473
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,070
- Put them back on for now.
- I think...

474
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,540
- she'll grow to two meters.
- Right.

475
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,580
That'd be great.
I could be a basketball player.

476
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,760
(Don't worry. Then I would become
a basketball player.)

477
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,080
It's a good plan, right?

478
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,280
- It'd be a good thing.
- She can play along with any jokes.

479
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,630
True.

480
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,190
- All right. You're up, Young Ji.
- Young Ji, you've got this.

481
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,420
- Overwhelm the audience.
- Do this move.

482
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,820
(Smiling charmingly)

483
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,370
The one where you walk forward
like this.

484
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,530
(Heo Young Ji from KARA is here.)

485
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,070
(This idol singer still has
her dance skills.)

486
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,220
(Going crazy)

487
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,440
- Awesome!
- Yes!

488
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,650
- You're amazing. Keep going.
- Oh, my.

489
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,260
- She's amazing as always.
- Indeed.

490
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,420
- She's great.
- She's amazing.

491
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,400
- She's exceptional.
- Amazing.

492
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,820
- Good. Keep going.
- She knows the other members' part.

493
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,820
(All girl groups separate parts
for each member.)

494
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,420
Young Ji,
walk toward the camera crane.

495
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,690
- Let's go!
- Get closer to the camera crane.

496
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,870
- Let's go!
- Go.

497
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,660
- That's good.
- Great.

498
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,570
(She knows where to see
from her experience.)

499
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,610
- This is fun.
- She's great.

500
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,200
- Okay. That's enough.
- Great job.

501
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,280
(She maintains the cheerful energy
to the end.)

502
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,480
- Good job.
- Impressive.

503
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,380
- Good. You did well.
- Great job.

504
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,910
- How can I defeat an active singer?
- Good job.

505
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,440
- Well done.
- That was amazing.

506
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,620
- How can I defeat an active singer?
- Okay. Thanks.

507
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,910
You looked so cheery.

508
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,920
- We all enjoyed it,
- You were amazing.

509
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,180
but especially Jong Kook got
so excited.

510
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:28,270
(He smiled from ear to ear.)

511
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,500
(Actually, Jae Suk and Lee Young Ji
were even more excited than him.)

512
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,900
- I wanted to see the highlight.
- Exactly.

513
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,740
But I didn't want her to use up
all her energy already.

514
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,980
- Right.
- Young Ji, are you ready?

515
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,070
- All right. Don't worry.
- You can pick a song.

516
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,610
- It's okay.
- The one you're confident in.

517
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,750
One that I'm confident in?

518
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,310
- Pick something in your style.
- She can dance to any latest songs.

519
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,380
- I know almost all.
- That's right.

520
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,990
- How about aespa's song?
- How does that sound?

521
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,990
- Dance to one of aespa's songs.
- All right.

522
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,390
- "Walk toward the open field."
- Okay. Let's go with aespa.

523
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,130
- "Walk toward the open field."
- Let's go with aespa.

524
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,180
(She's ready to walk
toward the open field.)

525
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,150
- Okay. Let's go.
- Oh, my.

526
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,920
- Here we go.
- "Next Level."

527
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,030
I think I've seen her dance
to this song before.

528
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,130
(Disciplined moves)

529
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,770
(The dance maverick is enjoying
dancing in the open field.)

530
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,010
(Heo Young Ji joined her
in the open field.)

531
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,040
- Heo Young Ji, headbang at least.
- What's that?

532
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,920
(The headbanging show
begins suddenly.)

533
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,520
(Meanwhile, Lee Young Ji didn't
forget the key moves.)

534
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,780
- Look how she moves.
- Oh, my.

535
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,190
It's absolutely amazing.

536
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,780
(The dancers on another level
mesmerizes the cast members.)

537
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,380
Young Ji and Young Ji are amazing.

538
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,260
Let's give them a big hand.

539
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,500
(Impressed)

540
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,000
- They're amazing.
- Indeed.

541
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,590
That was amazing.
And they danced in this heat.

542
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,320
They don't seem to get tired
in this heat.

543
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,200
- Gosh, that's so annoying.
- Why?

544
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,290
- What?
- Why?

545
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,970
I asked about this song,

546
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,770
and he said it was
Cho Yong Pil's new song.

547
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,980
(The new song in August,
"Next Level" by Cho Yong Pil)

548
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,070
What is this song?

549
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,540
We like this kind of song.

550
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,800
Hey, what's this song?

551
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,810
It's Cho Yong Pil's new song.

552
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,380
(The home economics teacher is
not familiar with the latest songs.)

553
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,720
- Hey, how about S.E.S?
- Yes.

554
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,660
- What was it? "I'm Your Girl?"
- There's no song to dance to.

555
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,780
- Yes, it's "I'm Your Girl."
- Good. Go with that song.

556
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,260
- Play "I'm Your Girl" by S.E.S.
- "I'm Your Girl."

557
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,670
- No. There's no way she knows it.
- S.E.S. Give it a try.

558
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,390
I don't know
the entire choreography, but...

559
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,240
(As the nostalgic melody
comes out...)

560
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,700
- So Min, join her.
- Go on.

561
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,100
(Temporary member number 2)

562
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,870
- You go too. Dance along with them.
- Go on.

563
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,300
Let's go!

564
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,980
(Member 1, the cheerful one)

565
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,280
(Member 2 dancing in her own style
wearing a face mask)

566
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,760
(And Member 3)

567
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,350
Look at Ji Hyo.

568
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,780
Ma'am!

569
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,320
Hey, Ji Hyo.

570
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,590
(She moved in the wrong direction
and almost bumped into Young Ji.)

571
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,930
Where are you going, ma'am?

572
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,060
(The 3rd member goes in a direction
of her own choice.)

573
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,290
Excuse me. Where are you going?

574
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,890
- She's so cute.
- Excuse me.

575
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,030
(It was successful
for an impromptu performance.)

576
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,570
- She moved in the wrong direction.
- Hey...

577
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,250
- Ji Hyo.
- I know.

578
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,280
- I don't know the choreography.
- Ji Hyo.

579
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,450
- Yes?
- It was like a mirrored video.

580
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,310
Jong Kook found it so cute.

581
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,140
(Jong Kook found it so cute.)

582
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,220
- Oh, my. How sweet.
- That's ridiculous.

583
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,960
You didn't even look at me!

584
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,660
You didn't even see my face!

585
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,080
- I saw that too.
- Did you see my face?

586
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,280
- I saw that too.
- I can't believe him.

587
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,620
- He's unbelievable.
- I saw it.

588
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,620
- I was standing behind him.
- I saw it.

589
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,500
- You know...
- It must be true. He's flustered.

590
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,590
- Jong Kook...
- This is so unexpected.

591
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,890
Do I look that cute to you?

592
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,530
- My gosh. I can't believe you guys.
- I could see all of your teeth.

593
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,830
You were smiling from ear to ear.

594
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,440
- I saw it.
- I didn't see that coming.

595
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,100
- That's total nonsense.
- He's flustered.

596
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,140
He seemed to be
totally head over heels for Ji Hyo.

597
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,070
I might actually punch you.

598
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,190
Young Ji. Hey.

599
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,580
(Lee Young Ji got herself ready
to dance again even in the ruckus.)

600
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,880
("Alcohol-Free" by TWICE)

601
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,260
- TWICE.
- Great.

602
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,580
- She's great.
- Impressive.

603
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,890
(We're all mesmerized
by Young Ji's dance.)

604
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,000
- She's amazing.
- Great.

605
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,300
(Fascinated)

606
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,800
- She's incredible.
- How amazing.

607
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,180
- I'm amazed.
- Awesome.

608
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,440
- How amazing.
- Yes!

609
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,780
- She's incredible.
- Oh, my.

610
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,720
She's exceptional.
She has such a good groove.

611
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,810
She does look like a girl
who was born in the 2000s.

612
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,720
She's much younger than us, Ji Hyo.

613
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,580
(The ones who were born in the 1970s
are fascinated by her youth.)

614
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,850
She's on another level.

615
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,930
(She makes sure
that everyone knows.)

616
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,030
Great.

617
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,000
(Heo Young Ji stepped forward again
as she got anxious.)

618
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,700
- She got anxious.
- They're amazing.

619
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,890
(Using every joint in her body)

620
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,940
They're awesome.

621
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,830
- Amazing.
- They have an amazing groove.

622
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,800
- Okay. That's it. Come back in.
- That was great.

623
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,480
- That was good enough. Good job.
- Young Ji is such a great dancer.

624
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,640
- Exactly.
- Her moves are amazing.

625
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,180
- She sure was in a dance club.
- She has a great groove.

626
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,220
(She's still full of energy.)

627
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,450
- That was good as well.
- Their signature dance move.

628
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,720
That was great.

629
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
The intense competition...

630
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,080
- between the team leaders ended.
- They're amazing.

631
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,110
- They're neck and neck.
- They're just incredible.

632
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,580
I'll announce the result right away.

633
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,960
The five judges will vote.

634
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,320
- There are five judges.
- Yes.

635
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,050
(She's trying to
win the judges over.)

636
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,670
- I have a good feeling.
- Let's find out the result now.

637
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,090
I think it was a good investment.

638
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,530
Both of them did really well.

639
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,210
Raise the name of the person
you think did better.

640
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,970
- One, two,
- It's Young Ji no matter what.

641
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,100
- three.
- It's Young Ji no matter what.

642
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,750
Three.

643
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,300
Three votes for Team Lee.

644
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,070
Four, actually.

645
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,180
(The staff members were fascinated
by the raw style of dance.)

646
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,190
- It's okay.
- You did well.

647
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
It's okay.

648
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
- All right.
- Young Ji, you did a wonderful job.

649
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
(The team won
only because of Young Ji's dance.)

650
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,490
By the way, Heo Young Ji was also
really amazing.

651
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,990
Thank you. I'm honored.
You're so cool.

652
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,790
- The power of youth was amazing.
- Indeed.

653
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,430
- I was like her when I was her age.
- I know.

654
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,360
I was as energetic as her back then.
But not anymore.

655
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,270
As a result, Heo Young Ji's score is
minus six points.

656
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,210
(The number of the members is
deducted from the leader's score.)

657
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,300
That's so harsh.

658
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,640
- And Lee Young Ji got 15 points.
- Yes!

659
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,870
Please write down the points
you want to give to the members.

660
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,920
Thank you.

661
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,540
She can have all the points
to herself, right?

662
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,540
Correct.

663
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,190
Young Ji, you can take them all.

664
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,310
I know. I'll think about it.

665
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,320
You should have all the points
if you want to draw attention.

666
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,930
- But, I...
- Okay?

667
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,850
- Young Ji has a good heart.
- Indeed. It's okay...

668
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,270
- if you give us a few points.
- She and I go way back.

669
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,170
- Give us just a few points.
- Should I reveal it?

670
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,670
- Should I hide it from them?
- Just a few points would be enough.

671
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,470
- Don't show it to us yet.
- Write down where they can't see.

672
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,470
And then please give it to us.

673
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,440
Young Ji, give zero points
to one of them.

674
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,630
Young Ji, think of it this way.

675
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,740
Giving us no points is too harsh.

676
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,030
Think that we're your uncles,
and you met us...

677
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,570
- at a national holiday.
- Right.

678
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,780
- Like that.
- Exactly.

679
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,640
- We did nothing but cheer.
- That's right.

680
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,660
- Think that we're your uncles.
- Exactly.

681
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,030
Now, the two of you,
please come and check your scores.

682
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,460
- All right. Young Ji.
- Okay.

683
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,890
- Don't worry. We're like a family.
- I trust you.

684
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,430
- You...
- Young Ji, thank you.

685
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,890
We go way back, you know.

686
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,790
Thank you, Young Ji.

687
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,170
You don't have to tell the others.

688
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,470
Look at his face.

689
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,240
I gave them more than enough.

690
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,060
- Seriously.
- Look at his face.

691
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,530
- Jae Suk seems shocked.
- Well, it seems fair.

692
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,910
- It's fair.
- I'm so curious.

693
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,410
He is just surprised
as he got so many points.

694
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,640
- It's fair.
- You're good at this.

695
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,450
Jae Suk, it's better than nothing.

696
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,540
Of course.

697
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,720
I guess they got at least one point.

698
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,950
She did her best to win
for her own sake.

699
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,080
- Right?
- I'm speechless.

700
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,690
She earned it. It's fair.

701
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,690
Young Ji, I'm impressed.

702
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,460
Jae Suk said that the harder I try,
the more airtime I get.

703
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,460
(It was Jae Suk
who taught me this.)

704
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,790
You will choose your team again.
Please step forward.

705
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,170
- The members will be changed?
- Yes.

706
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,890
- This is...
- Right. It changes in every round.

707
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,270
It's obvious
which team we'll choose.

708
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,170
How many points did you get?
You should tell us.

709
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,290
- What?
- Did she give you no points?

710
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,670
- She did give us some points.
- What's your score...

711
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,910
- I won't tell anyone else.
- I can't...

712
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,210
- tell you my score.
- Were you very shocked?

713
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,070
She gave one point to each
because it's the minimum point.

714
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,070
Isn't it obvious?

715
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,450
All right. Let's go now.

716
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,570
- One, two, three.
- It'll be a quiz game.

717
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,950
I'm sure of it. It's a quiz game.

718
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,110
(Jae Suk heard the word "quiz"
and stopped.)

719
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,540
It might not be a quiz game.

720
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,460
- He's hesitating.
- I'm sure it's a quiz game.

721
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,580
You're sure of it?

722
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,460
- Maybe it's not.
- I'm sure of it.

723
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,660
But it might not be...

724
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,690
On three.

725
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,660
Three, two, one.

726
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,320
You can turn around now.

727
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:48,380
Young Ji, it's me.
You can turn around now.

728
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,750
Young Ji, it's me.

729
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,490
(The elders chose her after being
betrayed by their niece.)

730
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,490
- Okay!
- It's the opposite this time.

731
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,140
- It's you.
- Of course, we chose you.

732
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,530
They just switched the teams.

733
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,030
- You shouldn't betray us.
- Of course, not.

734
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,140
- I will never betray you.
- Don't betray us.

735
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,850
- Gosh. Look at Lee Young Ji...
- I promise. No.

736
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,180
- I can't believe her.
- No.

737
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,970
Young Ji, they don't make any effort
to win.

738
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,950
- Don't...
- They won't make any effort.

739
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,710
I gave them points
according to the effort they made.

740
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,850
- Really?
- Just as much effort they made.

741
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,310
- She's the one who worked hard.
- But still...

742
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,820
- She's right about that, but...
- We cheered for you and all.

743
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,020
- We contributed too.
- My gosh. You shouldn't say that.

744
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,490
- I gave you a lot.
- It's not like...

745
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,720
You will change
into your team uniforms.

746
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,900
- I'll tell you about the game.
- Okay.

747
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,990
The second game is...

748
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,400
You shouldn't change the game now.

749
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,870
- I have a feeling that it's a quiz.
- It's a quiz.

750
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,870
(Could it be a quiz
as they predicted?)

751
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,680
It's Random Player Foot Volleyball.

752
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
(The 2nd mission is
Random Player Foot Volleyball.)

753
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,350
- It's not bad. We've got this.
- We outnumber them.

754
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,180
- We'll play foot volleyball?
- Wait. Hold on a second.

755
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,540
We're at an advantage
because we outnumber them.

756
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,740
We don't have a chance to win.

757
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,780
We outnumber them.

758
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,980
Maybe it's not so bad
because So Min will be the referee.

759
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,550
Right. She'll be the referee.
Hey, So Min.

760
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,090
- So Min will be the referee.
- That's right.

761
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,320
- Let me...
- How many players are on each team?

762
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,750
- make this one thing clear.
- I'll explain the rules later.

763
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,490
- I'll kick the ball no matter what.
- Okay.

764
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,820
- I'll kick the ball today.
- Come on.

765
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,930
- Stop. I'll kick the ball today.
- No. Listen, So Min.

766
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,030
So Min, that's not a good idea.

767
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,440
I'll play the entire game.

768
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,460
Hey, I told you that the referee is
the most important person.

769
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,960
(They changed
into their team uniforms.)

770
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,880
Oh, my. This is... Why? What is it?

771
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,970
- You really are the referee.
- I mean...

772
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,180
Let me see. Turn around.
It says "Referee."

773
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,450
- You're the referee.
- Just as we said.

774
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,970
So Min will be the referee today.

775
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,740
I was so surprised.
Suk Jin, she's the referee.

776
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,980
She put the name tag on her back.

777
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,860
Leave it, So Min.
You're the referee.

778
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,160
Don't take it off. Just accept it.

779
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,720
So Min, we're not fooling around
with you. It's the best position.

780
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,290
That's the whole point
of playing this game.

781
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,930
Why is it always So Min
who gets to be a referee?

782
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,430
She's actually the referee.

783
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,170
- No, I'm a player.
- So Min is the referee.

784
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,940
No, I said I'm a player.
I'll play the game today.

785
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,170
- You know the game rules, right?
- So Min, since you're the referee,

786
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,730
blow your whistle and say,
"Line up."

787
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,540
If you say that, all of us will
gather around. You'll see.

788
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,650
If they don't,
I won't be the referee.

789
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,880
(Blowing the whistle)

790
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,540
The referee wants us
to gather around.

791
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,450
- Let's go. Left, right.
- Left, right.

792
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,750
- Referee, what should we do?
- So Min is a perfect referee.

793
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,930
I'm glad we'll play foot volleyball.
It's pointless to have many players.

794
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,790
- Who made you so angry?
- It's weird...

795
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,900
- I feel like we'll lose.
- Exactly.

796
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,700
- We're at a disadvantage.
- Somehow I have a bad feeling.

797
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,700
And the letter "Heo" on their shirts
annoys me.

798
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,560
- It sounds like a smirk.
- "Heo."

799
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,440
- I didn't realize that.
- "Lee."

800
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,940
(The intense,
childish war of nerves)

801
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,270
- "Heo."
- "Lee."

802
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,650
The game you'll play this time is...

803
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,650
Random Player Foot Volleyball...

804
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,450
where the team leaders play
a very important role.

805
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,150
- What is it?
- Each team...

806
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,010
The team leaders should play
the entire game.

807
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,860
In the beginning,

808
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,690
the team leaders choose a member
for a 2 on 2 match.

809
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,860
- It's a 2 on 2 match?
- I see.

810
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,990
The female players are allowed
to use their hands.

811
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,430
When the team leader scores a point,

812
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,260
she can either add one more player
to her team...

813
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,640
or eliminate one player
from the opponent team.

814
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,730
Really? Eliminate a player?

815
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,030
But her team has only two players
other than her.

816
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,730
You can eliminate them all
except for the team leader.

817
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,540
Let's make Young Ji play alone.
This is great.

818
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,510
You should win 11 points in 1 set.
The 1st team to win 2 sets wins.

819
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,240
- Exactly.
- Use your hand.

820
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,350
- Like in volleyball.
- I'm so excited.

821
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,810
- Like in volleyball.
- Got it.

822
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,780
- You know volleyball, right?
- Yes, I know what volleyball is.

823
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,620
- Hey, that sticker...
- "Spike."

824
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,750
I mean the sport volleyball,
not "Bali."

825
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,590
- Gosh, you.
- I think...

826
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,400
- Okay.
- Really?

827
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,320
- Do you all understand the rules?
- Yes, we do.

828
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,900
Then we'll pick the first players
from each team now.

829
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,730
- Okay.
- Okay.

830
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,170
- I hope Se Chan will be chosen.
- Please. Pick me or Haha.

831
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,030
- Pick Suk Jin.
- Please pick Se Chan.

832
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,970
(To add more players to the team,
the 1st player must do well!)

833
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,240
- Let's go. Pick my name.
- My throat is sore.

834
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Pick Pfizer Jee!

835
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,850
Pick me, Pfizer Jee.

836
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,090
- It's Suk Jin.
- Gosh. We're in trouble.

837
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,240
(The 1st player is Suk Jin.)

838
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,980
(Big Nose has been selected
for an important position.)

839
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,390
(The nerd was picked
instead of the fast, athletic ones.)

840
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,130
- I'll show you.
- Pfizer Jee!

841
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,130
Pfizer Jee!

842
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,290
- We should get a lot of points.
- Okay.

843
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,430
We should get many points
in the first set.

844
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,170
- It's Jong Kook.
- Okay.

845
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,230
- Okay!
- It'd be better...

846
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,760
- if I didn't play.
- Okay.

847
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,530
- We'll definitely lose.
- Gosh.

848
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,140
Okay.

849
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,440
Let's win.

850
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
Go, Pfizer Jee! Let's win!

851
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,970
- Let's do this!
- Go, Pfizer Jee!

852
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,350
- I can do it! Go, Pfizer Jee!
- Let's go.

853
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,810
I did lower body exercise yesterday.

854
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,710
(The non-certified referee is
also ready.)

855
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,040
- Get ready.
- That's so cool. I'm so upset.

856
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,310
I'm so nervous.

857
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,090
Suk Jin, serve.

858
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,750
(Suk Jin serves first.)

859
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,590
Young Ji, stand closer to the net.

860
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,960
- Young Ji!
- Okay.

861
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,050
- Out.
- Has it begun?

862
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,060
- Young Ji.
- Okay.

863
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,020
- It's 1 to 0.
- Stay inside this line.

864
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,530
- I see. Here?
- Stand here.

865
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,140
- You're an attacker, okay?
- Understood. I'm an attacker.

866
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,500
- Hit the ball with a fist.
- I'm an attacker.

867
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,800
- Okay.
- Hey.

868
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,970
- Go, Pfizer Jee!
- Go, Pfizer Jee!

869
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,380
- Who should be added to the team?
- Why did I say that?

870
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,800
- She said, "Go, Pfizer Jee."
- Let's go.

871
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,240
- Go.
- Hey.

872
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,770
Okay.

873
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,970
(The ball fell on their side.)

874
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,240
Gosh. What was that?

875
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,420
- Don't worry.
- I thought you passed the ball.

876
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,450
- This is just the beginning.
- I see.

877
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,810
- That was good.
- It's just the beginning.

878
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,090
Bo Pil, you're so cold-hearted.

879
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,980
Suk Jin, it's better to hit it
with your head at the start.

880
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,090
- With my head?
- Yes, hit it with your head.

881
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,360
- Yes, in any case.
- Young Ji, look at the ball.

882
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,520
- Got it.
- Dodge it when it goes out.

883
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,050
- You've got this!
- We can do it!

884
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,130
- I'll receive.
- Okay.

885
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,130
The head.

886
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,430
- Good.
- Use your hands.

887
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,600
- Use your hands.
- Oh, no.

888
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,440
(Young Ji kicked it high.)

889
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,440
- Young Ji, use your hands.
- Use your hands.

890
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,440
- Use your hands.
- Hands. Right.

891
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,070
- Okay.
- Yes!

892
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,150
- Nice.
- We'll win.

893
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,470
Nice!

894
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,310
- Hit it over the net.
- I'll do that.

895
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,150
- Or you can pass it to me.
- Okay.

896
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,550
- Here we go.
- Go ahead.

897
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,960
Just hit it over the net
with your hands.

898
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,480
(I'll hit it with my hands.)

899
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,320
- Out.
- Okay.

900
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,320
Young Ji, don't try to receive
any serves.

901
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,930
- It's out.
- Okay.

902
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,130
Young Ji, it's out.

903
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,430
- Got it.
- It's out.

904
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,030
- Get it together!
- Young Ji, get it together.

905
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,140
I'll get it together.

906
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,230
Here we go.

907
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,140
- That's good.
- Nice.

908
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,440
- It's in.
- It's in.

909
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
- It's in.
- Young Ji, don't receive it.

910
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,180
- Receive.
- What is he doing?

911
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,950
- Good. Hit it over the net.
- Hit it over the net.

912
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,880
- No, not that way.
- Okay.

913
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,920
I'm so sorry.

914
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,710
Don't be. It wasn't your fault.

915
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,360
(The human antibody
lowered his head.)

916
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,550
Heo Young Ji, since you,
the leader of her team, scored,

917
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,980
you can add another player
to your team...

918
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,130
- or eliminate Suk Jin.
- This is just the beginning.

919
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,130
(She can add a player to her team
or send one off from the other.)

920
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,520
(Bringing Jae Suk in
or sending Suk Jin off)

921
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,130
- What should we do?
- Add more players to our team.

922
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,430
- You should do that.
- Add more players to our team.

923
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,670
Please eliminate Suk Jin.
That'd be better for us.

924
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,290
- Eliminate Suk Jin.
- Add a player to our team.

925
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,290
- That's better.
- Okay. We'll bring him in.

926
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,500
- Suk Jin is no help at all.
- Okay. This is good.

927
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,530
- Good.
- It's Jong Kook's serve.

928
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,880
We'll end it with 11 points.

929
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,910
- Young Ji.
- Yes?

930
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,270
My ball! Darn it.

931
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,540
(He strikes up a conversation.)

932
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,070
My ball! Darn it.

933
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,740
(She ends up hugging the ball.)

934
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,040
- Hey!
- Out!

935
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,620
- I mean...
- Don't receive their serve.

936
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,190
- And Young Ji...
- Their serve...

937
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,660
- Don't think about receiving it.
- I won't.

938
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,550
- Bam bam.
- Take the serve instead.

939
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:30,290
- What if this is how the game ends?
- Don't receive it.

940
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,490
I mean...

941
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,290
They can't kick the ball
over the net.

942
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,760
This is no fun at all.

943
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,170
It's hardly any fun.

944
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,910
Could we please have a rally?

945
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,110
Suk Jin, you've got this, right?

946
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,710
Of course.

947
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,710
(The confident Suk Jin
makes his serve.)

948
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,650
- Young Ji, move.
- Young Ji, kick it.

949
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,650
Young Ji, with your foot!

950
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,950
- That's it.
- My ball.

951
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,450
- Me!
- With your head.

952
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,690
- Here.
- Use your hands instead!

953
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,310
Use your hands instead!
Punch the ball across.

954
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,160
- Here.
- Use your hands instead!

955
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,860
- Good.
- That's it.

956
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,480
- Good one.
- Nicely done.

957
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,660
- Nice.
- We're on a roll.

958
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,690
Use your hand.

959
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,860
- Nice!
- Okay!

960
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,750
Good one. Nice.

961
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,960
(She hit it with too much power.)

962
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,670
(Team Lee Young Ji scores properly
thanks to Heo Young Ji's mistake.)

963
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,870
- In 1, 2, 3.
- We've got this!

964
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,710
- Okay.
- Nice.

965
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,940
That was good.

966
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,570
Think about striking the ball
when it's up in the air.

967
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,710
- Like this?
- Yes.

968
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,210
Since you scored,
we can add another player.

969
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,540
- Then...
- All right.

970
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,070
- Is that how it's done?
- All right!

971
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,650
Let's go!

972
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,850
Me!

973
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,780
- Haha.
- Nice.

974
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,050
(The nimble Haha joins the game.)

975
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,980
- Nice.
- It's Nino Maximus.

976
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,660
- I'll pass the ball to you.
- Got it.

977
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,160
He adds nothing to the team.

978
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,360
(Team Heo Young Ji tenses up.)

979
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,520
There will be no difference.

980
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,560
(Young Ji and Young Ji
aren't backing down.)

981
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,700
There will be no difference.

982
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,960
Okay. We've got this.

983
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,060
We shouldn't fool around anymore.

984
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,260
(Haha enters the game
to save the team.)

985
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,300
We've got this.

986
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,530
- I'll receive the serve.
- Here we go!

987
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,680
Haha, you receive the ball.

988
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,350
Here we go.

989
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,680
I'll receive it this time.

990
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,850
- You'll receive it, right?
- It's mine.

991
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,470
You'll receive it, right?

992
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,390
- Okay.
- Good.

993
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,980
(Haha sends it over
close to the net.)

994
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,510
- Young Ji, move.
- Hey!

995
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,010
- Nice.
- You did well though.

996
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,160
You did well. It's all right.

997
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,690
- Good one.
- Nice!

998
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,250
- Nicely done.
- All I have to do is watch.

999
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,320
Here we go.

1000
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,400
- Nice.
- It's long.

1001
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,520
- Nice.
- It's long.

1002
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,670
- Take it.
- Oh, it wasn't.

1003
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,700
- Young Ji, hit it.
- Hit it hard.

1004
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,460
(He taps the ball with his head
and serves it to Young Ji.)

1005
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,570
- Nice.
- Nice.

1006
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,680
- Hit it.
- Hit it hard.

1007
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,710
(She spikes the ball
like she was taught.)

1008
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,300
- Good one.
- Give it to Young Ji.

1009
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,950
- That's it.
- Young Ji, hit it.

1010
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,150
Nicely done.

1011
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,620
Young Ji, hit it.

1012
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,950
(Tapping)

1013
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,420
That was good.

1014
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,780
- We still intimidated them.
- Take one player out.

1015
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,780
- We still intimidated them.
- That was very hip-hop of you.

1016
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,090
- Swag.
- Young Ji, what...

1017
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,860
There's no player
to take out though.

1018
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:42,960
Young Ji!

1019
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,550
- What now?
- There's no player to take out.

1020
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,700
Haha, you're out.

1021
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,960
Oh, we have to lose a player.

1022
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,460
Haha, you're out.

1023
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,490
Oh, we have to lose a player.

1024
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,200
(They lose Haha
who was their best player.)

1025
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,840
It was Haha who made us catch up.

1026
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,770
- This is hilarious.
- Shouldn't Suk Jin...

1027
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,710
- take a break?
- I have no energy left.

1028
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,880
Okay.

1029
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,410
- Already?
- I have no energy left.

1030
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,880
(Jae Suk serves.)

1031
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,510
- Mine!
- We're good.

1032
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,010
"Mine"?

1033
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,150
- Seriously?
- What on earth are you doing?

1034
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,850
(What?)

1035
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,860
(Huh?)

1036
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,190
(His depletion of energy
is evident.)

1037
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,280
Can he get a Pfizer shot?

1038
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,320
A Pfizer shot.

1039
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,990
Here. Here's a Yang-izer shot.

1040
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,320
Here you go.

1041
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,670
There.

1042
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,700
The ball doesn't bounce well
on this surface.

1043
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,730
What a mess.

1044
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,100
- Okay, do it.
- Here we go.

1045
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,260
- Here we go.
- The Pfizer shot!

1046
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,640
(The serve heads to Suk Jin
who got his booster shot.)

1047
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,070
Get it!

1048
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,380
Nice. Now, an overhead kick.

1049
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,300
Get it!

1050
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,710
Nice. Now, an overhead kick.

1051
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,210
- We're good.
- Hold on.

1052
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,880
Are you playing beach volleyball?

1053
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,090
Get it!

1054
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,510
(PE on the beach
with her home economics teacher.)

1055
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,690
Send it over the net.

1056
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,960
Okay, we're good.

1057
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,390
(PE on the beach
with her home economics teacher.)

1058
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,630
They're playing beach volleyball.

1059
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,220
Just leave them be.

1060
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,600
We won.

1061
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,430
- We won this point.
- I mean,

1062
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,930
it was like watching...

1063
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,670
a mother and a daughter
play volleyball on the beach.

1064
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,290
- Unbelievable.
- Not father, but mother?

1065
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,700
Sorry, I should've said "father."

1066
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,870
(My bad.)

1067
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,370
(Young Ji's mom
wants to take a break.)

1068
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,110
Can't someone take my place?

1069
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,230
I'd love to take your place.

1070
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,270
Me too.

1071
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,650
Young Ji, score this time...

1072
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,150
- so we can add a player.
- Got it.

1073
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,350
This team...

1074
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,770
No other player
has been able to join in.

1075
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,120
- Why is it just those two?
- Tell me about it.

1076
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,240
- Can't I join in?
- I want to play too!

1077
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,390
I'll score from this moment on.

1078
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,660
Suk Jin's exhausted.

1079
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,860
Suk Jin's exhausted,
so get playing already.

1080
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,090
Here we go!

1081
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,360
Suk Jin's exhausted.

1082
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,460
- Send it over.
- Toss the ball high.

1083
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,820
Darn it.

1084
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,090
- Send it over.
- Toss the ball high.

1085
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,940
(They have the worst chemistry.)

1086
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,900
(All they have to do
is serve to win.)

1087
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,610
(He's frustrated
past his tipping point.)

1088
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,170
Get over there with a Moderna shot.

1089
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,280
A Moderna shot?

1090
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,650
Shoot him up.

1091
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,780
The Janssen shot.

1092
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,970
Moderna?

1093
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:45,050
Keep your head on straight
and focus on scoring...

1094
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,240
- one point at a time.
- We can do this!

1095
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,960
- We can do it.
- Just end it.

1096
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,880
End the game.

1097
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,090
- It's long.
- Nicely done.

1098
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,260
- Gosh.
- Get it!

1099
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,860
- Nicely done.
- Get it!

1100
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,400
Seriously?

1101
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,320
Get it!

1102
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,590
Seriously?

1103
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,690
(They lost their last point
as the ball goes over his head.)

1104
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,760
- They'll lose a player.
- No, we don't have to.

1105
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,170
(Heo Young Ji wins Round 1
with a score of 11 to 5.)

1106
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,800
That was hilarious.

1107
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,940
(Team Lee Young Ji
had to bench most of their players.)

1108
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,130
Nice.

1109
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,130
There you go.

1110
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,150
I can't believe this.

1111
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,570
The first set is over.
We'll now move on to the second.

1112
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,840
- The first set it over?
- Okay.

1113
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,340
Heo Young Ji...

1114
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,820
and Jae Suk.

1115
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,090
- Okay.
- It's not bad.

1116
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,220
- If it's Suk Jin again...
- I know.

1117
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,280
Can't the player from
the first set be excluded?

1118
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,320
It's So Min.

1119
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,860
(So Min will play.)

1120
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,690
(Only So Min is excited.)

1121
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,820
Jeon So Min!

1122
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,590
- Jeon So Min!
- But she's the referee.

1123
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,130
Can a referee play?

1124
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,240
- The two of you...
- Let's do this!

1125
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,940
Let's do this!

1126
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,710
- You can both use your hands.
- All right.

1127
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,470
That's why you have
a good chance of winning.

1128
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,030
- Also...
- Don't use your palms.

1129
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,150
- Punch the ball instead.
- Got it.

1130
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,670
- This is what So Min loves.
- Don't kick the ball.

1131
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,150
- I...
- She's not on Jong Kook's team,

1132
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,240
and no one can
pull the brakes on her.

1133
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,940
- Kick it.
- Stay way behind the net.

1134
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,720
- Over here?
- Think that this is volleyball.

1135
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,880
How about here?

1136
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,960
(She's the eldest daughter
of a former soccer player.)

1137
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,030
Try kicking it.

1138
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,220
(She's the eldest daughter
of a former soccer player.)

1139
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,090
(Korean volleyball
has Kim Yeon Koung.)

1140
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:07,090
(And Korean foot volleyball
has Jeon So Min.)

1141
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,190
- Hey.
- Nice one.

1142
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,490
Be the referee instead.

1143
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,030
(This is how the master serves.)

1144
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,610
She can't serve properly.

1145
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,300
- Being the referee is the best.
- You can do this.

1146
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,170
- Let me try it again.
- Hold on.

1147
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,780
Can you let them serve
three steps ahead?

1148
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,010
- Just three steps.
- Okay.

1149
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,440
Only when they serve, okay?

1150
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,050
- Win the gave with only serves.
- Just three steps.

1151
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,510
- Yes, right there.
- That's the spot.

1152
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,050
- Take it easy.
- No pressure.

1153
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,360
- Nice one.
- Nicely done!

1154
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,220
(The team leader
found her composure.)

1155
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,550
There you go.

1156
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,690
Use your hand.

1157
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,860
(She boldly kicks the ball.)

1158
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,400
- Move back.
- Young Ji!

1159
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,530
The ball!

1160
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,590
- Nice!
- What on earth was that?

1161
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,860
Young Ji!

1162
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,740
(Heo Young Ji scores
with a bold kick.)

1163
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,210
How is she so good?

1164
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,010
- Young Ji!
- Our Young Ji...

1165
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,170
isn't on the athletic side.

1166
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,420
Will you add a player
or take one out from their team?

1167
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,970
- Sorry?
- Add or take out?

1168
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,150
Please take her out of the court!

1169
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,940
- Please take her out!
- We'll add a player.

1170
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,150
Hey!

1171
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,460
- Please take her out!
- We'll add a player.

1172
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,550
Hey!

1173
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,820
(Jong Kook enters the court
and So Min stays.)

1174
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,530
Can't you let us play the game too?

1175
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,490
We're not cheerleaders, you know.

1176
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,590
Se Chan and...

1177
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,840
- Ji Hyo...
- We can do this.

1178
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,070
They haven't been able
to play at all.

1179
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,030
Someone should be in the back
to receive the ball.

1180
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,630
- This is like the Olympics.
- Here we go!

1181
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,740
(The courageous Leader Heo
serves the ball.)

1182
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,400
- We can do this!
- She's really good.

1183
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,170
- With your hands.
- Your hands!

1184
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,740
(Receive it with your hands!)

1185
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,820
The one in the back
should've gotten it!

1186
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,380
The one in the back
should've gotten it!

1187
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,880
Why do you want to play?

1188
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,150
Why do you want to play
foot volleyball with us?

1189
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,760
Did you see them let the ball pass?

1190
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,030
This was So Min.

1191
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,960
(He teases their comedic moves.)

1192
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,760
- That was...
- Hold on.

1193
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,420
- You should've called it.
- Whose side are you on?

1194
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,920
- Why didn't you call it?
- So Min.

1195
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,130
You can either...

1196
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,940
take So Min out
or keep playing as is.

1197
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,970
Don't take her out.
We shouldn't take her out.

1198
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,630
- We'll play as is.
- Sure thing.

1199
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,800
- Play as is.
- Got it.

1200
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,610
Team Heo Young Ji
won't take So Min out.

1201
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,010
- We'll play as is.
- What?

1202
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,670
Please take her out.

1203
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,050
- No, we're good.
- Adhere to the rules.

1204
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,550
- She's better off on her own.
- I know.

1205
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,240
- Then...
- So Min, stand here instead.

1206
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,720
All right.

1207
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,150
I'll stay along this line.

1208
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,820
- Go, go!
- Go for it.

1209
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,420
- Nice.
- She's good at this.

1210
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,920
Mine!

1211
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,760
- Okay.
- Now send it over the net.

1212
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,400
Wait. Didn't she just hold the ball?

1213
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,630
- Now send it over the net.
- Send it over.

1214
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,630
Didn't she just hold the ball?

1215
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,760
- Double contact!
- No way.

1216
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,110
- Look.
- Double contact.

1217
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,470
- She held the ball.
- Exactly.

1218
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,900
- That was double contact.
- Isn't that allowed?

1219
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,470
- This...
- That was wrong.

1220
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,900
So Min, how could you?

1221
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,420
- I...
- How could you be this bad?

1222
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,610
That's not it.

1223
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,240
The ball can be hit three times.

1224
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,920
Yes, but you held the ball.

1225
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
I didn't.

1226
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,760
The one behind should
receive the ball, okay?

1227
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,050
Young Ji, So Min,

1228
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,460
bounce it on your arms like so.

1229
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,320
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

1230
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,900
Young Ji,

1231
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,190
- your serves are superb.
- Take a few steps back.

1232
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,530
(She reflects the serve!)

1233
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,690
Take a few steps back.

1234
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,860
(Oh, dear)

1235
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,800
The one in the back
receives the serve!

1236
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,710
Darn it!

1237
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,010
(The one in the back
receives the serve!)

1238
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,440
(Coach Ha has had it.)

1239
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,970
Oh, no.

1240
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,840
(He speaks for everyone benched.)

1241
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,920
I know what should be done,
but I can't do it.

1242
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,190
- I want to do better, you know.
- You're killing me.

1243
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,720
- I...
- The one in the back.

1244
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,280
The one in the back
should receive the serve.

1245
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,550
Okay, the one in the back.

1246
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,090
- Stay calm.
- We still have a chance.

1247
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,260
Young Ji!

1248
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,150
Young Ji, calm down.

1249
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,920
Let's do this!

1250
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,990
- Okay.
- Nice.

1251
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,570
Young Ji's doing so well.

1252
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,340
- She's the best.
- Get the ball.

1253
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,860
Mine.

1254
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,260
- Send it over the net.
- Over the net.

1255
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,800
- Send it over the net.
- Over the net.

1256
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:40,150
(She sends it flying
without looking first.)

1257
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,670
Send it over the net!

1258
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,070
(Coach Ha is close to tears.)

1259
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,840
How can you be so bad at this?

1260
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,920
But we did a good job this time.

1261
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,260
- We did.
- That was good.

1262
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,820
- We had good chemistry.
- We did a good job.

1263
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,860
- It was awesome.
- Wait.

1264
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,820
Did you hear them just now?

1265
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,220
- They complimented each other.
- Good job.

1266
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,570
Why don't you receive the serve?

1267
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,590
- Okay, I will.
- We've got this!

1268
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,720
How is Young Ji so good at this?

1269
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,760
- She's the best.
- The absolute best.

1270
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,760
- Look at that.
- Receive it.

1271
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,110
(The ball drops on the edge
of the court.)

1272
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,710
- There you go.
- Hit it, So Min.

1273
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,030
- That's good.
- Hit it, So Min.

1274
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,070
Pass it to her.

1275
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,380
- She got it.
- It's coming.

1276
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:17,150
- It's coming. There you go.
- Well done.

1277
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,490
There you go!

1278
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:23,050
(Team Lee Young Ji
scores for the first time.)

1279
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,110
We did it!

1280
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,150
(So Min and Young Ji embrace
each other as they're deeply moved.)

1281
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,760
(A miracle came to them
when they were about to give up)

1282
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,190
We won, right?

1283
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,590
So Min, you can do it.

1284
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,130
This is how you play.

1285
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,490
You could do it because
you pulled yourself together.

1286
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,860
- You never know.
- I'm so happy.

1287
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,800
(It's okay.)

1288
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,900
That was great.

1289
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,300
Well done, Young Ji.
I won't yell at you anymore.

1290
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,630
- So Min, you did well too.
- Good job.

1291
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,030
- You did well.
- So Min, good job.

1292
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,470
Take it easy. You can do it.

1293
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,550
- Praise breeds willingness.
- Let's go!

1294
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,740
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy. Well done.

1295
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,820
- There you go!
- There you go.

1296
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,380
- She's good.
- That was a good kick.

1297
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,440
- That's good.
- Well done.

1298
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,490
- Young Ji, toss it over.
- Young Ji, toss it over.

1299
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,320
- That's it.
- Receive it. Take it easy.

1300
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,380
- There you go.
- Good one.

1301
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,090
- Young Ji, come! Attack them!
- Pass it. What are you doing?

1302
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,130
Why aren't you moving?

1303
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,490
- Good one.
- Young Ji, come! Attack them!

1304
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:04,860
(She just stretches herself
without budging her feet.)

1305
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,300
(Why aren't you moving?)

1306
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,070
- I did move!
- What was that?

1307
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,070
- That was...
- What was that?

1308
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:13,360
- I did move!
- Why didn't you move?

1309
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,470
Pass me the ball.

1310
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,800
So Min, as long as
you're having fun, it's all good.

1311
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,280
I'm going to die out of frustration.

1312
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,670
It's so funny that you guys
don't get to play.

1313
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,570
Ji Hyo and I didn't get to play
at all.

1314
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,010
- You can do it.
- This is driving me crazy.

1315
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,610
- Young Ji is really good.
- Pass it forward.

1316
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,860
- She's really good.
- The court is too big.

1317
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,990
Use your hands. Pass it forward.

1318
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,780
- Use your hands. Pass it forward.
- That's it.

1319
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,050
She did it.

1320
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,550
(Stealthily touching the ball
twice in a row)

1321
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,860
- That's it. Young Ji touched it.
- We got it.

1322
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,990
- Go! Attack them, Young Ji!
- It's over.

1323
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,260
- She did it!
- No, that doesn't count.

1324
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,260
- Nice. She did it.
- No, it was double contact.

1325
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,510
- Just let it slide this time.
- Let it slide.

1326
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,070
But she...

1327
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,510
I want to let this go for once.

1328
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,800
- We'll let it slide.
- We'll let it slide.

1329
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,150
I want to let it slide.

1330
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,150
Will you add a player or remove one?

1331
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,170
- We'll add one.
- Let's add one more player.

1332
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,920
(Thanks to Captain Lee,
they get to add another player.)

1333
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,940
- If Suk Jin joins...
- Please!

1334
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,010
Let it be Suk Jin.

1335
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,760
(Who will be joining
to play this time?)

1336
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,090
- Se Chan.
- All right!

1337
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,420
(Se Chan will join the game.)

1338
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,630
- Se Chan.
- All right!

1339
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,690
Let's go to the finals.

1340
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:12,300
(Se Chan joins the game
when his team is losing.)

1341
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,260
We got this now!

1342
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,990
He'll defend,
so you two should move up.

1343
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,300
You two should move up.

1344
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,710
I'll head the ball to you guys.

1345
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,860
- I'll head the ball to you guys.
- You should spike the ball.

1346
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,570
Even if he...

1347
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,740
Even if he receives the serve,
So Min...

1348
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,650
- It's either Young Ji or So Min.
- Then Young Ji can receive it.

1349
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:27,880
- We can toss the ball over.
- That's right.

1350
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,570
Serve it well.

1351
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,470
(After a deep breath,)

1352
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,720
(Se Chan takes the serve.)

1353
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,740
- That's it.
- That's it.

1354
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,940
- Here it comes.
- I got it.

1355
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,760
- Young Ji!
- Use your hands, Young Ji!

1356
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,090
That was good.

1357
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,380
(Young Ji tosses it over short,
avoiding Se Chan.)

1358
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,090
(Tapping)

1359
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,400
(Young Ji saves it!)

1360
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,300
- You should block it!
- Toss it over!

1361
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,630
- Young Ji!
- That's it.

1362
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,720
(Hitting the ball multiple times)

1363
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,840
- You should block it!
- Toss it over!

1364
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,360
- Toss it over!
- That's it.

1365
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,840
(She flapped her hands in the air.)

1366
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,170
Are you doing a karate chop?

1367
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,050
That was a fail.

1368
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,110
(Laughing)

1369
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,840
It's so funny
that they don't get to play.

1370
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,880
They can't even toss the ball over.

1371
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,110
(Their play is so clumsy that
their teammate can't join to play.)

1372
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,490
Forget it!

1373
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:09,860
(So Min finds it absurd herself.)

1374
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,920
Hey.

1375
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,320
(Drawing a player
to remove from Team Lee Young Ji)

1376
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,490
(Se Chan is out.)

1377
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:16,860
Se Chan will be removed.

1378
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,670
But I played only once!

1379
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,920
- That's so mean.
- I played only once.

1380
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,400
That's so mean.

1381
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,970
Let's have Se Chan removed.

1382
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,340
- That's so mean.
- I only got to kick once!

1383
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,470
(Se Chan is so upset
that he can't close his mouth.)

1384
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,210
Remove him. All right.

1385
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,800
So Min isn't even disappointed.

1386
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,840
I'm having so much fun, but...

1387
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,380
What's the score?
Do we not have it yet?

1388
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,880
- It's their match point.
- What did you say?

1389
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,920
- It's their match point.
- It's their match point already?

1390
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,010
Ji Hyo never even got to play.

1391
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,460
And I only got to play once.

1392
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,630
We can do it.

1393
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,530
I want to play too.

1394
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,050
It's okay as long as we don't
give up. Let's show a miracle.

1395
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,760
- I'll receive the ball.
- She's really good.

1396
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,860
Let's finish this.

1397
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,900
(It's Captain Heo's serve.)

1398
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,970
- She's really good.
- I got it!

1399
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,240
- Receive it!
- Use your hands!

1400
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,800
(Young Ji's receive)

1401
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,400
- Don't be nervous.
- Get the ball!

1402
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,300
(And So Min's toss)

1403
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,840
- That's good! Now spike it!
- Spike!

1404
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,970
Darn it!

1405
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,470
Nice!

1406
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:07,470
- Now spike it!
- Spike!

1407
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:10,050
(She spiked the ball into the net.)

1408
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,780
I did spike the ball.

1409
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,690
Well begun is half done!

1410
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:14,720
But you were supposed to
toss it over.

1411
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,530
(They take the victory
with the minimum effort.)

1412
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,280
It was not fun at all!

1413
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,260
- What was that?
- It's absurd.

1414
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,090
Jong Kook,
what kind of rule is this?

1415
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,320
- We didn't get to play at all.
- This is so absurd.

1416
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,030
This is absurd.

1417
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,340
(Captain Heo
is laughing out of joy.)

1418
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,340
The commentating ends here.

1419
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:35,070
- My goodness.
- The winner is...

1420
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,840
- Why are your serves so sharp?
- Team Heo Young Ji.

1421
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,170
Lee Young Ji will lose six points.

1422
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,280
(Captain Lee loses 6 points.)

1423
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,920
And Heo Young Ji will distribute
15 points to her teammates.

1424
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,970
All right!

1425
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,340
Jae Suk and Jong Kook,
get your points.

1426
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,490
- My goodness.
- Young Ji.

1427
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,690
- Yes?
- You must be different from her.

1428
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,010
I don't know if it's okay
to take these points.

1429
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,650
I know. This is embarrassing.

1430
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:53,880
- Good work!
- Thanks.

1431
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,220
- I don't know if this is okay.
- This is...

1432
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,530
(They take the point card
that Young Ji wrote.)

1433
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,760
(They got only 1 point each
from Lee Young Ji in Round 1.)

1434
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,690
(How many points
did Captain Heo give to them?)

1435
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,760
She's such a scum.

1436
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:09,240
- Jae Suk, don't be...
- Young Ji, you are...

1437
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,530
I mean... Goodness, this is...

1438
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,340
(Stupefied)

1439
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,780
You've got to be kidding me.

1440
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,570
- Gosh, this is...
- Both Young Ji's are...

1441
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:20,840
How many points did she give out
that she ran away?

1442
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,220
That was hilarious.

1443
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,510
Let's have fun.

1444
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:26,090
It's time to choose your team
for Round Three.

1445
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,590
The two captains
will stay inside the room,

1446
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:29,030
and the rest will take turns
to choose their team.

1447
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,530
It looks like...

1448
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,300
they're both stingy
in giving out points.

1449
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,470
Let's do this! Pfizer!

1450
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,760
Wait.

1451
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:39,510
I came to Lee Young Ji when I was
thinking of joining Heo Young Ji.

1452
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,800
- Let's do this!
- I bet we'll play a quiz this time.

1453
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,710
- What's the capital of Switzerland?
- We'll be playing a quiz.

1454
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,150
- Isn't it Geneva?
- Geneva?

1455
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:48,740
- What about the capital of Africa?
- I'll tell you.

1456
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,740
Which country from Africa?

1457
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,010
- Oh, a country from Africa?
- Africa is a continent.

1458
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,240
Right.

1459
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,960
- I'm in big trouble.
- Africa is a continent.

1460
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,860
(Lee Young Ji doesn't seem
that different from Heo Young Ji.)

1461
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,820
- What's the capital of Australia?
- Australia?

1462
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,320
It's Australia, right?

1463
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,630
- Yes, it is.
- Australia is known for kangaroos.

1464
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,800
They have kangaroos.

1465
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:08,420
They also have nice sceneries.

1466
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,670
And most of their cuisines
are greasy.

1467
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,300
(It looks like Suk Jin
has come across a big obstacle.)

1468
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,760
- What about Malaysia?
- Malaysia.

1469
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,170
- It begins with "Ku".
- Malaysia. "Ku"?

1470
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,300
- "Ku".
- "Ku"? The rice cooker brand?

1471
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,550
It's Cuckoo.

1472
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,340
- It begins with "Kuala".
- "Kuala"?

1473
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,570
Yes, it's Kuala...

1474
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:26,650
Kuala Guskida Dudalmans.

1475
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,880
- It's Kuala Lum...
- Kuala Lumbalumba? Kuala Lumpur.

1476
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,110
It's Kuala Lumpur.

1477
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,460
What? How do you know all this?

1478
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,280
- It's Kuala Lumpur.
- Oh, I see.

1479
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,630
Suk Jin is here.

1480
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,460
All right. We'll win
if we play a quiz.

1481
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,920
(Ji Hyo joins
Team Lee Young Ji too.)

1482
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,690
- Kuala Lumpur.
- What's she doing here?

1483
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,260
- She knows the capital of Malaysia.
- What's the capital of Malaysia?

1484
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,340
Manila.

1485
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,340
- She doesn't know.
- Malaysia?

1486
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,670
She sounds so confident.

1487
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:51,300
Ji Hyo, don't use
your brain already.

1488
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,510
- Keyser Soze
- Keyser Soze

1489
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,150
- All right, we're all set.
- Sonador and Sparta

1490
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,420
The teams are decided.

1491
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,740
- It's over?
- Really?

1492
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:00,420
- No one else is coming?
- This is it?

1493
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,260
We'll play a simple mission
before lunch.

1494
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,090
While we prepare lunch,
we'll play a simple mission.

1495
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,030
Then will we switch teams again
after that?

1496
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,690
- If it's a simple mission...
- Then it won't be a quiz.

1497
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,760
- Because a quiz is the main event.
- That's right.

1498
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,420
(What's the mission
they will play next?)

1499
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:13,670
It's our lunch!

1500
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:14,800
(They're having lunch
after selecting their teams.)

1501
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,670
There are so many different dishes.

1502
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,670
(All kinds of food
are waiting for them.)

1503
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,740
They all look so good.

1504
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,940
It's dumpling hot pot.

1505
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:24,210
There's chocolate ice cream.
It's my favorite!

1506
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,280
I guess we take a dish each
once we win something.

1507
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,220
There's a xylophone.
It looks like we'll play a quiz.

1508
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,920
- We're playing a quiz.
- It looks like we'll play a quiz.

1509
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,780
(The new Empty Head is intimidated.)

1510
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,380
I feel like I have
an upset stomach already.

1511
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,760
- What's 7 times 4?
- It's 28.

1512
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,420
Everyone, here's the next mission.

1513
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,760
If you answer
as many questions as you can,

1514
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,630
you'll get to have a hearty meal.

1515
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:46,970
- We're in trouble.
- We got this!

1516
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:48,800
It's called Empty Heads' Lunch.

1517
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,900
(Empty Heads' Lunch)

1518
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,170
- We're in trouble.
- We got this!

1519
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,240
We're playing a quiz?

1520
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,970
(Team Heo Young Ji
quickly becomes downbeat.)

1521
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,470
Didn't you say...

1522
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:00,470
that we'll have lunch
after a simple mission?

1523
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:02,720
Actually, I'm not that hungry.

1524
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,050
No, we never know. We can do this.

1525
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,280
I'll just trust Jong Kook.

1526
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,220
- We can do it, Young Ji. It's okay.
- Let's trust Jong Kook.

1527
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,720
- We can do this.
- Let's trust him and play.

1528
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,490
- Let's do this.
- The capital of Italy is Paris.

1529
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:13,760
- What did you say?
- We're done for.

1530
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,380
(Did I hear her wrong?)

1531
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,860
- How is Paris the capital of Italy?
- The capital of Italy is Paris.

1532
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,190
- It's Rome.
- Where was it again?

1533
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,070
- Lapura Pumpura?
- Kuala Lumpur.

1534
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,030
It's not Lapura Pumpura.
It's Kuala Lumpur.

1535
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,490
- Kuala Lumpra.
- It's the capital of Malaysia.

1536
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,440
- What about Mongolia?
- Kuala Lumpra.

1537
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,440
- What about Mongolia?
- Mongolia?

1538
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,380
- Ulaanbaatar.
- Ulaanbar?

1539
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,610
- What's Ulaanbar?
- The food prepared behind you...

1540
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:32,900
is your lunch for today.

1541
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,010
I want to eat it so badly.

1542
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:37,820
Each player from each team
will come forward to play.

1543
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,510
They'll answer a question
related to each dish.

1544
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:41,990
The one who wins
will earn that dish.

1545
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:43,690
- It's a quiz related to food.
- It could be difficult.

1546
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:44,990
- I've had a lot of dishes.
- It's related to food?

1547
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:48,130
The team that earns more dishes
among the 11 dishes wins.

1548
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:50,960
And you can have your lunch
with the dishes you earned.

1549
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,590
We never know though.
It's a quiz related to food.

1550
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:54,400
But I think
we'll be better than them.

1551
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,590
(He's already panicking.)

1552
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:59,340
(How do you spell ice cream?)

1553
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,070
How do you spell ice cream?
I, C, E...

1554
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:04,610
- I think we'll be able to answer.
- C, I?

1555
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,170
How do you spell cream?

1556
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,420
Let's study.

1557
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,880
What about pasta? P, A...

1558
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,510
He's thinking of the spelling
for ice cream.

1559
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:14,650
He went, "I, C, E".

1560
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,610
- He's studying spelling.
- I'm studying spelling.

1561
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,860
- How do you spell "Yookgaejang"?
- First of all,

1562
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,860
decide which player...

1563
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,650
will go first from each team.

1564
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:25,800
Okay. But the order
doesn't really matter.

1565
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,900
- It doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter.

1566
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,090
- Let's just go in this order.
- Let me go up against Ji Hyo.

1567
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,670
Okay.

1568
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,190
So Min wants to
go up against Ji Hyo.

1569
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,030
Me too.

1570
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,210
- I want to go up against Ji Hyo.
- I love her so much.

1571
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,280
How come no one wants to
go up against Haha?

1572
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,400
- He's gotten smarter.
- I'm on another level.

1573
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:41,650
"Another level"?

1574
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,340
The first dish is the appetizer
behind you.

1575
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,550
- It's a roast chicken salad.
- It looks good.

1576
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,090
Oh, it's a chicken salad.

1577
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:52,650
If you know the answer,
shout out, "Answer".

1578
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:53,720
- Young Ji.
- Then you can answer.

1579
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,190
- Here we go. I got this.
- Let's go.

1580
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:57,260
It's a question related
to a roast chicken salad.

1581
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:01,070
The president of the US,
President Joe Biden...

1582
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,970
said his favorite dish
is roast chicken salad.

1583
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:07,300
Taking that into consideration,
what is the full name of...

1584
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,940
the Vice President
of the United States?

1585
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,630
- What?
- He mentioned it earlier.

1586
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:13,650
(How is roast chicken salad related
to the Vice President of the US?)

1587
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,400
- Didn't you say...
- They don't know the answer.

1588
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,170
- this was a food question?
- I know.

1589
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,090
I was going to say
balsamic vinaigrette.

1590
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:20,380
- Gosh.
- Why?

1591
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:21,940
The Vice President...

1592
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,050
You mentioned it last time.
It came out on Running Man.

1593
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:25,490
- It did!
- Don't look back.

1594
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,420
(The Vice President of the US
is a familiar question.)

1595
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,460
I know it.

1596
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:30,760
I mentioned it last time.

1597
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,990
I know.

1598
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,470
(In Episode 533)

1599
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,360
(The answer: Kamala Harris)

1600
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,900
(Jae Suk said the Vice President's
full name correctly.)

1601
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,470
Even though it came out on our show,
I bet these two don't know it.

1602
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,010
- I don't remember.
- Isn't it Headbelt?

1603
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,050
(Isn't it Headbelt?)

1604
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,110
(What's the full name of
the Vice President of the US?)

1605
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,380
- Hey!
- It's not?

1606
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:50,670
(They don't seem
to have a clue either.)

1607
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,440
Okay. I'll give you a hint.
It's a woman.

1608
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,590
Right.

1609
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,690
- Emily.
- Hold on.

1610
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:55,690
(Exclaiming)

1611
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,220
- Was I close?
- No.

1612
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,860
Her first name has 3 syllables,
and her last name has 3 syllables.

1613
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:04,030
Emily Houston.

1614
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:06,170
That was good. Go in that direction.

1615
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:07,800
Emily Pumbaa.

1616
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,670
- I'll give you her initials.
- Okay.

1617
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:10,990
(They gave them her initials.)

1618
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:12,610
- It's quite easy.
- Okay.

1619
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,210
This is it.

1620
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,340
- Do you remember?
- Answer! Kamila Herris.

1621
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,280
- It's close.
- Herris.

1622
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,050
(She sounds so confident
that we thought she was right.)

1623
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:22,440
- Answer! Kamira Harris.
- That's wrong.

1624
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,150
Kamula Harris.

1625
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,550
- You're almost there.
- Kamela Harris.

1626
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,490
Kamera Harris.

1627
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:29,590
Kamera?

1628
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,090
Kamira Harris.

1629
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:32,820
Kamula.

1630
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,990
Kamila. Kamala.

1631
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:36,760
Kamal... Hold on!

1632
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,900
- She didn't say, "Answer".
- Kamala!

1633
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,420
(She took a bunch of wild guesses
and got it right.)

1634
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,440
- Kamala.
- Kamala Harris.

1635
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,030
- Kamala Harris.
- That's right. Kamala Harris.

1636
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,970
- Hold on.
- How it's read is different.

1637
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,630
I'm struggling to be heard
next to Young Ji.

1638
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:51,210
- She's louder than me.
- You have to be louder.

1639
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:53,570
- I really do.
- You can take the salad with you.

1640
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:54,570
- Okay!
- Yes.

1641
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,010
It's Yang Se Chan
versus Yoo Jae Suk now.

1642
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:57,070
Okay. Very good.

1643
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:58,220
- What's important is...
- Who's Se Chan up against?

1644
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,280
- Jae Suk.
- Okay. Very good.

1645
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,280
- I'll try to win.
- Go for it!

1646
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,920
- This is good.
- Try to win.

1647
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,380
- Try winning.
- You can win! We're going to eat.

1648
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,460
This next dish is japchae.

1649
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,860
- Japchae?
- Japchae?

1650
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,990
We have to win this!

1651
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:11,150
- Japchae is good. Jang Geum!
- This is ours.

1652
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:13,190
- This is a traditional dish.
- It might be a question...

1653
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:14,470
- about Korea.
- We have a chance.

1654
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:19,340
Japchae came to be what it is now
when a glass noodle factory...

1655
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:23,470
was built in Hwanghae Province
in North Korea in the 1920s.

1656
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,280
- And?
- Right.

1657
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,380
How do you say, "I had ramyeon
and now my sphincter hurts."

1658
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,470
"Can I get some medicine?"
in the North Korean dialect?

1659
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:30,570
What? All of a sudden?

1660
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:31,670
How do you say, "I had ramyeon
and now my sphincter hurts."

1661
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:32,920
(What? All of a sudden?)

1662
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,110
- This is a good one.
- What kind of question is this?

1663
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,780
Hard questions like this...

1664
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,650
- Give him a chance.
- He might get it right.

1665
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,190
- Answer.
- Okay.

1666
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:44,550
Well, I consumed some ramyeon,

1667
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:47,920
(An unknown dialect and a man
whose legs can't stop shaking)

1668
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,070
and my sphincter hurts.

1669
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:52,740
- Say butthole instead of sphincter.
- This is wrong.

1670
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,170
(Wrong)

1671
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,570
Well, I had some ramyeon,

1672
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,440
and my backside hurts.

1673
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,220
Can you give me something
to put on it?

1674
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,780
There's a separate word for
ramyeon and sphincter.

1675
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,090
- There's a word for them.
- Anal control.

1676
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:09,610
The word for ramyeon
is pretty famous.

1677
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,820
- Okay. Answer!
- Ramyeon?

1678
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,880
- I ate some curly noodles,
- Curly noodles.

1679
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,260
and the hole where
my poop comes out...

1680
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,300
(The hole where poop comes out)

1681
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:23,570
(He got graphic when asked
to speak in a North Korean dialect.)

1682
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:25,070
Curly noodles must be right.

1683
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:27,900
Good job. That was so exact.

1684
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,210
It was good. Very direct.

1685
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,210
Ramyeon was close.

1686
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,380
- Answer.
- Really?

1687
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,170
- Answer. Curly noodles...
- Really?

1688
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,050
I ate some curly noodles,

1689
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,170
and my rear hurts.

1690
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:39,170
- Can you give me some medicine?
- This could be right.

1691
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,090
Your rear shouldn't hurt.

1692
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:44,010
I had some curly noodles,

1693
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,420
and I... Well... I...

1694
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,650
- What is the word for sphincter?
- The... Well...

1695
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,400
The thing that's in your rear...

1696
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,360
It has wrinkles...

1697
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:56,760
Why is the explanation so detailed?

1698
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,630
- It's too...
- Right.

1699
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:01,630
They call it an anus in the South...

1700
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,010
That part hurts,
so can you give me some medicine?

1701
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:08,210
It starts with a "C",
but it's not "curly".

1702
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:09,820
It starts with a "C",
and it's similar.

1703
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,050
- I think it's curled noodles,
- What's sphincter though?

1704
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:12,170
- but I don't know "sphincter".
- "Sphincter" is hard.

1705
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:14,090
Sphincter ends with "skin".

1706
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,920
- Skin?
- Anal skin?

1707
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,920
- Anus?
- Anus?

1708
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,090
- Anus is from Chinese characters.
- Anus... Oh, right.

1709
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,380
- Answer!
- Okay.

1710
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,990
I ate some curled noodles,

1711
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:25,320
and...

1712
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,990
Stop touching your butt!

1713
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:31,260
(His hands go to his rear
instinctually.)

1714
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,440
Why do you keep doing that?

1715
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,840
Why do you keep
touching your bottom?

1716
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,670
You just need to think of a word.
Why do you keep doing that?

1717
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:37,880
I was hoping it would help...

1718
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,670
- What is it?
- What's a word for tightening?

1719
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,470
(Tightening?)

1720
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:43,970
(Answer!)

1721
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:45,050
Answer!

1722
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:47,320
I had curled noodles,

1723
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,150
and my pursing skin hurts.
Can you give me some medicine?

1724
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,360
Yes!

1725
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:53,530
- Japchae! Japchae!
- Pursing skin?

1726
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,780
(They were hoping for a twist,
but there wasn't one.)

1727
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:58,190
- Japchae! Japchae!
- Japchae.

1728
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:00,420
(Team Lee Young Ji gets the japchae
thanks to Jae Suk's quick wits.)

1729
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,170
- Pursing skin.
- Pursing skin?

1730
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:04,840
- Okay. Very good.
- Okay.

1731
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,800
- I'm going to win!
- You can do it!

1732
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,210
I can do it!

1733
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:10,440
There's a brunch dish, right?

1734
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,610
- Yes, there is.
- Yes. Toast.

1735
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,800
It looks very filling.

1736
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:17,670
In Western countries,

1737
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,170
they have...

1738
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:22,990
bacon, scrambled eggs, sausages,
and potatoes for brunch.

1739
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:24,650
- Right.
- If that's the case,

1740
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:26,690
what is the famous quote that...

1741
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,420
the British philosopher,
Francis Bacon said?

1742
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,650
(Bacon?)

1743
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:34,800
Cook it slightly.

1744
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,970
Bacon tastes best
when it's cooked over low heat.

1745
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:40,030
- Bacon...
- It's best cooked over low heat.

1746
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,670
- Bacon's famous quote...
- You see it in bathrooms often.

1747
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:43,940
A famous quote.

1748
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,030
Everyone knows this quote.

1749
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,170
It's a famous quote.

1750
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:48,570
- Bacon said it?
- Everyone knows this.

1751
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,280
Bacon said this in the bathroom?

1752
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:52,340
- It's a quote.
- "Know thyself." That's Socrates.

1753
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,320
- Bacon is a philosopher.
- Right. You know this quote.

1754
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,860
- We know it? He's a philosopher?
- We all know this quote.

1755
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,360
- Answer.
- It's the most famous quote.

1756
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,530
Marriage and death
are best done late.

1757
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:03,050
- Hey.
- That's not right.

1758
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:04,150
Isn't that your saying?

1759
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:05,300
("Marriage and death are
best done late." By JiSuk Jin)

1760
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,360
(A famous quote by
the Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong)

1761
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,260
- Is that your philosophy on life?
- That's just something you say.

1762
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,740
That's not it.

1763
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,530
- That's just something you say.
- That's not it.

1764
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,740
That's just something you say.

1765
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:16,800
I wonder what the answer is.

1766
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,110
- Bacon.
- Is it related to bacon?

1767
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,670
- No.
- No. That's his name.

1768
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:22,170
- The philosopher's name is Bacon.
- A British philosopher.

1769
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,670
The three of us
were talking about bacon.

1770
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,740
I thought it was an idiom
about bacon.

1771
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,590
This is the first quote
that comes to mind...

1772
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:31,860
- when you think philosopher.
- Really?

1773
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,720
Answer! "Tears aren't the only
thing that men must not spill."

1774
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,820
- That's about using the bathroom!
- What are you saying?

1775
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,900
- Why would you say that?
- I just lost my appetite.

1776
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,170
Seriously.

1777
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:42,360
This quote is perfect
for this situation.

1778
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,170
- That's right.
- It's true.

1779
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:47,210
This suits the empty heads.

1780
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,860
- It suits the empty heads?
- Answer!

1781
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,280
"Knowledge is power"?

1782
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,470
- That's the answer!
- See? I was right.

1783
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,670
"Knowledge is power"?

1784
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,280
(All he ended up doing was saying
his own quotes.)

1785
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,420
It was this easy?

1786
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:59,650
Really?

1787
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,220
This wasn't said by someone
from Korea?

1788
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,490
("Knowledge is power" wasn't said
by someone from Korea?)

1789
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,050
- Suk Jin...
- This was the answer?

1790
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,460
- This was Bacon?
- When it was our turns,

1791
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,550
- he kept criticizing us.
- What was his name again?

1792
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,360
- Francis Bacon.
- I should remember this.

1793
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,420
Bacon.

1794
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:15,300
"Knowledge is power".

1795
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,590
- Go.
- Ji Hyo, go up.

1796
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:18,970
Let's go, Ji Hyo.
The main event is here.

1797
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,010
Let's go.

1798
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:21,570
(Up against Ji Hyo is...)

1799
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:22,880
- Jeon So Min, let's go!
- Ji Hyo.

1800
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,010
- Me?
- Okay.

1801
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:27,280
- Ji Hyo. Be confident.
- Okay.

1802
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,740
- You can do it!
- Just...

1803
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,380
- "Knowledge is power." Bacon.
- Just...

1804
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,380
- say what comes to mind.
- Okay.

1805
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,090
"Knowledge is power."
by Francis Bacon.

1806
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:34,280
"Knowledge is power."

1807
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,920
(The person behind the legendary
Jeoktoma Answer Case, Song Ji Hyo)

1808
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,760
I can do this.

1809
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,860
(So Min is trying to make up for
Ambrella.)

1810
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,280
This is the match of the century.

1811
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,280
(The match of the century)

1812
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,900
They look down on one another.

1813
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,030
(Jeon So Min vs. Song Ji Hyo)

1814
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,530
The next dish is pizza.

1815
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:49,840
We can't miss out on this.

1816
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,400
- Come on!
- This is the question for pizza.

1817
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:57,780
When you order pizza, they try to
make sure the slices are the same.

1818
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:01,440
Then what do you call a triangle
with two sides that are the same?

1819
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,380
(What do you call a triangle
with two sides that are the same?)

1820
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,070
This is really easy!

1821
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:06,780
- You can't give her a hint.
- This is so easy!

1822
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,220
Do you know the answer?

1823
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,050
(This question comes out in math
textbooks for elementary school.)

1824
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:11,320
- Triangle?
- It's a type of triangle...

1825
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,960
I know this.

1826
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,380
- It's...
- I know this.

1827
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:17,420
It's a triangle where two sides
are the same length.

1828
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,570
(A triangle where two sides
are the same length?)

1829
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:20,590
A triangle?

1830
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,760
Answer. An equilateral.

1831
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,840
(Correct)

1832
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,030
(Make some noise for Song Jeoktoma!)

1833
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:30,780
You got it!

1834
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,170
(The empty head siblings
didn't know the answer.)

1835
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:35,650
You got it!

1836
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:38,220
(Ji Hyo remembers what she learned
in grade school math.)

1837
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,490
- You got it!
- How did you know this?

1838
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,590
The pizza is shaped like
an equilateral!

1839
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,650
- How did you know this?
- You knew this?

1840
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:46,590
(Song Ji Hyo sets a record
of 2 answers this season.)

1841
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,420
Why are you guys so surprised?

1842
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,550
- How did you know this?
- You're so cool!

1843
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:52,360
- It just came to mind.
- Take a seat here.

1844
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,670
- That was incredible.
- Jeon So Min is done for.

1845
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:54,760
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

1846
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,860
(After Song Jeoktoma
got the answer right,)

1847
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:02,070
(she turned pale and froze
in her seat.)

1848
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:05,530
- I... I didn't even get to speak.
- Good try.

1849
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:07,240
I didn't know the answer either.

1850
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:10,050
(She gets dragged out while being
comforted by the empty heads.)

1851
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,840
We have a lot of people
who have been injured.

1852
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,440
Go up there and hit your head twice.

1853
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,690
- I didn't get to speak.
- Heory up and do that.

1854
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,280
That's right. Good.

1855
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,510
This next dish is dumplings.

1856
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:21,920
- Dumplings, dumplings
- Dumplings, dumplings

1857
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:25,150
Lee Young Ji's favorite food
is dumplings.

1858
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:26,470
- Right. Dumplings.
- Me?

1859
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:27,470
- Why?
- Me?

1860
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:28,570
That's what it said.

1861
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:32,590
Many people like dumplings, and
in Korean, they're called "mandu".

1862
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,710
There is a city
with "mandu" in its name.

1863
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,030
Please say the name of the city
and the country it's in.

1864
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:39,280
- Don't say the answer.
- What?

1865
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,880
The city and the country it's in.

1866
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:42,070
Is it abroad?

1867
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,670
Yes. The city that has "mandu"
in its name...

1868
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:46,280
- There is such a place.
- and the country it's in.

1869
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,690
- Where is it?
- A city with "mandu" in it?

1870
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:48,690
Is it an English-speaking country?

1871
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:51,920
(Do you know it?)

1872
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,780
Kathmandu.

1873
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,650
You'll know it once you hear it.

1874
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:58,190
- Right. You've heard of it.
- Really?

1875
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,030
- Okay. Yes.
- It has "mandu" in it?

1876
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:01,530
- Answer. It's...
- I keep thinking Deli Mandu.

1877
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:03,860
- Why does that keep coming to mind?
- Answer. Chengdo Mando in China?

1878
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:04,900
(Qingdao dumplings, China?, Wrong!)

1879
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:07,030
- Qingdao dumplings, China.
- He doesn't disappoint.

1880
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:08,510
Qingdao dumplings, China.

1881
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:09,630
(Does he think
it's like a regional specialty?)

1882
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:13,510
- Qingdao dumplings, China.
- He doesn't disappoint.

1883
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,940
He is quite the empty head.

1884
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,920
I admire his courage.

1885
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,470
Dumplings are famous in China.

1886
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,720
The name of the city
contains "Mandu", dumplings.

1887
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,090
Is it a city in India?

1888
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:25,190
- I will give you a hint.
- Okay.

1889
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,590
It has four syllables.

1890
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:28,220
- This quiz is really hard.
- Four syllables?

1891
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:29,280
Are you sure
it isn't "Qingda dumplings"?

1892
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,360
Qingdao is famous for dumplings.

1893
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:32,650
I am not talking about
a regional specialty.

1894
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:34,320
It can't be kimchi dumpling.

1895
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,260
- It can't be Myungin Dumplings.
- You forget when you don't use it.

1896
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,840
- It isn't Myungin Dumplings.
- It isn't Myungin Dumplings.

1897
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:40,610
- Indian dumplings.
- No.

1898
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:41,940
(They go over each country.)

1899
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,110
China. Japan.

1900
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,740
The first letter is K.

1901
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,010
Katanmandu.

1902
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,800
- Katanmandu.
- Let me answer. Katumandu.

1903
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:50,420
- It's similar.
- Let me answer. Katukmandu.

1904
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,650
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer. Katukmandu.

1905
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:53,940
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer. Katyukmandu.

1906
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,090
Incorrect.

1907
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:56,920
- Katermandu.
- Let me answer. Katekmandu.

1908
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,420
- Incorrect.
- Katalmandu.

1909
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,130
- Let me answer. Katakmandu.
- Incorrect.

1910
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:02,550
- I have never heard of it.
- It starts with K, right?

1911
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:04,260
- Katilmandu.
- You know what it is.

1912
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,320
Katumandu.

1913
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,570
Let me answer. Katermandu.

1914
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:08,190
The name of the city is Kathmandu.

1915
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,670
- Yes.
- In which country is it?

1916
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,440
You have heard of Kathmandu.

1917
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,630
- The answer has two syllables.
- Kathmandu.

1918
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:13,760
Thailand.

1919
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,300
- An Asian country hikers go to.
- An Asian country hikers go to?

1920
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:18,840
Qingdao.

1921
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,740
Qingdao. Just say it's correct.

1922
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,740
- The country has many mountains.
- That's right.

1923
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:28,010
- Which country is it?
- This hint will end the round.

1924
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,150
Here are the first letters
of the syllables.

1925
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,050
Here are the first letters
of the syllables.

1926
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,490
- He practically gave the answer.
- Let me answer.

1927
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:34,490
- Let me answer.
- Nepal.

1928
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:36,490
Okay. Nepal.

1929
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:37,630
Nepal.

1930
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:38,720
Good job.

1931
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:42,970
In Korea, Jeonju is famous
for bibimbap.

1932
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:44,170
- Jeonju.
- Jeonju.

1933
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:46,840
Listen to the intro of the song...

1934
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,740
and guess the song title
and the singer.

1935
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,510
Let me answer.
"I Believe" by Shin Seung Hun.

1936
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,710
- Okay.
- That's right.

1937
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:54,610
Gwanggaeto the Great, King Jangsu.

1938
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:55,800
There you go.

1939
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,010
(Ji Hyo gets
another question right.)

1940
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:58,380
Let me answer. Over the top.

1941
01:01:58,380 --> 01:01:59,550
There you go.

1942
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,150
- Gosh.
- Nice.

1943
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,550
I feel hot.

1944
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:06,090
- I feel hot.
- Isn't "Over the Top" a movie?

1945
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:07,190
That was painful.

1946
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,460
Before we will give you
the dishes you acquired,

1947
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:11,920
the points will be distributed.

1948
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,530
- Team Lee Young Ji won.
- Okay.

1949
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,530
- Young Ji.
- Lee Young Ji.

1950
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,260
- Young Ji, you have many points.
- How many points do we get?

1951
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,630
- You get 25 points.
- We get 25 points.

1952
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:21,010
- Young Ji.
- Young Ji.

1953
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:23,470
Heo Young Ji, your team gets
minus four points.

1954
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,380
- Young Ji.
- I believe in you.

1955
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,610
I got all the questions right.

1956
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:27,940
Some people didn't get
any questions right.

1957
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:29,240
Please remember that.

1958
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,550
Was that the last game?

1959
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:31,880
- There will be one more game.
- I see.

1960
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,340
- Young Ji.
- Young Ji.

1961
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:34,650
- Young Ji.
- Come on.

1962
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:37,650
- Why do you even need to think?
- Young Ji.

1963
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,050
I doubt she will give me...

1964
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:40,590
more than one point.

1965
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:42,550
- Young Ji.
- I am hoping for two points.

1966
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:44,550
Jae Suk has enough points.

1967
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:45,800
Young Ji, remember that.

1968
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:49,470
(Will she be loyal to the team
in distributing the points?)

1969
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:51,900
If you gave one point per person,
I won't stand still.

1970
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,130
I didn't do that.

1971
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:54,610
- I did my best.
- Really?

1972
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,010
- Come and check in turns.
- Let's go.

1973
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:58,340
I didn't give one point per person.

1974
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,840
I bet I got more points
than the others this time.

1975
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:03,280
- Young Ji...
- Young Ji, hide.

1976
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,440
I can't believe her.

1977
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,320
For goodness' sake.

1978
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:09,690
- She is unbelievable.
- She ran away.

1979
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:11,590
How could she give me zero points?

1980
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:15,220
Not even Kwang Soo gave zero points.

1981
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,720
I was told not to give one point.

1982
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,260
- Still...
- I had to be certain.

1983
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:20,570
- Zero points?
- This is what I received...

1984
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:23,440
- for the 1st time today.
- I was told not to give 1 point.

1985
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:24,740
Thank you for your hard work.

1986
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:27,030
- You are amazing. Team play.
- Jae Suk.

1987
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:28,300
- Join this team.
- We are the team.

1988
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,610
- I can't believe her.
- She gives points.

1989
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,130
- This is just wrong, right?
- Next time,

1990
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:33,210
- I will choose Heo Young Ji.
- She is considerate.

1991
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,800
- I thought that was 6.
- You should at least give 1 point.

1992
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,510
Enjoy the food.

1993
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:39,320
- It's so tasty.
- It's so tasty.

1994
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:40,780
- It's good.
- It's so tasty.

1995
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,940
(They have lunch with food
for each team.)

1996
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:44,650
Captains, go ahead.

1997
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:45,720
(It's time to choose the team.)

1998
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:48,150
Do you know what my dad texted me?

1999
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:49,630
(Young Ji's dad texted her.)

2000
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:51,420
"When you have a quiz
during the shoot of Running Man,"

2001
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,470
"don't get scared and stay calm."

2002
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:55,630
"You know the answers
to those questions."

2003
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:56,900
"Good luck."

2004
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:58,690
But I couldn't answer
a single question today.

2005
01:03:58,690 --> 01:03:59,760
(She couldn't keep her promise
to her dad.)

2006
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,970
Dad, I am sorry.

2007
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:03,470
The last time...

2008
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:06,470
What my dad said has a problem.

2009
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,280
Staying calm didn't get me anywhere
the last time.

2010
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,510
(Staying calm didn't get me anywhere
the last time.)

2011
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:11,740
He doesn't know his daughter
very well.

2012
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,280
How many points do I have right now?

2013
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:16,510
You have 32 points.

2014
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:17,590
(Lee Young Ji has 32 points.)

2015
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:20,630
I have no conscience whatsoever.

2016
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,780
I have 32 points.
That's good. I am full.

2017
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,260
The team that wins the last game
will be exempt from the penalty.

2018
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:27,400
The captain will give one point
at the very least.

2019
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,590
- Lee Young Ji has many points now.
- I know.

2020
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,510
- So naturally...
- Lee Young Ji?

2021
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,760
She has no reason
to hoard more points.

2022
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,340
- Seriously.
- But you never know.

2023
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,300
It's not like you can use
those points.

2024
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,740
(Will Young Ji make such a decision
as Jong Kook claims?)

2025
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:43,070
I am full. I think
I can distribute the points now.

2026
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,240
Welcome.

2027
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:49,510
Welcome

2028
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,190
(So Min enters.)

2029
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:54,090
(Jae Suk enters as well.)

2030
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,720
Young Ji, I will trust you
once more.

2031
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,820
Young Ji.

2032
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,320
You and I share blood.

2033
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,920
We don't share blood,
but you know what I mean.

2034
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,720
What? He came again.

2035
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:04,630
What?

2036
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:07,170
- Haha came here.
- I stayed loyal to you.

2037
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:08,340
Welcome.

2038
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:09,530
There are too many people here.

2039
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:10,530
(5 members came to Captain Lee.)

2040
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:12,010
And...

2041
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:14,280
Ji Hyo came.

2042
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,570
- Ji Hyo.
- There are so many people.

2043
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:18,650
Did you come here to avoid changing?

2044
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,190
(That's right.)

2045
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:22,690
There isn't a place to sit.

2046
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,960
I won't cry
even if no one chooses me.

2047
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,920
(She mumbles to herself...)

2048
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,050
I will stay strong.

2049
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:32,630
(and fills the room with sound.)

2050
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:35,800
(The crew in the other room
asks for help.)

2051
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,590
That room needs more cameras.

2052
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:39,090
Isn't that right?

2053
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,130
(Taking off)

2054
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:45,570
Everyone is leaving.

2055
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:49,170
(The cameraman decided
to help the crew in the other room.)

2056
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:52,470
(He escapes the empty room
without looking back.)

2057
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:54,190
This is too much.

2058
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:57,920
(She fills the audio
with the sound of her crying.)

2059
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:01,780
(It's 1 minute before the end
of the team selection.)

2060
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:03,650
(Opening)

2061
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,720
For goodness' sake. Is no one here?

2062
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,440
Is no one here?

2063
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,670
(Jong Kook came.)

2064
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:15,400
How have you lived your life?

2065
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:17,530
How have you lived your life?

2066
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:20,070
- I have wasted my life.
- Sit down, Young Ji.

2067
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:21,150
I guessed correctly.

2068
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:22,900
- I said you will be loyal.
- Really?

2069
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,170
That's right.
I am all about loyalty.

2070
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:27,220
- What?
- Who is that?

2071
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:28,320
(At that moment,)

2072
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:31,190
(Se Chan appears.)

2073
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:33,050
- My goodness.
- Se Chan.

2074
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:34,920
Are these all the members?
I guess so.

2075
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,090
I didn't feel like changing.

2076
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:39,690
Don't say something so mean.

2077
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:41,260
- I know. You should be nicer.
- Seriously.

2078
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:42,490
I was joking.

2079
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,130
I was joking.

2080
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,300
Young Ji, here is the thing.

2081
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,670
You should treat us properly.

2082
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,800
We should win no matter what,

2083
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,530
and you should give us
as many points as possible...

2084
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:54,280
so that the 2nd place and 3rd place
can come from this team.

2085
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,380
Do you know what I mean?

2086
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,220
If we win this time,

2087
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,420
keep your word.

2088
01:06:58,420 --> 01:06:59,650
- Of course.
- Okay?

2089
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,190
- Trust me.
- Let's say we win.

2090
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:03,780
You have more points
than Heo Young Ji.

2091
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,260
- That's right. I have many points.
- She has zero points.

2092
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,490
- If we get all the points,
- That's right.

2093
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:08,130
- you can distribute all of them.
- That team will lose points.

2094
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:09,550
Even if you do that,
you will take first place.

2095
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:10,550
- I will take first place.
- That's right.

2096
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:13,050
- We will have all the points.
- That's right.

2097
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:14,530
Would you give me two points?

2098
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,260
I will give you all the points.
You don't need to worry.

2099
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:17,490
You joined that team.

2100
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,990
No one wanted to change.

2101
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:22,570
- It's too much work.
- I had the same thought.

2102
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:26,240
Too many people have zero points.

2103
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,380
- Zero points.
- Seriously.

2104
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,900
- It's a match for 1 point.
- Yes. It's a match for 1 point.

2105
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:31,720
Now comes the last mission.

2106
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,720
- I want to win.
- To have a fierce match...

2107
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,090
we chose a game...

2108
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:36,990
- you have played before.
- What is it?

2109
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:38,110
(The last mission will determine
who gets the penalty!)

2110
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:39,360
This mission...

2111
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,590
will let you learn about
each other's image.

2112
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:43,800
It's Good Image.

2113
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,820
I know what it is.

2114
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:46,720
- You sing, "Good image."
- We have a chance of winning.

2115
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:51,570
(When the offensive team says
the image and number,)

2116
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:55,440
(the defensive team members
who suit the image must answer.)

2117
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,940
(You fail to defend
if 2 or more members...)

2118
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:04,880
(or no one answers.)

2119
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:06,940
Hey.

2120
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,840
We are at a disadvantage
since there are more members.

2121
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:12,320
We just need to respond
in three beats, right?

2122
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,820
Let's start there.
When you get used to it,

2123
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:15,360
- we will reduce it to two beats.
- Okay.

2124
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,490
- We will attack first.
- Okay. Let's go.

2125
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,530
- Hold on.
- Good image.

2126
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:20,760
- Good image.
- Let's go.

2127
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,320
- Good...
- Let's begin.

2128
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,900
Good...

2129
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,440
- Good...
- Good...

2130
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,170
- Good...
- Tell him not to exhaust himself.

2131
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:29,810
- Good...
- Don't exhaust yourself!

2132
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:31,100
You are bored, right?

2133
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,230
(They live for the intro.)

2134
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:34,400
- Good...
- Good...

2135
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,640
- Good image
- Good image

2136
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,010
Blue T-shirt, four.

2137
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:55,590
Blue T-shirt, blue T-shirt,
blue T-shirt, blue T-shirt.

2138
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:57,290
A 40-year-old, 4.

2139
01:08:58,020 --> 01:08:59,520
A 40-year-old, a 40-year-old,
a 40-year-old, a 40-year-old.

2140
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,800
(A 40-year-old succeeded in
defending.)

2141
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,130
- A 40-year-old, a 40-year-old.
- Good job.

2142
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:03,500
He's not going to make it.

2143
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,560
(The muscular man in his 40s
became speechless.)

2144
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:10,230
(Generation MZ defeated
the man in his 40s.)

2145
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:11,260
- Good job.
- Young Ji!

2146
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,930
- For goodness' sake.
- Young Ji.

2147
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,140
- That was great.
- What was that?

2148
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:16,170
(Team Lee Young Ji won 1 point!)

2149
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:18,580
You have a nice tone
since you are a rapper.

2150
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:19,770
Good job.

2151
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:22,180
This time,
Team Blue will attack first.

2152
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:27,880
- Good...
- Good...

2153
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,550
It gets tiring
when you team up with Haha.

2154
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:35,720
(The intro artists focus more
on the intro than the actual game.)

2155
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,540
(DJ Haha's intro is chaotic.)

2156
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,630
Boom!

2157
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:43,100
- Good image
- Good image

2158
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:44,910
My boyfriend, two.

2159
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:46,770
(My boyfriend, two.)

2160
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:48,750
(He stalls as much as he can.)

2161
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:49,840
Boyfriend, boyfriend.

2162
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:53,550
(Boyfriend, boyfriend.)

2163
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:56,090
Pink panties, three.

2164
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:58,140
(Pink panties, three.)

2165
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,620
Pink panties, pink panties,
pink panties.

2166
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,050
My boyfriend, three.

2167
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:02,850
(My boyfriend, three.)

2168
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:04,380
(It's too cringeworthy for him.)

2169
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:06,000
Boyfriend, boyfriend, boyfriend.

2170
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:07,850
- That's good.
- That's good.

2171
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:10,200
Hairy ears, three.

2172
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,730
That sounded strange.

2173
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,130
You missed the beat.

2174
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:16,670
- I did well, right?
- "My boyfriend" was a good one.

2175
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:18,170
- My boyfriend.
- "My boyfriend" was a good one.

2176
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:20,340
I got so annoyed.

2177
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:23,640
Both of them were annoyed
by the attack.

2178
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,920
- "Boyfriend, boyfriend..."
- Seriously.

2179
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:27,770
- I fell for it.
- "My boyfriend" was a good one.

2180
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:30,090
It's fascinating
that each one has a girl.

2181
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,480
It's fascinating
that both of them know it.

2182
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,590
They paired up nicely.

2183
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:35,350
- They paired up nicely.
- For goodness' sake.

2184
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:37,460
We can do this
now that Kwang Soo quit.

2185
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,850
- Seriously.
- The number is perfect.

2186
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:41,020
- All right.
- Let's go.

2187
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:45,760
- Good...
- Good...

2188
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,870
(Generation MZ does
the shoulder dance.)

2189
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:49,630
(Here comes
the circus troupe of intro.)

2190
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,380
- Good...
- Good...

2191
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:53,630
(The intro enthusiast
is back again.)

2192
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:55,050
Good...

2193
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,410
- Good...
- Start the game already!

2194
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:58,920
(He uses 50 percent of his energy
before the game begins.)

2195
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,450
Good image

2196
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:02,420
- There you go.
- Heory up.

2197
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:03,510
(That's my type.)

2198
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:07,620
- Good image
- Good image

2199
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,180
Long hair, two.

2200
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,330
- Long hair, long hair.
- There you go.

2201
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:13,330
Short temper, three.

2202
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:14,460
(Short temper, three.)

2203
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,520
Short temper, short temper,
short temper.

2204
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,560
(Short temper, short temper,
short temper.)

2205
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,040
(The description went
to the rightful owner.)

2206
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,630
Married man, two.

2207
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:27,010
- Married man, married man.
- Okay.

2208
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,580
(The attack on the married men
was successful!)

2209
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:30,840
Two people responded.

2210
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,080
- Okay.
- I signaled that I will respond.

2211
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,310
I did this.

2212
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,250
For goodness' sake.

2213
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:39,420
Why did you butt in?

2214
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,510
Why did you butt in?
I signaled that I will respond.

2215
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:43,480
I thought you were telling me
to do it.

2216
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,330
This is driving me crazy.

2217
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:46,590
For goodness' sake.

2218
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:49,300
Only someone who is happily married
should respond.

2219
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:51,390
- I am happily married.
- Someone who is happily married.

2220
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,560
I will respond.

2221
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,590
- I will respond.
- Okay.

2222
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:55,210
Se Chan, it's your turn to attack.

2223
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:56,260
I will go slowly.

2224
01:11:56,260 --> 01:12:01,800
- Good image
- Good

2225
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:05,170
- Good image
- Good image

2226
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:07,880
- How good?
- Very good

2227
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,180
Who is good?

2228
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:14,510
- Good image
- Good

2229
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:16,220
Even if it's good,
it's just the image

2230
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:17,790
Good

2231
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:19,700
What's good, money or image?

2232
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:21,000
- Good
- Good

2233
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,920
I will begin now

2234
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,730
- Good
- Good

2235
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:28,800
- Good image
- Good image

2236
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:30,560
Bald, three.

2237
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,230
(Bald, three!)

2238
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:35,510
Bald, bald, bald.

2239
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:38,100
(Bald, bald, bald.)

2240
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:39,220
Middle age, four.

2241
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:42,220
Middle age, middle age,
middle age, middle age.

2242
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:43,840
Mom, three.

2243
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,010
(Mom, three.)

2244
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:48,960
Mom, mom, mom.

2245
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,420
(She is a member of Generation MZ
who goes along with anything.)

2246
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:52,550
All right.

2247
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,020
So Min, four.

2248
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:55,920
What was "All right"?

2249
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,500
- What did she do wrong?
- It was just a rejoinder.

2250
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,730
- It was just a rejoinder.
- It isn't allowed.

2251
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:03,230
- It isn't allowed in Good Image.
- Seriously.

2252
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:05,510
- It was like a booster.
- It's confusing with a mistake.

2253
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:07,510
- That's right.
- It isn't allowed.

2254
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:09,050
- Good job.
- Come on.

2255
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:10,550
Good job.

2256
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:12,810
- We did well.
- We were close to winning.

2257
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:14,250
I can't think of any descriptions.

2258
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:16,120
- Let's resume.
- Suk Jin.

2259
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,720
Suk Jin, you avoid
all the descriptions.

2260
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,660
He didn't respond to "Bald".

2261
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:21,960
You act like
you didn't hear anything.

2262
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:23,630
You avoided it so many times.

2263
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:25,700
- Respond.
- He is Jamwon-dong's loach.

2264
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,760
- He slips out.
- Jamwon-dong's loach.

2265
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,830
- He doesn't respond.
- Let's take this to the end.

2266
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:31,930
- Take "Bald".
- I will do that.

2267
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:34,470
"Bald" and "Hair fiber"
should go to Suk Jin.

2268
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:37,170
It's not like he is
a world-renowned celebrity.

2269
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:39,800
Why does he care so much
about his image?

2270
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,800
Those are nice descriptions.
The name is Good Image, after all.

2271
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,600
Anyone can see
that he is 56 years old.

2272
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,640
Voluminous.

2273
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,950
- Voluminous.
- For goodness' sake.

2274
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:50,620
Very voluminous.

2275
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:51,750
- That's so funny.
- Voluminous.

2276
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,010
Jong Kook, it's your turn to start.

2277
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:54,790
Can you give us a ballad version?

2278
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,350
Can you give us a ballad version?

2279
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:57,480
- Good
- Good

2280
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,090
- Good image
- Good image

2281
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,130
Good image

2282
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:03,720
That's nice.

2283
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,430
- Good image
- That's a ballad song.

2284
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:06,930
- Good image
- It's melodious.

2285
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:08,300
- I like it
- Good image

2286
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,870
- Good image
- Good image

2287
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,930
- Oh, image
- Good image

2288
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:14,040
(He adds the cheap chorus.)

2289
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,640
I like it

2290
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:17,340
I like it

2291
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:18,950
What?

2292
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,620
I like it

2293
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:23,750
(The slow-witted and flippant man
gets smacked.)

2294
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,950
Who did that?

2295
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:26,790
- Who did that?
- Who hit me while I was absorbed?

2296
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:28,460
- Who did that?
- I was adding ad-libs.

2297
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:29,850
- Who did that during the game?
- Who did that?

2298
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:31,160
We can't find the culprit.

2299
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,420
I will let you off
since I am in a good mood.

2300
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:35,200
Suk Jin is much older than us.
Who did that?

2301
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:37,890
- I was doing so well.
- I won't stand still.

2302
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,260
- We are sorry.
- Don't mess up.

2303
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:40,590
- Don't do it again.
- Don't mess up.

2304
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:41,630
We are sorry.

2305
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:42,760
- Don't do it again.
- Seriously.

2306
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,560
- I was absorbed in the feelings.
- Okay.

2307
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,170
- Good...
- Good...

2308
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:50,510
- Good image
- Good image

2309
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:52,120
Han Min Kwan, three.

2310
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,050
(Clenching her teeth)

2311
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:56,380
Han Min Kwan, Han Min Kwan,
Han Min Kwan.

2312
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:57,790
Mama's boy, two.

2313
01:14:57,790 --> 01:14:58,980
(Mama's boy, two.)

2314
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:03,880
Mama's boy, mama's boy.

2315
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:05,660
(He barely defends...)

2316
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:06,760
Age spot, three.

2317
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,330
(and strikes back with "Age spot".)

2318
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:11,470
Age spot, age spot, age spot.

2319
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:12,890
Shortie, two.

2320
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:14,390
Shortie, shortie.

2321
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:15,760
Bald, three.

2322
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,300
(Bald, three.)

2323
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,840
Bald, bald, bald.

2324
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:20,300
So Min, four.

2325
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,300
(She attacks with "So Min".)

2326
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,770
So Min, So Min, So Min, So Min.

2327
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:24,140
A 40-year-old, 2.

2328
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:26,950
A 40-year-old, a 40-year-old,
a 40-year-old, a 40-year-old.

2329
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:27,970
A 40-year-old, 2.

2330
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:29,590
- Really?
- What was that?

2331
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:31,310
- It was 2.
- A 40-year-old, 2.

2332
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:33,010
- You are in your 40s too.
- You couldn't hear him well.

2333
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:34,050
You are in your 40s.

2334
01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:35,830
Se Chan, your pronunciation is
so bad.

2335
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:37,630
- A 40-year-old, 2.
- I could hear him clearly.

2336
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:39,500
- Seriously.
- I can't attack them.

2337
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,420
- It's hard to come up with one.
- Just do it.

2338
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:42,800
Just say, "Eunuch, three."

2339
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:47,170
- It's a word from a dictionary.
- "Eunuch, three"?

2340
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:49,600
- Just do it. It's okay.
- I will respond.

2341
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:52,010
- Okay.
- Eunuch, eunuch, eunuch.

2342
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:53,430
(Big Nose instructs them
to attack ruthlessly.)

2343
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:55,040
- Go ahead.
- Good...

2344
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,210
- Good...
- Good...

2345
01:15:57,210 --> 01:16:00,340
- Good...
- Good image

2346
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,970
Hair fiber, four.

2347
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:03,590
Hair fiber, hair fiber,
hair fiber, hair fiber.

2348
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:06,420
My dear, two.

2349
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,160
(My dear, two.)

2350
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,350
My dear, my dear.

2351
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,720
- What?
- Nose hair, two.

2352
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,500
(Young Ji took the attack.)

2353
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,500
Nose hair, nose hair.

2354
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:14,890
Nose hair, three.

2355
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:16,300
(The nose hair rally begins.)

2356
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,590
Nose hair, nose hair, nose hair.

2357
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,040
Age spot, three.

2358
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,500
(Age spot, three.)

2359
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,890
- Age spot, age spot...
- Age spot, age spot...

2360
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:25,510
Why did you butt in?

2361
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:27,770
The attacks were directed at me.

2362
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:30,210
- You didn't respond before.
- Seriously.

2363
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:32,250
- The attacks were directed at me.
- Suk Jin messed up.

2364
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:34,140
You didn't respond before.

2365
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,170
(Suk Jin responds erratically.)

2366
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:37,590
- Age spot.
- Why did you butt in?

2367
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:39,850
I was taking all the attacks.

2368
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:41,680
You didn't respond
to "Age spot" before.

2369
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,980
That's why Jae Suk did it.

2370
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:46,020
Why did you respond?

2371
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:47,630
(The worst chemistry
leaves both of them flustered.)

2372
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:48,830
All right.

2373
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:51,220
Now, you must respond in two beats.

2374
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:52,260
- You got used to the game.
- Okay.

2375
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:53,260
- Okay.
- Two beats?

2376
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:54,390
His face turned red.

2377
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:56,910
This team has many members,

2378
01:16:56,910 --> 01:16:57,930
so we are at a disadvantage.

2379
01:16:57,930 --> 01:17:01,210
We should have started
with three points.

2380
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:02,910
Who are you talking to?

2381
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:04,600
Seriously.

2382
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:05,750
All right.

2383
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,640
Don't follow that figure.

2384
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,720
Grim Reaper, three.

2385
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:10,640
Grim Reaper, Grim Reaper,
Grim Reaper.

2386
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,720
(He responds
to "Grim Reaper, three.")

2387
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,920
He responded to that one.

2388
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:15,350
He responded to that one.

2389
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:17,630
Are you going to respond or not?

2390
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:18,890
- Let's go.
- I don't know.

2391
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:20,760
- This is scary.
- Don't do that again.

2392
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,260
- Okay.
- Let's go, Jae Suk.

2393
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:23,830
- Let's go.
- Go slowly.

2394
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:24,970
- Let's go.
- Slowly.

2395
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:28,170
- Good image
- Good image

2396
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:29,840
Catfish, three.

2397
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,430
Catfish, catfish, catfish.

2398
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,040
Actor, three.

2399
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,380
(Actor, three.)

2400
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,010
Actor, actor, actor.

2401
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:37,640
Short sleeves, two.

2402
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:39,310
Short sleeves, short sleeves.

2403
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:40,770
Nose hair, two.

2404
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,880
- Nose hair...
- Okay.

2405
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:45,760
Okay. We are doing well.
Let's do this.

2406
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,220
What was that?

2407
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:49,090
"Nose hair" was directed at Haha.

2408
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:50,550
- I was going to respond.
- He has a mustache.

2409
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:53,200
Dirty things like "Nose hair"
and "Mustache" belong to him.

2410
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,200
Then anything about Grim Reaper
is yours, right?

2411
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,390
- That's mine.
- Anything small is Jae Suk's.

2412
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,730
- Anything small is Jae Suk's.
- That's right.

2413
01:17:59,730 --> 01:18:01,230
- Anything about hair is Haha's.
- That's mine.

2414
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:02,560
Anything about love.

2415
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,300
- That's right.
- Love.

2416
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,370
How about Young Ji?

2417
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:06,630
- I...
- Just...

2418
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:08,100
- I will take the remaining ones.
- You can take anything.

2419
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,410
- I will take the remaining ones.
- Go ahead.

2420
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:11,640
If you don't like
"Bald" or "Age spot", signal me.

2421
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:12,720
Okay.

2422
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,970
Let's begin.

2423
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:16,840
- Good...
- Let's do this.

2424
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:18,640
- Go slowly.
- Good

2425
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,660
- Good
- Good

2426
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:25,220
- Good image
- Good image

2427
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,300
Someone who wants to kiss me, two.

2428
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,760
(Someone who wants to kiss me, two!)

2429
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,300
(He gives up.)

2430
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:31,520
Someone who wants to kiss her,
someone who wants to kiss her.

2431
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:33,870
Someone who wants to kiss her,
someone who wants to kiss her.

2432
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:35,630
(Giggling)

2433
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:37,510
Boring person, four.

2434
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,800
Boring person, boring person,
boring person.

2435
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:42,880
- Hey.
- What is your problem?

2436
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:45,250
- Even his mistake was boring.
- Hey.

2437
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:46,640
Can't you get the rhythm right?

2438
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:48,550
- Hey.
- Hey, Mr. Mustache.

2439
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:50,090
Mr. Mustache is boring.

2440
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:52,180
- For goodness' sake.
- That was boring.

2441
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:54,720
- Boring person.
- Even his mistake was boring.

2442
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,380
- Even his mistake was boring.
- Okay.

2443
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:57,720
Mr. Boring.

2444
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,460
He is boring.

2445
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:01,130
For four, you start here.

2446
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:03,330
For 3, you start here.
For 2, you start here.

2447
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:05,630
It's 8 to 5 now. Once you get
10 points, the game is over.

2448
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:07,200
- Ten points?
- What's their score?

2449
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,300
It's 8 to 5.

2450
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:09,300
Haha, go ahead.

2451
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:10,840
Say something intense.

2452
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:13,010
Bring it on.

2453
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:15,410
Good image

2454
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:17,600
Good image

2455
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:20,010
Someone who kissed
last night, three.

2456
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:21,810
(Someone who kissed
last night, three.)

2457
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:24,310
- Last kiss, last kiss, last kiss.
- Good.

2458
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:25,310
Foot odor, two.

2459
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:27,980
(Hesitating)

2460
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:29,220
Foot odor, foot odor.

2461
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:31,260
Someone who wants to go home
like crazy, four.

2462
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:32,500
What did you say?

2463
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,630
Someone who wants to go home,
someone who wants to go home,

2464
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:34,800
someone who wants to go home,
someone who wants to go home.

2465
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,800
(He managed to defend
the long attack.)

2466
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:38,200
Constipation, three.

2467
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:40,230
Constipation, constipation.

2468
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:41,630
That's not it.

2469
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:43,910
(He got it long in a loud voice.)

2470
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:45,910
It's three.

2471
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:47,130
- Yes!
- Three.

2472
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:48,540
He said constipation, three.

2473
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:51,770
He's the one
who suffers from constipation.

2474
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:54,880
Why did you do that
when you don't have constipation?

2475
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,790
- Why?
- Why is it so hard?

2476
01:19:58,010 --> 01:19:59,660
- Three is... Listen.
- Okay.

2477
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:01,790
Four starts here. Three starts here.

2478
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:04,050
Two starts here. And this is one.

2479
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:06,630
I just thought he said two.

2480
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:08,050
- Constipation...
- I thought it was two.

2481
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:09,630
What's with your ears?

2482
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:12,670
Constipation, constipation,
constipation. How simple is that?

2483
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,560
Constipation, constipation,
constipation. And...

2484
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:17,410
If I say "Eunuch, two",
they can't say it.

2485
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:19,710
- Why are you...
- We should do that.

2486
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:21,080
How would they say
they are a eunuch?

2487
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:22,510
- Hair loss...
- He is...

2488
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:23,800
You didn't say hair loss.

2489
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,640
Why do you keep telling me
to say eunuch?

2490
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:28,620
- Hey, the word is...
- I can say that.

2491
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,550
in the dictionary.

2492
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:32,680
- Why do I have to say that?
- My gosh.

2493
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:35,090
Why are you telling me to say that?

2494
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:38,260
Gosh, this is really upsetting.

2495
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:39,700
I just thought it was two.

2496
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,160
Two and three... Four starts here.

2497
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,890
Three starts here. Two starts here.
And this is one.

2498
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:47,060
- Please calm down.
- I know that.

2499
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:48,130
You do?

2500
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:49,260
Constipation, constipation,
constipation, constipation.

2501
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:50,260
This is four.

2502
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:51,510
Constipation, constipation,
constipation.

2503
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:52,710
- This is three.
- I know.

2504
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:54,770
- I know that.
- Two. Constipation, constipation.

2505
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:56,970
- His vein is about to explode.
- One is...

2506
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:58,510
Constipation!

2507
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:00,950
Eunuch, four.

2508
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,510
Why do you keep saying eunuch?

2509
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:04,120
Why do you say eunuch?

2510
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,660
Why are you so obsessed with eunuch?

2511
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:07,380
- I'm so angry.
- He wants to win.

2512
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:08,460
Why is he...

2513
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:09,630
Are you sure he's not
possessed by a spirit?

2514
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:11,790
Why does he keep saying that?

2515
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:13,850
He wants to win.

2516
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:16,700
He once said eunuch
instead of Nose King before.

2517
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:18,700
(The butterfly effect
of Nose King in episode 549)

2518
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:20,340
- I'm so upset.
- Do we have two points left?

2519
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:22,170
It's 9 to 5. You have
only 1 point left.

2520
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:23,630
We can do this.

2521
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:24,630
- Let's focus.
- We can't lose.

2522
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:25,630
Jae Suk goes first.

2523
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:26,630
I won't make a mistake.

2524
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:27,970
I should say something
that they can't take.

2525
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:30,510
- He's making a winning move.
- It's thrilling until the end.

2526
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:32,720
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2527
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:37,480
Good image

2528
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:41,160
- Good image, good image
- Good image, good image

2529
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:42,980
So Min's love, four.

2530
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:44,290
(So Min's love, four.)

2531
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:46,330
So Min's love, So Min's love,
So Min's love, So Min's love.

2532
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:47,850
Eunuch, four.

2533
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:49,200
(Eunuch, four.)

2534
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,260
Eunuch, eunuch, eunuch, eunuch.

2535
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,500
Bad breath, two.

2536
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,870
Bad breath, bad breath.

2537
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:58,670
Prostate, three.

2538
01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:00,580
Prostate, prostate, prostate.

2539
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:02,080
Ganoderma lucidum, three.

2540
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,600
(This round continues
for a long time without a mistake.)

2541
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,300
Ganoderma lucidum, Ganoderma
lucidum, Ganoderma lucidum.

2542
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:06,510
Man, four.

2543
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:07,510
(Man, four!)

2544
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:12,250
- Why did you not say it?
- Why are you quiet?

2545
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:14,160
(They failed
because no one took the word.)

2546
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:17,260
Why is it so hard to say
that you're a man?

2547
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:19,390
Why is it so hard? Man, man,

2548
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:20,890
- man, man.
- Man, man,

2549
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:23,300
- man, man.
- Even if I lose, I would say that.

2550
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,090
- Man, man, man, man.
- Man, man, man, man.

2551
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:26,630
We'd do that even if we lose.

2552
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:27,970
- Why did you not take it?
- Why were you quiet?

2553
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:30,170
- You are a man.
- It's okay to lose.

2554
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:31,370
You said eunuch right away.

2555
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:33,600
- For eunuch, you said...
- Eunuch, eunuch, eunuch, eunuch.

2556
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,510
But why were you quiet
when she said man?

2557
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:37,910
Why did you not take it?

2558
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:39,510
- Man, man, man, man.
- Man, man, man, man.

2559
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:41,810
- Why can't you say that?
- You have to say it.

2560
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:43,340
- Man, man, man, man.
- Man, man, man, man.

2561
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:45,510
I was afraid to lose.
I should've said that.

2562
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:47,220
- I thought we'd lose.
- Eunuch, three.

2563
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:48,920
- Eunuch, eunuch, eunuch, eunuch.
- Eunuch, eunuch, eunuch, eunuch.

2564
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,980
- You guys are cowards.
- My gosh.

2565
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:52,850
- That was fun.
- So...

2566
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:54,660
Team Heo Young Ji wins this round.

2567
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,170
- We did it.
- Three members are better.

2568
01:22:57,170 --> 01:22:59,200
Captain Heo Young Ji gets 15 points.

2569
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,800
- We need just a little.
- Distribute the points here.

2570
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,230
- Just give us a little.
- Now...

2571
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:04,300
How many points do they have?

2572
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:05,800
I can't tell you that.

2573
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,770
- Young Ji.
- Now we have...

2574
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:10,010
- the final results.
- Okay.

2575
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:14,720
The three members to win
Korean beef and ganoderma lucidum.

2576
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,340
- Jae Suk.
- Ganoderma lucidum.

2577
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:17,510
The first place...

2578
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:20,790
got 26 points. It's Lee Young Ji.

2579
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:21,880
(1st place,
Lee Young Ji with 26 points)

2580
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,850
- She got a lot of points.
- Right.

2581
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:25,480
That's a lot of points.

2582
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:26,630
The second place is...

2583
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:29,050
Heo Young Ji with 15 points.

2584
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:30,590
(2nd place,
Heo Young Ji with 15 points)

2585
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:33,560
Now you know how stingy you were.

2586
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:35,090
(Young Ji's heydays)

2587
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:37,510
The third place... The last one
to win the prize is...

2588
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:39,380
Kim Jong Kook with four points.

2589
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:40,410
My gosh.

2590
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:42,130
- Four points.
- He's got only four points?

2591
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:43,750
- And he's the third place.
- Thank you.

2592
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:45,600
I didn't expect to win today.

2593
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,680
And the members
who got zero points are...

2594
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:51,550
There must be a lot.

2595
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:54,380
JiSuk Jin, Haha,
Song Ji Hyo, and Jeon So Min.

2596
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:55,680
- The four of them.
- Okay.

2597
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,180
I got one point.

2598
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:59,350
- Two members will get a penalty.
- Safe.

2599
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:02,500
- Two members will get a penalty.
- It's a 50 percent chance.

2600
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,060
It says either an O or an X.

2601
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:05,890
- An O or an X?
- Open it.

2602
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:07,590
- Open it?
- You can't avoid it.

2603
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:09,340
- Okay. I'll open it first.
- Okay.

2604
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:10,510
- Okay. Do you like an O?
- Yes.

2605
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:12,410
- You startled me.
- I don't like an X.

2606
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:14,010
(He will get a penalty
if it has an X on it.)

2607
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:15,100
There's nothing.

2608
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:17,100
- Yes.
- Gosh, he is...

2609
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:19,250
I thought he'd pick an X.

2610
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:21,880
Yes!

2611
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:24,920
(So Min and Ji Hyo
will get a penalty.)

2612
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:27,260
- Married...
- men.

2613
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:28,380
- Cross.
- Cross.

2614
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:30,050
Eunuch, eunuch, eunuch, eunuch.

2615
01:24:30,050 --> 01:24:32,380
Eunuch, eunuch, eunuch, go home.

2616
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:33,920
- And sleep.
- And sleep.

2617
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:38,700
We will move to another place for
the penalty and acceptance speech.

2618
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:40,670
- Let's go.
- Yes.

2619
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:44,230
The two losers will
have a hot foot bath...

2620
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:48,410
wearing padded jackets while
having hot tea in the open garden.

2621
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:51,640
- Young Ji and Young Ji.
- It's even a black jacket.

2622
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:52,640
My goodness.

2623
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:55,380
(It's a black jacket that absorbs
all the heat from the sun.)

2624
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:58,380
I'm wearing socks.
I'm doing this wearing socks.

2625
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:00,720
(So Min is having
a foot bath already.)

2626
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,920
- Are you wearing socks?
- Yes.

2627
01:25:03,330 --> 01:25:04,380
Is it lukewarm?

2628
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,200
It's hot.

2629
01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:07,700
You should drink tea.

2630
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:08,890
(They're forced to enjoy a hot spa
in the hot open garden.)

2631
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:11,760
What do we do?
They look pretty though.

2632
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,130
- They look pretty.
- This feels good.

2633
01:25:13,130 --> 01:25:14,890
They look amazing.
It's like a photo shoot.

2634
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:16,170
- By the way...
- Let me take a picture of you.

2635
01:25:16,170 --> 01:25:20,380
It looks like you two are
on a vacation.

2636
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:21,630
They look amazing.

2637
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:22,640
They are pretty.

2638
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:26,080
It looks like they are doing this
for beauty and health.

2639
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,250
So Min is doing all the good things
including foot volleyball today.

2640
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:30,420
- So Min did all sorts of things.
- She did everything.

2641
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:32,660
After Kwang Soo left,

2642
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,220
- we all get a penalty in turn.
- I know.

2643
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:38,180
- You're right. Ji Hyo is...
- She got the energy.

2644
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:40,000
She got Kwang Soo's energy.

2645
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,050
Oh, no.

2646
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:42,800
(Kwang Soo's bad luck
has moved to lucky Ji Hyo.)

2647
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:45,500
As I announced
the results of the race,

2648
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:49,170
the three winners will get
Korean beef and ganoderma lucidum.

2649
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:50,630
That's amazing.

2650
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:52,800
- Young Ji.
- It looks really good.

2651
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,210
We just bought them
at a department store.

2652
01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:55,210
You just bought them?

2653
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:56,800
- This looks great.
- My gosh.

2654
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:57,880
This is great.

2655
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,140
- Your parents will love this.
- I know.

2656
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:01,420
They must be happy.

2657
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:03,220
(Let's just have some green tea.)

2658
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:05,340
When you take this with you,

2659
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:06,510
you should leave
without looking back.

2660
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:07,550
Okay.

2661
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:09,260
Suk Jin will make a sign
with his eyes.

2662
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:10,980
Then I'll have to give this to him.

2663
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:13,500
- So you have to rush home.
- He's being silent now.

2664
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:16,060
- What?
- I know this is for you.

2665
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:18,000
My feet are hot.

2666
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:20,340
The sun is really hot.

2667
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:23,100
I'd like to thank you
for letting me...

2668
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,730
build good memories
with Young Ji today.

2669
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:27,880
I hope I will come here
with Kim Young Ji next time.

2670
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,710
- Is there another Young Ji?
- Another Young Ji?

2671
01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:31,210
There's another Young Ji.

2672
01:26:31,210 --> 01:26:33,720
I did a TV show
with Yeong Ja before.

2673
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:36,790
Young Ji, Young Ji,
Yeong Ja, and Young Ji.

2674
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:39,480
Thank you for having me here
and getting me a great gift.

2675
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,260
Please give them a big hand.

2676
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:44,130
- Thank you for today.
- Thank you.

2677
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:45,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2678
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,800
- Thank you.
- Good job today.

2679
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:48,850
- Good job.
- Good job today.

2680
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:50,370
- I had a great time today.
- Thank you.

2681
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:53,910
Hello. Welcome.

2682
01:26:53,910 --> 01:26:57,370
(Kim So Hee's VIP doll exhibition)

2683
01:26:57,670 --> 01:26:59,710
(The place is full
of expensive masterpieces.)

2684
01:26:59,710 --> 01:27:01,580
(The members have fun
playing with the toys.)

2685
01:27:02,410 --> 01:27:03,840
(The artist shows up
right at the moment.)

2686
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,950
- Hello.
- She's the artist.

2687
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:08,320
(This doll is...)

2688
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:12,250
(What is it doing here?)

2689
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:13,750
(The star artist...)

2690
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:15,030
(passes out in front of them
all of a sudden.)

2691
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:17,160
(She left her will.)

2692

(The members are here
to look for Kim So Hee's traces.)

2694

2697
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,280
I've been waiting.

2698
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:38,580
(Some bizarre things
happen to them.)

2699
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:42,460
(The most expensive doll
is controlling them from somewhere?)

2700

the mystery of the hidden doll?)
