00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,970
(Artist Kim So Hee shines
with her unrivaled artistry.)

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,440
(Her dolls have been shrouded
in mystery for a very long time.)

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,010
(Artist Kim's masterpieces
are finally opened to the public.)

13
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,310
(Welcome to
Artist Kim's VIP Doll Exhibition.)

14
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,590
Because I'm a fool

15
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,480
(The first guest arrives while humming.)

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,620
(Kim So Hee VIP Doll Exhibition)

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,950
Hello.

18
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,950
Hello. Welcome.

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,950
- Who are you?
- Welcome to Artist Kim So Hee's...

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,800
(Hello. Welcome.)

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,300
Welcome to
Artist Kim So Hee's VIP Doll Exhibition.

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,060
- VIP Doll Exhibition?
- That's right.

23
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,560
First, please sanitize your hands
before entering.

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,810
- Oh, is that so?
- After you enter,

25
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,730
you can freely check out the artwork.

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,110
I love exhibitions.

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,640
A doll exhibition?

28
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,640
(Dolls are displayed in each section.)

29
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,250
Artist Kim So Hee?

30
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,420
"VIP Doll Exhibition."

31
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,720
"The VIPs who have come
to the exhibition..."

32
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,300
"will be given Artist Kim's
limited edition doll as a gift."

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,030
So I can take one of them?

34
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,470
I love free stuff.

35
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,270
Oh, one of these? There's 2, 4...

36
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,670
I can take one of them?

37
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,270
(Including the most expensive doll,
7 dolls are displayed side by side.)

38
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,610
They are handmade dolls.

39
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,700
(Her style ranges from fancy to simple.)

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,380
These dolls are of high quality.

41
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,830
Whose is this?
Is this also by Artist Kim?

42
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,500
(Her world of art shows off
a wide spectrum.)

43
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,750
My, this looks expensive.

44
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,310
How much is this?

45
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,610
(Which doll is the most expensive one?)

46
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,750
Which one should I pick?

47
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,480
I can take one of them.

48
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,860
The first one is a bit...

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,130
It's a bit scary. I don't know why.

50
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,660
There's no male doll.
No, there's just one.

51
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,340
Should I take the male doll?

52
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,590
It's cute.

53
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,560
This is the only male doll.

54
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,160
All right, I'll take...

55
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,740
the male doll.

56
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,940
Oh, I can just take it out.

57
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,180
I'll take this.

58
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,970
Hey, Eddy.

59
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,280
Your name is Eddy.

60
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,880
This is really high quality.

61
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,310
- What's going on?
- Hello.

62
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,490
- What's this?
- Hello. Welcome.

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,660
- It's a doll exhibition.
- He's so cute.

64
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,250
You're so cute. Who are you?

65
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,960
- You're so cute.
- Welcome...

66
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,460
to Artist Kim So Hee's
VIP Doll Exhibition.

67
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,500
- Kim So Hee?
- Kim So Hee? Who is So Hee?

68
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,000
A doll exhibition?

69
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,820
I guess we have a guest today.

70
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,290
- But from the beginning...
- Let's go in.

71
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,970
Who is Kim So Hee?
Is she an actress?

72
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,160
Kim So Hee.

73
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,440
Here they are.

74
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,740
Oh, one of them...

75
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,030
is the most expensive doll
that Artist Kim made?

76
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,710
I like this one.

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,210
How cute is that? Look.

78
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,970
- Number seven.
- Look at this. It's...

79
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,440
The other dolls look scary.

80
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,970
- This one is the cutest.
- I like number seven.

81
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,150
Come here, you punk.

82
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,150
(Jong Kook chooses doll number 2.)

83
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,380
Yes, this one is the cutest.

84
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,220
- The other dolls look scary.
- I like dolls like this.

85
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,120
- I'll take number seven.
- I like the color.

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,820
- I'll take number seven.
- You're taking that?

87
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,990
- Isn't it cute?
- My gosh.

88
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,130
- Wait a minute.
- What is it?

89
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,690
- It's pretty.
- Right.

90
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,030
(Doll lookism)

91
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,790
- Do you like pretty dolls?
- Yes, I do.

92
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,530
- Is that so?
- I don't like ugly dolls.

93
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,760
All right. Where should we go next?

94
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,190
- Is that so?
- Upstairs?

95
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,240
So Min, which one do you want?

96
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
Gosh, So Min.

97
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,810
So Min, that one looks scary.

98
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,740
You picked a doll that looks like a ghost.

99
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,910
It's because...

100
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,280
Because it looks scary,

101
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,410
I thought it'd be less significant.

102
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,940
Who is Artist Kim So Hee?

103
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,250
(Jae Suk enters next.)

104
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,190
You thought it through
before making your choice, right?

105
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,560
- I knew it.
- I knew you'd pick that.

106
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,510
I knew you'd like the doll
with two braids.

107
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,630
You picked a mischievous-looking one
just like you.

108
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,850
- We have similar taste.
- You picked a mischievous one.

109
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,060
- We have similar taste.
- He picked one that looks like him.

110
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,000
I picked the only male doll.

111
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,560
- "What are you saying?"
- What are you doing?

112
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,370
- I like dolls like this.
- "What are you doing, mister?"

113
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,900
- Your doll...
- His name is Eddy.

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,240
Call him Eddy.

115
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,740
"Eddy, my foot."

116
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,000
What's her name? Clara?

117
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,180
"Hi, Clara."

118
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,710
I like dolls that look like dolls.

119
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,650
- These look like a person.
- Right, it's better than these.

120
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,010
It's scary. I was thinking of
picking either of these two.

121
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,720
This style is my favorite.

122
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,440
Since when did you two get along so well?

123
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,910
- They're close.
- Since when?

124
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,820
If they stick together,
things will go crazy.

125
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,750
- It's too much to handle.
- Ever since...

126
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,060
"Three Meals for Jae Suk,"
they've become closer.

127
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,020
- I'll pick this one.
- This one? Then I'll pick this.

128
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,230
I don't have bangs,
so I want one with bangs.

129
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,170
It's so cute.

130
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,740
- It's so pretty.
- Right, Ji Hyo?

131
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,370
The one that Ji Hyo picked is cuter.

132
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,130
- This one's really cute.
- You picked a male doll?

133
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,830
- Yes.
- Yours is so pretty.

134
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,740
- Aren't they cute?
- Yes, they are.

135
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,070
I've never held a doll like this
for so long in my entire life.

136
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,940
I've never wanted a doll.

137
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,180
When were you born?

138
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,750
I was born 55 years ago.

139
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,010
- No, it's been 56 years.
- You're right.

140
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,580
Didn't they make dolls
with straw back in your day?

141
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,450
- It was...
- Like a cursed doll.

142
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,860
- I know.
- With straw?

143
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,130
Like back in the Joseon Dynasty?

144
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,500
- That puppy is still there.
- I want to know who he is.

145
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,020
- Who is that puppy?
- Artist Kim So Hee...

146
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,020
isn't a real figure, is she?

147
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,130
- I have no idea.
- Hello.

148
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,600
- Hi.
- Everyone.

149
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,740
Hello. As you already know,

150
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,460
Artist Kim So Hee...

151
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,630
has won so many awards
in various competitions.

152
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,330
She's a star artist who's known
as a master of handmade dolls.

153
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,110
- That's right.
- Oh, she's a star artist?

154
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,350
Let me tell you about the dolls
you're holding.

155
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,580
Ms. Kim rejected all the invitations
from prestigious art galleries...

156
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,930
and focused on her artworks only.

157
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,520
After putting in a great deal
of effort, she made these dolls,

158
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,600
which are limited editions.

159
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,300
Yes! Limited editions!

160
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,960
One of the seven dolls...

161
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,390
is the most expensive doll
that Ms. Kim has ever made.

162
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,610
Among these?

163
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,170
One of you...

164
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,700
is holding the most expensive doll,

165
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,070
and I can't wait to find out who that is.

166
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,570
The next segment we've prepared for you...

167
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,880
is a meeting with Artist Kim.

168
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,290
- Artist Kim So Hee?
- I can't wait to see who she is.

169
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,750
Please welcome Artist Kim
with a big round of applause.

170
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,230
Who could it be?

171
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,360
(Curious)

172
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,690
- Hello.
- Hello.

173
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,500
(Artist Kim So Hee,
the master of handmade dolls)

174
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,230
- Is she a real artist?
- Hello, everyone.

175
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,800
- Hello.
- I'm Artist Kim So Hee.

176
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,370
- Hello.
- Is she a real artist?

177
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,170
- My, hello.
- I'm Artist Kim So Hee.

178
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,130
Thank you so much for coming
to my VIP doll exhibition.

179
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,110
- Thank you.
- Of course we should come.

180
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,350
- Don't say something ridiculous.
- I know. What's wrong with you?

181
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,500
- Your ad-libs are horrible.
- I know.

182
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,680
- They can't even be aired.
- Just stay quiet.

183
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,420
You've all selected my dolls.

184
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,710
Let me introduce the dolls you're holding.

185
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,010
The doll you're holding...

186
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,450
was made with inspiration...

187
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,430
from Gaudi's architecture that I saw
when I was in Barcelona.

188
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,450
- Gaudi?
- Oh, I know who he is.

189
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,520
- "Gaori?"
- Gaudi.

190
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,890
- Gaudi.
- I got inspired...

191
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,000
- I know who Gaudi is.
- by his work and made this doll.

192
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,170
- You were inspired by his work?
- Yes.

193
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,630
When I look at this doll,

194
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,940
I can feel the sunlight...

195
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,900
- of Barcelona from that time.
- You can feel the sunlight?

196
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,940
That must be why
Suk Jin picked this doll.

197
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,940
- Because he was inspired.
- You can feel the sunlight?

198
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,110
What about the others?

199
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,750
You picked the doll
I put the most effort into.

200
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,070
- Oh, this one?
- Yes.

201
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,710
- What did she say?
- For this doll,

202
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,750
I got the material myself,
which is only provided...

203
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,790
to the Italian designer brands.

204
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,230
- I put my heart into every stitch.
- It looks that way.

205
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,650
(Now that you mention it)

206
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,500
And this doll...

207
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,670
(And this doll...)

208
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,170
Wait. Why are you...

209
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,130
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

210
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,870
- Artist Kim!
- What just happened?

211
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,260
- "Why are you?"
- "Why are you?"

212
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,940
(Artist Kim was introducing
the doll Ji Hyo was holding.)

213
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,310
(Wait. Why are you...)

214
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,570
(With a mysterious remark,
Artist Kim collapsed.)

215
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,810
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

216
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,510
- Artist Kim!
- What just happened?

217
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,310
- "Why are you?"
- "Why are you?"

218
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,420
Did she mean you?

219
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,450
No, she was talking about the doll.

220
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,450
- Maybe she had thrown it away.
- She was talking about the doll.

221
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,650
Artist Kim!

222
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,450
This is a VIP emergency! Paramedics!

223
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,730
Paramedics, please hurry over!

224
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,730
The paramedics are here.

225
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,460
It's so scary.
It's a horror special.

226
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,960
- The one she threw out is here.
- Is she okay?

227
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,670
Ms. Kim!

228
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,830
- But wait.
- She's rolling.

229
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,170
She's rolling on her own!

230
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,240
(She rolls onto the stretcher
as though it was scripted.)

231
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,050
- She's getting on it herself.
- She rolled on her own.

232
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,250
His butt is too close.

233
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,480
- Excuse me.
- You should face her.

234
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,080
Can't you do a better job, Hyung Gu?

235
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,580
- You're so clumsy.
- Didn't Hyung Gu practice?

236
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,360
- Carry her!
- Put her on the stretcher.

237
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,580
- There you go. Watch her arms!
- Be careful.

238
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,690
- Watch her arms.
- Here he goes again.

239
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,630
Just leave already! Watch her head.

240
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,750
You should go down a little.

241
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,950
Be careful.

242
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,600
- Is she okay?
- Her skirt!

243
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,100
Shouldn't she turn over?

244
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,500
She has passed away.

245
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,000
- What did you say?
- She has passed away.

246
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,170
- All of a sudden?
- She rolled herself...

247
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,170
onto the stretcher!
What do you mean she's dead?

248
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,060
- She's still alive!
- Hey.

249
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,400
How can you be so indifferent
when she's dead?

250
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,110
We'll take her to the funeral home.

251
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,480
But she's holding onto the pole.

252
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,750
(Artist Kim So Hee
suddenly died mysteriously.)

253
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,510
- They're going to the funeral home?
- The funeral home?

254
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,280
What number is on your doll, Ji Hyo?

255
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,820
- It's number 5.
- Hers is number 5.

256
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,490
She said that to Ji Hyo's doll.

257
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,230
She was looking at that doll,

258
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,960
and said, "Why are you?"

259
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,550
Ji Hyo.

260
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,920
- Why did you choose this?
- But this is...

261
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,130
(What's the secret
behind Artist Kim's death?)

262
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,730
- It looks like you too.
- It's scary.

263
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,970
The puppy is back.

264
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,600
Everyone.

265
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,630
I'm sure you're all surprised.

266
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,130
Let me clarify what just happened.

267
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

268
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,400
Due to the arduous effort
she put into her artworks,

269
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,210
she suffered from
visual and auditory hallucinations.

270
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,120
(Artist Kim suffered from
visual and auditory hallucinations.)

271
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,910
Sadly, today,

272
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,590
Artist Kim passed away.

273
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,250
- My goodness.
- She's dead?

274
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,820
(Artist Kim So Hee is dead.)

275
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,830
- She's dead?
- The prices must spike.

276
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,050
What do we do?

277
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,000
Artist Kim...

278
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,470
prepared for her own sudden death.

279
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,070
She told me the procedures
I must take after her death...

280
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,840
- and entrusted her will to me.
- What?

281
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,800
Let me read her will out loud.

282
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,840
- Okay.
- Sure. Go ahead.

283
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,000
She must've left something.

284
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,170
This is the late Artist Kim So Hee's will.

285
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,000
First.

286
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,900
"Whenever, wherever, and however
I, Kim So Hee, die,"

287
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,770
"I will pass the ownership
and all of my assets..."

288
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,120
"to the person selected
by the procedures."

289
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,880
- That's what her will says.
- She must've left something.

290
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,050
Second.

291
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,550
"In accordance with her will
and the prepared plans for today,"

292
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,250
"the person who finds and attains
the most expensive doll by 8 p.m..."

293
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,520
"will inherit the ownership
of the doll and all her assets."

294
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,290
We haven't played
this kind of game in a while.

295
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,570
And lastly,

296
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,660
we're going to carry out a test...

297
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,300
to see if you deserve
to inherit all the assets.

298
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,800
"Those who place 1st and 2nd
on the test..."

299
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,170
"will be given a hint
on the most expensive doll."

300
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,170
"You need to do your best
if you want to inherit."

301
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,120
- Okay.
- All right, now.

302
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,540
We'll start the test now.

303
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,990
- Okay.
- All right.

304
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,860
The dolls suddenly look scary.

305
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,750
- Are we drawing the dolls?
- All of a sudden?

306
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,730
(How are the dolls
related to the artist's death?)

307
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,920
- Why did Artist Kim suddenly...
- Artist Kim...

308
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,740
Why did she die so suddenly?

309
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,070
- She looked at your doll...
- Why was she surprised by my doll?

310
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,240
(Artist Kim suddenly collapsed
after seeing Ji Hyo's doll.)

311
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,800
It's really pretty though.

312
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,900
(Is there a secret behind this doll?)

313
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,800
- All right.
- Please go ahead.

314
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,880
Artist Kim...

315
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,590
wanted to give the most expensive doll...

316
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,380
to the person who is sharp-eyed
and observant.

317
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,360
So here's the test we have prepared.

318
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,050
It's called Draw Using Your Memory.

319
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,590
- Draw Using Your Memory?
- Yes.

320
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,920
Using my memory?

321
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,020
Listen to the name of the brand
we often see...

322
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,240
and draw its logo using your memory.

323
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,390
(They're to draw the logo
of a brand that they remember.)

324
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,570
Two people who score the highest...

325
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,430
will be given a hint.

326
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,500
I must win this.

327
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,980
Everyone.

328
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,770
Please do your best
to win the most expensive doll.

329
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,040
- All right.
- Okay.

330
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,510
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

331
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,580
Bye.

332
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,180
According to Artist Kim So Hee's
last will and testament,

333
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,180
the first qualification test will be
carried out.

334
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,180
(It's time for the qualification test.)

335
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,750
You just have to draw the logo
of the brand I tell you.

336
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,780
- Really?
- Okay.

337
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,460
If the brand name is written on it,
you must spell it correctly too.

338
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,050
We have to spell the brand name too?

339
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,500
If it's necessary, yes.

340
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,870
There's another game inside the game.

341
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,030
- Here's your first question.
- Okay.

342
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,570
The international coffee brand, S coffee.

343
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,630
Oh, I see. Really?

344
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,710
S coffee.

345
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,000
How do I draw that logo?

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,500
- That's too difficult.
- How do I draw it?

347
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Please draw the logo of S coffee.

348
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,770
- The one with "Star" in its name?
- Yes.

349
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,080
- First...
- Seriously?

350
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,580
- Their logo has a color.
- Hold on a second.

351
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,990
I'm holding it now.
We all picked this color.

352
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,780
- I wish I could drink it.
- Oh, I found the right color.

353
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,880
- I'll go with this color.
- This is too difficult...

354
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,490
- to draw.
- Jong Kook was holding the cup.

355
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,990
Exactly. I was holding it earlier.

356
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,130
- Wait.
- It's hard to draw that angel.

357
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,100
Oh, boy. Was it Medusa?

358
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,420
- Am I right?
- Yes, it looks like Medusa.

359
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,470
It's something like Medusa, right?

360
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,700
I have no idea how to draw it.

361
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,030
I have the image in my head, but...

362
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,200
All right. I'm done.

363
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,430
- Good. It looks just like the logo.
- Let's move on quickly.

364
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,080
Five, four, three,

365
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,140
- What's this? Look.
- two, one. Time's up.

366
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,400
All right.

367
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,720
Gosh. What's that?

368
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,140
(He turned it
into an aliens' beverage company.)

369
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,320
Hey, what's that?

370
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,510
- I couldn't remember the details.
- My goodness.

371
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,360
- So Min.
- Gosh. Is it a witch or something?

372
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,050
- Hers reminds me of Ninja Turtles.
- Isn't this it?

373
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,380
- There's a queen in the center.
- What's that?

374
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,150
Jong Kook, what did you draw?

375
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,830
- What's that?
- Jong Kook, that's Mr. Man.

376
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,070
- Why did you draw Mr. Man?
- Hey.

377
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,070
- I drew...
- Hey, Jong Kook.

378
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,530
It looks similar if you look at it
with your eyes half open.

379
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,970
- Doesn't it?
- What's that?

380
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,370
Ji Hyo, don't you know
the brand logo at all?

381
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,710
- There's a lady with...
- You don't know?

382
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,770
A lady...

383
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,270
Do you?

384
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,610
- This is it. It's almost the same.
- Okay. Next.

385
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,500
- This is it. There's...
- What's this?

386
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,980
There's the brand name
written around the drawing.

387
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,820
- I'm asking who this is.
- Oh, this...

388
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,680
- Who is this lady here?
- She...

389
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,850
She gained some weight.

390
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,120
- Gosh, seriously.
- She ate a lot and gained weight.

391
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,150
You should've made it look stylish.

392
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,860
This is it. I drew all the details nicely.

393
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,020
- Pardon?
- That's...

394
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,520
- Isn't that Zeus?
- What's that?

395
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,200
- That looks just like Zeus.
- Gosh. I think...

396
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,290
It has similar facial features.

397
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,500
- It'd be a great composite sketch.
- My drawing is the best.

398
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,930
- I drew it better.
- This is more accurate.

399
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,300
- The overall look is...
- Really?

400
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,110
It's obvious who is at the bottom.

401
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,530
- Why?
- What did you draw?

402
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,110
- What is this?
- It's the one on the cupholder.

403
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,750
- Hey.
- On the cupholder...

404
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,480
That's you when you dressed up
as a green onion.

405
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,720
That's ridiculous.

406
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,140
You've never tried their coffee, have you?

407
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,820
This is the drawing on the cupholder.

408
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,590
- We'll reveal the logo now.
- Okay.

409
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,010
- This is the correct answer.
- I'm sure I did the best.

410
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,320
(The correct answer is revealed.)

411
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,130
- It's a mermaid. See?
- Right. Look at her arms.

412
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,590
- I drew her arms right here.
- Look at her hair.

413
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,730
- I drew her curly hair.
- He drew her arms too.

414
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,960
- Right. I drew the arms right.
- Now...

415
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,290
- I drew her arms here.
- They're tails, not arms.

416
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,740
- Now...
- The brand name is written on it.

417
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,600
The winner that was chosen
by the staff members is Jae Suk.

418
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,800
- Okay.
- What?

419
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,840
- He's the winner?
- That?

420
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,530
- How can that be the best one?
- I'm the winner.

421
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,300
- He drew a mermaid at least.
- I knew it was a mermaid.

422
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,350
Oh, I see.

423
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,820
- But I did well too.
- It was hard to draw, right?

424
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,140
- I couldn't remember the logo.
- Okay.

425
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,250
The test result came out.

426
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,320
The person in first place is...

427
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,010
Jae Suk.

428
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,050
(Jae Suk is in first place.)

429
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,490
- Jae Suk is good at these games.
- I'm sure I'm not at the bottom.

430
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:26,230
You guys lacked understanding
of the logo in the first place.

431
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,390
- You see, they...
- Just because you won. That's mean.

432
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,920
- You guys didn't know what it was.
- I can't believe him.

433
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,260
Artist Kim So Hee wouldn't want to
give you any hits.

434
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,300
- Seriously, it's so difficult.
- I'm so upset.

435
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,260
- I thought I could draw it.
- I couldn't remember the details.

436
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,300
I couldn't remember it.

437
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,610
The person in second place is...

438
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,340
Haha.

439
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,480
(Haha is in second place.)

440
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,250
Haha is in second place?

441
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,820
The two of you will be given a hint
on the most expensive doll.

442
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,380
- I'm jealous.
- Read it without showing anyone.

443
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,550
- Haha.
- I'm not allowed to share it?

444
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,510
- No, don't show it to anyone else.
- He said I shouldn't share it.

445
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,750
- Can't he share it with us?
- No.

446
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,780
You and I have known each other
for decades.

447
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,790
They gave me two envelopes.

448
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,600
(Jae Suk and Haha received
two hint envelopes.)

449
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,130
Check the cue card first.

450
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,200
- You mean this?
- Yes.

451
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,930
(They open the first envelope
and read the hint.)

452
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,110
He looks worried.

453
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,030
What? Why?

454
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,840
The first hint must be ambiguous.

455
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,110
But this is...

456
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,670
(What is it?)

457
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,770
There's a weird tension in the air.

458
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,850
(So the hint remains a secret
between them.)

459
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,220
Now, we're going to move
to the next spot of the tour.

460
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,220
(Let's go to the next spot!)

461
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,650
- We're leaving, everyone.
- Okay.

462
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,750
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

463
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,360
- That puppy is still here.
- Thank you.

464
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
(The puppy is standing
in front of the tour bus.)

465
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,920
- I think we'll get instructions.
- What?

466
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,390
Now, you're going to visit
the school Artist Kim went to.

467
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,700
- The school she went to?
- I see.

468
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,300
- If you look around the school,
- Yes.

469
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,500
you will find some hints
on the most expensive doll.

470
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,640
Use those hints to find
the most expensive doll.

471
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,640
And the person who has it
in his or her possession...

472
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,720
at 8 p.m. when the tour ends will
inherit the ownership...

473
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,950
and Artist Kim's assets.

474
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,220
(The person who finds
the most expensive doll wins.)

475
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,280
You can exchange your dolls...

476
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,960
- by mutual consent.
- Yes.

477
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,680
You can also exchange dolls
without consent...

478
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,250
by ripping off the doll owner's name tag.

479
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,290
Without consent?
Then we can get any doll we want.

480
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,290
- However...
- Understood. Thank you, sir.

481
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,230
Since you need to find hints
as quickly as possible,

482
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,890
the order in which you get off the bus
is very important.

483
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,570
- The order we get off?
- Yes.

484
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,240
While moving to the next location,
the order will be decided...

485
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,350
through a simple test.
Don't ever miss this chance.

486
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,000
- Got it.
- Then good luck, everyone.

487
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,820
I understand, sir.

488
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,590
I think there's something going on.

489
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,320
- It's suspicious.
- Exactly.

490
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,490
Why does the puppy keep showing up?

491
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,860
(The puppy with a weird vibe
sees them off as they leave.)

492
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,250
By the way, we can exchange dolls
by ripping off someone's name tag,

493
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,250
- Yes.
- but we can't take one from others.

494
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,750
- What's important is...
- Yes.

495
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,500
- that this doll...
- Do we need two dolls at the end?

496
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,030
- That may be right.
- I agree.

497
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,070
We'll probably need another doll.

498
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,300
Suk Jin, why would you twist
its neck like that? Gosh.

499
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,710
- Look. Its head is turned.
- Gosh.

500
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,880
Turn it back.

501
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
(Big Nose is having fun with his doll.)

502
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,210
He has never played with a doll.

503
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,850
He only played traditional games
like jwibulnori.

504
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,510
- Or biseokchigi.
- Or jachigi.

505
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,980
- Yes, jachigi.
- He only played such games.

506
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,250
- He has never played with a doll.
- Or throwing arrows in a bucket.

507
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,220
- He's never done it before.
- Or catching frogs.

508
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,320
(The traditional game lover is excited.)

509
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,720
- He went through a famine too.
- That reminds me of a song.

510
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,650
(Child, do not run)

511
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,690
(It will make you feel hungry)

512
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,720
What's that song?

513
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,530
- "Period of Spring Poverty."
- It's Jin Sung's song.

514
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,600
Oh, I see.

515
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,870
- Why don't you know the song?
- Suk Jin is...

516
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,900
Tell me why I should know that song.

517
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,160
He's one year younger than you.

518
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,700
That's not true.

519
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,580
My parents watched
our show yesterday and said...

520
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,510
- that you don't look well lately.
- Why?

521
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,900
- Why?
- I don't know. You looked unwell.

522
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,350
- In that episode?
- Really?

523
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,470
- I guess I had some worries.
- So Min.

524
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,970
- I don't remember though.
- Ask your parents...

525
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,550
when he ever looked cheery.

526
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,910
Since they've never seen Suk Jin
look cheery before,

527
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,360
- they must've been worried.
- So Min.

528
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,480
- Brother seems to worry about me.
- Indeed.

529
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,530
- Who is "Brother?"
- Right?

530
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,920
- That kid's father.
- He calls my dad "Brother."

531
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,660
- Just call him "Mr. Jeon."
- Suk Jin.

532
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,630
- "That kid's father?"
- Why would you call him "Brother?"

533
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,490
- What was that?
- He's old enough to be my brother.

534
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,690
How much older is he than you?

535
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,510
- I think he's about...
- My dad was born in 1960.

536
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,730
- They have a six-year age gap.
- Young enough to be my big brother.

537
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,380
- Suk Jin, that sounded so cold.
- That's unbelievable.

538
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,130
- My dad was born in 1960.
- A much older brother.

539
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,200
(Their age gap is small enough
for them to be more friendly.)

540
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,080
My dad calls Suk Jin affectionately
while watching our show.

541
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,580
- "My dear Suk Jin."
- You see,

542
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,120
- That's funny.
- although I've never met him,

543
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,590
- I feel affectionate toward him.
- How they call each other is funny.

544
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,710
You can visit her parents' house...

545
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,650
- even when So Min isn't home.
- Absolutely.

546
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,760
I'd say to her mother,
"Hello, my sister-in-law."

547
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,330
- That's cute.
- They have a small age gap.

548
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,690
- When you look around the school,
- Yes.

549
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,990
the earlier you get out of the bus,
the better chance you'll get.

550
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,810
- We'll play a game to decide that.
- Okay.

551
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,040
- Great.
- All right.

552
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,230
- We can do that.
- Now...

553
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,930
This next test that will decide
the order you get off is...

554
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,280
Admit It to Get Out.

555
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,670
- Okay!
- "Admit It to Get Out?"

556
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,120
- I'd admit to anything.
- I admit things easily.

557
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,520
- I'd admit to anything.
- I admit.

558
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,210
The first player can attack
one of the two people...

559
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,980
- sitting next to you.
- I see.

560
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,790
For example, tap one of the people
sitting next to you,

561
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,390
and say a sentence like,
"You're doing this now."

562
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,990
For example,
"You want to go number two now."

563
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,070
Or something else.
Anything would do.

564
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,070
- Okay. Got it.
- Then the person you attacked...

565
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,900
has to repeat what you said.
"I am doing it."

566
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,340
- Like this.
- I see.

567
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,080
- You respect me.
- That's good.

568
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,380
- Then you say...
- I respect you.

569
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,740
- Then you attack someone else.
- You like So Min.

570
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,440
- Then I say, "I like So Min."
- Correct.

571
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,850
- That's how you play the game.
- I see.

572
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,360
If you hesitate or fail to say it,
you lose one point.

573
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,520
- Got it.
- We'll have to admit what's false.

574
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,330
- Ready? Who wants to go first?
- Yes.

575
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,220
- Let's have Suk Jin go first.
- Let's do that.

576
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,420
- You should say something baffling.
- That's right.

577
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,800
You're looking at So Min.

578
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,540
(Attack, "You're looking at So Min.")

579
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,570
What was that?

580
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,400
I am looking at So Min.

581
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,700
(Se Chan blocked the weak attack.)

582
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,380
You don't love your family.

583
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,670
(Attack, "You don't love your family.")

584
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,240
(Taken aback)

585
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,980
You don't love your family.

586
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,290
(Taken aback)

587
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,260
- Go.
- He's hesitating.

588
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,090
I don't love my family.

589
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,790
(Defense, "I don't love my family.")

590
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,260
I don't love my family.

591
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,860
(He traded his love for his family
just for one point.)

592
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,830
- I can't believe he just said that.
- Did he just say that?

593
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,270
- Just to get off the bust first.
- I can't believe this.

594
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,840
- Suk Jin, how could you do that?
- You...

595
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,660
regret marrying your wife.

596
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,540
(Attack, "You regret marrying your wife.")

597
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,770
I...

598
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,670
I regret marrying my wife.

599
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,670
(Defense, "I regret marrying my wife.")

600
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,400
(The breaking celebrity news
keep pouring out.)

601
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,440
But...

602
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,780
You are thinking about Yoon Eun Hye.

603
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,850
Enough!

604
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,850
(Defense, "Enough!")

605
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,060
Enough is enough! Just stop it!

606
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,360
(Jong Kook is hitting Jae Suk
ruthlessly with his doll.)

607
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,420
- Stop it.
- Why...

608
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,130
- Eun Hye, come on the show.
- That's enough.

609
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,030
- "Running Man" is waiting for you.
- Enough. Gosh, seriously.

610
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,660
- I haven't seen you in ten years.
- You drive me crazy.

611
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,600
- I mean...
- She's practically a member.

612
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,930
- Eun Hye, I miss you.
- Please come on our show.

613
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,200
- Don't bring her up every time.
- Eun Hye, you're one of us.

614
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,610
- Eun Hye from Baby V.O.X,
- Why would you...

615
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,510
- we're all waiting for you...
- Stop it. That's enough.

616
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,470
- Don't let it continue.
- I mean this is just a game.

617
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,970
- Even so...
- This is just a game.

618
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,240
- Never bring her up in any case.
- Jong Kook, you lost one point.

619
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,120
- Never bring her up again.
- He lost a point.

620
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,060
- He lost one point. Okay.
- Promise me, okay?

621
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,420
- You lost one point.
- All right. That's okay.

622
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,260
- It ends right here.
- All right. I heard you.

623
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,150
- He can't seem to let it slide.
- It's just a game.

624
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,300
- Don't do that again.
- Jong Kook, you go first.

625
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,390
- Pick either person next to you.
- That was hilarious.

626
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,570
Okay. You may begin.

627
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,610
You want to be alone for three days.

628
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,160
(Attack, "You want to
be alone for three days.)

629
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,370
I bet he actually wants that.

630
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,930
- I want to be alone for three days.
- He means that.

631
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,110
- That's why he doesn't feel bad.
- Exactly.

632
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,470
("Mr. Yoo Demands Additional
Three Days for Quarantine")

633
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,410
You are thinking about your ex-lover.

634
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,210
(Attack, "You are thinking
about your ex-lover.")

635
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,940
- Oh, my gosh.
- The one that I know?

636
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,060
- Is it her?
- Suk Jin, don't do that.

637
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,480
Keep the peace in your family, Suk Jin.

638
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,150
You lost one point.

639
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,480
(He failed to admit it
and lost one point.)

640
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,060
- Darn.
- Why did you hesitate?

641
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,060
- Gosh.
- You could've just said it.

642
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,630
- You know... Hey.
- You could've just repeated it.

643
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,570
- You should've said it.
- I never thought about my ex-lover.

644
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,460
- Then why didn't you repeat it?
- It wasn't like that.

645
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,770
- You should've just repeated it.
- It was so unexpected.

646
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,840
You could've done it.

647
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,510
By the way, why is it only us
that play the game?

648
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,200
- Let them play too.
- Let's go that way.

649
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,050
- I'm so relaxed.
- I should repeat whatever it is.

650
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,240
- Let's start with Haha this time.
- Okay.

651
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,470
Great. Let's go.

652
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,970
You...

653
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,480
have dated Jong Kook.

654
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,020
(Attack, "You have dated Jong Kook.")

655
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,060
That's a hard one.

656
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,210
- What?
- That's a difficult one.

657
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,680
I have dated Jong Kook.

658
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,590
- I knew it.
- He said, "I knew it."

659
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,260
- We all knew that.
- Okay.

660
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,420
You...

661
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,420
still think of me.

662
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,100
What? Is this a love triangle or what?

663
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,630
But he's married.

664
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,040
- You're married. Will you say it?
- That was unexpected.

665
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,280
(When he was single, he said,
"Will Ji Hyo fall for me in ten seconds?")

666
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,010
(You want to go crazy today?)

667
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,240
(Should I hit on her?)

668
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:40,980
(There were times when he wouldn't
stop flirting with her.)

669
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,260
(Could Haha admit
his embarrassing moments?)

670
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,600
- You'll admit it?
- But this is just a game.

671
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,130
I still think of you.

672
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,270
Good.

673
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,690
That was good.

674
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,830
You...

675
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,340
were at Jong Kook's house yesterday.

676
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,370
(Attack, "You were
at Jong Kook's house yesterday.")

677
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,870
- Great.
- Fine.

678
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,510
I was at Jong Kook's house.

679
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,880
I knew it.

680
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,970
Oh, I see. Okay.

681
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,670
You...

682
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,670
thought of me yesterday too.

683
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:13,760
(Haha burst out laughing and failed.)

684
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,880
Haha got excited.
He's lost his touch.

685
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,630
Haha lost one point.

686
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,990
- He lost one point.
- He got taken aback.

687
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,330
I think it brought him back old memories.

688
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,420
I guess it reminded him of the days...

689
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,160
- when he was wild.
- There's romance for a change.

690
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,570
- Haha lost a point.
- By the way,

691
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,190
Haha looks like the coach
of the national archery team.

692
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,660
- "Let's go!"
- He looks like the coach...

693
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,510
- of the national archery team.
- Indeed.

694
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,730
- He's shooting an arrow. Good.
- Yes.

695
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,470
He looks like
the national archery team coach.

696
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,380
My gosh. I couldn't admit that.

697
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,940
- Let's start with So Min this time.
- This is fun.

698
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,050
- Me?
- Yes.

699
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,820
- Go Eun, I'm sorry.
- So Min will go first.

700
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,120
So Min will go first.

701
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,980
Why are you staring at me?
I have nothing to do with you.

702
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,180
(Tapping)

703
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,450
- You should look at me.
- Okay.

704
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,530
Look at me while I'm saying.

705
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,220
- Don't ask him out suddenly.
- Exactly.

706
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,420
You...

707
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,130
- love me with all your heart.
- Oh, man.

708
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,370
(Attack, "You love me
with all your heart.")

709
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,870
- Hey, you'll lose only one point.
- Oh, my.

710
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,570
It's only one point.
Keep your pride.

711
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,570
I...

712
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,930
- love you with all my heart.
- Okay.

713
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,670
(Defense, "I love you with all my heart.")

714
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,780
Hey, what was that?
I said you'd lose only one point.

715
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,410
- Why would you hit me?
- Go on.

716
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,140
- Why are you taking it out on me?
- You...

717
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,680
You...

718
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,480
love So Min with all your heart.

719
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,650
(Attack, "You love So Min
with all your heart.")

720
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,890
(Defense)

721
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
I...

722
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,770
(Laughing)

723
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,130
(He laughs while repeating it.)

724
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:38,840
I love So Min with all my heart.
Yes, I do.

725
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,130
(The extreme job)

726
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,080
- As a co-worker.
- Okay. Let's go.

727
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,850
You want to be alone for a month.

728
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,120
For a month?

729
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,320
I want to be alone for a month.

730
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,320
(Defense, "I want to be alone
for a month.")

731
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,880
- You're bad at improvising.
- Yes?

732
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,210
(Attack, "You're bad at improvising.")

733
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,790
(Clenching his teeth)

734
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,600
(They're laughing
as they know how he must feel.)

735
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,990
- That was good.
- Great job.

736
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,370
- My goodness.
- Hey.

737
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,570
I'm not bad at it!

738
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,370
- He wasn't teasing you.
- I'm not bad at improvising.

739
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,630
- He took it seriously.
- Exactly.

740
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,310
There must be a reason why I still
work in this industry!

741
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,930
- That was the hardest one so far.
- There must be a reason.

742
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,970
- Right?
- My goodness.

743
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,580
- "You're bad at improvising."
- People go crazy about me.

744
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,850
- This is a weekend variety show.
- You're bad at improvising.

745
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,480
- That's true.
- That was so hilarious.

746
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,090
- All right.
- Who wants to go first this time?

747
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,090
How about Jong Kook?

748
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,150
Okay. Let's start with Jong Kook.

749
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,590
- Me?
- Yes.

750
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,720
I'm curious about what he'll say.

751
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,690
You...

752
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,890
hate Director Choi Young In.

753
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,630
(Choi Young In, the director
of SBS variety show department)

754
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,370
(Fully satisfied)

755
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,040
(Actually, the two of them...)

756
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:50,470
(complimented each other
at an award ceremony as well.)

757
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,470
Oh, my. Will he meet her again after this?

758
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
I...

759
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,140
hate Director Choi Young In.

760
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,410
Oh, gosh. He just said it.

761
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,680
- Of course, I said it.
- I wouldn't have if I were you.

762
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,650
- Of course, I should. It's a game.
- I respect you, Ms. Choi.

763
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,790
- Okay.
- You...

764
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,760
- are not funny these days.
- Why do you attack only me?

765
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,330
(Attack, "You're not funny these days.")

766
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,800
(Laughing)

767
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,300
Don't laugh, you guys.

768
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,390
- He just said the same thing.
- It's not the same.

769
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,460
- Don't get mad.
- It's not the same.

770
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,110
- Don't be mad.
- It's the same as the previous one.

771
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,160
- That's not true.
- Repeat it for now.

772
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,510
- Repeat it.
- Everyone says I'm funny.

773
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,630
- Say it.
- What's with your reaction?

774
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,580
- It's the situation that's funny.
- Don't be ridiculous.

775
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,670
- It's not like we think it's true.
- That's right.

776
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,200
- That's not what I mean.
- Just repeat it.

777
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,880
- Why would you laugh at it?
- Why are you being sulky?

778
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,020
- You lost one point.
- Just say it.

779
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,320
- You lost one point.
- That's it. Gosh.

780
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
- But he made me angry.
- You hesitated too long.

781
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,120
- I mean...
- Is that what this game is about?

782
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,020
I didn't say it
because I actually hate Ms. Choi.

783
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,380
- Because it's just a game.
- I said it because it's a game.

784
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,650
Suk Jin, you go first.

785
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,150
Let's start with So Min.
She didn't get many chances.

786
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,030
- Have you run out of ideas?
- That's right.

787
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,370
I'm too angry to think of any.

788
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,230
- "Have you run out of ideas?"
- I ran out of ideas.

789
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,660
- Hey.
- He ran out of ideas.

790
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,270
- My, that's so funny.
- He's run out of ideas.

791
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,770
- Hey. Got a death wish?
- That's funny.

792
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,380
I'm just worried. That's all.

793
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,670
- He'll call the staff later...
- "Have you run out of ideas?"

794
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,280
to ask them to make him look funny
when they edit this.

795
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,510
- Gosh, seriously.
- Let's start with So Min.

796
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,510
- Me?
- Yes.

797
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,880
(It's So Min's turn.)

798
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,380
- It's you, Haha.
- That was cute.

799
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,520
You didn't go home last night.

800
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,290
I didn't go home last night.

801
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,290
(Haha repeated it.)

802
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
You...

803
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,860
are ugly.

804
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,630
I know that.

805
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,920
(So Min got upset.)

806
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,030
- So Min, come on.
- She admitted it though.

807
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,160
- She failed.
- Didn't she just admit it?

808
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,960
- Of course.
- No. I didn't fail.

809
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,200
- I was going to repeat it.
- She was going to.

810
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,770
- Why did you take it seriously?
- I was...

811
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,580
- going to repeat it.
- You should've said, "I'm ugly."

812
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,010
- I was going to...
- If you get upset...

813
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,940
- Exactly. You shouldn't get upset.
- I was going to repeat it.

814
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,780
- You lost one point. It's over.
- You shouldn't get upset.

815
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,210
- Exactly.
- The game ended.

816
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,050
- I'll tally the score and tell you.
- You...

817
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,740
- You're uglier than Se Chan.
- Stop it.

818
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,260
No, I'm not!

819
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,880
When we get there, you'll get out
in this order.

820
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,150
- Got it. Thank you.
- Okay.

821
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,950
- Why am I in sixth place?
- One, two, three.

822
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,270
This is the school
that Artist Kim went to.

823
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,460
- Yes.
- Where are we?

824
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,130
The person who is holding
the most expensive doll...

825
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,160
at 8 p.m. when the game ends...

826
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,670
gets the prize money
and inherits Artist Kim's assets.

827
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,310
- I see.
- As you were informed earlier,

828
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,310
- there are hints hidden throughout here.
- Yes.

829
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,880
Based on the hints you find,
guess the most expensive doll,

830
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,180
and exchange dolls with someone else
or take it from the person.

831
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,120
- This place is a little eerie.
- Indeed.

832
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,480
I'm a little scared.

833
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,760
This is really scary.

834
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,130
I have a bad feeling about this.

835
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,330
It looks creepy.

836
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,150
I feel like there's something in here.

837
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,070
- It's suspicious.
- Exactly.

838
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,460
(What do the hidden hints
tell about the most expensive doll?)

839
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,840
Now, the person who came in first
in the game...

840
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,870
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

841
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,660
- You may go now.
- Okay.

842
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,230
- Take off your seat belt.
- Go, Se Chan.

843
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,430
I'll see you guys later.

844
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,380
I'm off.

845
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,670
(He got out of the bus
while holding his doll.)

846
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,470
All right.
Where should I check first?

847
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,410
I should find hints.

848
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,680
Oh, my. What's that?

849
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,130
Why are there dolls here and there?

850
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,490
I see dolls all over the place.

851
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,130
(In the stairways and classrooms...)

852
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,340
I wonder why there are dolls
here and there.

853
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,380
(Mysterious dolls are placed
here and there.)

854
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,310
(There's an eerie tension in the air.)

855
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,850
This place is so scary.

856
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,410
This isn't a horror special, is it?

857
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,140
(Something about this school
doesn't feel right.)

858
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,860
I'm scared.

859
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,530
I'm curious about So Min's doll.

860
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,260
(Se Chan wants So Min's doll.)

861
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,720
I'm going to rip off her name tag.

862
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,300
- So Min, yours is the scariest.
- There must be something.

863
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,770
There must be something else.

864
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,630
- Mine is so cute.
- It looks like a nine-tailed fox.

865
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,690
- My baby.
- If you think about it,

866
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,840
Artist Kim explained to us...

867
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,770
about only these two dolls
before she died.

868
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,230
- She didn't tell us about the others.
- That's right. Also,

869
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,880
she was startled when she saw this doll.

870
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,940
(Earlier on, at the exhibition...)

871
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,480
(She said that Suk Jin's doll is
a great doll.)

872
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,480
(Then she told them
about Jae Suk's doll too.)

873
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,360
And this one is...

874
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:06,990
(When she saw Ji Hyo's doll,
she collapsed and died.)

875
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,310
The dolls that she didn't tell us about...

876
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,670
- Ji Hyo, you may leave now.
- Okay.

877
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,080
- Go on, Ji Hyo.
- My gosh.

878
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,280
- Good luck.
- All right. Go on.

879
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,510
I'll get going.

880
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,850
(The doll in Ji Hyo's hand is
the mysterious doll number five.)

881
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,580
Wait. The hint...

882
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,320
(Wait. The hint...)

883
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,680
Are those dolls hints?

884
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,650
I see a lot of dolls around here.

885
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,480
(She picks the doll up
and continues moving.)

886
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,090
- Jae Suk, it's your turn.
- Yes!

887
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,690
- Okay.
- See you later.

888
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,690
Bye.

889
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,370
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.
- See you later.

890
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,920
(Jae Suk stepped on his foot.)

891
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,270
Why would you step on my foot?

892
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,040
- I'm sorry.
- Did he step on your foot?

893
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,070
- I doubt it.
- I didn't see it.

894
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,630
- Why did you put it in the path?
- That's why it happened.

895
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,580
- Why did you put it out there?
- Then where else should I put it?

896
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,670
- Come on. Don't do that.
- Why would you put your foot there?

897
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,640
- Gosh. You'll be in trouble.
- I'm sorry.

898
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
(I'm sorry.)

899
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,980
(He gets out
after the half-hearted apology.)

900
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,210
(Then he checks something out.)

901
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,950
(What he took out as soon as
he got out of the bus was...)

902
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:14,190
(the hint envelope that was given
only to the top two earlier.)

903
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,600
- Why?
- But this is...

904
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,800
There's a weird tension in the air.

905
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,970
The cursed doll is the most expensive.

906
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,080
(Please head to Room 203
of Building A and play the video.)

907
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,050
(The most expensive doll is
a cursed doll?)

908
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,050
(They chose the dolls at random
while thinking that they're cute.)

909
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,290
(But out of the 7 dolls...)

910
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,520
(There's a cursed doll among them?)

911
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,680
(The cursed doll is the most expensive.)

912
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,630
(If you wish to know the full story,)

913
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,150
(please head to Room 203
of Building A and play the video.)

914
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,070
(Only Jae Suk and Haha...)

915
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,690
(know the secret
to the most expensive doll.)

916
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,930
I think it's this building.

917
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:53,900
(He must head to Room 203 to learn more.)

918
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,930
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

919
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,880
It started to rain all of a sudden.

920
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,440
(He bumped into Ji Hyo
on his way up the stairs.)

921
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,470
Jae Suk,

922
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,520
what was the clue you were given?

923
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,120
- I can't share that information.
- Got it.

924
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,820
- If I figure it out, we'll talk.
- Got it.

925
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,920
If I find out what the clue is,
we'll share ideas.

926
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,890
I'll put it down here for now.

927
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,860
What's with all the mosquitoes?

928
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,420
- Are there mosquitoes around?
- Yes.

929
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,190
(It's the room Jae Suk must go into
to watch the video.)

930
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,930
(He watches Ji Hyo's actions
and heads to the room.)

931
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,230
(He goes inside.)

932
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,470
Shouldn't I close the door?

933
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,200
(Nervous)

934
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,650
It won't lock.

935
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,560
My gosh.

936
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,800
(You startled me.)

937
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,300
That was terrifying, you know.

938
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,570
What are you up to?

939
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,460
- What...
- You scared me.

940
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,100
- That's why you locked the door?
- Yes.

941
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,270
(He blabbers nonsense
with a suspicious look on his face.)

942
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,770
- You startled me.
- I thought you had found something.

943
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,930
I didn't.

944
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,970
- What...
- You found something, didn't you?

945
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,380
I didn't.

946
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,850
I think you did.

947
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,400
I really didn't.

948
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:11,050
(Haha now gets off the bus.)

949
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,710
(He reads the clue like Jae Suk did.)

950
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,760
I must find the videotape.

951
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,030
(The cursed doll is the most expensive.)

952
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,060
(He heads to Room 303 of Building B
to look for the videotape.)

953
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,530
Let me see.

954
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,960
(He must find the videotape first.)

955
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,160
Is it here?

956
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,930
(Jae Suk managed to ditch Ji Hyo.)

957
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,780
(He searches for the videotape too.)

958
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,120
I think something could be here.

959
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,710
(I think something could be here.)

960
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,620
(Huh?)

961
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,410
I found it.

962
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,650
(It's the videotape.)

963
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,060
(He puts it in the VCR.)

964
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,530
It's been a while since I saw a VHS tape.

965
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,870
(The video plays.)

966
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:32,720
(What is recorded on the videotape?)

967
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,680
Welcome.

968
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,310
My gosh!

969
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,250
(He freezes on the spot.)

970
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,020
That startled me.

971
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,830
As a reward for finding me,

972
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,730
I will tell you a jaw-dropping story.

973
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,120
(I will tell you a jaw-dropping story.)

974
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,000
You're looking for
the most expensive doll So Hee made.

975
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,100
(You're looking for the most
expensive doll So Hee made.)

976
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,200
I am.

977
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,430
Do you believe...

978
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,710
that the doll you're currently holding...

979
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,810
is the most expensive one?

980
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,450
If so, be aware.

981
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,580
Because the most expensive doll...

982
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,870
has been cursed by a ghost.

983
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:28,180
(The most expensive doll
is in fact cursed.)

984
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,560
My gosh. Did I frighten you?

985
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,620
But that's not all.

986
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,060
The ghost that cursed the doll...

987
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,730
and killed Kim So Hee...

988
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,370
is among you.

989
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,330
(The killer is among you.)

990
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,710
(The ghost...)

991
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,000
(is among us?)

992
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:54,000
(One of them is the ghost
who murdered So Hee.)

993
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,480
And that ghost...

994
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,020
will be after you next.

995
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,480
(One of the dolls is cursed...)

996
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,980
(and the ghost
will now come after the living.)

997
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,710
Do you wish to live?

998
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,830
Your chances are slim,
but I'll still lay out an option.

999
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,960
(The way the living can survive)

1000
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,290
Out of the seven dolls,

1001
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,330
find the one that's cursed...

1002
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,640
and cut it open by the belly.

1003
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,830
(Cutting open the cursed doll
will eliminate the ghost.)

1004
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,500
(The ghost will be eliminated.)

1005
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,140
But be careful...

1006
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,080
because the names of the living...

1007
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,040
are written inside the other six dolls.

1008
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,520
(The names of the living
are in the other 6 dolls.)

1009
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,180
If you cut open a doll that isn't cursed,

1010
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,390
the name in it
will point to who's eliminated.

1011
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,560
(If you find a name in the doll,
that person will be eliminated.)

1012
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:47,060
(Cutting the wrong doll will result
in the elimination of a human.)

1013
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:53,000
(Their names are written
inside each doll.)

1014
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:58,350
(Not knowing this,
they chose the one they liked.)

1015
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:02,410
(The dolls aren't in the hands
of their respective owners.)

1016
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:07,250
(No one's aware of whose doll they have.)

1017
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,210
(To stay alive,)

1018
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,180
(you must find the doll
that has your name in it.)

1019
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,580
At 7 p.m.,

1020
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,120
at 7:30 p.m.,

1021
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,870
and at 8 p.m., head to the doll house...

1022
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,230
to win the chance to stay alive.

1023
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,290
(Every 30 minutes, they will
be given the chance to stay alive.)

1024
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,830
Until 8 p.m., find the doll
that has your name inside.

1025
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,230
(Winning conditions for humans)

1026
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,140
Or find the cursed doll
and cut open its belly.

1027
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,140
(Winning conditions for humans)

1028
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,040
This is how you find
the dolls that belong to you.

1029
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,480
Find the envelopes
hidden within the school...

1030
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,480
and choose two of the dolls
from the photos inside.

1031
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,730
Write down your name or
the name of the one you suspect...

1032
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,080
and place it in the mailbox.

1033
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,120
At the doll theater,
you'll be able to see...

1034
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,830
if that person's doll is the right one.

1035
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,790
(Write down a name
along with photos of 2 dolls.)

1036
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,830
(Confirm your suspicions
at the doll theater.)

1037
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,810
(The second envelope he was given...)

1038
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:06,750
(has the photos of the dolls.)

1039
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,950
I'm supposed to choose two.

1040
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,540
(Confirm your suspicions
by choosing photos of two dolls.)

1041
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,410
I hope you find the cursed doll
and stay alive.

1042
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,120
Poor you.

1043
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,810
(Poor you.)

1044
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,080
(Horrified)

1045
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,730
Do not...

1046
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:22,930
trust anyone.

1047
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,770
(He yells in anger
at the sudden bloody tears.)

1048
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,330
That was scary.

1049
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,000
(That was so scary.)

1050
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,710
(One must secure his own doll
and find the cursed doll to win.)

1051
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,850
(Who could be the ghost
that lurks among them?)

1052
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:45,450
I bet the others first went that way.

1053
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:48,120
However, I'm getting
a vibe from this place.

1054
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,350
Wait. Here's a doll.

1055
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,250
(Behind it...)

1056
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,460
Why hasn't anyone...

1057
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,790
See? No one has been here.

1058
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,520
It's still here.

1059
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,230
Hold on.

1060
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,200
(He finds the photos of the dolls...)

1061
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,160
(that'll lead him to the rightful owners.)

1062
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,540
I'll check these later.

1063
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,930
They don't seem to be in the right order.

1064
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,540
(While Jong Kook finds the photos...)

1065
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,600
(Like Jae Suk,
Haha figures out the rules.)

1066
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,750
My gosh.

1067
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,270
This is kind of scary.

1068
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,520
(What's this sound?)

1069
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,410
(Rattle)

1070
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,480
What's this?

1071
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,460
(Startled)

1072
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,180
Hey!

1073
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,790
- Welcome.
- Why is the door locked?

1074
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,960
- This is odd.
- As a reward for finding me...

1075
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,600
(Detective Kook knows something is up.)

1076
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,730
Haha!

1077
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,960
- I will tell you...
- Who are you with?

1078
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,060
(What's that sound?)

1079
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,540
(Behind locked doors...)

1080
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,930
Write down your name...

1081
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,770
(Haha finds out the scary truth.)

1082
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:46,910
(What's scarier is Detective Kook
listening from the outside.)

1083
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,410
Okay, I heard everything.

1084
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,120
I heard it all.

1085
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,620
Now I know why these photos were there.

1086
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,060
(He figures out what the photos are for.)

1087
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,660
- Gosh.
- Come on out already.

1088
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,290
Why didn't you lower the volume?
I heard everything.

1089
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,100
I heard it all.

1090
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,460
The volume can't be turned down.

1091
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,620
(The volume can't be turned down.)

1092
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,660
- Why did you lock the door?
- What?

1093
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,100
- It's nice to share.
- I was scared.

1094
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,960
It's all the more reason
to have me with you.

1095
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,230
I mean...
I don't know what I just saw.

1096
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,410
Watch it yourself.

1097
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,980
- I heard everything.
- It's like I've been possessed.

1098
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,270
- Hey.
- I'm terrified right now.

1099
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,750
(Haha talks in circles
and avoids Jong Kook.)

1100
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,450
How will he...

1101
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:29,390
(What is this?
He's being suspicious.)

1102
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,080
Can anyone watch this?

1103
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,660
- The video.
- That?

1104
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,000
You have to fit the requirements, but...

1105
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,560
I told you I heard everything.
Don't try to hide things from me.

1106
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,520
- I'm not hiding anything.
- I'm going to cut that open.

1107
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,930
- What?
- I'm going to cut open your doll.

1108
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,000
Don't do that.

1109
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,370
It's really scary today.

1110
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,730
(Haha runs away as soon as possible
to escape Jong Kook's questions.)

1111
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,640
- Today, my...
- You're too weak for this mission.

1112
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,910
My brain is working really fast today.

1113
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,370
I think I can do something today.
Turn on the lights.

1114
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,980
I have good eyesight,
so I can see in the dark.

1115
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,540
You can't see anything in
this pitch black room.

1116
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,250
Hey.

1117
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,350
What?

1118
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,680
Stop kidding.

1119
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,480
You're acting.

1120
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,830
Did you think I'd fall?

1121
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,020
"Did you think I'd fall?"

1122
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,890
What does that even mean?

1123
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,290
Just pretend to understand it.
Accept it as it is.

1124
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,600
What does that mean?

1125
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,890
Just accept it.

1126
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,000
I mean,
"Did you think I'd fall for that?"

1127
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,770
Hey!

1128
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,210
- What?
- What's wrong with you?

1129
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,080
I didn't know you'd scream.

1130
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,480
(Laughing)

1131
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,580
I didn't know you'd keep going.

1132
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,350
(He's done teasing
and starts looking for hints.)

1133
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,390
You know something, don't you?

1134
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,580
Of course.

1135
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,020
You're going to win anyway.

1136
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,960
- Then I'll tell you something.
- Guys!

1137
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,180
- Then I'll tell you something.
- Guys!

1138
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,100
(Surprised)

1139
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,330
- My gosh!
- Goodness.

1140
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,870
Can you be quieter?

1141
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,060
- My gosh. You scared me.
- Gosh!

1142
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,290
You're usually so quiet.
What's with you today?

1143
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,600
- Why are you...
- Because...

1144
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,830
- you guys were whispering, so...
- You really surprised us.

1145
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,410
You scared me.

1146
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,770
There's something here. What is it?

1147
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,770
(Jong Kook knows all the rules...)

1148
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,100
Mine is important.

1149
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,640
Mine.

1150
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
(He plans to put in the photo
to find his doll.)

1151
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,750
Mine.

1152
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,080
Number two.

1153
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,250
Mine and...

1154
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,060
(The one Jong Kook has,
The one Suk Jin has)

1155
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,120
Okay.

1156
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:15,350
(He puts his name
on dolls number 2 and 4.)

1157
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,390
Finding mine is most important.

1158
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:20,890
Should I go to the doll theater?
I'm doing all sorts of things.

1159
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:22,060
(He can find out if one of these
is his at the doll theater.)

1160
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,700
Okay. Let's go.

1161
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,730
(He can find out if one of these
is his at the theater.)

1162
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,930
(So Min appears.)

1163
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,000
Jong Kook.

1164
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,500
Did you find any hints?

1165
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,680
- I found about two...
- No, I didn't.

1166
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,910
Did you go to the doll theater?

1167
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,000
No. I'm going to go now.

1168
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,270
That place is weird too. There are
dolls with our names on them.

1169
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,270
- Really?
- So I thought there might be a spy.

1170
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,910
There are dolls with our names on them?

1171
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:39,980
Yes.

1172
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,350
Let's go check it out.

1173
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,410
- The doll theater is leery.
- Here?

1174
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,250
- The doll theater is here.
- Okay.

1175
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,350
It's at the end? The left end?

1176
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,120
Here. Over here.

1177
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,350
- It's here?
- Over here.

1178
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,350
(So Min doesn't know anything yet.)

1179
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,960
I'm pretty sure there's
something here, but... What is this?

1180
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,600
- Why is Kim Jong Kook making an X?
- What's wrong?

1181
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,600
- What?
- Why is it holding up its hands?

1182
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,200
(Ji Suk Jin, Kim Jong Kook,
Haha, Song Ji Hyo)

1183
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,640
What is it? Do you know what this means?

1184
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,310
- It wasn't like this...
- So that's what it means...

1185
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,330
Okay. I get it.

1186
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,330
I have no idea what this is.

1187
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,600
I just knew where this was.

1188
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,140
What is it?

1189
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,250
Okay. We have to move quickly.

1190
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,310
I have to move fast.

1191
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,040
- I have to reduce the probability.
- What is it?

1192
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,080
- Okay.
- Why is yours an X?

1193
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,080
(So Min doesn't get what's going on.)

1194
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,120
- I should go over there.
- What's this? Are you leaving?

1195
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,660
(Haha knows the rule,
and he's looking for hints.)

1196
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,160
What are you doing?

1197
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,390
(Surprised)

1198
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,460
(After watching the video, he was
scared, but this made it worse.)

1199
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,000
What is it? What's wrong?

1200
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,390
Gosh, my neck.

1201
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,640
Everyone is scared
out of their minds right now.

1202
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,980
Okay.

1203
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,580
My gosh!

1204
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,770
Why are you so scared?

1205
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,080
I have something to tell you.

1206
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,040
- I found something.
- What is it?

1207
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,710
- A photo.
- Right.

1208
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,790
What do we do with it?
Did you find any hints?

1209
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,020
- Hold onto it,
- Hold onto it.

1210
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,060
and look at me. Maybe I should...

1211
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,850
just share everything I have with you.

1212
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:51,980
- Go ahead. What is it?
- Come with me.

1213
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,730
Come with me.

1214
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,430
(He can't make progress alone, so he
takes Se Chan to the video room.)

1215
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,020
Do you see my goosebumps?

1216
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,430
What is this? What's wrong?

1217
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,270
- I'm not lying...
- Did you find something?

1218
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,870
(He makes a fuss as he shares the video.)

1219
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,830
I'll share it with him because
I think he's going to die early.

1220
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:07,100
You think I'm going to die early?

1221
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,480
Close the door.

1222
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,480
(Se Chan finds out the truth
through the video.)

1223
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,080
Jae Suk.
Can you share a hint with me?

1224
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,140
Right. Can you tell us something?

1225
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,540
Did you find that?

1226
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:21,640
- This is...
- Let me see it.

1227
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,960
(Like Haha, Jae Suk decides that
this is too hard to do alone.)

1228
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,680
- What is that?
- Did you watch the video?

1229
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,890
(He shares it with Ji Hyo and Suk Jin.)

1230
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,290
- The two of you can go watch it.
- Let's go watch it.

1231
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,790
Where do we have to go?

1232
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:32,330
Do you remember the room I was in?

1233
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:33,520
- Go watch it.
- Let's go.

1234
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,560
Hurry.

1235
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,770
(They find out everything
thanks to Jae Suk's help.)

1236
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:37,830
- We can write two at a time, right?
- Yes.

1237
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:39,600
I'll write 4 and 5.

1238
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,410
We must write the name of the person
we want to find out, right?

1239
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,980
(Haha uses the photos he got earlier now.)

1240
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,000
The person who's been acting weird.

1241
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,980
(Ji Suk Jin)

1242
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,120
(Ji Suk Jin?)

1243
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:54,250
Numbers 4 and 5.

1244
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,560
(Haha wrote Ji Suk Jin down
for numbers 4 and 5.)

1245
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,290
I just have a hunch.

1246
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,680
Which one is mine?

1247
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,430
(If Suk Jin's the ghost, the number
of his doll is important.)

1248
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:07,430
(Ji Suk Jin)

1249
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,060
(What is the result?)

1250
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,830
(Suk Jin's doll isn't 4 or 5.)

1251
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,430
(Sighing)

1252
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,140
I need to watch what I say.

1253
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:23,980
Okay.

1254
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,180
(Ji Hyo begins searching
after watching the video.)

1255
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,160
(Is there something inside these dolls?)

1256
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,710
(Beep!)

1257
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,790
So Hee hasn't been getting along
with her homeroom teacher.

1258
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:37,350
That teacher has a brother.

1259
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,830
"That teacher has a brother?"

1260
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:44,290
(She found out there's
a voice message hint by chance.)

1261
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:46,830
(It's a message that seems to be
pointing at someone.)

1262
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,640
(Jae Suk is searching another room.)

1263
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,710
My gosh.

1264
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,710
So Hee was jealous of the student
in first place,

1265
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:54,080
and their birthday was
in the spring or summer.

1266
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,120
But So Hee forgot,
so they got into a fight.

1267
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,910
So Hee was jealous of the student
in first place...

1268
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:03,850
(It seems to be about Kim So Hee,
the artist he saw during the day.)

1269
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,390
(Jae Suk looks nervous.)

1270
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,020
(He hurries to the mailbox.)

1271
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,790
- I can try it right now, right?
- Yes.

1272
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,370
I need to find mine first.

1273
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:18,770
(Despite the unusual situation,
he decides to find his doll first.)

1274
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,060
Numbers 1 and 3.

1275
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,870
(Jae Suk writes his name down
for 1 and 3.)

1276
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:25,770
I'm going to find out if
one of these is mine.

1277
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,710
- Where do I need to go?
- The first floor...

1278
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:31,910
Okay.

1279
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:33,180
(He can find out the results
in the doll theater.)

1280
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,660
Gosh, this is scary.

1281
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,710
This is really scary.

1282
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:38,980
(What are the results?)

1283
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,060
What?

1284
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,020
What is this?

1285
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,230
What is this?

1286
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,890
(The doll is making a circle.)

1287
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,540
(That means Jae Suk's doll is
number 1 or 3.)

1288
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,100
So my doll is either number 1 or 3?

1289
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,140
- Did you put it in?
- What?

1290
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,640
- Did you put yours in?
- Yes.

1291
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,710
I put two in,

1292
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,480
and the doll with my name was
making a circle.

1293
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,580
- Really?
- I put in 1 and 3.

1294
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,140
That means number 1 or 3 is yours.

1295
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,310
My doll is either number 1 or 3.

1296
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,310
- Right.
- It's 1 or 3.

1297
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:07,750
It's either that doll or this doll.

1298
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,180
- Right. You're right.
- One of these is mine.

1299
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,520
- You guessed well.
- I did, didn't I?

1300
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,910
- It worked out perfectly.
- Yes.

1301
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:12,930
(As a result, the probability of
finding Jae Suk's doll got higher.)

1302
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,350
I wonder where mine is.

1303
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:15,500
(But they haven't found the real
owners of the other dolls.)

1304
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,560
The first judgment stand
is about to start.

1305
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:20,160
Please gather in the doll house.

1306
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,890
(The doll house judgment stand they
heard about in the video is open.)

1307
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,140
- It's on the second floor.
- Wait for me.

1308
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,870
- Okay.
- I'm scared.

1309
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,140
Isn't this place scary?

1310
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,830
Want to trade with me?

1311
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,270
- Okay. We can trade.
- Okay.

1312
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,350
Why am I the only one in the dark?

1313
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:40,040
There's something here.

1314
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:41,950
Where is it?

1315
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:43,850
Where's the judgment stand?

1316
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,620
(The 1st judgment stand has opened.)

1317
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,850
There is one ghost. Who is it?

1318
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,100
(The 1st judgment stand has opened.)

1319
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:53,770
What is this?

1320
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:55,370
Oh, my.

1321
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:59,430
- What is this?
- What's that doll? Is that Chucky?

1322
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,230
(They walk towards it as if possessed.)

1323
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:05,580
- What is this?
- What is that?

1324
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,810
What is this?

1325
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:09,750
(The doll display cabinet
is completely empty.)

1326
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,810
- What is this?
- What is it?

1327
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,450
What is that?

1328
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,210
This is incredible.

1329
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:17,390
So this is the story?

1330
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,390
Suk Jin's reaction was weird.

1331
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,980
I agree.
He's been like that from the start.

1332
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,390
- What is it?
- Right.

1333
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,830
"So this is the story?"

1334
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:25,200
The video was so scary.

1335
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,200
So Min.

1336
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,200
(Surprised)

1337
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,870
(Laughing)

1338
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:33,660
(They suddenly hear someone laughing.)

1339
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,730
I guess you want to avoid being cursed.

1340
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,080
Then you came to the right place.

1341
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,950
Welcome to the doll house,

1342
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,580
the only place you can avoid being cursed.

1343
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:45,810
(The place where you avoid
the curse, the doll house)

1344
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:49,350
There are three judgments
to avoid the curse.

1345
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,120
You must succeed before
the last judgment...

1346
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,020
that will be held at 8 p.m.

1347
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,100
This is driving me crazy.

1348
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,000
What happens if you fail?

1349
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,520
(What happens if you fail?)

1350
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,870
The six humans will receive
a horrible penalty...

1351
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:06,460
due to the doll's curse.

1352
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:11,270
I'll give you your first chance now.

1353
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:15,310
The three people who are sure
which dolls are theirs...

1354
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:18,750
can place them on the top floor
with their names on them.

1355
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:22,890
Then put the remaining four dolls
on the lower floor.

1356
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,180
Once you close the door,
the judgment will start.

1357
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,460
If the three dolls found
their rightful owners,

1358
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:32,390
the humans will win right away.

1359
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,460
- All three must be correct.
- However,

1360
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,390
if even one of them is wrong,

1361
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,040
you would have foolishly lost your chance.

1362
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,040
Okay.

1363
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:44,210
Okay. Put in your dolls right now.

1364
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:47,080
The game will start now.

1365
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:49,250
Let's start the first game.

1366
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:50,680
- Is that yours?
- It's not that...

1367
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,250
Yours is either 1 or 3,

1368
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,790
- Right.
- so you can put yours in.

1369
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,390
- But it's number four.
- I'll put mine in.

1370
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:57,250
Yours is one of these, so put it in.

1371
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,750
Yours is either 1 or 3.

1372
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,120
(He puts number 3, the doll he was
holding, on the judgment stand.)

1373
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,160
Next...

1374
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,890
- Did anyone put my name in?
- I didn't put yours in.

1375
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:06,200
- Then why was there an X?
- Why was yours an X?

1376
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,730
I put in my name for these two.

1377
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,230
- Which numbers?
- These two.

1378
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:12,660
I got rid of two from
the list of possibilities.

1379
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,430
So mine is among the remaining ones.

1380
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:15,870
We have to guess for this round.

1381
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:17,000
- We do.
- Put it in.

1382
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:19,350
- This one's scary.
- Go with number one.

1383
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,770
- Number one?
- We won't get it right. Put it in.

1384
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:22,040
We won't get it right. Just guess.

1385
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:24,450
Both numbers 1 and 3 belong...

1386
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:25,640
to Jae Suk anyway.

1387
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,210
That's right. Number one probably
belongs to Jae Suk...

1388
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:28,310
Let's choose number seven then.

1389
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:29,660
- That's right.
- Let's choose between 6 or 7.

1390
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,750
Do you want to try So Min's doll?

1391
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,460
- I like pink.
- Choose pink then.

1392
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,620
- Pink?
- The pink doll might be right.

1393
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,500
Se Chan, didn't you try my doll?

1394
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,500
No, I didn't.
What number is your doll?

1395
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,620
Me?

1396
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,370
This one probably isn't it.

1397
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,870
- It's not my doll?
- It's not.

1398
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:46,540
- Why?
- I'll tell you later.

1399
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,310
Are you going to tell me later?
Wait, this isn't it.

1400
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:50,230
- Try this. Try number seven.
- He thinks this isn't it.

1401
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,810
- Haha can't tell us anything,
- Let's just try putting this in.

1402
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:52,810
but he thinks this isn't it.

1403
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:54,350
- But seriously, are you...
- Wait a minute!

1404
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:55,350
- Why is he doing this to me?
- You're lying, aren't you?

1405
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,710
- I might be lying.
- Wait a minute.

1406
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:57,850
Hey, he might be lying.

1407
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,850
I might be lying, but trust me.

1408
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,290
- For about 4 or 5 times, he...
- He told me quietly.

1409
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:02,390
"Jong Kook,
I don't think it's number six."

1410
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:04,060
Ask me in the next game.

1411
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,850
- The ghost...
- Yes.

1412
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:08,060
- that's in here...
- He just wrote it down.

1413
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,960
will surely try to confuse us.

1414
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,250
That's right.

1415
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,830
- We need to find the doll.
- I think it's my doll.

1416
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:16,870
Let's put it in.

1417
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:22,140
(But Haha already checked
Suk Jin's doll.)

1418
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:27,310
(Haha was suspicious of Suk Jin
and wrote his name for 4 and 5.)

1419
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:29,000
(Suk Jin's doll wasn't among...)

1420
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,540
(doll number 4 and doll number 5.)

1421
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:36,480
(Even after checking that,)

1422
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:39,830
(he didn't say anything.)

1423
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:40,930
- Suk Jin, put it in.
- Hey.

1424
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:42,960
- One person should put it in.
- Let Suk Jin put it in.

1425
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,830
- Will you put it in?
- But this is...

1426
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,120
- You will get an "X."
- The odds are against us right now.

1427
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,830
Realistically, it is difficult.

1428
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:50,460
We can't get it on the first try, right?

1429
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,960
If Suk Jin is right,

1430
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,730
- Haha is strange.
- his doll will be the answer.

1431
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:57,230
- That's right.
- But all three of them must be...

1432
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,540
- right for us to know it's right.
- That's right.

1433
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,810
They won't tell us
whether each one is right or not.

1434
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:02,310
They won't tell us one by one, right?

1435
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:03,350
Actually, this is...

1436
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:04,850
Have you made your choice?

1437
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:05,850
- Yes.
- Yes.

1438
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:09,120
I hope everyone won't regret this choice.

1439
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,060
We will start judging now.

1440
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,850
What will happen?

1441
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:19,660
To be honest, the odds are very low.

1442
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,120
Yes, very low.

1443
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:25,230
(Will there be another plot twist?)

1444
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:29,100
Okay, the judging has ended.

1445
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,230
Let's see what the result is.

1446
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:33,540
- It must be wrong.
- Jae Suk.

1447
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:36,540
Open the door immediately
and check the result.

1448
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,640
- Take a look.
- It's definitely wrong.

1449
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,870
Could it be right?

1450
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:42,310
(What's the result of their first choice?)

1451
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:45,390
That's right.

1452
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,750
- Here.
- That surprised me!

1453
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,520
- We failed.
- It's wrong.

1454
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,930
- It's wrong.
- That's right then.

1455
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,230
- We can't do much now.
- They won't tell us how many dolls.

1456
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:56,140
Kim Jong Kook, out.

1457
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,290
- He's out?
- He's out?

1458
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:00,810
(Why is Jong Kook suddenly out?)

1459
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,370
- Why?
- Why?

1460
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:03,830
- Doll number five is broken.
- What is happening?

1461
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,370
- It was Jong Kook's doll.
- Why?

1462
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,750
- Did someone do it?
- Why?

1463
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,910
- Where did doll number five go?
- Doll number five got broken.

1464
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,810
- Think about it.
- Someone did it.

1465
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,640
- Why?
- My doll was number five.

1466
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,710
Hurry up and think!

1467
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,120
- Why is Kim Jong Kook out?
- Why is he out?

1468
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,660
- Hurry up and think!
- Am I out?

1469
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:21,160
Wait. No!

1470
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,230
(They failed the first judgment.)

1471
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:24,790
- Were you surprised to see...
- Who cut up the belly of the doll?

1472
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:25,790
the ripped doll?

1473
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:26,960
The ghost did this then.

1474
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,660
Whenever you fail each judgment,

1475
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:33,230
someone's doll designated by
the ghost will be torn to pieces.

1476
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:34,710
So if we get it wrong...

1477
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:36,910
If you don't want to be eliminated,

1478
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:41,310
choose very carefully from now on.

1479
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,870
Jong Kook's doll was doll number five.

1480
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,540
I found all of them out.
I know the numbers now.

1481
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:46,080
If we go there, we will know the answer.

1482
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,290
- Yang Se Chan.
- Yes?

1483
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,310
- You're acting strange.
- Se Chan is acting kind of strange.

1484
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,060
- Come here.
- This is driving me insane.

1485
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,660
- Tell me.
- It's not Se Chan.

1486
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,250
- I'm telling the truth.
- Both of you are acting strange.

1487
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,330
- They're really acting strange.
- Haha is acting strange.

1488
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:58,020
- Haha.
- No, both of you are.

1489
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,770
- It's either one of them.
- Okay.

1490
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,930
- Okay, way to corner people.
- Both of them are acting strange.

1491
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,790
- Eliminating Jong Kook...
- Yes?

1492
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,700
means that this person is weak.
The ghost, I mean.

1493
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,710
- That's right.
- Yes.

1494
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,910
But everyone is weak except Jong Kook.

1495
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,080
- Isn't that right?
- That's right.

1496
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,080
So the ghost is among the six of us.

1497
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,450
That's obvious.

1498
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,480
- You sold Jong Kook out.
- Hey.

1499
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,710
- That's obvious.
- I explained it to you.

1500
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:20,310
If you don't have any hints,

1501
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:21,450
it will be no use now.

1502
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:22,660
- Let's go. Spread out.
- Yes.

1503
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,660
We don't have time.

1504
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,080
- Dolls number 6 and 7...
- We don't have time.

1505
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,730
Jae Suk,
I should find your doll, right?

1506
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:30,020
- Make sure you find mine.
- Your odds will become higher...

1507
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,100
- that way.
- Make sure you find mine.

1508
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,230
I should find your doll, right?

1509
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:35,020
- Haha, isn't that right?
- It's not doll number 5 or 6.

1510
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,930
I have a bad feeling about today.

1511
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,100
I think we should definitely
put in doll numbers 6 and 1.

1512
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,230
Sure, put those two in then.

1513
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:45,000
If I do and I get an "O,"

1514
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,600
Jae Suk's doll will definitely be
doll number one.

1515
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,500
- It definitely will be.
- That's right.

1516
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,870
Jae Suk's doll will probably be
doll number one.

1517
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,790
Your doll and mine won't be number one.

1518
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:54,950
That's not right. We don't know yet.

1519
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:56,960
What if I put in numbers 6 and 1
and it says I'm wrong?

1520
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,020
This is right. Just go.

1521
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,080
Are you the ghost?

1522
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,390
Just go.

1523
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,960
- Are you the ghost?
- Why are you suddenly suspicious?

1524
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,230
You keep confusing me.

1525
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:07,770
It's strange that you showed me
the video over there.

1526
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,930
You're not the ghost, are you?
Please make it clear.

1527
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,560
- What do you mean?
- Gosh.

1528
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,640
You're joking. I'm going to
put in doll numbers 6 and 1.

1529
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,230
- Okay, numbers 6 and 1.
- Jae Suk for 6 and 1.

1530
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,910
After that, let's have a meeting
and put in my numbers.

1531
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:20,910
Here.

1532
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,020
Let's go.

1533
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,020
(The two of them head
to the doll theater.)

1534
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,250
(If they get an "O,"
Jae Suk will be doll number 1.)

1535
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:33,480
(If they get an "X,"
Jae Suk will be doll number 3.)

1536
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,160
We will get an "O."

1537
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,120
- Isn't it right?
- It's an "O."

1538
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,160
See?

1539
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,370
(The doll is making an "O" sign.)

1540
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:43,500
(They're sure
which doll is Jae Suk's now.)

1541
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,560
Jae Suk.

1542
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,160
Jae Suk.

1543
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,270
(Jae Suk's doll is definitely
doll number 1.)

1544
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,330
I'm scared.

1545
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:51,330
(He's looking for hints,
not knowing they found his doll.)

1546
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,210
I told you.

1547
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:55,540
Why are you getting angry?

1548
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,620
So Hee was jealous of
the top student in school.

1549
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:02,140
I don't think the top student
will run a personal video channel...

1550
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,660
even if it becomes popular.

1551
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:09,460
(Not running a personal video
channel means that...)

1552
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,750
It's either Ji Hyo, So Min, or me.

1553
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,830
(It's either Ji Hyo, So Min, or me.)

1554
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,870
(What?)

1555
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,060
I got goosebumps.

1556
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,960
(With this single hint,)

1557
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,540
(the possibilities get narrowed down
by a lot.)

1558
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,210
(Besides those who have YouTube channels,)

1559
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:26,410
(who's left out of these 7?)

1560
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,450
(Jae Suk, So Min, Ji Hyo)

1561
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:32,810
(Are one of these three the ghost?)

1562
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,180
- Gosh!
- Why?

1563
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,020
(He runs quickly because it seems
like Jae Suk found something out.)

1564
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,960
- Where are you?
- Jae Suk, where are you?

1565
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,390
No, it's nothing.

1566
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:42,330
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

1567
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,750
Where is Jae Suk?

1568
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:47,100
(Quiet)

1569
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,120
Jae Suk...

1570
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:50,270
Jae Suk, what is it?

1571
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,870
It's nothing.

1572
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,060
I need to find my doll.

1573
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,100
I don't understand the rules right now.

1574
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,330
(Fortunately, Ji Hyo went on her way
without being suspicious.)

1575
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:00,580
Let's find the envelopes first.

1576
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:06,250
(According to his hint,
one of these three is the ghost.)

1577
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:07,640
- Let's see what you found.
- Gosh.

1578
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,210
- Why?
- People get surprised...

1579
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:10,660
whenever I say, "What are you doing?"

1580
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,430
That's not it. I have many hints,
but I don't have any photos.

1581
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,750
- We don't have any photos.
- Tell me then.

1582
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:16,020
- Haha.
- Gather around.

1583
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,500
I have so many hints,
but I don't have any photos.

1584
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,960
- What kind of hints do you have?
- Let's have a meeting together.

1585
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,270
I also have two hints.

1586
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,520
Let me see.

1587
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,460
The ghost is doll number one.

1588
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:25,430
- What?
- The ghost is doll number one.

1589
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:27,560
- What?
- What did you say?

1590
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,640
The ghost is doll number one.

1591
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,830
That's not true.
The hints aren't like that.

1592
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:32,140
- No, they're like that.
- The ghost is doll number one?

1593
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,910
No way, he's acting strange.

1594
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:35,480
(It must be different
from what So Min had heard.)

1595
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,580
- I'm not going to talk to him.
- It's doll number one.

1596
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,140
- I'm not going to talk to you.
- What are your hints?

1597
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:40,310
- Are you doll number one?
- The hints aren't like that.

1598
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:41,310
You're doll number one.

1599
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,310
- The hints aren't like that.
- You're doll number one, right?

1600
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,790
Doll number one?

1601
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,480
Number one?
The ghost is doll number one.

1602
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,730
- The hints aren't like that.
- They are.

1603
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:53,600
They're described in detail.
I know because I tried it.

1604
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,660
Yes, so did I.

1605
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,560
They aren't like that.
They're like "So Hee's something..."

1606
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,230
- I know another one.
- The hints aren't like that.

1607
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:00,930
(The hints aren't like that?)

1608
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:03,710
Why are you running away
as soon as I said that?

1609
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:07,770
I think I know who it is.

1610
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:08,850
Who is it?

1611
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,350
Don't you think it's Jae Suk?

1612
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:11,950
I think it's either Jae Suk or Ji Hyo.

1613
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:12,950
Yes, it's either one of them.

1614
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,250
They kept driving us into a corner.

1615
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,310
What about So Hee's boyfriend?

1616
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,960
He likes soccer.

1617
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,060
- So Hee's boyfriend likes soccer?
- Yes.

1618
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:23,930
(So Hee had a boyfriend?)

1619
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,330
(So Hee has a boyfriend.)

1620
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:30,660
(Recently, their relationship went sour.)

1621
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:36,330
(The first hint So Min found was
a hint about So Hee's boyfriend.)

1622
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,040
(So Hee's best friend...)

1623
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,810
(had a hard time trying to please
So Hee who is very sensitive.)

1624
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:45,120
(Soon after that, she found a hint
about So Hee's best friend.)

1625
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:52,350
(Jae Suk's hint was about a friend
who is the top student in school.)

1626
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:56,830
(Boyfriend, best friend,
a friend who is the top student)

1627
00:58:56,830 --> 00:59:03,160
(All of the hints weren't pointing
to one person.)

1628
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,930
I don't know what the connection is.

1629
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:07,810
What's the connection
between her boyfriend, friend,

1630
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,310
- and the friend she was jealous of.
- What?

1631
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,910
What's the connection
between the people around So Hee?

1632
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,370
So Hee has a boyfriend.

1633
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:19,120
Her boyfriend really likes soccer,
so she didn't like the fact...

1634
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:22,180
that he didn't spend time with her
during lunch.

1635
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,350
A boyfriend?

1636
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:25,850
(A boyfriend who likes soccer?)

1637
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:27,930
(Jae Suk is also confused
by the appearance of a new person.)

1638
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:30,430
I thought it was either Ji Hyo or So Min.

1639
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:31,460
(Jae Suk is also confused
by the appearance of a new person.)

1640
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:36,540
So Hee had a very bad relationship
with her homeroom teacher.

1641
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:40,640
That homeroom teacher wears glasses
and he's quite conservative.

1642
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,560
(Homeroom teacher?)

1643
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,830
Take a look now.

1644
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,140
Homeroom teacher, best friend,

1645
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:50,680
boyfriend, and the friend who is
always the top student in school.

1646
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:54,580
Did someone among these four kill So Hee?

1647
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:59,460
(Among these people, they must find
the ghost who killed So Hee.)

1648
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:05,730
(Each of these people is
one of So Hee's acquaintances.)

1649
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:09,600
(The ghost is among them!)

1650
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,770
(They gather around to share
the hints they each found.)

1651
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:13,140
- You're gathering hints, right?
- You startled me.

1652
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,230
- I think it's Haha.
- Jae Suk.

1653
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:16,600
- Come here.
- I think it's Haha.

1654
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:19,750
Right now, people are...
The ghost is right here.

1655
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,040
- There's a ghost here.
- The ghost is right here.

1656
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,120
- A ghost is definitely here.
- Yes, definitely. Who is it?

1657
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,950
According to the hint I found...

1658
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,910
and the information I gathered,

1659
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:31,250
I think the ghost is
either So Min or Ji Hyo.

1660
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,560
It could also be Suk Jin or Jae Suk.

1661
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,580
Me?

1662
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,350
- That's what I got.
- I have no idea.

1663
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:38,830
Does anyone have a photo envelope?

1664
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:40,520
- No.
- No one has it, right?

1665
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,620
Then let's cut one open.

1666
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:43,040
- Here?
- Yes.

1667
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,660
- What?
- A doll?

1668
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,770
- Let's cut one open.
- It's not a bad idea.

1669
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:49,730
We can exclude the dolls
we are certain about.

1670
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,040
- Shall we cut that doll open?
- I want to cut that doll open.

1671
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,080
- Good idea.
- That doll.

1672
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,080
Why this one?

1673
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,580
Are you nervous because you are the ghost?

1674
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,450
- No, I'm not the ghost.
- Then it shouldn't be a problem.

1675
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,080
My name might be inside.

1676
01:00:58,210 --> 01:00:59,210
Then it can't be helped.

1677
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:01,640
(Haha doesn't want to cut open his doll.)

1678
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,960
My name might be inside.

1679
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,750
I am suspicious about one doll.

1680
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:08,830
I want to cut open doll number one.

1681
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,890
(Don't they know for sure
that doll number 1 is Jae Suk?)

1682
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:13,560
- No.
- Then I will be eliminated.

1683
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,060
It needs to be 1 of the 3 dolls
in the judgment stand.

1684
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,390
- You punk.
- All right.

1685
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:18,540
- You are suspicious.
- All right.

1686
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,560
You are of no help to us humans.

1687
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,930
- Shall I cut mine open?
- Go ahead.

1688
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:24,270
(Haha gets cornered
in his attempt to corner Jae Suk.)

1689
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:26,950
- Cut it open.
- The judgment stand has opened.

1690
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:28,600
Isn't the timing so suspicious?

1691
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:30,520
The judgment stand has opened.

1692
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,910
- Isn't the timing so suspicious?
- It's suspicious.

1693
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:34,250
(The 2nd judgment stand opens
when Haha gets cornered.)

1694
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:35,810
- It's suspicious.
- I told you that it isn't me.

1695
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:38,160
- It's suspicious.
- It's not me.

1696
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:40,750
The judgment stand opened
when we tried to cut his doll open.

1697
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:41,980
You are framing me.

1698
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,390
Since the judgment stand opened,
someone will get eliminated.

1699
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:45,460
(They need to put 3 dolls
in the judgment stand.)

1700
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,770
- My doll goes in no matter what.
- That's right.

1701
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,830
- How about Suk Jin's?
- Let's put mine in as well.

1702
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:51,200
All right.

1703
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:53,730
My doll is the only one we are sure about.

1704
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:55,040
(Number 1, Jae Suk's doll,
goes into the judgment stand.)

1705
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,140
I will try this one.

1706
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,930
I know it's among numbers 2, 3, 6, and 7.

1707
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,540
Choose among numbers 2, 3, 6, and 7.

1708
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,500
(Number 1, Jae Suk)

1709
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,640
(Number 7, Suk Jin)

1710
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,250
Let's say...

1711
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,680
- Haha, which doll is yours?
- This is scary.

1712
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:07,710
Number three?

1713
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:08,910
Let's put in Haha's doll.

1714
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,480
- Okay.
- Put in number three.

1715
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,620
(Haha's doll goes
into the judgment stand as well.)

1716
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:14,480
- Okay.
- Put in number three.

1717
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,350
Other dolls go in the bottom.

1718
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:19,520
Haha, Suk Jin, and I put in our dolls.

1719
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:22,100
(Number 1 belongs to Jae Suk.)

1720
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,600
If we think about...

1721
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,960
- the probability...
- Someone will die.

1722
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,430
That's right.
But I doubt you will die.

1723
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:28,430
It will be a disaster if Jae Suk dies.

1724
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:30,180
- Number one is Jae Suk's doll.
- I think Jae Suk will die.

1725
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,330
I think Jae Suk will die.

1726
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,910
- He knows so much.
- You know,

1727
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,640
there must be rules
behind the elimination process.

1728
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,810
- They won't just kill anyone.
- The ghost decided on the order.

1729
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:40,040
(The ghost decided on the order.)

1730
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:41,910
Have you made your choice?

1731
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:43,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

1732
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,850
I hope everyone won't regret this choice.

1733
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:47,850
(I hope everyone won't regret
this choice.)

1734
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:51,430
We will start judging now.

1735
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:53,120
- This is so scary.
- I know.

1736
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:54,460
This is so scary.

1737
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:56,430
(If all 3 dolls have the rightful owners,)

1738
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:58,040
(the humans will win.)

1739
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:01,040
(The ghost must be watching anxiously.)

1740
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,410
Okay, the judging has ended.

1741
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,750
Let's see what the result is.

1742
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,080
- Someone got eliminated.
- Please.

1743
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,480
Open the door immediately
and check the result.

1744
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,750
(Did the three of them choose
the right doll?)

1745
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:25,150
Who is it? Who died?

1746
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:26,250
Which doll is on the floor?

1747
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:28,000
(They failed.)

1748
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,090
Which doll is on the floor?

1749
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:34,090
Yoo Jae Suk, out.

1750
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,960
- Yoo Jae Suk, out.
- See? Jae Suk died.

1751
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,730
See?

1752
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,800
I told you that number one is Jae Suk.

1753
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,250
- The ghost is someone weak.
- I knew it.

1754
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:44,250
The ghost is someone weak.

1755
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,520
This happened because I know the most.

1756
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,380
This happened because I know the most.

1757
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:48,920
- Right now...
- Hey.

1758
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,590
- Find the ghost no matter what.
- Okay.

1759
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:51,690
Do it for the humans.

1760
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:54,820
- Only the weak ones remain.
- The ghost must be someone weak.

1761
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,550
You wasted your second chance as well.

1762
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:00,150
You must be quite stupid.

1763
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,170
The last judgment remains,

1764
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:04,520
so please take caution.

1765
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,690
(There is 1 judgment
and 5 dolls remaining.)

1766
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:10,500
(There are 4 normal dolls
and 1 cursed doll.)

1767
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:15,130
(The humans are at a disadvantage
since the Grand Award Duo is out.)

1768
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:16,610
- It's Haha.
- Find the ghost no matter what.

1769
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:17,800
Okay.

1770
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,250
- Do it for the humans.
- Only the weak ones remain.

1771
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,150
The ghost must be someone weak.

1772
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:24,650
Jong Kook and Jae Suk are out.

1773
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:27,290
(Haha is suspected of being the ghost.)

1774
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,480
Me?

1775
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,550
Let's cut a doll open.

1776
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:31,860
Let's do it.

1777
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,550
- I can't believe Haha.
- Come on.

1778
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:35,020
- Let's cut a doll open!
- Do it.

1779
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,000
Let's play rock-paper-scissors
and cut the loser's doll open.

1780
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,400
- Cut your doll open.
- It might contain your name,

1781
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,840
not mine.

1782
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,070
This doll might not belong to Haha.

1783
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:43,730
- It might belong to you.
- Cut it open.

1784
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:45,440
- I am okay.
- It should be okay with you.

1785
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,130
Really? Then I will cut it open.

1786
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:49,270
- A human might die.
- It might not belong to you.

1787
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:50,500
Let's cut it open.

1788
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,250
- Let's cut number three open.
- You didn't trust me.

1789
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:55,210
You cornered me until the end.

1790
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:56,290
Come here.

1791
01:04:56,290 --> 01:04:57,820
- Cut it open.
- Let's do it.

1792
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:59,750
- We have no choice.
- Really?

1793
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:01,710
- I am sorry.
- I can't watch it.

1794
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:04,520
If this doll belongs to the ghost,
the humans will win.

1795
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,690
(If number 3 belongs to the ghost,
the humans will win.)

1796
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:09,500
- It's out.
- Really? Whose name is it?

1797
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,770
(Does number 3 contain
the ghost's name tag?)

1798
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:13,040
If this doll belongs to the ghost,
the humans will win.

1799
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,340
(Does number 3 contain
the ghost's name tag?)

1800
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:16,400
- It's out.
- Really? Whose name is it?

1801
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,070
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

1802
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,440
(The name tag belongs to Suk Jin.)

1803
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,540
(Me?)

1804
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:22,750
That's so funny.

1805
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:25,820
Suk Jin, I am sorry.

1806
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:29,150
Ji Suk Jin, out.

1807
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:35,320
(The announcement
drives a nail in his coffin.)

1808
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,650
(Suk Jin eliminated himself.)

1809
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:38,800
That's so funny.

1810
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,250
- I cut myself open.
- This is ridiculous.

1811
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,550
I cut myself open.

1812
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:42,960
(Suk Jin Scissorhands is devastated.)

1813
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,940
How did this happen to us?

1814
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:48,540
- Here it is.
- Give us the doll.

1815
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,860
- Hey!
- Throw it.

1816
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,360
I sacrificed myself,

1817
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:52,940
so hurry up and find the ghost!

1818
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:55,440
He picked up the scissors and cut open...

1819
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,750
his own doll.

1820
01:05:58,070 --> 01:05:59,210
- For goodness' sake.
- What?

1821
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:00,880
Did you cut a doll open?

1822
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,690
The doll I cut open happened to be mine.

1823
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:04,380
- It was number three, right?
- Yes.

1824
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,690
I cut number three open.

1825
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:08,050
- Suk Jin.
- I did it with scissors.

1826
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:11,750
The older ones got eliminated.

1827
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,590
- You are right.
- Are they having a party...

1828
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:15,820
- without us?
- Seriously.

1829
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:17,520
- They are by themselves.
- The older ones.

1830
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:23,040
(Only 4 dolls remain.)

1831
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:24,710
I have an idea.

1832
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:26,570
The ghost is among us, right?

1833
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,130
Come on.

1834
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:29,550
You're the ghost.

1835
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:31,570
- It has to be Haha.
- I think you are the ghost.

1836
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:32,610
This is insane.

1837
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:35,110
We just need to find our dolls.
Let's find our dolls.

1838
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:38,250
We will win if we find our dolls
and put them in the judgment stand.

1839
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,480
They made the decision without me.

1840
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,920
- Se Chan.
- Haha.

1841
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,860
- Let's look for them.
- I am sorry, Haha.

1842
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,320
- Give us proof if you are human.
- Come here.

1843
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,420
Come here!

1844
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:47,650
(Who is the ghost that killed So Hee
and cursed a doll?)

1845
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,770
How is it that I didn't find
a single photo envelope?

1846
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:51,460
(The members disperse
in search of a photo envelope.)

1847
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:54,940
(Surprised)

1848
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,070
(For the first time,)

1849
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:57,300
I found it.

1850
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,710
(Ji Hyo found a photo envelope.)

1851
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:00,540
(Among numbers 2, 4, 6, and 7
is Ji Hyo's doll.)

1852
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:03,050
Numbers 4 and 6.

1853
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:08,250
(She chose numbers 4 and 6.)

1854
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,440
(Is Ji Hyo's doll among numbers 4 or 6?)

1855
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,590
What?

1856
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,020
(The doll's answer is "O.")

1857
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:15,860
Either number 4 or 6 is...

1858
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,750
my doll.

1859
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,500
(Either number 4 or 6 is Ji Hyo's doll.)

1860
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:24,500
Se Chan, I wish I could find
a photo envelope.

1861
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:26,230
I just can't find it.

1862
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,770
Both Ji Hyo and I
haven't been able to check...

1863
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:29,360
since we never found any.

1864
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,860
Do you know about anyone else's doll...

1865
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,300
- other than Jae Suk's?
- No.

1866
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:34,730
Do you have any idea
which doll might be yours?

1867
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:37,050
(So Min keeps fishing for information.)

1868
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:39,210
But the current situation...

1869
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:40,710
(Ji Hyo doesn't make an effort
to share information.)

1870
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:43,380
(She is searching fearlessly on her own.)

1871
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,380
(She goes through the documents
in the principal's office.)

1872
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:48,360
I used to be really good at finding hints.

1873
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,790
(She complains that she can't seem
to find hints.)

1874
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:52,050
These days, my skills...

1875
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:55,460
My skills...

1876
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:56,920
(She found something.)

1877
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,090
What is this?

1878
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:01,540
"The list of award winners
in Running High School?"

1879
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,570
(The list of award winners
in Running High School)

1880
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:11,840
(It's a list of award winners
in Running High School.)

1881
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,520
(The record shows students
who won an award from 2000 to 2005.)

1882
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,650
Third place.

1883
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,210
Participation award.

1884
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:21,090
(She looks for information
that could offer a hint.)

1885
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:23,630
Kim So Hee?

1886
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:26,860
(Kim So Hee is on the list.)

1887
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,730
(She found a record of Kim So Hee.)

1888
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:32,770
(What secret is hidden here?)

1889
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:34,860
I am scared.

1890
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:38,340
(To find a hint,
Haha came to the doll club room.)

1891
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:42,550
(He searches the club room.)

1892
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:44,650
Haha, we found a hint.

1893
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,020
What hint?

1894
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,570
- You are the ghost for sure.
- Why?

1895
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:50,690
(You are the ghost for sure.)

1896
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:54,720
(Is Haha the ghost?)

1897
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:58,350
(Which hint is hidden
in the doll So Min brought?)

1898
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,390
Haha is the ghost.

1899
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:03,130
(Haha is the ghost.)

1900
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:04,630
(For goodness' sake.)

1901
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:06,300
What?

1902
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:08,690
- Haha.
- Are you my fan?

1903
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,840
- Are you my fan?
- It's a hint.

1904
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,570
Haha is the ghost.

1905
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:14,930
- See?
- That's your voice.

1906
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:16,140
(She made a hint to tease Haha.)

1907
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:17,210
(A moment ago)

1908
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:20,420
(Recording)

1909
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:24,310
(She expertly created a fake hint.)

1910
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:26,150
Haha, we found a hint.

1911
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:31,130
So Min is a fool.

1912
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:35,890
- It's you. A hint told me...
- What is this?

1913
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:37,560
- What is it?
- That startled me.

1914
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,730
(Haha found something!)

1915
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:42,970
I just found it.

1916
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,600
(A red diary?)

1917
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,900
It's a diary.

1918
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:49,380
- No way.
- How did you find it?

1919
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,210
- Over there...
- I can't believe it.

1920
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,970
So you aren't the ghost?
Once we read the diary...

1921
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:56,590
- Prove that you aren't the ghost.
- Go away. You might be it.

1922
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:58,310
- I'm not the ghost.
- I'm not the ghost either.

1923
01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:00,310
(Does the diary contain a hint
on the ghost's identity?)

1924
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:01,650
"I stayed up for three nights
to prepare..."

1925
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:03,850
"for the National Doll Olympics
that will take place in two weeks."

1926
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:05,150
"I stayed up for three nights
to prepare..."

1927
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:07,190
"for the National Doll Olympics
that will take place in two weeks."

1928
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:09,470
"Because of that person,
I always missed the Gold Prize."

1929
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:12,560
"But that person was sick
and couldn't prepare much."

1930
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,500
(I have a feeling
that I will win the Gold Prize.)

1931
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,140
"Let's go! Let's work hard
for another night."

1932
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,670
(Let's go! Let's work hard
for another night.)

1933
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:19,540
"It's the Silver Prize again."

1934
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,100
"My friends whisper
about how I always come in second."

1935
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,400
(My friends whisper
about how I always come in second.)

1936
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,610
I feel even more pathetic...

1937
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,090
because you consoled me and said
that second place is good too.

1938
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,090
If it weren't for you,
I would have come in first.

1939
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,460
I have a hint about the first place.

1940
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:36,150
This is about the first place.
So Hee was...

1941
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:38,150
No. It was written by the second place.

1942
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,930
- It's the second place's diary.
- It's So Hee's diary.

1943
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:42,890
(It's So Hee's diary.)

1944
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:47,640
(The master of handmade dolls,
Kim So Hee died due to a curse.)

1945
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,810
(In 2002, she won the Silver Prize
in the National Doll Olympics.)

1946
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:55,310
(A long time ago)

1947
01:10:55,310 --> 01:11:00,610
(So Hee was a member
of the doll club back in school.)

1948
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:05,110
(The red diary contains accounts
from her school days.)

1949
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:08,060
(They hurriedly read the next page.)

1950
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,290
May 5, 2003. Monday.

1951
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:13,930
It wasn't a school day,
but I went because I felt trapped.

1952
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,260
That person was making a doll.

1953
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:19,600
Even from a distance,
the doll looked perfect.

1954
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:21,800
"Even from a distance,
the doll looked perfect."

1955
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,310
"And that person looked ecstatic."

1956
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:24,730
"I really wanted that doll."

1957
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:26,510
I really wanted that doll.

1958
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:29,180
So I acted without thinking.

1959
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:31,970
(So I acted without thinking.)

1960
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:35,140
I hit that person's head
and brought the doll.

1961
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:37,420
(I hit that person's head
and brought the doll.)

1962
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:39,560
If that person dies,

1963
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,610
can I keep the doll?

1964
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:48,150
(So Hee killed the person
who always took 1st place.)

1965
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:50,100
"That person died.
There were no witnesses."

1966
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,970
"I don't need to return the doll."

1967
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:54,800
"I went through that person's locker..."

1968
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,670
"and found a notebook containing
doll designs."

1969
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:59,400
And found a notebook containing
doll designs.

1970
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,930
These poor things lost their owner.

1971
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:04,270
I will turn them into dolls.

1972
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:06,220
She stole the designs.

1973
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:08,750
(She stole the designs.)

1974
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,720
May 9, 2003. Friday.

1975
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,480
I submitted that person's doll.

1976
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,810
I am already excited because I think
I will win the Gold Prize.

1977
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:16,890
May 19, 2003. Monday.

1978
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:18,720
Gold Prize! It's the Gold Prize!

1979
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,500
I finally did it!

1980
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,220
"It's the Gold Prize!
I finally did it!"

1981
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,260
(The Gold Prize winner of 2003?)

1982
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:24,390
(Kim So Hee VIP Doll Exhibition)

1983
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:26,040
(Kim So Hee, the pride
of the Korean doll industry)

1984
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,690
(2003, Gold Prize winner
of the 32nd Asia Doll Fair)

1985
01:12:28,690 --> 01:12:29,930
(2000, Silver Prize)

1986
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:33,810
(2002, Silver Prize)

1987
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:38,600
(Until 2002,
So Hee only won the Silver Prize.)

1988
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:43,590
(After she killed the 1st place in 2003)

1989
01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:46,510
(At the 32nd Asia Doll Fair,
Kim So Hee Wins the Gold Prize.)

1990
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:48,460
(At the Dollmaker Contest of 2004,
Kim So Hee Wins the Gold Prize.)

1991
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:50,930
(At the World Doll Expo of 2007,
Kim So Hee Wins the Gold Prize.)

1992
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:53,460
(At the World Doll Expo of 2008,
Kim So Hee Wins the Gold Prize.)

1993
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:59,060
(So Hee stole the 1st place's ideas
to become a master dollmaker.)

1994
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:04,140
(So Hee was the jealous 2nd place
who killed the 1st place.)

1995
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:10,270
(So Hee's collection was made
of stolen ideas.)

1996
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:12,310
(So Hee's diary continues.)

1997
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:14,270
- "To celebrate Children's Day..."
- "I went to my school..."

1998
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:15,440
"for a talent donation."

1999
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,310
"When I entered the classroom
full of memories,"

2000
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,590
"that person was standing there
with a bloodied face."

2001
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:21,420
That person appeared as a ghost.

2002
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:24,180
To celebrate Children's Day,
I went to my school...

2003
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,180
for a talent donation.

2004
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:28,800
"When I entered the classroom
full of memories,"

2005
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,060
(In the classroom full of memories)

2006
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:31,320
that person was standing there...

2007
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:34,760
with a bloodied face.

2008
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:37,970
I was fine all along.
Why is this happening now?

2009
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:39,880
I keep hearing that person's voice.

2010
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,470
No, these are my dolls.

2011
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:43,180
You went ahead and died.

2012
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,400
Stop it already.
You are dead anyway.

2013
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,680
Stop tormenting me.

2014
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:51,550
(Guilt brought on
visual and auditory hallucinations.)

2015
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:56,650
(In the end, she died
because of the 1st place's ghost.)

2016
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:58,630
(That's the last entry in the diary.)

2017
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:00,220
What? That's the last one.

2018
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:02,800
You startled me.

2019
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:04,300
What are you doing?

2020
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:07,390
The first place died and became the ghost.

2021
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:12,540
(So Hee's 1st place friend was the ghost.)

2022
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:14,730
The first place died and became the ghost.

2023
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:16,850
Haha, the first place doesn't have
a YouTube channel.

2024
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:22,680
(Haha, the first place doesn't have
a YouTube channel.)

2025
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:26,720
(Jae Suk found a hint
about the 1st place.)

2026
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:31,130
(The 1st place won't run
a YouTube channel.)

2027
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:34,760
(So Min found a hint about the 1st place.)

2028
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,470
(The 1st place's name had a letter S.)

2029
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:40,500
The first place So Hee was jealous of...

2030
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:44,810
(The 1st place was born
in spring or summer.)

2031
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,570
(If you exclude Jae Suk,)

2032
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:51,310
(Ji Hyo or So Min is
the 1st place and the ghost.)

2033
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:52,610
(Ghost candidate 1, Jeon So Min)

2034
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:59,010
(Suspicion 1. She kept acting like
she didn't know the rules.)

2035
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:05,390
(Did she feign ignorance
to avoid suspicion?)

2036
01:15:05,390 --> 01:15:16,310
(Suspicion 2. She kept
grilling people for information.)

2037
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:25,210
(Suspicion 3. She suspected
one member with enthusiasm.)

2038
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:28,850
(Ghost candidate 2, Song Ji Hyo)

2039
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:34,090
(Suspicion 1. She followed
the members around.)

2040
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:38,150
(Ji Hyo lingered
when Jae Suk tried to be alone.)

2041
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:42,800
(She even eavesdropped on the members.)

2042
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:49,900
(She was more intent
on checking everyone's location.)

2043
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:55,880
(Suspicion 2. So Hee died
upon seeing Ji Hyo.)

2044
01:15:56,070 --> 01:16:00,610
(So Hee said something mysterious
as she pointed toward Ji Hyo.)

2045
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:04,590
Haha, So Hee died
right after she saw Ji Hyo.

2046
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:06,590
Isn't it strange?

2047
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:08,180
Maybe this hint is fake.

2048
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:13,560
The first place's name has the letter S.

2049
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,020
Jeon So Min. It isn't Ji Hyo.

2050
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:16,260
Song Ji Hyo.

2051
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,860
- Her name has an S.
- Jeon So Min and Song Ji Hyo.

2052
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:20,800
- You pieced everything together.
- Good job.

2053
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,010
- I am sorry. You aren't the ghost.
- No, I'm not.

2054
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:25,640
Why did you kill So Hee?

2055
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,340
- Why did you kill her?
- Why did you kill her?

2056
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,680
Start talking.

2057
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:29,810
It isn't me.

2058
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:31,510
- No way.
- Let's go upstairs.

2059
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,610
- This is our last chance.
- I know.

2060
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,440
That's So Min's handwriting.

2061
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:39,480
(Which one of them is the 1st place
So Hee was jealous of?)

2062
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:41,060
Listen to me.

2063
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:42,180
Sit down.

2064
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,390
In conclusion, So Hee was the culprit.

2065
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:46,100
She was the killer.

2066
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,430
- What?
- Here she comes.

2067
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,960
She is bringing something.

2068
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:51,470
- What is that? Let's see it.
- It's a list of award winners.

2069
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:52,690
Is it a decisive hint?

2070
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:54,500
Let's see it together.

2071
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:56,900
Hold on. Let's analyze this first.

2072
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,840
- This is...
- Math, art, art, PE,

2073
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,400
music, track...

2074
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:03,710
How did Lee Kwang Soo win
the Gold Prize in math?

2075
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:05,850
- No way. It's a lie.
- This is false information.

2076
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:07,570
- Seriously.
- This is false information.

2077
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:11,420
(He can barely memorize the times table.)

2078
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:13,790
- Math, art, art, PE,
- Check out the next page.

2079
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:15,150
track, music...

2080
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:17,850
I see "Dollmaking."

2081
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:20,260
Gold Prize, Kim So Hee. Here it is.

2082
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,060
I saw the name too.

2083
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:24,170
(Kim So Hee won the Gold Prize in 2003.)

2084
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,300
What?

2085
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,560
Gold Prize, Kim So Hee.

2086
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,730
It's the Silver Prize again.

2087
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:30,230
It's what we read in the diary.

2088
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:32,210
The first place must be Jin Sung.

2089
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:34,010
Here it is.
She won the Silver Prize then.

2090
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,140
This kid kept winning
the Gold Prize. It's this kid.

2091
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:37,900
- Jin Sung.
- Yoon Jin Sung is the ghost.

2092
01:17:38,810 --> 01:17:40,720
She must have won the Silver Prize before.

2093
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,980
(From 2003 on, So Hee won the Gold Prize.)

2094
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:46,460
(But Yoon Jin Sung won
the Gold Prize before then.)

2095
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:51,150
(Because of that person,
I always missed the Gold Prize.)

2096
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:54,930
(She was incredibly jealous
of that person.)

2097
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:58,170
(Gold Prize, Yoon Jin Sung)

2098
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:00,000
- Jin Sung.
- Yoon Jin Sung is the ghost.

2099
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,860
There must be something about the name.

2100
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,930
Yoon Jin Sung. Jeon So Min.

2101
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:08,970
Yoon Jin Sung.

2102
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:09,970
(The unfamiliar name
leaves them flustered.)

2103
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:14,010
(Between So Min and Ji Hyo,
who is Yoon Jin Sung?)

2104
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:15,640
Hurry up.

2105
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:16,680
(They have ten minutes
until the last judgment.)

2106
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:20,060
Four dolls remain. Among them...

2107
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:21,610
(They don't know
who these dolls belong to.)

2108
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:22,890
This is complicated.

2109
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,790
(They have used
all the easily hidden envelopes.)

2110
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:28,930
I want to find a photo envelope.

2111
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:30,760
I want to try putting them in.

2112
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,230
(With all three older members out,
Haha has a big responsibility.)

2113
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:37,310
(He uses his short stature
to search everywhere.)

2114
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:40,010
What?

2115
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:42,710
(He finds a hidden folder.)

2116
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:44,550
(Movie synopsis collection)

2117
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:46,940
Pandora, Na'vi...

2118
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:48,270
(It's a collection of synopses
the movie club used.)

2119
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:49,680
Then came "Avatar."

2120
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:53,610
("Ode to My Father")

2121
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:55,560
"Ode to My Father."

2122
01:18:58,650 --> 01:18:59,760
What?

2123
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,600
This is so scary.

2124
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:04,560
This is incredible.

2125
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,500
(He hears the announcement
of the last judgment.)

2126
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:09,670
This is your last chance.

2127
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:10,670
(The last judgment stand has opened.)

2128
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:14,070
I hope you succeed and catch the ghost.

2129
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:17,250
Shall we begin the final selection?

2130
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:21,140
Are you the ghost or not?

2131
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:22,980
I am not the ghost.

2132
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:24,050
(Haha picks Ji Hyo.)

2133
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:27,180
What is it?
Why don't you just show me?

2134
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,460
- What is it?
- All right.

2135
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:29,980
- What is it?
- It was torn.

2136
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:31,890
("Ode to My Father," Synopsis)

2137
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,960
(A synopsis that's torn?)

2138
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,260
"So Hee, the top student
of the department of dance,"

2139
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:39,130
(So Hee?)

2140
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:40,540
"is loved by everyone
in her department..."

2141
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:43,340

01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,970
"her wish will come true."

2147
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:53,510
(Jin Sung climbs the stairs
while making a wish.)

2148
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:56,640
This is the synopsis of "Wishing Stairs."

2149

of "Wishing Stairs.")

Who is it? Did you play Jin Sung?

have been desperately looking for)

(Song Ji Hyo)

2162
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,150
- My gosh.
- It must be her.

2163
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:38,150
- I got goosebumps.
- That must be why...

(And its main character, Yoon Jin Sung)

2167
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:56,750
I used to be really good at finding hints.

2168
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:58,750
Maybe it's because I became a ghost.

2169
01:20:58,750 --> 01:20:59,850
(Maybe it's because I became a ghost.)

2170
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:06,790
(May 2003)

Running High School, Yoon Jin Sung)

as the forever runner-up.)

2173

by her sense of inferiority)

ended up killing Jin Sung.)

2176

(all of Jin Sung's dolls.)

2177
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:44,520
(Jin Sung who was wrongfully killed
became a ghost...)

(who suffered from hallucinations
all her life ever since then...)

2181

to take back the dolls she made.)

(using that person's name,
causing confusion.)

2187
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:22,220
(She's been handing in
the envelopes with different names.)

2188
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:27,560
(And the secret behind the order
of people who were eliminated)

2189
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:30,930
(The 29th stair from the movie...)

2190
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:34,570
(that makes your wish come true)

2191
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:39,640
(Jin Sung could stick
the figure of her next target...)

2192
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:43,050
(on the 29th stair.)

2193
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:45,290
I should eliminate
the two most annoying ones.

2194
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,650
Who do I think is the ghost?

2195
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:52,150
Song Ji Hyo?

2196
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:53,320
(Song Ji Hyo?)

2197
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,820
(The ghost's identity
is finally revealed.)

2198
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:57,260
(Song Ji Hyo was Yoon Jin Sung.)

2199
01:22:57,690 --> 01:23:00,230
(But it's not the humans' victory yet.)

2200
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:01,560
It's either number 4 or 6.

2201
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,210
- I know. We need to cut one open.
- Which one is it?

2202
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:06,400
(They can only win
if they open Ji Hyo's doll.)

2203
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,380
- Hold on. I'm so dizzy.
- Which one is it?

2204
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:09,570
I'm so dizzy.

2205
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:10,900
You wrote either number 4 or 6, right?

2206
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:13,570
- But I could've made that up.
- Before that...

2207
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:16,270
It depends on whether
she's telling a lie or not.

2208
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:17,940
There could be a twist.

2209
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:20,560
- Do we have any more hints?
- No, that's all we have.

2210
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:22,720
Why didn't I find more hints?

2211
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,980
So what if I'm the ghost?

2212
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:27,930
That's right.
It's better just to cut one open.

2213
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:29,630
It's better just to cut one open.
We have a 50-percent chance.

2214
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,470
If we put in all 3,
we'll have only a 30-percent chance.

2215
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:33,670
Since I'm holding doll number six,
I'll cut open this one. Okay?

2216
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:35,670
- Okay.
- If Ji Hyo's name is in there,

2217
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:37,260
- then we'll win.
- We'll win.

2218
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:38,710
- Let's do it.
- Cut it open.

2219
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:41,680
- Then cut open number 6.
- I'll just cut open number 6.

2220
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:42,900
- It's better to cut it open.
- That's right. Let's cut it open.

2221
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:43,900
- I'm sure it's number six.
- Hurry up and cut it open.

2222
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,440
- Hurry up. Cut it open.
- Cut it open.

2223
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,640
- Look at her. She's so scary.
- She's so scary.

2224
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:48,050
She is Jin Sung, right?

2225
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:50,890
She is. I just got the chills.
When I looked it up...

2226
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:52,610
Cut it open.
We should cut number six open.

2227
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:56,480
(They start cutting open doll number 6.)

2228
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:00,460
(And Ji Hyo has a mysterious look
on her face.)

2229
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:05,670
(Whose doll is doll number 6?)

2230
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:07,860
- I got her!
- I told you!

2231
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:09,170
It's hers, right?

2232
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:14,680
(Song Ji Hyo)

2233
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:19,140
Oh, no. The humans made it.

2234
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:20,250
(The humans made it.)

2235
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:22,140
(The humans take the victory.)

2236
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,050
- You're so scary.
- You said you're not the ghost!

2237
01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:26,650
(The Empty Head Mystery Club
caught the ghost in the end.)

2238
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:28,920
(Running High School's
master of handmade dolls,)

2239
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,430
(Yoon Jin Sung loses to the humans.)

2240
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,190
- Everyone, today's race...
- It's so scary.

2241
01:24:33,390 --> 01:24:35,760
is about Jin Sung
who was wrongfully killed by So Hee.

2242
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,800
The ghost of Jin Sung
wanted to curse the humans too.

2243
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:42,470
Jin Sung was the role Ji Hyo played
in "Wishing Stairs."

2244
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:43,760
- It's Jin Sung?
- Yes.

2245
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,400
Didn't we sing Jin Sung's song
on the bus earlier?

2246
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:47,680
- Oh, my.
- What?

2247
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,180
"Child, don't run."

2248
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:51,070
- Me too.
- We sang Jin Sung's song.

2249
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:54,010
(While teasing Suk Jin on the bus,)

2250
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:56,590
(they sang along to Jin Sung's song
by chance.)

2251
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:57,640
What's that song?

2252
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,640
(Jin Sung!)

2253
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:04,150
(The real Jin Sung was nervous
by this unbelievable coincidence.)

2254
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:07,220
(They sing Jin Sung's song
to celebrate their win.)

2255
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:08,460
We were all surprised...

2256
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:09,930
- because you sang Jin Sung's song.
- Right?

2257
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:12,470
Because you talked about a period
of poverty, we sang that song.

2258
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:13,540
Exactly.

2259
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:14,560
(This is all thanks to Suk Jin
who mentioned a period of poverty.)

2260
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,300
Ji Hyo was really scary earlier.

2261
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:19,510
She was sitting on the bed
without even turning on the lights.

2262
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:20,840
She was really scary
when she stared at you...

2263
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,430
before cutting open your doll.

2264
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:23,550
Oh, really?

2265
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:24,770
It was as if she was saying,
"I'd love to see you try."

2266
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:26,920
Her eyes were really scary. Right?

2267
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,940
The last three remaining humans
realized the ghost was Song Ji Hyo.

2268
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:33,390
They were inferring which doll was hers,

2269
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:35,260
and they randomly cut open a doll,
and it happened to be Ji Hyo's.

2270
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:36,260
(Simply put,
they won because they got lucky.)

2271
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,460
Ji Hyo will receive the penalty...

2272
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:42,390
of making a handmade doll
before going home today.

2273
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:44,170
- I'm so jealous.
- A handmade doll?

2274
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:46,690
- It's the worst.
- It really is the worst.

2275
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:48,300
I'm supposed to make a doll?

2276
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:50,470
(Just like that, after a long while...)

2277
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:53,730
Why did she have to be so jealous
of Jin Sung?

2278
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:55,470
It's okay to be a runner-up.

2279
01:25:55,930 --> 01:25:57,810
How could she kill her friend
just because she was a runner-up?

2280
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:00,770
Just wait.
I'll be able to finish it today.

2281
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:02,050
(But the master of handmade dolls
seems quite slow.)

2282
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:03,590
Do you want to go home first?

2283
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:04,590
(Do you want to go home first?)

2284
01:26:05,050 --> 01:26:07,220
It's not so easy to make a doll.

2285
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:11,680
I'm done. I need to stitch this part
and tie a knot.

2286
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:13,560
- I'm done!
- Please show it to us.

2287
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,520
Ji Hyo, you cleared your penalty.

2288
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,300
Good work.

2289
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,860
Good work.

2290
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:22,710
(These guests are back after a long time.)

2291
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:24,040
(Yoon Si Yoon, Hani, Park Ki Woong)

2292
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,410
(Today is a couples' race.)

2293
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:28,860
(The unchosen ones
will join Team Jae Suk.)

2294
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:32,160
(He'll be Dr. Yoo who helps
improve their self-esteem.)

2295
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:35,620
(The unchosen ones, come to me.)

2296
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:36,770
He's a doctor?

2297
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:37,900
The rest of you, come over here!

2298
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,870
(Rebuilding their mentality)

2299
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:40,960
I'll pick Jong Kook.

2300
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,660
(The couple who decided to admit
their romance from today...)

2301
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:45,460
(to the ones who can't admit it)

2302
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,670
- You remember me, right?
- Yes.

2303
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:49,980
(Next to the lovey-dovey couples,)

2304
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:52,870
(Team Dr. Yoo seeks a chance
to turn the tables.)

2305
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,410
(Can we switch partners?)

2306
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:55,780
(I pick Si Yoon.)

2307
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,880
(I'll trade Suk Jin with Si Yoon.)

2308
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:03,860
(Their lives changed a little
with Dr. Yoo.)

2309
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:06,580
(Will Dr. Yoo be able to give them
a new life?)

2310
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:07,860
(Couples' Race, You Raise a Man Up)
