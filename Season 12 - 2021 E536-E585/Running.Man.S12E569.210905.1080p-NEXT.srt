1
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,470
It's fall now.

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,010
Your outfit is perfect for fall.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,680
Hello.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,710
- Hello.
- Hello.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,110
This is a wedding hall, isn't it?

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,560
- Is this a wedding hall?
- This place is a wedding hall.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,990
This is lovely.

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,680
There was a controversy...

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,160
- over Suk Jin again.
- What?

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,160
- Controversy?
- Really?

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,890
At a press conference, he said
he doesn't want to work for long.

13
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,570
He's worked for a long time.

14
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,570
- I know.
- He doesn't want to?

15
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,370
- I mean...
- "I don't want to work for long."

16
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,730
"I just try many different things
like YouTube and TikTok."

17
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,110
"I like to try new things."

18
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,740
- It's not about trying new things.
- At the press conference...

19
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,840
You started all of them for money.

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,080
- That's not true.
- It isn't?

21
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,010
No. It's a new challenge.

22
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,510
"You know I majored
in business administration."

23
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,660
(Ji Suk Jin: You know I majored
in business administration.)

24
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,510
So I have some friends
who run their own businesses.

25
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,090
So I can get...

26
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,690
- Why did he say such a thing?
- advice from them.

27
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,090
The friends
who make Suk Jin go broke.

28
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,300
Why did you talk about friends
who run their own businesses?

29
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,900
- Suk Jin.
- Did he want to brag about them?

30
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,840
Hey, you didn't have to
write down the details.

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,440
He wants to say that he will have
work to do after his retirement.

32
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,730
He lost the money he'd saved
because of them.

33
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,100
Why does Suk Jin try to look bold
when he's with others?

34
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,850
- What's with him?
- Hey.

35
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,650
This is how I've lived.

36
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,020
Don't yell at us.

37
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,020
Smile.

38
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,380
I'm just expressing
my opinion emphatically.

39
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,680
- This is just the opening.
- I know.

40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,760
I'm just stating my opinion.

41
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,880
And in an interview, Ji Hyo said...
There were many interviews.

42
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
- What interview?
- There were many interviews.

43
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,790
- What did she say?
- What is it now?

44
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,550
- When did you say that?
- "Recently..."

45
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,460
Ji Hyo said a lot of useless things.

46
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,630
Is that a recent interview?

47
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,630
"I'm playing along with my romance
with Jong Kook for good chemistry."

48
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,800
- Lock your fingers together.
- "Playing along?"

49
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,270
That's not what she really wants,
but she plays along with it."

50
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,300
- It's not like that.
- Ji Hyo.

51
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,380
You just passed Ji Hyo's audition.

52
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,010
- That's...
- He passed.

53
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,480
After ten years.

54
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,540
She didn't seem to care when there
was a rumor about our relationship.

55
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,590
And now she plays along with it?

56
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,990
- Ji Hyo, what does that mean?
- I'm just playing along with it.

57
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,350
I guess there was
some misunderstanding.

58
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,490
- Misunderstanding?
- I see.

59
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,880
People really liked it though.

60
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,090
- Sure.
- It's fun.

61
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,630
So I thought it would be fun
to play along with it.

62
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,600
What we really want is...

63
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,490
Ji Hyo with Jong Kook
and So Min with Se Chan.

64
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,840
Me and So Min?

65
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,600
- The two of us?
- Me and Se Chan?

66
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,110
- Do you want us to be a couple?
- This couple?

67
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,800
Good. I guess a lot of things
happened in the past week.

68
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,500
- That's right.
- I see.

69
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,340
Today, we have three guests
who are trying to defeat...

70
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,840
the members of Running Man.

71
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,420
- Really?
- We will have to trample on them.

72
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,450
Why would they want to defeat us?

73
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,710
I saw today's guests roam around.

74
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,650
- I know.
- So Min was...

75
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,460
We will talk about it
with the guests later.

76
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,050
I heard So Min made
today's guests uncomfortable...

77
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,800
with her words.

78
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,200
- Really? Why?
- What happened?

79
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,430
They tried to leave after seeing me.

80
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,430
They waved their hands like this.

81
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,490
- Seriously?
- Yes.

82
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,370
So Min surprised them.

83
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,670
- We will talk about it later.
- Okay.

84
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,110
Hey, Hani.

85
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,800
- Hello.
- Hey.

86
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,650
- Hey, Si Yoon.
- Ki Woong.

87
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,310
Ki Woong looks like Kim Won Jun.

88
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,710
Is he the guy
from "2 Days and 1 Night 4"?

89
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,710
- Yoon Si Yoon.
- It's Yoon Si Yoon.

90
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,280
- His name is Yoon Si Yoon.
- He's Yoon Si Yoon.

91
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,020
Hello.

92
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,890
- Hello.
- Hello.

93
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,150
(Park Ki Woong,
Hani of EXID, Yoon Si Yoon)

94
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,720
- Stand here.
- Hello.

95
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,870
- Come over here.
- Nice to meet you.

96
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
- He's the millstone guy.
- Right.

97
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,840
- He's Ki Woong.
- Ki Woong.

98
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,800
Ki Woong, you looked like Won Jun...

99
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,340
- coming down the stairs.
- I know.

100
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,110
- He looks just like Won Jun.
- He also looks like Yang Joon Il.

101
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,400
- Yang Joon Il.
- I mean Yang Joon Il.

102
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,080
- Yang Joon Il.
- Will you move over a little?

103
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,400
Okay.

104
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,610
Why are you talking casually to him?

105
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,650
- Hey.
- Why are you being mean to him?

106
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,080
- My gosh.
- I can't believe this.

107
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,450
I already met them
in front of the van.

108
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,210
But you can't talk
to them like that.

109
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,620
Why did you say this
when you already met them?

110
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,810
"Hey, who are they?"

111
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,090
I met him on a TV show before.

112
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,550
I know. That's what he does.

113
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,550
That's right. We met before.

114
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,990
- On "Star Golden Bell".
- Right. It was "Star Golden Bell".

115
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,300
Really?

116
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,330
- You have long hair now.
- That's right.

117
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,870
Is that what you say to catch up?

118
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,640
"You have long hair now."

119
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,500
(The former show host's
lame comments)

120
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,710
Isn't that the worst thing
to comment on?

121
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,710
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

122
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,370
- Ki Woong, I'm sorry.
- You look really cool.

123
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,450
- Thank you.
- You look like a European.

124
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,180
- Thank you.
- Anyway,

125
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,920
the three of them started
a new drama, "You Raise Me Up".

126
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,920
- Is that right?
- "You Raise Me Up".

127
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,550
You raise me up

128
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,620
- It sounds perfect for this place.
- It does.

129
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,020
Let's talk briefly about...

130
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,860
- their new drama first.
- Okay.

131
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,520
- You two are doctors, right?
- Yes.

132
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,420
- I see.
- Doctors.

133
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,460
- And I'm a patient.
- Tell us about it.

134
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,100
I'm in my early 30s.

135
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,510
But for psychological reasons,

136
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,010
I can't get it up.

137
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,470
- Oh no.
- Oh dear.

138
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,770
In your early 30s?

139
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,710
I can't get it up.

140
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,320
(They all sigh.)

141
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,170
- That's...
- In your early 30s?

142
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,280
- Seriously?
- Suk Jin should be there.

143
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,690
That's really sad.

144
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,690
It will get better
if you work out the lower body.

145
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,390
- In your early 30s?
- For psychological reasons.

146
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,020
- Psychological reasons.
- It's about psychology.

147
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,200
- For psychological reasons...
- Still, a workout will help.

148
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,220
- I hang low.
- You do?

149
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,520
So you go to a doctor.

150
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,960
- I go see a doctor.
- I'm the doctor.

151
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,200
And you two are friends from school?

152
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,790
- Right.
- The urologist was my first love.

153
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,940
- His urologist?
- Yes.

154
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,400
- I find the setting interesting.
- That's intense.

155
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,670
I'll watch the drama for sure.

156
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,170
I like the story.

157
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,970
We did the reading before.

158
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,820
Men of your age
really liked the story.

159
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,250
- I see.
- Men in their 50s?

160
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,450
- Men in their 50s.
- Jae Suk...

161
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,090
doesn't have psychological reasons.

162
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,130
(Jae Suk doesn't have
psychological reasons.)

163
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,270
- Is this what you want to do?
- But he hangs low.

164
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,130
- You should be careful.
- No psychological reasons?

165
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,860
You said the phone bill
of 2,000 dollars before.

166
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,000
So people think
I actually spent 2,000 dollars.

167
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,640
Please don't get the wrong idea.

168
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,600
- Isn't that too provocative?
- That's why...

169
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,880
it's titled "You Raise Me Up".

170
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,730
Is that why it's called
"You Raise Me Up"?

171
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,770
- So it's titled "You Raise Me Up".
- Is that why?

172
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,040
It sounds interesting.

173
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,110
Anyway,

174
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,520
I talked about this before.

175
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,340
So Min scared them away with a word.

176
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,020
- What did she say?
- I mean, one of the guests.

177
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,910
She embarrassed one of them.

178
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,390
- What did you say?
- Well...

179
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,020
It was Ki Woong.

180
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,020
- What?
- Well...

181
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,500
Our guests usually don't
get out of their cars.

182
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,220
But I ran into him here.
So I was excited to see him.

183
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,200
"You remember me, don't you?"

184
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,790
- And he remembered me.
- Ki Woong was like...

185
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,090
"Well, yes."

186
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,640
"Sure. Of course I do."

187
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,730
(Was he flustered
because they met a long time ago?)

188
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,360
How do you know each other?

189
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,030
It was 2005.

190
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,770
- I was a college freshman.
- Where?

191
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,770
This feels good.

192
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,900
She's from
Dongduk Women's University.

193
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,040
- That's right.
- I am.

194
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,710
- Did they meet on a blind date?
- No.

195
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,280
My ex-girlfriend was
from the same university.

196
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,190
So I set my friend up with So Min.

197
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,460
You did?

198
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,150
He set his friend up with her.

199
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,650
So Min, you're unbelievable.

200
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,270
Should we go back to 2005?

201
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,570
We should.

202
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,140
We should travel back in time.

203
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,840
- Things were good in 2005.
- Ki Woong...

204
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,460
set me up with a really nice guy.

205
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,270
So we hung out
with Ki Woong's couple.

206
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,940
- It was a double date.
- Yes, it was a double date.

207
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,170
So how did it go?

208
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,150
- It didn't work out.
- I see.

209
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,270
- Did you drink or not? Tell me.
- What?

210
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,840
Did you drink or not on the date?

211
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,960
I don't think we drank.
We just had some coffee.

212
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,320
(Come on!)

213
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,830
- Did you play Truth or Dare?
- Stop it.

214
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,630
- Did you not play games?
- That's enough.

215
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,920
Just stay quiet.

216
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,060
You're like that all the time.

217
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,000
Actually, I still remember
what she was wearing.

218
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,520
What was she wearing?

219
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,290
She was wearing boot-cut jeans.

220
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,810
That was in fashion in 2005.

221
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,710
- It was popular in 2005.
- Boot-cut jeans were in fashion.

222
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,080
Was she wearing True Religion?

223
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,710
And she was wearing Von Dutch.

224
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,770
Were you wearing Von Dutch?

225
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,950
- Von Dutch?
- Von Dutch.

226
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,210
Von Dutch.

227
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,170
I remember that.

228
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,670
- And I was wearing heels.
- Von Dutch.

229
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,250
- And big hoop earrings.
- That's right.

230
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,980
We had Mini Homepage back them.

231
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,460
So Min is so funny.

232
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,920
Today,

233
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,220
we will have
You Raise a Man Up Race.

234
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,350
And "You" means...

235
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,900
Yoo Jae Suk.

236
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,960
What?

237
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,900
That's enough.

238
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,140
I know this is
Yoo Jae Suk's Running Man.

239
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,440
But enough is enough.

240
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,900
So Jae Suk will be the "You"
in the You Raise a Man Up Race.

241
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,710
Today, Ji Hyo, So Min, and Hani...

242
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,580
will be the captains of each team.

243
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,690
And they will pick one
male member they want in each round.

244
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,610
- And the rest will be my team?
- Exactly.

245
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,780
The unchosen members will join...

246
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,350
Team Jae Suk.

247
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:09,000
Captain Yoo Jae Suk will help you
improve your self-esteem...

248
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
- Self-esteem?
- and rebuild your mentality...

249
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,500
- as Dr. Yoo.
- Rebuild their mentality?

250
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,770
How could he do that
when he has no self-esteem?

251
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,140
Rebuild our mentality?

252
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,860
- He's a doctor?
- Me?

253
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,570
This is what I'm good at.

254
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,660
Okay.

255
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,770
(Okay!)

256
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,530
That's not what he can do.

257
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,670
I like stuff like this.

258
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,080
The gown doesn't suit him.

259
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,170
Dr. Yoo.

260
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,470
Dr. Yoo.

261
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,710
- I'm confident in this area.
- Dr. Yoo.

262
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,280
Like I said before,
the three women...

263
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,160
will pick a man they want
and become a couple.

264
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,430
And the other four men
will be a team.

265
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,790
After each mission,

266
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,060
the 1st place wins 40 points,
the 2nd place wins 30 points,

267
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,120
the 3rd place wins 20 points,
and the rest will win 10 points.

268
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,200
And the captains will
distribute the points.

269
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,360
(The captains distribute the points
after each mission.)

270
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,080
The two members with the lowest
points will get a penalty.

271
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,870
And the two losers can...

272
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,340
pick one member
to get a penalty with them.

273
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,710
So there will be three people
to get a penalty.

274
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,840
Three members will get a penalty,
so the captains shouldn't...

275
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,920
- get on their bad side.
- They can't be all bossy.

276
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,790
- They should behave themselves.
- They can't get on our bad side.

277
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,610
After each mission,

278
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,160
the captains will get a chance...

279
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,060
- to switch their partners.
- Switch my partner?

280
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,830
If you're ranked high,
you can pick a partner you want.

281
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,570
And Dr. Yoo...

282
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,490
will get two replacement cards.

283
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,890
- And?
- If you're done...

284
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,700
rebuilding a member's mentality...

285
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,360
He's there already.

286
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,570
- Why are you trying so hard?
- Jong Kook, you're good.

287
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,540
- I don't want to be on his team.
- My gosh.

288
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,080
I feel uncomfortable around them.

289
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,910
- I feel suffocated already.
- I don't want to be on their team.

290
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,920
- They make me uncomfortable.
- This is horrible.

291
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,140
Pick me so I won't be
on the same team as them.

292
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,920
- Please pick me.
- I'm tired.

293
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,420
He's rebuilding
my mentality already.

294
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,460
You can use the cards
to switch your team members anytime.

295
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,060
You should pick your first team now.

296
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,390
The captains will play
rock-paper-scissors.

297
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,490
Rock-paper-scissors.

298
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,670
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

299
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,490
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

300
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,730
Ahn Hee Yeon goes first.

301
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,910
- Pick a partner you want.
- Hee Yeon goes first.

302
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,230
Hee Yeon runs a lot.
I can't be her partner.

303
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,470
I pick Si Yoon.

304
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,100
- Si Yoon.
- Okay.

305
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,210
I bet they are dating.

306
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,840
They are doing a drama together.

307
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,080
- Why would you pick him again?
- They are dating.

308
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,290
My gosh.

309
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,920
It's smoke and mirrors.

310
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,790
- Who's second?
- It's me.

311
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,330
- I guess So Min already has one.
- She has her partner.

312
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,660
- It's obvious.
- We all know that.

313
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,750
But I can't pick one right away.

314
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,120
I pick Ki Woong.

315
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,330
(But I can't pick one right away.
I pick Ki Woong.)

316
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,620
(It took her 3 seconds.)

317
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,800
You don't need to hesitate.

318
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,940
(She picked the man she met
in 2005 with no hesitation.)

319
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,840
- So now...
- He seems glad though.

320
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,370
Ji Hyo said she'd play along
with the romance.

321
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,870
Will the romance continue?

322
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,000
- You should.
- Go ahead.

323
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,840
Should I start it today?

324
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,680
(Should I start it today?)

325
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,920
The Metallica shirt.

326
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,480
She's saying that
in the Metallica shirt.

327
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,690
- "Should I start it today?"
- She sounds scary.

328
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,880
Should I start it today?
All right. Come here.

329
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,720
(Should I start it today?
All right. Come here.)

330
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,880
All right, Metallica.

331
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,030
- Okay.
- Go to her.

332
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,200
- It's your fate.
- Go to Metallica.

333
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,300
The rest of you, come over here!

334
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,800
One, two.

335
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,030
(The rest of them join Team Dr. Yoo.)

336
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,070
You're with me now.

337
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,340
- Okay.
- Okay.

338
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,210
- We're going to train them, right?
- What?

339
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,710
It's not like we're being trained.

340
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,780
You're being trained.

341
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,100
- You will train us?
- Yes, I will.

342
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,450
- He doesn't understand it.
- Is that true?

343
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,820
He will help you improve
your self-esteem.

344
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
I don't have a problem though.

345
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,590
So the doctor will rebuild
his mentality too, right?

346
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,010
- Exactly.
- The doctor will be trained too.

347
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,790
Now we have teams for Round One.

348
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,790
Please get changed before we start.

349
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,980
Okay.

350
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,890
(Team Dr. Yoo, Team Song Ji Hyo,
Team Jeon So Min, Team Ahn Hee Yeon)

351
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,590
- This is...
- It's a ring.

352
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,990
It's a ring.

353
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,670
Should I knock them down today?

354
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,440
Suk Jin, you should fight me.

355
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,940
What's this?

356
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,670
(The lovey-dovey couples
are coming into the place.)

357
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,730
Suk Jin, come over here.

358
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,040
I'm getting my microphone set.

359
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,240
You won't talk a lot anyway.

360
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,970
- I still need the microphone.
- We have the boom microphone.

361
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,240
- It's done.
- Okay.

362
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,970
- Stand in the middle.
- Why?

363
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,010
- I'm taking care of my members.
- Thank you.

364
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,320
- Come here.
- Stand at the end.

365
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,590
Thank you, Jae Suk.

366
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,160
Do you like your first team?

367
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,790
- Yes.
- Yes. I'm satisfied.

368
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,030
Here's the first mission...

369
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,330
that requires
your courage and hearing.

370
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,570
- It's called Cry in Zombies.
- What?

371
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,570
Two members of each team will play.

372
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,860
Two humans will...

373
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,080
play Cry in Silence
avoiding zombies.

374
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,210
The team that gets the most
correct answers will win the race.

375
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,600
It will be over once you get caught.

376
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,000
- We shouldn't get caught.
- One human...

377
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,550
will give quizzes outside the ring.

378
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,790
But the other human should
stay in the ring...

379
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,840
and give answers wearing earphones.

380
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,750
Two members of the other three teams
will be zombies in the ring.

381
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,750
Wearing eye masks,

382
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,060
they will catch
the human in the ring...

383
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,430
and induce the person's surrender.

384
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,530
The human's surrender.

385
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,200
If you surrender to the zombies...

386
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,440
or exceed the time limit of five
minutes, the game is over.

387
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,500
Okay. Good.

388
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,370
Can zombies touch humans?

389
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,580
You can press them
or pinch them if you want.

390
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,140
Don't say that.

391
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,600
We can tickle them.

392
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,710
- We should just tickle them.
- We can tickle them.

393
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,580
Why would we hit or pinch them?

394
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,510
You can do anything but biting.

395
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,880
- I see.
- All right.

396
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,980
- We're at a disadvantage.
- In Round One,

397
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,830
So Min and Ki Woong are the humans.

398
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,290
Okay. Let's go.

399
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,250
Please put on the earphones.

400
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,120
And the other teams should put on
eye masks and get on the ring.

401
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,260
Okay.

402
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,540
All right.

403
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,360
Put on the earphones.

404
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,100
I'll catch them,

405
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,600
twist their arms...

406
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,040
What?

407
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,580
Hit them.

408
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,080
Then I'll tickle them.

409
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,340
I'll put my fingers into the ribs.

410
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,010
(Then I'll tickle them.
I'll put my fingers into the ribs.)

411
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,340
Why do we have a first-aid box here?

412
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,610
- What does this mean?
- What is this?

413
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,290
Why do we have this here?

414
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,850
- Are we going to get hurt?
- What?

415
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,620
- Will someone get seriously hurt?
- That means I'll get hurt.

416
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,800
(Ki Woong will give answers,
so he put on the earphones.)

417
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,090
He can't hear us.

418
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,070
Ki Woong looks so weak.

419
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,230
All right.

420
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,840
It's worth a shot. Let's do this.

421
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,760
The second zombies are
Ji Hyo and Jong Kook.

422
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,470
And the third zombies are
Se Chan and Haha.

423
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,810
Ready.

424
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,600
Start.

425
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,680
(Urology)

426
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,550
Your new drama is about this.

427
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,450
- Hee Yeon, behind your back.
- In your drama.

428
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,640
- Here.
- The doctor.

429
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,060
The doctor in your drama.

430
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,350
(The zombies have no idea
where Ki Woong is.)

431
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,690
- Over here.
- The doctor in your drama.

432
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,430
- The opposite direction.
- The other way.

433
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,490
The doctor...

434
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,170
- The kind of doctor in the drama.
- That way.

435
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,200
- Behind you.
- The opposite direction.

436
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,300
- Si Yoon, in front of you.
- Run. Run that way.

437
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,360
- Run. Run forward!
- Go straight!

438
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,200
You got him!

439
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,730
You got him!

440
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,860
- No.
- No.

441
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,710
- Hey, Hani.
- Hani!

442
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,810
Hani, that's not him!

443
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,840
That's not him.

444
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,580
- Right. Go forward!
- Go forward.

445
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,340
To the left!

446
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,510
- A job!
- Over here!

447
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,840
- Forward.
- A job? Actor.

448
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,740
- No.
- Right there. You got him!

449
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,090
No. The character.
What's the character's job?

450
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,880
- A doctor. A psychiatrist.
- Behind you.

451
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,330
- Corner him.
- No. What specialty?

452
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,560
That's not him!

453
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,590
(Ki Woong passes them, and 3 seconds
later the zombies begin fighting.)

454
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,660
My gosh, Yoon Si Yoon!

455
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,070
It's not this way.
Si Yoon, that way.

456
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,830
- Hani, behind you!
- A specialty for men.

457
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,170
- Comedians.
- No.

458
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,860
- Move forward!
- Forward!

459
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,940
No. That's not him!

460
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,500
The second team will go in now.

461
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,280
- That's us.
- Ki Woong, it's for men!

462
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,370
- Listen to my voice.
- I got it.

463
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,780
- I'm going to listen to Jae Suk.
- Where should I go?

464
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,640
To the left. Straight.

465
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,710
- Go straight!
- Just listen to me.

466
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,110
- Speak one at a time.
- To the left.

467
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,550
- To the left.
- Haha, to the left.

468
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,690
Urologist.

469
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,980
- This way.
- Over here.

470
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,320
Beer... You have peanuts...

471
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,660
- You eat it with beer and peanuts.
- It's me, Haha.

472
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,830
- Zombies stick out your arms.
- Beer, peanuts, and...

473
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,750
Go all the way to the right.

474
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,220
(Right?)

475
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,390
You got him.

476
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,860
- Beer, peanuts, and...
- You got him!

477
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,230
- Go to the right!
- Ki Woong!

478
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,360
- Si Yoon. To the right.
- No.

479
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,700
- To your right.
- Squid.

480
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,910
Behind you.

481
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,040
- Haha!
- Haha!

482
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,170
You got it!

483
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,280
- Where is he?
- It's me.

484
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,040
- You got it. Haha.
- Hold hands and move forward.

485
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,410
- Like this.
- It's me. Se Chan.

486
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,680
- Go in a line!
- Let's hold hands!

487
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,840
- Where are you?
- In a line.

488
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,420
- Over here.
- Let's hold hands. Don't move.

489
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,840
Okay. He's standing behind you.

490
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,210
- Who is this?
- He's behind us.

491
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,420
- He's standing behind you.
- Who is this?

492
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,480
(They're playing
ring-around-the-rosie.)

493
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,060
It's me. Si Yoon.

494
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,330
- Turn around.
- Okay.

495
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,530
The third zombie team is going in.

496
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,990
- Behind you!
- Do we go in?

497
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,300
It's a bird that can repeat words.

498
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,570
A puppet boss?

499
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,260
- It's a bird that can repeat words.
- Behind you!

500
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,990
- Behind us!
- You got him!

501
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,540
In front of you...

502
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,730
Hold hands like that.

503
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,470
Haha! Behind you!

504
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,230
A bird. A colorful bird.

505
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,640
- Who is this?
- It's me, Haha.

506
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,810
Go forward towards your left.

507
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,680
A colorful bird.

508
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,780
An alcoholic?

509
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,880
A colorful bird.

510
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,980
- A bird that can repeat words.
- He's standing to your left.

511
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,190
- My right.
- Your left!

512
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,690
- A bird that can repeat words.
- He's standing to your left!

513
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,090
- To your left!
- To your left!

514
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,160
I got him!

515
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,200
- Where?
- Oh, no!

516
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
I got him!

517
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,890
Where? How did you get him?

518
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,960
- Who was it?
- How did you get him?

519
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,430
I give up!

520
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,170
I give up!

521
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,760
- I give up!
- Oh, gosh.

522
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,080
He was right here?

523
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,730
You got two right.

524
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,840
I don't know.

525
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,210
- Nice.
- This is really hard.

526
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,810
You guys got two questions right.

527
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,550
- How could you only get two right?
- What was the last one?

528
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,840
Parrot.

529
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,640
This time it's Ahn Hee Yeon
and Yoon Si Yoon.

530
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,710
(It's Team Ahn Hee Yeon's turn
to be humans.)

531
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,690
He stayed close to the person giving
the hints because he couldn't hear.

532
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,930
- Right.
- Get close to...

533
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,960
the person giving hints.

534
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,890
Someone should stay by
the person giving the hints. Right?

535
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,700
I'll give you the questions.

536
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,720
I'll stay by Hani.

537
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,740
- I'll follow Hani around.
- Ready.

538
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,660
Start.

539
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,840
Hani is right here!

540
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,840
(Hani's fan appears.)

541
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,600
- Hani is right here!
- Hani is right here!

542
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,550
- To the left. Right. That way!
- Hani is right here!

543
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,780
Hani is right here!

544
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,220
- Chicken.
- Hani is right here!

545
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,220
Fingers.

546
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,290
- Hani! Hani is right here!
- Fingers...

547
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,990
- No!
- Hani is right here!

548
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,490
- Hani is right here!
- Over there.

549
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,680
- Chicken.
- Hani is right here!

550
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,260
- Ostrich.
- Hani is right here!

551
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,420
- Hani is right here!
- What is it?

552
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,390
- Feet!
- Hani is right here!

553
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,800
Chicken leg. Chicken.

554
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,130
My gosh!

555
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,500
- Hani is right here!
- What is that?

556
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,570
What is this?

557
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,630
Hani!

558
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,900
Chicken. Chicken feet!

559
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,040
- Chicken feet!
- Hani is right here!

560
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,630
(They finally get 1 question right.)

561
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,080
- Second team.
- Okay.

562
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,510
- Second team, go in.
- Go in.

563
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,110
- Where are you, Haha?
- I can see you.

564
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,110
Hani is right here!

565
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,490
(While everyone's busy, the protein zombie
focuses on the sounds.)

566
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,550
- Over here!
- Hani is right here!

567
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,320
Jong Kook, stick out your arm!
Behind you!

568
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,090
You got him!

569
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,380
Behind you! You got him!

570
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,850
(He falls to the ground after
being grabbed by the venomous snake.)

571
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,920
He got him.

572
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,420
- He got him.
- It's over.

573
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,470
- Did he get him?
- He did.

574
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,130
He's not giving up!

575
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,700
- Archery.
- Hurry!

576
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,740
You can do it!
Team Korea, you can do it!

577
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,600
- Who is this?
- It's...

578
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,200
- Who is this?
- Where is he?

579
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,940
- Who is this?
- A little bit more!

580
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,440
- It's Jong Kook!
- Where are you?

581
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,840
It's me!

582
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,110
- Where are you?
- That's me, and he's here.

583
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,110
- I'm holding onto him!
- Where?

584
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,220
Give up!

585
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,030
(Grasshopper zombie is doing
martial arts on his own.)

586
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,830
- It's me!
- Where are you?

587
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,190
That's me, and he's here.

588
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,300
- I give up!
- Don't.

589
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,890
- Stop!
- I give up!

590
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,070
He gives up!

591
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,690
Who is that? Who kept hitting me?

592
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,090
- Was I hitting you?
- Hey.

593
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,860
(He kept punching someone
without knowing who it was.)

594
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,430
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry about that.

595
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,130
No wonder I kept hearing
sounds from in front of me.

596
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,080
- I hit you really hard.
- Really?

597
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,750
(Ssaebssaeb was blinded
by the eye mask.)

598
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,840
Yoon Si Yoon got one question right.

599
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,020
(Team Ahn Hee Yeon got
1 question right.)

600
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,820
Si Yoon. What happened?

601
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,090
Right.

602
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,590
I hit him in his pressure points.

603
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,380
Se Chan and Haha will go first.

604
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,420
- "Love letter" in Korean.
- Zombies!

605
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,090
Zombies, clap!

606
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,150
Love letter.

607
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,800
(The zombies created
their own signal.)

608
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,540
Then we won't attack other zombies.

609
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,970
- Where is he?
- Four syllables.

610
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,100
- What is it?
- That's me.

611
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,840
- It's me.
- We have to talk.

612
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,280
It's over.

613
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,430
They got five questions right.

614
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,780
That was okay.

615
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,870
Yoo Jae Suk's nickname.

616
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,410
- This.
- Grasshopper.

617
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,720
The hair that grows
in Suk Jin's ears.

618
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,050
- Old man hair.
- Right.

619
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,260
The shot that Suk Jin got.

620
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,730
- Pfizer? Vaccine?
- What did you just do?

621
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,420
(That hurt.)

622
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,000
(Thanks to the weak zombies...)

623
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,860
It's over.

624
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,120
They got nine questions right.

625
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,190
Suk Jin will go in for our team.

626
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,500
- Okay.
- Right.

627
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,430
Really? Shouldn't you go in?

628
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,740
What are you saying?

629
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,370
- He's a doctor.
- Oh, right. Dr. Yoo.

630
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,430
That's right.

631
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,170
This team got 5 right, so if they
get 4 more, they'll be tied for 1st.

632
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,820
(If they get 4 right,
they'll be tied for 1st.)

633
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,870
If they get five...

634
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,320
- We can get 4 right.
- Let's get 4 right.

635
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,380
- Just get 4 questions right.
- We need 4 questions.

636
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,450
Four questions.

637
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,610
I'm going to catch him.

638
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,920
- Ready.
- I'm going to catch him.

639
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,990
Start.

640
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,300
We need to catch him.

641
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,260
We need to catch him.

642
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,190
(Answer: Giraffe)

643
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,270
Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo's nickname.

644
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,800
- Kwang Soo.
- I can't hear you.

645
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,000
- Kwang Soo.
- He can't get that close.

646
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,270
- Kwang Soo.
- I can't hear you.

647
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,270
(Is he over here?)

648
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,600
What's Kwang Soo's nickname?

649
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,930
- Kwang Soo.
- I can't hear you.

650
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,780
(I hear him. I can hear him.)

651
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,100
- That close?
- Kwang Soo's nickname.

652
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,820
- It has a long neck...
- Giraffe!

653
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,840
- He's coming this way.
- That's right. Giraffe.

654
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,020
(He focuses his hearing
on Suk Jin's voice.)

655
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,220
- Right.
- You got him.

656
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,250
- Giraffe!
- That's right. Giraffe.

657
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,260
- Giraffe.
- He's coming this way.

658
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,490
(Big Nose shows off his agility
as he avoids him.)

659
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,650
Se Chan.

660
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,620
Se Chan's feet.

661
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,300
Move forward.

662
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,130
(They begin cornering Big Nose
thanks to Si Yoon's coaching.)

663
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,570
Keep going forward.
To the left. That's right.

664
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,270
- Se Chan's feet!
- Sit down!

665
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,570
Keep going forward.
To the left. That's right.

666
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,740
(Laying down?)

667
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,200
We got him!

668
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,940
(Big Nose cornered himself
by lying down.)

669
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,250
- You can torture him now.
- That's too bad.

670
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,370
- Keep torturing him.
- Let's keep going.

671
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,750
- Se Chan's feet!
- There you go.

672
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,090
Se Chan's feet!

673
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,320
- Darn.
- It's over.

674
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,110
(A move that gets rid of
his teammate's enthusiasm.)

675
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,260
- Just endure it!
- Okay.

676
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,590
(They try to get him to endure it,)

677
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,760
(but he's already pretending like
it hurts a lot.)

678
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,730
- Enough. I give up.
- The...

679
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,000
- The...
- I give up.

680
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,300
- How annoying.
- He's...

681
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,660
He's surprised.

682
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,860
- Suk Jin...
- How boring.

683
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,970
Ki Woong twisted his arm.

684
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,770
- He was surprised.
- It really hurt!

685
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,280
- Wait.
- It really hurt!

686
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,340
- You got one question right.
- Hold on.

687
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,640
- Wait.
- Was it stinky feet?

688
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,050
Stinky feet.

689
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,320
- How could you get caught so fast?
- You should've rolled.

690
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,410
- Wait.
- I should've gone in.

691
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,020
Why did you lay down?

692
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,020
(Nobody can understand that.)

693
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,950
It's easy to avoid two people.
Why did you do that?

694
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,020
Gosh. I know.

695
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,560
He was shocked
when his arm got twisted.

696
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,790
Suk Jin!

697
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,380
It hurts!

698
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,850
- Suk Jin!
- Right, my arm! Where is he?

699
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:06,920
Ki Woong.

700
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Hey! How could you put me
in an armbar for real?

701
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,090
- I'm sorry.
- Stop pretending.

702
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,540
Let me go again. Hey.

703
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,040
I'll go again when it's your turn.

704
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,540
- It's over.
- It's over.

705
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,310
- What do you mean you'll go again?
- It's over?

706
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,400
Okay. As a result, Ji Hyo
and Jong Kook are in first place.

707
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,480
Okay.

708
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,910
In second place is Jae Suk's team.

709
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,050
- That's not bad.
- Okay.

710
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:29,090
In third place is Jeon So Min
and Park Ki Woong,

711
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,820
and in fourth place is Yoon Si Yoon
and Ahn Hee Yeon.

712
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,180
- We're not in last place.
- We're not in last place.

713
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,950
- Team leaders, divide the points.
- Okay.

714
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,390
- Do whatever you want. It's okay.
- I did my best, Jae Suk.

715
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,620
- So Min, 20 points.
- Don't abuse your power.

716
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,570
- It's the first game, so be fair.
- Of course.

717
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,430
- Who's giving out the points?
- The team leader.

718
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,660
- The team leader.
- Hey.

719
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,690
Mr. Yoo.

720
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,900
I don't think Suk Jin
will get anything.

721
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,480
Jae Suk, we get to appoint someone
at the end, so...

722
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,040
- That's right.
- We get to appoint someone,

723
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,280
but you should still think about
what's best.

724
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,480
We shouldn't get to appoint people,
but we can.

725
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,050
Just do whatever you want.

726
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,520
- I think you should be first place.
- Me too.

727
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,850
You could get first place
and avoid the penalty.

728
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,880
Earlier...

729
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,060
(The other team leaders
divide up the points too.)

730
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,650
- Jae Suk gave a lot.
- I really did.

731
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,650
Jae Suk, can you show
the camera yours first?

732
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,260
- My gosh.
- That's a lot.

733
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,270
- It's okay.
- Why did you give me four points?

734
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,770
- Hold on...
- Are you...

735
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,590
I gave you a lot more
than you deserved.

736
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,300
- What's with the four points?
- That's a lot.

737
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,360
It is.

738
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,430
I divided it in half, 20-20.

739
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,080
- Really?
- My gosh.

740
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,100
Heart!

741
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,130
Thanks.

742
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,780
- It's because we just got together.
- Give it to me.

743
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,750
Isn't this too much?

744
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,280
- Why?
- Just accept it.

745
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,340
Hee Yeon, can you show us yours?

746
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,610
(Team Ahn Hee Yeon reveals
theirs next.)

747
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,020
(Team leader: Ahn Hee Yeon, 3 points
Member: Yoon Si Yoon, 7 points)

748
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,150
- What is that?
- What is that?

749
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,620
- What's with you two?
- What is this?

750
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,530
- I feel bad. It's a joint effort.
- What's with you two?

751
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,920
- How sweet.
- She divided it 7 to 3.

752
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,620
- Next up is Jeon So Min.
- A heart.

753
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,190
I gave him a lot.

754
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,390
My gosh.

755
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,500
- I really gave him a lot.
- It's okay.

756
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,240
- He only got two right.
- He said it's okay.

757
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,310
- No, wait...
- How are you okay?

758
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,600
- I didn't do well.
- He didn't do very well.

759
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,430
- That's right. It's all good.
- Right.

760
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,050
The first round is over.

761
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,840
You can change partners now.

762
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,640
Ji Hyo came in first place,

763
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,990
so she can trade Jong Kook
for someone else.

764
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,910
- She won't trade him.
- Of course not.

765
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,320
- I did my best.
- Right.

766
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,450
Does anyone want Jong Kook?

767
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,680
- What is that?
- Why would you ask that?

768
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,620
- I wanted to know if anyone did.
- If you don't want to, don't.

769
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,620
(Ji Hyo conducts a survey.)

770
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,660
Kiss!

771
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,090
- Keep your partner.
- What's the next game?

772
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,300
I can't tell you.

773
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,770
Right. He can't.

774
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,430
I don't think there's anyone,
so I'll keep him.

775
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,200
(She said she'd accept him,
but she's being more forward.)

776
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,440
- Love power!
- Power!

777
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,980
(Glaring)

778
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,820
- Can I trade?
- Yes,

779
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,750
but you can't touch Jong Kook.

780
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,250
Yoon Si Yoon.

781
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,720
This is a predictable move
from So Min.

782
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,020
- You're unbelievable.
- What?

783
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,030
Why? He did his best!

784
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,150
- Wait. He did his best, but...
- Ki Woong did his best.

785
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,620
- He did his best.
- I know he did...

786
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,160
- his best.
- He did his best.

787
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,530
So Min is so scary.

788
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,800
The two of them will switch.

789
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,070
I'm not even surprised.

790
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,570
- Memories are just memories.
- Right.

791
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,130
- He did his best...
- Next, Hee Yeon...

792
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,810
can trade Ki Woong with
one of those three.

793
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,870
Are you going to trade?

794
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,050
You have a lot of options.

795
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,550
You have a lot of options. Why?

796
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,610
- You have a lot of options.
- Do whatever you want.

797
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,610
- There's a variety.
- They get bored of their partners.

798
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,880
Se Chan's a good partner.

799
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,910
(It's a chance to escape
Dr. Yoo's nagging.)

800
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,520
If she chooses Se Chan or Haha,

801
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,260
- it'll be bad.
- I'll go with this.

802
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,090
(She's not going to trade.)

803
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,420
Why?

804
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,060
- Let's use the replacement card.
- Give us a chance!

805
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,070
(Jae Suk, the replacement card.)

806
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,470
- Can you use the replacement card?
- With whom?

807
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,740
- You have a replacement card.
- I do.

808
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,160
Change those guys up.

809
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,100
Change the people who are trying
to start something romantic...

810
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,100
like So Min.

811
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,670
Please use a replacement card,
Dr. Yoo!

812
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,780
I'll trade Yoon Si Yoon
with Ji Suk Jin.

813
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,250
- Why?
- Perfect!

814
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,940
(She went from paradise...)

815
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,640
(to a nightmare.)

816
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,290
- That's great!
- Why?

817
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,410
That's great. You're so wise!

818
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,850
- Okay!
- You're amazing, Dr. Yoo!

819
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,350
You're so wise!

820
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,730
- With her?
- Suk Jin!

821
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,420
- Hey!
- Then...

822
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,160
give me anyone but Suk Jin.

823
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,470
Hey.

824
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,090
How can you say that
when I'm within earshot?

825
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,390
I can hear everything.

826
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,200
He can hear!

827
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,570
Nice.

828
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,480
- Nice ears!
- Nice hearing aids!

829
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,780
Nice ears!

830
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,580
- Okay. Nice.
- Very good!

831
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,550
We'll move onto the location
for the next mission.

832
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,750
- Okay.
- Yes.

833
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,940
This place is nice.

834
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,720
Is the mission outside?
Oh, it's there.

835
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,820
(Everyone comes together
for the next mission.)

836
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,410
This place is really nice.

837
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,560
- It's as if we're outdoors.
- Right.

838
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,380
With Si Yoon on our team...

839
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,500
- He looks more handsome, right?
- Exactly.

840
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,560
You should be glad to join our team.

841
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,300
Plus, he's sitting
between me and Jae Suk.

842
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,160
The seat that makes you
look most handsome.

843
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,570
It doesn't matter
what team I'm on...

844
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,070
as long as I get plenty of airtime.

845
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,540
- He's a pro.
- That's a great mentality.

846
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,010
- That's a great mentality.
- Your experience shows.

847
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,280
He's a pro.

848
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,670
It's obvious he's been on
a weekend variety show.

849
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,840
That mentality comes from people
who've done this for ten years.

850
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,220
How incredible.

851
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,940
Why are you having such a hard time
putting that on?

852
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,750
- Just put it anywhere.
- It's a clip.

853
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,250
Just clip it on here.

854
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,850
My gosh.

855
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,990
This mission...

856
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,260
is a chance to get personal points.

857
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,560
The game is
As Long as It’s Not My Partner.

858
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
What is it?

859
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,090
This mission is very easy.

860
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,030
We're going to play Mafia,

861
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,970
- a game you're all familiar with.
- Okay.

862
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,470
We're going to randomly choose...

863
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,930
- two Mafia members.
- This sounds fun.

864
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,360
You'll play three rounds, and if
you catch all the Mafia members,

865
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,840
- the citizens will win.
- Okay.

866
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,310
But here's the thing.

867
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,140
If the Mafia wins,

868
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,910
- they will get 50 points,
- Really?

869
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,440
and the citizens will lose
ten points each.

870
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,250
If your partner was chosen
as a Mafia member,

871
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,720
you will lose 30 points.

872
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,850
That's terrible!

873
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,150
I have three partners!

874
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,730
So you'll split up into two.

875
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,830
In teams of two?

876
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,800
How do you want to split up?

877
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,970
We'll split up based on looks.

878
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,070
- Then it's us two.
- Then I'm...

879
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,070
Then the two of us will be a team.

880
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,160
- Why would you say that?
- Hey!

881
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,360
Then we'll end up together.

882
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,670
(Walking)

883
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,430
- We'll end up together.
- I'm dumbfounded.

884
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,480
- Come to the middle.
- It's me and Si Yoon!

885
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,550
- Come over here.
- Move.

886
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,820
- Why would you say that?
- I know.

887
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,550
- Why'd you say that?
- You have high self-esteem.

888
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,550
- It's not a matter of self-esteem.
- Honestly...

889
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,450
- He's in 1st place.
- I'm in 2nd.

890
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,090
- Right.
- You guys are funny.

891
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,150
But we can't choose
3rd and 4th place.

892
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,260
No. I'm in third place.

893
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,060
It's obvious we're in
1st and 2nd place.

894
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,030
Who's in fourth place?

895
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,570
- Hold on.
- He's talking about himself.

896
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,860
I'm dumbfounded.

897
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,360
My gosh, you guys are really funny.

898
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
Okay. The key point of this game...

899
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,930
is to figure out whether or not...

900
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,540
- your partner is a Mafia.
- Right.

901
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,580
- You have to figure that out.
- That's important.

902
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,580
- You shouldn't do that.
- I shouldn't do this.

903
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,440
If the Mafia loses,
they lose 30 points,

904
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,820
and the citizens
gain ten points each.

905
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,050
We're going to choose
two Mafia members randomly.

906
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,250
You can't lie.

907
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,090
Don't do anything weird, okay?

908
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,610
- Don't do something randomly.
- I...

909
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,530
I should turn my radar on.

910
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,690
It won't be fair...

911
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,330
if you gave your partner a sign,
right?

912
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,160
- You can't do that.
- You can't.

913
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,190
You can't give them a sign.

914
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,470
(How good are the members
who have 11 years of experience?)

915
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,840
- Should I choose one?
- Yes.

916
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,160
- Suk Jin...
- And...

917
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,670
turn away from the camera and look.

918
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,980
Turn away from the camera.

919
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,670
Then I could get more.

920
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,700
Check it.

921
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,410
(He checked it.)

922
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,180
- It is.
- It'll be hard to guess.

923
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,790
Okay. He's awkward.
Si Yoon is acting awkward.

924
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,150
- Okay.
- Okay.

925
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,560
Next up is Haha.

926
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,290
(The moment they go up, their speech
and expressions are all suspicious.)

927
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,420
(Haha's turn is next.)

928
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,090
- Keep an eye on him.
- Mr. Dirty Mustache.

929
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,420
Mr. Dirty Mustache. Hey, Mr. DM.

930
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,420
(Focused)

931
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,570
Hey, Mr. DM.

932
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
Watch his expression.

933
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,100
- He looks awkward.
- He's a citizen.

934
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,430
- He looked at it quickly.
- The third handsome guy is next.

935
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,810
(The Running Man members know
each other too well.)

936
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:35,080
(Se Chan checks
with poker face next.)

937
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,440
(Next is Jae Suk.)

938
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
Look at his expression.

939
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,180
(Laughing)

940
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,450
He's flustered.

941
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,730
- He's flustered.
- He's flustered.

942
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,150
- What's wrong?
- He's flustered.

943
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,830
- He's flustered.
- He's a Mafia.

944
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,190
- He's very flustered.
- I'm not.

945
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,190
- This is random?
- When he denied it,

946
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,570
- it sounded like he was lying.
- I'm a citizen.

947
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,130
- I'm not.
- Everyone stops talking after.

948
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,930
This is random,
so it's hard to tell.

949
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,430
See? Nobody is talking.

950
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,010
- You can tell it's not me, right?
- You guys are weird.

951
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:09,550
(So Min, who's next...)

952
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,980
(is a citizen!)

953
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,640
(So Min's partner, Big Nose,
is also a citizen.)

954
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,560
- Hee Yeon?
- Gosh, no way.

955
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,330
Why would you open your eyes
so wide?

956
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,990
- Millstone Guy.
- Don't take the card out.

957
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,150
(Millstone Guy Ki Woong is...)

958
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,030
- "Millstone Guy". That's hilarious.
- Millstone Guy.

959
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,270
Millstone Guy.

960
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,890
(a citizen.)

961
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,930
- "Family Guy" and Millstone Guy!
- Millstone Guy!

962
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,160
(Everyone is done checking.)

963
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,270
Millstone Guy.

964
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,740
(These four are all citizens.)

965
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,630
It's not me.

966
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,670
Let's not lie to each other.

967
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,100
I promise.

968
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,520
- You're not, right?
- I'm not.

969
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,840
- You're not, right?
- This is hard because it's random.

970
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,910
- Be honest with me.
- I'm not. I'm really not.

971
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,260
We need to find the Mafia.

972
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,450
- Are you a Mafia?
- I'm not.

973
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,260
Then why did you say that before?

974
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,530
Were you anxious?

975
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,090
- Right.
- Really?

976
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,620
It's a habit.

977
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,920
- I do that habitually.
- Okay.

978
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,540
Okay. The Mafia needs to find out
who one another is.

979
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,130
Close your eyes
and lower your heads.

980
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,130
- Okay.
- Okay.

981
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:13,280
Mafia, open your eyes
and make eye contact.

982
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,400
Mafia, raise your heads.

983
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:18,020
(The Running Man members
who are well-versed in spy games...)

984
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,840
(and actors who are great at acting)

985
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,820
(Who are the 2 Mafia members?)

986
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,650
(The 2 Mafia members checked
each other's identities.)

987
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,060
- Everyone, wake up.
- Okay.

988
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,000
- Who raised their heads?
- I told you it wasn't me.

989
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,570
I felt some movement earlier
coming from Jae Suk.

990
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,030
It wasn't me.

991
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,860
- Are you saying it was me?
- I felt it.

992
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,390
I heard the wind.

993
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,660
I think that it's Si Yoon and...

994
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,080
- Hani.
- Jae Suk.

995
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
Se Chan.

996
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,280
- Why? Tell me why.
- Why do you think that?

997
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,140
They're both acting strange.

998
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,910
Si Yoon seems like a Mafia member.

999
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,050
I think Si Yoon is a Mafia.

1000
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,410
He's been zoned out
since he came back to his seat.

1001
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,550
- Right.
- Okay.

1002
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,290
I don't think it's Si Yoon.
He seems really stable.

1003
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,760
You look really stable.

1004
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,180
- Why is he so zoned out?
- I don't know.

1005
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,180
Is it you?

1006
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,760
(Is it you?)

1007
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,850
- Me?
- Yes.

1008
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,860
(He's not.)

1009
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,970
- He's not.
- Why are you covering for him?

1010
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,660
- What is this?
- Why are you covering for him?

1011
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,160
- I told her it wasn't me.
- "My husband didn't do it."

1012
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,840
- I told her it wasn't me.
- I always...

1013
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,540
- They're a Mafia Couple.
- They're a Mafia Couple.

1014
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,540
- Mafia Couple.
- Couple.

1015
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,940
Okay.

1016
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,810
- Mafia Couple.
- It's the two of us?

1017
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,520
- But...
- It might...

1018
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,840
Ji Hyo is the hardest to figure out
in games like this.

1019
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,020
Right. She doesn't talk.

1020
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,990
- She doesn't talk much.
- It's not me. I promise.

1021
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,650
She told me earlier,
and I don't think it's her.

1022
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,850
- If it's not, kiss. Kiss her.
- I'm being honest.

1023
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,260
- I'm being honest. It's not me.
- Hold on.

1024
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,560
I'm being honest.

1025
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,800
I think Se Chan...

1026
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,390
- Why is she targeting me?
- People...

1027
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,660
can fool people with their words,

1028
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,040
but their behavior...

1029
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,670
How can she tell by my expression?
We barely know each other.

1030
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,280
- I thought you were weird too.
- His poses.

1031
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,640
- It's not me.
- You punk.

1032
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,940
- It's not me. This is a mistake.
- She's making good deductions.

1033
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,250
- I'm telling you he is.
- He looks nervous.

1034
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,820
It's not me. I swear.
Don't target me. This is a mistake.

1035
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,940
- I'm 100 percent sure.
- When I get targeted...

1036
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,260
- That behavior.
- When you targeted me last time,

1037
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,760
I turned red because I wasn't it.
Remember?

1038
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,290
When people target me, I turn red.

1039
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,120
It's not him. He's like that.

1040
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,060
- I think...
- It's not me.

1041
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,830
- it's my partner...
- It's not me.

1042
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,030
Can I make a deduction?

1043
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,090
I'm 100 percent sure
it's Yang Se Chan.

1044
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,660
- There he goes again.
- No.

1045
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,770
- Okay. I'll explain.
- I'm 100 percent sure.

1046
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,270
- This is it.
- I'm 100 percent sure.

1047
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,430
- Mafia targets people...
- I'm 100 percent sure.

1048
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,670
Talk faster.

1049
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,870
Look. He can't talk.
I'm 100 percent sure. Go ahead.

1050
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,410
They have to target one person
and kill them off...

1051
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,050
- to lower the possibility.
- No way.

1052
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,410
I think that it's either
you or So Min.

1053
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,820
- It's not me.
- Either you talk a lot...

1054
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,060
or you don't at all.

1055
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,520
Okay, I...

1056
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,090
- knew it was my partner right away.
- Where are you touching?

1057
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,150
I was trying to feel your heartbeat,

1058
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,230
- It was my nipple.
- but I felt something bumpy...

1059
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,830
- He kept touching me.
- Stop touching people!

1060
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,830
- What?
- Hey!

1061
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,190
It's located higher than yours
for most people!

1062
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,430
(He tries to counterattack
Low-chested.)

1063
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,430
Don't touch people according
to your standards.

1064
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,040
No, it was bumpy, so...

1065
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,430
I was wondering
what he was doing all of a sudden.

1066
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,550
- Wait!
- Stop it.

1067
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,340
- You're anxious right now!
- No.

1068
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,280
- He's anxious right now.
- Or he liked it!

1069
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,410
It's because I take after my dad!

1070
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,640
They're pointy.

1071
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,850
- Really?
- Haha...

1072
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:13,990
Hold on. He must've been really
bored during his self-quarantine.

1073
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:15,320
You know it.

1074
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,930
He racked up a phone bill
of 2,000 dollars.

1075
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,490
- Because of you, news articles...
- Isn't that a bit too much?

1076
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,890
(Because of you, news articles...)

1077
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,990
- That's a waste of money.
- Unbelievable.

1078
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,490
Can he be any more annoying?

1079
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,030
Isn't Jae Suk a Mafia member?

1080
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,530
- No way.
- It's either Jae Suk...

1081
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,600
- or Haha.
- Hold on.

1082
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,300
- Jae Suk...
- He's slightly flushed.

1083
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,680
He's a Mafia.

1084
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,800
- Come on.
- Are you?

1085
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,010
Suspecting me
only helps those in the Mafia.

1086
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,780
- I suspect So Min.
- Out of the blue?

1087
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,050
- That was sudden.
- Why me all of a sudden?

1088
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,050
That was odd.

1089
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,410
- It was out of the blue.
- Hear me out.

1090
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,640
- It's you.
- It's Jae Suk!

1091
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,780
If you're a citizen,

1092
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,820
- don't act out.
- He's terrible at this game.

1093
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,890
- Hear me out.
- You're confusing us.

1094
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:48,260
- Go ahead.
- Hear me out.

1095
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,350
It's Jae Suk and Haha.

1096
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,160
What are the odds, right?

1097
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,660
- Why do you think it's me?
- Just remember...

1098
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,220
that the Mafia
keeps suspecting others.

1099
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,470
- It's like this.
- You...

1100
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,870
- I'm sure of it.
- It's Si Yoon.

1101
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,640
- It's the most handsome member.
- It has to be Si Yoon.

1102
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,160
- I'm sure of it.
- It's Si Yoon.

1103
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,070
(The most handsome member
is suspected once again.)

1104
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,370
Why do you think it's me?

1105
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,470
Because...

1106
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,280
you're not the silent type.

1107
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,200
- Exactly.
- He was talkative during the intro.

1108
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,740
He came here with one goal
and that's to have...

1109
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,780
a lot of screen time.

1110
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,910
Si Yoon, you're awfully quiet.

1111
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,180
- Tell me about it.
- That's not it.

1112
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,950
That's not it.
Besides, I'm a citizen.

1113
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,660
- How he's sitting is questionable.
- The one...

1114
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,890
who suspects me...

1115
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,950
- is most likely in the Mafia.
- No way.

1116
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,990
- He never sits like this.
- It's always...

1117
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,620
the one sitting at ease
with his legs crossed.

1118
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,570
Yours is crossed too.

1119
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:30,990
There you go.

1120
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,640
It's Suk Jin.

1121
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,100
For me, it's a habit.

1122
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,740
- We'll begin the first trial.
- Let's do this.

1123
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,780
I'm clueless though.

1124
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,850
- Choose one person on my count.
- Just one?

1125
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,180
- Yes, one.
- One for now.

1126
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,450
- Then...
- This isn't easy.

1127
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,970
All right. One...

1128
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,620
I wonder who it is.

1129
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,220
Two...

1130
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:54,890
(Is one of the 3 suspects
a member of the Mafia?)

1131
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,260
Three.

1132
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,430
Si Yoon.

1133
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,570
- Three.
- Si Yoon.

1134
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,660
- Hold on a second.
- Who chose Si Yoon?

1135
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,760
- It's Si Yoon.
- Si Yoon.

1136
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,160
- Then Si Yoon is on trial first.
- It's not him.

1137
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,600
- He'll get to say his last words.
- It's him.

1138
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,840
I'm a citizen.

1139
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,950
If that proves to be true...

1140
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,970
The one who chose you.

1141
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,550
A member of the Mafia is among those
who were suspected with me.

1142
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,990
- I'm sure it's him.
- He seems nervous.

1143
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,180
His hands are clasped.

1144
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,590
Should we go through with it?

1145
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,450
Yes, we should.

1146
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,550
Is he the one?

1147
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,390
Point your thumb down
if you choose to eliminate him.

1148
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,050
- In 1, 2...
- Down?

1149
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,490
- Does this mark death?
- Yes, point it down.

1150
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,620
In 1, 2, 3.

1151
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,660
Let's see how it goes.

1152
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,160
(They choose to eliminate him.)

1153
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,530
- We couldn't help it.
- All right.

1154
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,510
Now, please all drop your heads...

1155
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,570
- and close your eyes.
- I wonder who it is.

1156
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,970
All right.

1157
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,970
Is Si Yoon...

1158
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,850
a member of the Mafia?

1159
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:54,450
(Is Si Yoon a member of the Mafia?)

1160
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,560
Yes, he is.

1161
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,040
(Si Yoon is a member of the Mafia.)

1162
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,700
(They got it right.)

1163
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,850
What did I tell you?

1164
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,410
I knew something was off.

1165
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,270
- What did I tell you?
- He was acting strange.

1166
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,120
- He never sits this way.
- It's like I said.

1167
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,140
(The unlucky Si Yoon
was eliminated right away.)

1168
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,410
Then who's his partner?

1169
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,020
(After finding out what he was,)

1170
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,930
(he talked less and tried to look
like he was suspecting others.)

1171
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,660
(His tactics got
the best of him though.)

1172
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,830
(He became the most anxious man
in the room.)

1173
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,560
(No way)

1174
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,910
What did I tell you?

1175
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,010
(Their hunch even works
on the guests.)

1176
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,470
It's like I said.

1177
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,700
- I'm shocked.
- Please take your seats.

1178
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,850
It's now the Mafia's turn
to eliminate someone.

1179
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,120
- See?
- You...

1180
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,450
There's no one to trust
in this world.

1181
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,040
- What did I tell you?
- I knew almost immediately.

1182
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,240
Everyone, please drop your heads.

1183
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,890
Only the Mafia member
will look up...

1184
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,950
and choose someone to eliminate.

1185
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,430
You can point.

1186
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,520
(The remaining member of the Mafia
chose an innocent citizen.)

1187
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,350
It's now morning.

1188
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,660
- Can we look up?
- Sure thing.

1189
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,790
During the first night,
Jae Suk was eliminated.

1190
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,390
(Citizen Jae Suk is out.)

1191
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,160
Were you a citizen?

1192
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,040
Gosh, he was a citizen.

1193
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,270
- He was a citizen.
- No way.

1194
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,580
It proves just how on point I was.

1195
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,770
(Innocent citizen Jae Suk is out.)

1196
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:24,470
(The list of potential Mafia members
is now shorter.)

1197
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,720
(Who was the Mafia member
that eliminated Jae Suk?)

1198
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,120
Let me say something important.

1199
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,180
It's hard to point at anyone...

1200
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,450
since the Mafia can't speak
or mouth the name.

1201
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,330
That's why it must be
someone in Jae Suk's vicinity.

1202
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,520
Hear me out as well.

1203
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,700
He either did this...

1204
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,430
- See what I mean?
- Hear me out.

1205
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,700
- This is what I think.
- Sure.

1206
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,890
I kept on saying it's Se Chan.

1207
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,060
It has to be Se Chan.

1208
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,700
- He keeps on...
- Eliminating Jae Suk...

1209
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,700
It'd look suspicious
if he eliminated me.

1210
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,700
- I was going to say that.
- That's why...

1211
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,450
he eliminated Jae Suk instead.

1212
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,350
- It's like this.
- Let me just say that...

1213
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,450
we're all citizens over here.

1214
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,020
It doesn't have to be someone close.

1215
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,850
- Wait.
- It's not that hard to point.

1216
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,810
- Are your ears okay?
- It really isn't me.

1217
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,020
Hear me out.

1218
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,160
If I were a Mafia member,

1219
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,350
I wouldn't be able to eliminate
the one who suspected me.

1220
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,430
If it were me,
I'd choose someone far away.

1221
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,600
It seems off to eliminate
someone random though.

1222
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,930
It really isn't me. If it were,

1223
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,200
I'd have eliminated
someone far away.

1224
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,020
If you eliminate the person
that suspected you,

1225
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,560
it would seem...

1226
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,740
There's a reason for his choice.

1227
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,870
Only a fool would do that.

1228
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,540
- Is the Mafia a fool?
- I feel bad for Se Chan...

1229
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,430
- being on Jong Kook's radar.
- It really isn't me.

1230
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,640
If you take me out,

1231
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,040
you'll be in big trouble
during the next round.

1232
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,850
- I also believe it's Se Chan.
- Why...

1233
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,080
- Go ahead.
- Because...

1234
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,370
- It really isn't me.
- If the Mafia...

1235
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,410
was smart like Jong Kook,

1236
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,220
- he wouldn't kill another suspect.
- Exactly.

1237
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,910
- But...
- But someone as stupid as him...

1238
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,620
would do the opposite.

1239
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,080
- You're a fool.
- If you watch this when it airs,

1240
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,260
- you'll see who the foolish one is.
- How stupid can you be?

1241
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,680
Let's see who the stupid one is.

1242
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,350
- How can you kill another suspect?
- This is frustrating.

1243
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,200
Se Chan being all worked up...

1244
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,370
makes him look suspicious.

1245
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,990
I can tell by the look on his face.

1246
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,160
Just his expression alone...

1247
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,100
I just know. Come on.

1248
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,240
I knew it was Si Yoon
the moment he sat down...

1249
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,330
after reading
what's in the envelope.

1250
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,770
Then...

1251
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,240
And while we were talking,
I looked at Se Chan...

1252
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,950
and knew.

1253
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,370
The moment the game began,

1254
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,350
I knew who was in the Mafia.

1255
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,410
- What...
- So there's no need for a debate.

1256
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,240
- This is frustrating.
- You know...

1257
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,260
I knew the moment
I saw his expression.

1258
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,890
- Okay, let's see.
- I won't let it slide...

1259
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,720
if you're in the Mafia.

1260
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,990
Choose the person to eliminate.

1261
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,720
It's you.

1262
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,330
We'll hear your final defense.

1263
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,290
- Three.
- It's you.

1264
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,200
(Se Chan will defend himself
one last time.)

1265
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,330
All right.

1266
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,930
Let me explain.
Whenever someone targets me,

1267
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,560
blood rushes to my face...

1268
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,370
and I stutter. However...

1269
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,810
- You talk just fine.
- I don't.

1270
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:31,970
That's why...

1271
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,810
(The quiet Millstone Guy
lays a shy punch.)

1272
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,810
But why am I worked up right now?

1273
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,950
- Because I'm innocent.
- Ki Woong...

1274
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,180
knows how to punch hard.

1275
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,850
- Millstone Guy.
- He saw right through you.

1276
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,620
- He talks just fine.
- Anyway, it isn't me.

1277
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:46,430
Do you wish to stay alive
for another round?

1278
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,080
- What?
- We'll let you live.

1279
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,700
Who should we eliminate instead?

1280
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,350
(What?)

1281
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,020
Who should we eliminate instead?

1282
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,700
Pick a person.

1283
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,040
You think you're so clever!

1284
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,200
(He ends up exploding.)

1285
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,660
- Come on.
- Just kill me already!

1286
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,700
Why do you want to kill me so badly?

1287
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,810
- You wanted another chance.
- The punches keep coming.

1288
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,850
Since you want another chance,
we'll give you one.

1289
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,720
Let him live
and we'll see who he eliminates.

1290
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:11,950
We'll let him live.

1291
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,080
If we're that sure,
we'll let him live.

1292
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,720
- Yes, let him.
- Then he'll eliminate you.

1293
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,180
Who were you going to eliminate
if you had made it?

1294
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,220
You, of course.

1295
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,790
(You, of course.)

1296
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,330
Of course it's you.

1297
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,430
Who else would I eliminate?

1298
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,270
- He's red in the face.
- Look at him.

1299
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:31,200
- Of course it's you.
- Look.

1300
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,270
- Of course it's you.
- He's fuming.

1301
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,640
- Okay.
- Eliminate me already.

1302
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,270
- Eliminate me.
- Let's vote.

1303
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,930
- All right.
- Just kill me.

1304
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,810
- Kill him.
- I'd rather not.

1305
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,680
- We should eliminate him.
- Of course.

1306
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,540
- I know it's him.
- Kill him.

1307
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,950
(They agree to eliminate him.)

1308
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,350
- Now...
- I don't think it's him.

1309
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,240
Is Se Chan a member of the Mafia?

1310
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,310
(Is Se Chan a member of the Mafia?)

1311
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,830
(Se Chan was cornered
due to Jong Kook's tenacity.)

1312
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:59,620
(All members suspected him.
So which role was he playing?)

1313
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,620
He is.

1314
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,700
(He's a member of the Mafia.)

1315
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,490
See? What did I tell you?

1316
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,270
(Se Chan was a member of the Mafia.)

1317
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,700
- Seriously.
- Are you kidding me?

1318
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,510
He's the most annoying person
on earth!

1319
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,370
(He tried hard to
suspect others instead.)

1320
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:18,520
(He was targeted by Jong Kook
right from the start.)

1321
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:23,160
(During the first night)

1322
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,580
(Him)

1323
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,660
(He thought he was being clever
by taking Jae Suk out.)

1324
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,770
(He couldn't hold off
Detective Kook anymore.)

1325
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,660
Just kill me already!

1326
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,470
- I knew it.
- You...

1327
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,990
- Get over here.
- Is he insane?

1328
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,930
I know who it is instantly
whenever I play this game.

1329
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:41,430
What did I tell you?

1330
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,810
- You're incredible.
- I know immediately.

1331
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,040
- Their expressions say it all.
- You fool.

1332
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,910
Why eliminate someone
that's being suspected?

1333
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,450
- That's a bad move.
- I couldn't help it.

1334
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,620
This is great though.

1335
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:51,520
- He was cornered too early.
- I guess you couldn't help it.

1336
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,740
The stress was real.

1337
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:56,850
Let me announce the scores so far.

1338
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,080
(1st place: Jong Kook and Ji Hyo,
10th place: Si Yoon)

1339
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,330
What on earth?

1340
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:01,220
- No way.
- Are you kidding me?

1341
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,330
Why are Si Yoon and I...

1342
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,720
My score is the same,
but I moved up a rank.

1343
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,770
- Our ranks are different.
- We moved up a rank.

1344
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,140
- You moved up two.
- I know.

1345
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,660
- You guys are killing this.
- I moved up two ranks too.

1346
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:17,180
We'll give you lunch
in the order of your ranking.

1347
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,240
Is that so?

1348
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,270
Our ranking?

1349
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,540
- Gosh, I'm so unlucky.
- Jong Kook must be happy.

1350
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,180
Let's go have lunch now.

1351
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,640
All right!

1352
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,950
Thank you.

1353
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:29,060
- We give you a lot though, right?
- Yes.

1354
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,810
- Let's enjoy it.
- Have as much as you want.

1355
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:33,020
This is nice. It even got some oil.

1356
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,350
I hope you don't pick us...

1357
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:39,660
as your team member this time.

1358
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,890
(I hope you don't pick us
as your team member this time.)

1359
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:41,990
You get what I mean, right?

1360
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,100
- Why not?
- We need to work with good ones.

1361
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,540
You need your points too.

1362
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,640
That's why you need someone...

1363
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,830
Oh, we're dividing up?

1364
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,680
Yes, your team needs to win
to earn some points.

1365
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,080
If it doesn't work out
even if I try hard,

1366
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,680
I'll just place last
and bring down Jong Kook with me.

1367
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,850
But you can't if he's
in 1st or 2nd place.

1368
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,080
- Is that so?
- They're in 1st and 2nd place.

1369
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,810
You can't pick Ji Hyo and Jong Kook.

1370
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,060
I'm going to bring down Jong Kook
to third place no matter what.

1371
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,760
I know I'm done with.

1372
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,950
You must've been
really annoyed earlier.

1373
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:06,950
Of course.

1374
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,120
- I was annoyed too.
- I was really upset.

1375
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,100
From the beginning, he went,
"Si Yoon is suspicious."

1376
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,220
"Se Chan is suspicious."
That was really annoying.

1377
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,790
It was as if I was being judged.

1378
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,100
I'm going to bring him down
to third place no matter what.

1379
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,270
Is this our lunch?

1380
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:19,470
What's this?

1381
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,470
(The 4 members in the middle rank
get tuna mayonnaise rice.)

1382
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:21,540
I like this.

1383
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,640
We're really good at games.

1384
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,810
I think we're really good.

1385
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,700
But here's the thing.

1386
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:28,970
- Ji Hyo...
- Don't you have any soup?

1387
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,140
Don't you have any soup?

1388
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,890
- You have no idea...
- Can you give me some water?

1389
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,310
- Hey!
- I'm sorry.

1390
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,890
- It wasn't intentional.
- I was talking!

1391
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,950
I got really thirsty. I'm sorry.

1392
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,390
I might punch him today, but
please pretend you didn't see it.

1393
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,930
It's a secret
in the entertainment field.

1394
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:48,120
Even if he punches me,
you don't need to worry.

1395
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,540
It won't hurt at all.

1396
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:52,410
(The battle fighting power
has begun again.)

1397
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,160
They've been saying the same thing
for over 11 years.

1398
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:57,580
Na Eun is four now, so her punches
must be a bit stronger than yours.

1399
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,950
Na Eun's punches
are a bit stronger than yours.

1400
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,350
Na Eun's punches are stronger?

1401
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,950
(In the meantime,
the 3 in the top rank...)

1402
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,490
What's this? Is this Coke?

1403
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:07,640
It's fried chicken gizzard.

1404
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,720
There's such a thing?

1405
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,790
Are there drumsticks?
Don't they have drumsticks?

1406
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:13,120
- Drumsticks are the best part.
- That's right!

1407
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:14,850
It's gizzard.

1408
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,260
Right? It's fried gizzard.

1409
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,200
There's such thing as
a fried gizzard?

1410
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,870
- It's so good.
- Is it good?

1411
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:23,430
(They enjoy the special food
only given to the high rank.)

1412
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,270
Because they're fried
in clean oil...

1413
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,310
(Laughing)

1414
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:30,430
- It's a bit spicy.
- This place is really good.

1415
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:31,810
The three of us are the worst...

1416
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,140
- at promoting
- It's really good.

1417
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,240
It's so funny.

1418
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,220
I'm sorry. I was still chewing
the gizzard. It was too chewy.

1419
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,220
I was chewing on the gizzard
until now.

1420
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,520
You should just stop.

1421
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:45,580
It's my first time trying it.

1422
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:47,930
- This must be about knowledge.
- All right!

1423
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,060
If this is the about knowledge...

1424
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,290
I think we're playing a quiz.

1425
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,060
According to the result
from the game you played,

1426
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:54,720
you can change your teammates.

1427
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,990
Right.

1428
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:59,010
Ji Hyo who is in the first place
will go first.

1429
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,080
Will you change your teammates
or stick with them?

1430
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,140
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

1431
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,310
You should take
either me or Si Yoon.

1432
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:06,970
Ji Hyo, it's more important
to get scores on the quiz.

1433
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:08,470
We'll bet our lives on it.

1434
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,470
This round is really important
because we're playing a quiz.

1435
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:13,220
- It's a quiz.
- Then I'm not that bad of a choice.

1436
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,620
I'm pretty quick and good at a quiz.

1437
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,680
(He's full of self-love.)

1438
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,020
I can do anything.

1439
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,390
I can pop all the balloons
if there are any.

1440
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,850
All right. I'll pick Si Yoon.

1441
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,450
Jong Kook. It's all set.

1442
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,160
Is Si Yoon a smart type?

1443
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,700
Not really.

1444
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,290
- He reads a lot.
- Oh, really?

1445
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:30,930
- How good are you?
- Knowledge.

1446
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,040
When you were a regular
on the other show,

1447
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,200
were you good at quizzes?

1448
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,370
Tae Hyun always told me that
I'm quite dumb...

1449
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:38,080
compared to how much I read.

1450
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,680
- I get it.
- He's one of us.

1451
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,950
- Also...
- He's pretty good.

1452
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,220
Compared to how much you read?

1453
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,120
- Why didn't you tell me earlier?
- I know.

1454
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,390
You can't change your mind now.

1455
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,040
But I'll try my best.

1456
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,160
- Who's next?
- Next is So Min.

1457
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:51,950
So Min, go ahead.

1458
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:53,790
If you're satisfied with your
partner, you can stick with him.

1459
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:54,830
(You know what to do, right?)

1460
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:56,120
Go ahead.

1461
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,890
- I pick Jong Kook.
- Hey.

1462
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,200
- Why you...
- Seriously.

1463
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,540
You picked me?

1464
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:03,970
Why did you bump my fist?

1465
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:07,200
- Come here, Suk Jin.
- All right! I got this.

1466
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,200
- Jong Kook.
- You belong here anyway.

1467
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,740
- You need everything.
- Welcome, Suk Jin!

1468
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,200
You need to use
your strength and brain.

1469
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,600
Let's go!

1470
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,850
- Not me.
- Just do it.

1471
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:15,870
Hee Yeon, go ahead.

1472
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:17,120
(Only Hee Yeon's choice remains.)

1473
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,120
(Being careful)

1474
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,140
Suk Jin is really smart.

1475
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,410
- Since it's a quiz.
- I'll pick a player who will...

1476
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:22,450
score many points for me.

1477
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:23,490
Let's go!

1478
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,790
I heard there's someone
who likes liberal arts.

1479
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:26,830
- What?
- Liberal arts?

1480
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:27,850
- Who?
- Suk Jin?

1481
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:28,850
- Yes.
- Him?

1482
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:29,990
- Yes!
- Suk Jin.

1483
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:31,390
- Hani failed again.
- For real?

1484
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,890
- Hani failed.
- Goodness, Hani.

1485
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,470
We're playing a quiz, right?

1486
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:36,640
- All right.
- Yes, we're playing a quiz.

1487
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:39,370
Let me explain the rules,
and you'll change into new vests.

1488
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:42,330
Don't I have a chance
to change my teammates?

1489
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:43,430
Yes, you have one more chance.

1490
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,350
Wait. You looked at me
as you said that.

1491
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:47,870
- You looked at me.
- I think it'd be fun...

1492
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:48,870
if he joins So Min.

1493
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:50,020
You think so?

1494
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,470
Wherever I go...

1495
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:53,740
Jong Kook should join my team.

1496
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,890
Stop it!

1497
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,290
Empty Heads!

1498
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:00,430
- Empty Heads!
- Empty Heads. Come on!

1499
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:01,890
(They scout Jong Kook.)

1500
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:03,100
I'm joining you?

1501
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,390
- Empty Heads.
- Empty Heads.

1502
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,930
I'm coming, So Min!

1503
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:09,930
They'll never be able to answer
the questions no matter what.

1504
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:11,040
- So Min, we can do it.
- I think...

1505
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,200
it's meaningless to play
against them.

1506
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,560
- We can disregard them.
- That's right.

1507
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,040
So Min, we can do it. Let's do this.

1508
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,310
Empty Heads!

1509
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:18,470
- My gosh.
- Empty!

1510
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,700
Empty Head So Min
and Empty Head Se Chan.

1511
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,080
You ended up with him
after dumping me?

1512
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,370
Gosh, you.

1513
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:27,410
What's the point of earning a chance
when you can't answer questions?

1514
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:28,720
(So Min ended up picking
Empty Head instead.)

1515
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,620
Empty Head So Min
and Empty Head Se Chan.

1516
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,990
Dr. Yoo got new clients.

1517
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,660
- It's great.
- Dr. Yoo!

1518
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,450
- Dr. Yoo!
- This is nice.

1519
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,160
- That team looks strong.
- Dr. Yoo!

1520
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,770
- Dr. Yoo is the best at quizzes.
- That's right.

1521
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:44,060
You'll need to use your knowledge
and wit for your mission.

1522
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,240
It's Joint Responsibility Quiz.
The members have played this before.

1523
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,200
The theme is "global".

1524
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,330
- "Global"?
- "Global"?

1525
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,640
- I like that!
- I like it.

1526
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,770
Each team member
needs to say the syllable...

1527
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:58,470
of the answer. If it's correct,
you'll earn ten points.

1528
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:59,720
(Say the syllable of the answer
in turn and earn 10 points.)

1529
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,760
If the answer is "Running Man",
then you'll take turns to say it.

1530
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,160
If you say it correctly,
then you'll earn the points.

1531
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:06,760
We can steal
the other teams' answers.

1532
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:08,290
We just need to be witty.
We're pretty witty, right?

1533
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,890
- Of course.
- These guys are the worst.

1534
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:10,890
I'll show you how witty I am.

1535
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:12,060
- You're the worst.
- I can just steal your answer.

1536
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,700
During the game,

1537
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,330
a few balloons will fall
from the back.

1538
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,430
One of them has a real sword
for the pop-up pirate.

1539
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:21,470
- That's right.
- Yes!

1540
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:22,640
If the pirate pops out
using that sword,

1541
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,470
we'll give you 30 points.

1542
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:26,950
The captains will divide...

1543
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,810
the points the team wins.

1544
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:31,140
You can earn up to 200 points
if you do well. You never know.

1545
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,020
- This is great.
- I should pick them up well.

1546
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,350
Now, change into new vests
and sit over there.

1547
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:36,490
- All right.
- All right.

1548
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,060
- Let's go.
- Today's quizzes aren't hard.

1549
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,330
Once you call for an answer,
I'll pick a person who can go first.

1550
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:47,770
The first category
is a global figure.

1551
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:48,930
- A figure? Okay, that sounds easy.
- A figure?

1552
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:50,160
- A figure!
- Great!

1553
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,930
We'll show you the photo
of a famous global figure,

1554
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,410
and you'll tell us their full name.

1555
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,100
- Their full name?
- You mean their entire name, right?

1556
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,410
Yes, their first and last name.

1557
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:59,450
But it's confusing.

1558
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:01,140
- I'm not good with full names.
- Full names...

1559
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:05,040
Each member will take a turn
to say each syllable.

1560
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,350
Call out for an answer first.

1561
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,290
Here comes the first one.

1562
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,580
- Let me answer.
- He's...

1563
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,760
- It's that guy.
- Ki Woong, go ahead.

1564
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,790
"Ch".

1565
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:17,830
"Ri".

1566
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,470
- "Sn".
- Let me answer.

1567
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,620
- Yes, Se Chan.
- "Ch".

1568
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,770
- "Ri".
- "S".

1569
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,290
- "To".
- You know him, right?

1570
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,330
Let me answer!

1571
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:25,660
- Go ahead.
- "Ch".

1572
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,910
- They got it.
- "Ri".

1573
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:28,010
"S".

1574
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,100
"Hem".

1575
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,740
"Ming".

1576
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,770
- No!
- Let me answer!

1577
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:32,810
- Jong Kook.
- "Ch".

1578
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:33,810
- "Ri".
- "S".

1579
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:34,810
- "Hem".
- "S".

1580
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:35,810
- "Wor".
- "T".

1581
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:37,240
- We almost got it.
- Let me answer!

1582
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,720
(He got the last syllable wrong.)

1583
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,040
- Let me answer!
- I got it! Let me answer!

1584
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,220
- Let me answer!
- Go ahead, Hee Yeon.

1585
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,310
- "Ch".
- "Ch".

1586
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,390
- "Ri".
- "S".

1587
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,620
- "He".
- "S".

1588
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,890
- It's wrong!
- It's "Hem".

1589
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:49,350
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead, Haha.

1590
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:50,390
- "Ch".
- "Ri".

1591
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,390
- "S".
- "Hem".

1592
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:52,390
- "S".
- "Wor".

1593
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,700
- "Th". All right.
- Gosh.

1594
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,290
It's Chris Hemsworth.

1595
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:56,970
- Great job.
- Good one.

1596
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:59,510
Didn't you just steal our answer?

1597
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:02,370
- What? It was just there.
- You should've said "Hamstring".

1598
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:04,140
Why can't we just pick up
what was already there?

1599
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,580
You're practically
taking our answer.

1600
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,810
What do you mean?
We know who Chris Hemsworth is.

1601
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:09,680
- You should play better.
- Chris Hemsworth.

1602
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,370
So call out
for an answer faster than us.

1603
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,120
It's important
to take their answers too.

1604
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,450
Here's the next question.

1605
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:16,450
Here it goes.

1606
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:17,810
They're here!

1607
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,560
(Randomly dropping balloons)

1608
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,990
- They're here!
- They're here!

1609
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,430
- What is this?
- Take it.

1610
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:23,660
- Give it to me!
- Is it a real sword?

1611
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,660
I should pop it.

1612
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,660
- Take it.
- Is it a real sword?

1613
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:27,970
- This is fake.
- Is it real or fake?

1614
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,640
- It's fake.
- Pop it.

1615
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,660
(This one is real!)

1616
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,100
This one is real.

1617
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:35,100
- What were you doing?
- Gosh, I missed that.

1618
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,040
- Isn't this the one?
- There are four of us!

1619
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,240
This one is fake.

1620
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,580
Oh, that's the real sword?

1621
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,180
- It might not pop up. Don't worry.
- Stick it in.

1622
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,470
- Stick it in.
- You get 30 points if it pops up.

1623
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:43,910
- It won't pop up.
- It won't pop up.

1624
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,310
- We're safe.
- All right.

1625
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:46,640
- It didn't work.
- All right.

1626
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,640
If we get the correct answer,
we get ten points.

1627
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,640
If the pirate pops up, we get 30.

1628
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,310
- I forgot about the balloons.
- It's going great.

1629
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:52,490
Here's the next question.

1630
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:54,430
Here it goes.

1631
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,290
Let me answer! Oh, gosh.

1632
00:51:58,290 --> 00:51:59,520
Let me answer!

1633
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,830
- Oh, gosh.
- Let me answer!

1634
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:01,990
- "Van".
- "Go".

1635
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,470
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1636
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,640
- "Vin".
- Let me answer!

1637
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,910
- "Vin".
- Quiet, everyone. What did you say?

1638
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,160
- "Vin".
- "Cen".

1639
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,200
- "T".
- "Van".

1640
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,270
- "Go".
- "Gh".

1641
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,040
- It is van Gogh, right?
- It's Vincent van Gogh.

1642
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,200
(Laughing)

1643
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,200
- Hey.
- It's his first time.

1644
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,200
I got half of it correct.

1645
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,220
(He's happy that he got
just half of it correct.)

1646
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,520
- That was unexpected.
- It's all good.

1647
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,720
As long as you're happy
to be with your boyfriend.

1648
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,620
- It is van Gogh.
- This is great!

1649
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:22,760
- Here's the next question.
- Here they are!

1650
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,810
- Se Chan!
- Get them!

1651
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:24,850
(The balloons are dropped.)

1652
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,890
(The balloon beast)

1653
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,560
- Go get it, Suk Jin!
- Is it the real sword?

1654
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,830
- Is it real?
- It is.

1655
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:32,930
- So Min, come here. We got three.
- It's fake.

1656
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:34,700
(So Min, come here. We got three.)

1657
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:36,470
- We got three.
- They brought theirs first.

1658
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:37,700
- One of theirs must be real.
- Here's another one.

1659
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,370
- So Min, hurry up.
- That one must be real.

1660
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:40,870
There are four of us,

1661
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:43,540
and we could've gotten
one balloon each!

1662
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,140
- I got one, but...
- Why didn't we get any?

1663
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,370
We should've gone for it
in the first place.

1664
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,080
If we don't earn points here,
we're hopeless.

1665
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,350
- Can I stick this in?
- You'll get 30 points.

1666
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:51,370
We get 30 points, right?

1667
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,640
It needs to pop up.

1668
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,490
- It needs to pop up.
- It'll pop up for sure.

1669
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:56,660
Which slot should I pick?

1670
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,490
I hope it just pops out once.

1671
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:00,060
It won't pop up. They'll fail.

1672
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:01,830
They're unlucky with this.

1673
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,490
- It won't pop up.
- Please.

1674
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:04,560
- It won't pop up.
- It won't.

1675
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,790
Nice!

1676
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,470
(Se Chan fails as well.)

1677
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:09,490
- But we had four swords!
- All right!

1678
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:10,600
- That's not the one, right?
- What a shame.

1679
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,870
We should get one balloon each!

1680
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:14,100
So Min, let's come up with a plan.

1681
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,770
If they get one,
we can steal theirs.

1682
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,910
If they pop one, stay next to them
and pick up their sword.

1683
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,180
Here's the next question.

1684
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,370
- Shout out for an answer.
- Get ready.

1685
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:23,540
Here it goes.

1686
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,680
- Here it goes.
- Let me answer!

1687
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,240
- Let me answer!
- Go ahead, Jong Kook.

1688
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:30,450
- Go.
- Go ahead. Three, two, one.

1689
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:31,490
(Time over)

1690
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:32,560
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer.

1691
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,580
- "E".
- "Lon".

1692
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,680
- "Mu".
- "Sk".

1693
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:35,850
Yes!

1694
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:38,890
(The two Empty Heads
got the answer correct.)

1695
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:41,270
I'm one of many who want to meet
Elon Musk.

1696
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:43,160
I can't believe we got this.

1697
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,540
- Thank you.
- I saw his name not long ago.

1698
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,740
- Elon Musk!
- You told her, didn't you?

1699
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,560
- Not at all.
- No, I heard of him.

1700
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,560
- Of course I know him.
- I know who Elon Musk is.

1701
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,870
I saw his name
on a show not long ago.

1702
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:52,270
- We were really awesome.
- We were really hot.

1703
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,010
- That was so cool.
- We did it.

1704
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,040
- You all must acknowledge this.
- Of course.

1705
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,540
Here's the next question.

1706
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:00,990
Here it goes.

1707
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:03,950
Here it goes.

1708
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,220
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1709
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,060
- Go ahead, Jae Suk.
- Who is he?

1710
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,560
- I can't remember his name.
- I got it!

1711
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,560
- I got it though.
- Let me answer!

1712
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,560
I blanked out.

1713
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,200
Can we go for it? "E".

1714
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:15,270
Everyone, you need to state
their full name.

1715
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:16,560
- Shin Hyun Joon.
- "La".

1716
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,560
I think I got it! Let me answer!

1717
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,160
- "Shin"!
- What?

1718
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,540
(She confidently says
the answer as Shin Hyun Joon.)

1719
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,040
It's Shin Hyun Joon.

1720
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:24,740
- I have no idea.
- It's not Shin Hyun Joon.

1721
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,910
- You...
- All right. Let me answer!

1722
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,180
Go ahead, Jae Suk.

1723
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,370
- "Z".
- "La".

1724
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:30,740
- "Tan".
- "I".

1725
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,870
- "B".
- "Ra".

1726
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:32,890
"I".

1727
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,390
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1728
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:36,810
(Let me answer!)

1729
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:37,810
("Zu")

1730
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,350
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1731
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:40,560
- "Zu".
- "La".

1732
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,020
(He said "Zu".)

1733
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,120
- Let me answer!
- What's wrong with it?

1734
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,700
Let me answer. Who should go first?

1735
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,890
- Haha.
- Me? "Z".

1736
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:47,430
- "La".
- "Tan".

1737
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:48,830
- "I".
- "B".

1738
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:50,140
- "Ra".
- "Hi".

1739
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:51,930
- "Mo".
- "Vi".

1740
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:52,930
- "C".
- Yes!

1741
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,770
- Why was mine wrong?
- He said "Zu".

1742
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:56,100
- But...
- It's "Hi".

1743
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,970
- Excuse me. You said "Zu".
- What's wrong with that?

1744
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:59,850
- It's Zulatan Ibrahimovic.
- No, It's Zlatan.

1745
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:02,620
But doesn't that count? No?

1746
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:04,220
- It's Zulatan.
- My gosh.

1747
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,910
- Here they are.
- Here they are.

1748
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,220
(While Suk Jin throws a tantrum,
the balloons are dropped.)

1749
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,640
- Get it, Jong Kook!
- Here they are.

1750
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:09,950
Here they are.

1751
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:12,560
- Here they are.
- Where did it go?

1752
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,560
- Where is it?
- There's nothing in here.

1753
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,760
- There's nothing in here.
- It's fake.

1754
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,220
- I got one.
- It's fake.

1755
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,760
Is that the real one?

1756
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,790
Try this one.

1757
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,160
Ji Hyo, go ahead.

1758
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,370
- Si Yoon, I...
- I got one.

1759
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,970
All right. It didn't pop up.

1760
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:24,160
- It should pop up by now.
- We didn't try the front side.

1761
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,040
- I got lucky.
- Stick that one in first.

1762
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,140
- It's about time it should pop up.
- Stick it in.

1763
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,200
- We need to answer the question.
- You should stick it in first.

1764
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,740
- It didn't pop up.
- Great.

1765
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,700
- You should stick it in first.
- This is the real deal.

1766
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:34,870
This is the real deal.

1767
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:37,540
I told you to stick it in first!

1768
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,450
(I told you to stick it in first!)

1769
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:41,310
I thought I told you
to stick it in first!

1770
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,560
How many times did I tell you that?

1771
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,390
Jong Kook...

1772
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:50,100
How many times did I tell you
to stick it in first?

1773
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,350
- I...
- They had 3, and we had only 1!

1774
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:53,430
You should've stuck ours in
when they couldn't make it pop up!

1775
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:54,990
- There was such a big chance!
- There weren't many slots left.

1776
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:56,200
You did wrong this time.

1777
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,040
- Jong Kook was right.
- Seriously.

1778
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,010
- You should've stuck it in.
- Why didn't you listen to me?

1779
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,140
- Why?
- Why did you do that?

1780
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,970
- Why were you waiting?
- I...

1781
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:04,910
- Why were you waiting?
- I'm the doctor.

1782
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,770
Here's the next question.

1783
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:07,770
- Okay.
- Okay.

1784
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:08,910
Here it goes.

1785
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,040
- Let me answer!
- Go ahead, Haha.

1786
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,910
- "Syl".
- "Ve".

1787
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:17,580
- "S".
- "Ter".

1788
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,290
(Sylvester)

1789
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:21,390
- Let me answer!
- Why you...

1790
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:22,850
- Hey! Unbelievable.
- Let me answer!

1791
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,100
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1792
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,120
Go ahead, Si Yoon.

1793
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,160
Let's wait for it.

1794
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,520
- "Syl".
- "Ve".

1795
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,870
- "S".
- "Ter".

1796
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,790
- "S".
- "Tal".

1797
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:33,200
- "Lone".
- Let me answer!

1798
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,810
- She pronounced it wrong!
- She pronounced it wrong!

1799
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:35,870
- It's "Tallone"!
- She said it correctly.

1800
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:37,370
- Sylvester Stallone!
- Stallone!

1801
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:39,010
She said it wrong.

1802
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,370
- It's supposed to be "Tallone".
- I said it like that.

1803
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,770
This isn't fair.

1804
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,580
- But this is...
- She said it wrong.

1805
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:47,310
Who doesn't know Sylvester Stallone?
He's Rambo.

1806
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:50,060
Sylvester Stallone!
Throw the balloons already!

1807
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:51,950
Throw the balloons!

1808
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,560
- That's fine.
- If we have a mutual agreement...

1809
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,200
- Then it'll be fine.
- They're throwing the balloons.

1810
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,490
- All right!
- Where is it?

1811
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,660
(Here comes
the balloon beast again.)

1812
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,270
- Let go of it. Watch the camera.
- I'm sorry.

1813
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:04,470
- It's fake.
- It's fake.

1814
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:05,970
Gosh, I'm so unlucky.

1815
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:07,270
(Meanwhile,
Dr. Yoo got the real sword.)

1816
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:08,830
- I got it.
- This one's real.

1817
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:09,830
(Meanwhile,
Dr. Yoo got the real sword.)

1818
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:11,200
- I got it.
- That one is fake.

1819
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,540
- You got it?
- I got it.

1820
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:13,580
- I got it.
- He got it.

1821
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,580
Let's pop it up in one blow.

1822
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:16,540
- Let's go.
- It needs to pop up this time.

1823
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,640
This one is real.

1824
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,850
You have a low possibility
in the beginning.

1825
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:21,020
You got one too?

1826
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,490
- Fail.
- That one was close.

1827
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:24,060
- Fail.
- Gosh, this is...

1828
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,390
- It'll work.
- There's a low possibility.

1829
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:27,290
- Fail.
- Just stick it in.

1830
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:28,490
Yes!

1831
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,660
That was incredible.
I knew you'd make it.

1832
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:30,790
- Just stick it in.
- Yes!

1833
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:33,160
(It popped up!)

1834
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,220
- I knew you'd make it.
- This is unbelievable.

1835
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:37,660
Well done, Dr. Yoo!

1836
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,410
Well done, Dr. Yoo!

1837
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,970
- Well done, Dr. Yoo!
- Didn't you two fight earlier?

1838
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,770
- Great work.
- Great work.

1839
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:45,470
- Great work.
- Didn't you two fight earlier?

1840
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:46,770
No.

1841
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:47,850
Goodness, Dr. Yoo.

1842
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:49,310
- You two made up.
- We got this.

1843
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:50,970
- Here it goes.
- Please give us another one.

1844
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:54,220
I can't keep my eyes off
of the back. My neck feels stiff.

1845
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,640
- Give it to us.
- Here's the next question.

1846
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,790
(Next question)

1847
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:57,790
Here it goes.

1848
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:59,180
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1849
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,830
- Go ahead, Ki Woong.
- You know the answer, right?

1850
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,120
Let me answer! "Hel".

1851
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:05,160
- What?
- "Hel"?

1852
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,770
- Let me answer!
- Are you sure that's the first one?

1853
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,330
Isn't it "Nobel"?

1854
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:10,370
- I know it.
- Helicobacter...

1855
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:12,540
- "Tho".
- Excuse me.

1856
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,930
Se Chan said he's Helicobacter.

1857
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:16,100
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1858
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,180
- What did you say?
- Let me answer.

1859
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:19,240
Isn't he Helicobacter?

1860
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:21,470
- Are you serious?
- Go ahead, Jae Suk.

1861
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:22,510
"Tho".

1862
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,580
- "Ma".
- "S".

1863
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,580
- "E".
- "Di".

1864
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,220
- "Son". Yes!
- All right!

1865
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,020
- It's Edison.
- Good work.

1866
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,080
I thought he was Helicobacter.

1867
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,290
- I thought...
- "Helicobacter"?

1868
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:35,060
The team in the first place...

1869
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,600
- is still Team Dr. Yoo.
- We're doing great.

1870
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,020
Team Song Ji Hyo is in second place.

1871
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,560
- We went really easy on them.
- Let's go!

1872
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,100
What's our score?

1873
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:43,290
Ten points.

1874
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,700
What did you say?

1875
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,310
You got Elon Musk right.

1876
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:50,680
Why don't you let them go first?

1877
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,040
- Let us go first.
- I have a question.

1878
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,740
- It's not that.
- Why won't you look at us?

1879
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,010
You guys...

1880
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:57,270
You guys called Thomas Edison
as Helicobacter.

1881
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:59,080
Why won't he look at us?

1882
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:02,390
I can't believe... Here they are!

1883
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:03,390
(Right then,
the balloons are dropped.)

1884
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:05,580
- Here they are!
- Here they are!

1885
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,290
Here's one! Darn it!

1886
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:10,850
So Min, come here!

1887
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:12,350
So Min, let's go!

1888
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:13,560
There's a low possibility
in the beginning.

1889
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,040
You guys
are fully enjoying your date.

1890
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,770
- There's a low possibility.
- Look. Over here.

1891
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:18,990
- There's a low possibility.
- Stick it in.

1892
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:20,010
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1893
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:21,010
They're having such a good time.

1894
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:22,010
- Are you on a date or what?
- Let's try one more.

1895
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,470
- What's going on?
- They're holding hands.

1896
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:25,100
- Are you cutting a cake or what?
- Are you cutting a cake or what?

1897
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,370
Are you cutting a cake?
They're having so much fun.

1898
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,040
- It's the last one.
- They have so many.

1899
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,080
It's the last one.

1900
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,080
Excuse me!

1901
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,790
Can you hand that over to us?
We'll give you ten points.

1902
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:33,990
- Sorry?
- We'll give you ten points.

1903
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:35,490
Let's just take their ten points.

1904
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:36,890
- Okay. We'll take it.
- All right.

1905
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:38,060
- Give us ten points.
- All right.

1906
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,080
Okay.

1907
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,330
- This is our only chance.
- At least we earned something.

1908
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:43,060
If we earn ten points with this...
Are you listening, Hani?

1909
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,290
Why are you looking at So Min
while saying that?

1910
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,620
Hey, I'm So Min.

1911
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,620
Hani, why are you back there?

1912
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,560
- I bought this with ten points.
- I feel like it'll pop up.

1913
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,010
It's worth 100 dollars.

1914
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,270
It shouldn't pop up
so that this will be fun.

1915
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:55,770
Please don't pop up.

1916
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:56,870
Suk Jin, you need to make it pop.

1917
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:59,910
- Kwang Soo! Give me your energy!
- I hope it doesn't pop up.

1918
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:00,970
Give me your energy, Kwang Soo!

1919
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:03,450
Isn't he strange? He's asking
Kwang Soo for his energy.

1920
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:05,450
Kwang Soo, tell me
which slot to stick this in.

1921
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:06,680
Which slot? Near the ear?

1922
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,410
- The right one or the left?
- The left one.

1923
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,790
- The right ear?
- No, the left ear.

1924
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:11,080
The left one? Got it.

1925
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:13,020
You're only listening to Jae Suk.

1926
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,180
Suk Jin, you're only listening
to Jae Suk.

1927
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,760
You're not listening to Kwang Soo.

1928
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:19,020
Where is it? It's here, right?
The left ear.

1929
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,470
Kwang Soo is pulling a prank on you.

1930
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,290
(It popped up!)

1931
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:25,330
What was that?

1932
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,740
This is insane!

1933
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,740
(Kwang Soo is here!)

1934
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,830
I thought Kwang Soo
was pulling a prank on you.

1935
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:33,040
I can't believe it.
How is this possible?

1936
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,510
- Wow.
- Seriously.

1937
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:36,970
- It was...
- Kwang Soo told me.

1938
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,350
Thank you so much, Kwang Soo.

1939
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:40,740
He only stuck one in.

1940
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:41,910
That was...

1941
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:43,410
- So Min.
- Throw us the balloons.

1942
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:44,410
So Min, come here.

1943
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:46,890
- What are you doing?
- We give up on the quiz.

1944
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,160
- We'll only catch the balloons.
- Don't mind us.

1945
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,060
Let's play it.

1946
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,770
We need to stay on our toes.

1947
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:53,990
Here's the next question.

1948
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:59,290
(Shohei Ohtani,
a popular MLB baseball player)

1949
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:00,470
- I...
- Let me answer.

1950
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:01,910
- Who is it?
- Go ahead, Haha.

1951
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:03,830
- This is driving me crazy.
- "A".

1952
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:04,830
- Let me answer.
- "Oh".

1953
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,180
- "Ta".
- "Sik".

1954
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,640
- "Ohtasik"?
- "Ohtasik"?

1955
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,970
- Go ahead, Ki Woong.
- "Oh".

1956
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:11,220
- "Ta".
- "Ru".

1957
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:12,680
- Darn it!
- My gosh!

1958
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,020
- Go ahead, Se Chan.
- "Oh".

1959
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,390
- "Ta".
- "Ni".

1960
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:16,990
(Ohtani)

1961
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:18,950
"Ku"? He's not Korean?

1962
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,290
- Go ahead, Jong Kook.
- "Oh".

1963
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:21,490
- "Ta".
- "Ni".

1964
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,680
"Ku"!

1965
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,660
My gosh. What is he, yakiniku?

1966
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,560
My goodness.

1967
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,660
- Let me answer!
- I don't know him.

1968
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:29,970
- "Oh".
- "Ta".

1969
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,470
- "Ni".
- "Sho".

1970
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:32,910
- "He".
- "I".

1971
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,830
It's Shohei Ohtani.

1972
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:37,040
(This is driving me crazy!)

1973
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,580
Look at Hee Yeon.

1974
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,950
Did you think he's Ohtaniku?

1975
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:42,770
- It's Shohei.
- Shohei. That's right.

1976
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:44,270
- I know him.
- It's Shohei Ohtani.

1977
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:45,580
Hey, throw the balloons!

1978
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:46,910
I thought it was It's Shorei Ohtani.

1979
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:48,450
Shohei!

1980
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:50,220
(They begin a ritual
to call for balloons.)

1981
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,910
- Throw the balloons.
- Give us the next question.

1982
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:54,290
Here's the next question.

1983
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:55,390
Bring the balloons.

1984
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:56,660
I got them.

1985
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:58,760
(The balloons are dropped
just in time.)

1986
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,290
- Hey!
- It's the real one!

1987
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,560
No, it's fake.

1988
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,660
It's fake!

1989
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,740
Hey!

1990
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,970
Did you get one?

1991
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:06,660
It's mine! It's over.

1992
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,010
- Did you get one?
- It didn't work.

1993
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:09,060
- It didn't work.
- I got two more.

1994
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,680
- It didn't work.
- Pop up!

1995
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,080
- Please...
- It won't pop up.

1996
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,450
Pop up!

1997
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:15,310
(It popped up!)

1998
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:20,040
(They earned the points by giving up
on the quiz.)

1999
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:21,950
Se Chan, we did it!

2000
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:23,310
- Good job.
- We did it!

2001
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,490
Se Chan, we did it!

2002
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,060
- We did it!
- They caught up right away.

2003
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:30,490
- Can you focus more?
- We're doing fine.

2004
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:32,160
- We're doing great.
- I should've caught one.

2005
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,890
All right. The second category...

2006
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:37,430
is a global movie.

2007
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:38,830
- All right!
- It's a movie.

2008
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:39,830
There are so many.

2009
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:41,660
- We're good since we got Ki Woong.
- Yes.

2010
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:43,100
- Let's do this!
- I watched a lot of movies.

2011
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:45,640
We'll show you the poster
of a famous global movie,

2012
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,270
- and you'll guess its title.
- My gosh.

2013
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:48,370
It'll be easy.

2014
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:50,450
- You'll take turns to say it.
- Let's play it.

2015
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,370
- So Min, you're an actress.
- Ready.

2016
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,680
Here it goes.

2017
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:57,310
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

2018
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:58,560
- Go ahead, Jong Kook.
- "Sa".

2019
01:02:58,580 --> 01:02:59,660
- "Vi".
- "Ng".

2020
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:00,680
- "Pri".
- "Vate".

2021
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,160
- "Ry".
- "An".

2022
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,850
- Come here!
- They got it again.

2023
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,770
Watch how well I do!

2024
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,640
Why is he going that far?

2025
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,600
How could you...

2026
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:13,770
How was that?

2027
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:15,140
(These two men are happy about
"Saving Private Ryan".)

2028
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:16,930
- Okay.
- I will watch out for the balloons.

2029
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:18,910
- I give up. No.
- Look at the questions.

2030
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:20,040
- I have no chance.
- Here comes the question.

2031
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,270
(Ms. Empty Head is addicted
to a big break.)

2032
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:23,350
- Here come the balloons.
- Grab one!

2033
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:24,370
(The balloons are dropped!)

2034
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:27,120
There are no swords.

2035
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:28,720
So Min, come here.

2036
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,620
- So Min, come here.
- Did you get one?

2037
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:32,810
- Let's get 30 points.
- Let's stick to this method.

2038
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,350
- We don't need questions.
- Let's stick to this method.

2039
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:36,390
- They are winning with that method.
- There is no other way.

2040
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:38,720
- Here I go.
- Go.

2041
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:42,560
(She succeeded in one go!)

2042
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:44,330
(Focusing on the balloons
was a big success.)

2043
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:45,490
Unbelievable.

2044
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,600
For goodness' sake.

2045
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:47,740
- Let's get back up.
- We can do it.

2046
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,970
- We can do it.
- We can do it.

2047
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:50,510
This is good. Come on.

2048
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:51,770
Let's go.

2049
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:53,740
(The masters of balloons
are winning.)

2050
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:55,310
All right.

2051
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:56,870
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2052
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:58,470
(Let's go!)

2053
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:00,040
(A good example
of forced enthusiasm)

2054
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,240
Let's go.

2055
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:03,020
Let's go.

2056
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:04,290
Jae Suk.

2057
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,930
(He experiences
zero gravity once again.)

2058
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:09,450
Let's go.

2059
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:10,760
(People would think
that he wants to be an astronaut.)

2060
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,120
- Let's go.
- Shall we do something?

2061
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,620
- Are you Jae Suk's dad?
- No.

2062
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:17,200
You keep playing with him.

2063
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,830
- Let's cheer up.
- It's like an amusement park.

2064
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:21,310
Let's go.

2065
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:23,330
Let's go. Lift me up.

2066
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,310
Let's go.

2067
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:27,100
What are they doing?

2068
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,850
- We can do it.
- Let's go.

2069
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:30,620
The last category is...

2070
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:32,020
the capital.

2071
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,180
- The capital. Okay.
- That's great.

2072
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,310
I don't know many capitals.

2073
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:35,620
Listen to the country name...

2074
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:38,080
and say one syllable of the capital
at a time.

2075
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,330
Are you good with capitals?

2076
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:41,390
I know most of them.

2077
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:43,160
Okay. Somalia.

2078
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:44,760
Let me answer.

2079
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,260
So Min.

2080
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:47,490
- That's...
- So.

2081
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:48,560
- Let me answer.
- Haha.

2082
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,660
I heard it on the news.

2083
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,830
- So.
- Let me answer.

2084
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,370
All right. So Min.

2085
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:55,040
- So.
- Hey!

2086
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,410
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2087
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:58,040
Jong Kook.

2088
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,540
- I don't know.
- Let me answer.

2089
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:01,910
Ji Hyo.

2090
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,770
Let me answer.

2091
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:05,220
- Ki Woong.
- Let me answer.

2092
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:06,270
So.

2093
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:07,790
Let me answer.

2094
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:09,310
- Se Chan.
- Mo.

2095
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:11,850
(Se Chan gets a chance.)

2096
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:13,060
Mo.

2097
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:14,850
- Let me answer.
- What is it?

2098
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:16,330
Mo.

2099
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:17,890
- Let me answer.
- Haha.

2100
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:19,220
- Mo.
- Ga.

2101
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:20,220
- Di.
- Shu.

2102
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:22,720
- Yes.
- It's the title of a recent movie.

2103
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:24,490
The one about the Somali Civil War.

2104
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:25,770
- Mogadishu.
- The movie.

2105
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:27,010
The movie.

2106
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:28,660
Hey.

2107
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:31,240
- Mogadishu.
- I even watched the movie.

2108
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:34,010
So Min is a total Empty Head.

2109
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:35,810
- You know the movie, right?
- Go and watch the movie.

2110
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:37,850
It got over two million viewers.

2111
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:40,390
- I was too busy.
- Mogadishu.

2112
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:41,950
- Good job.
- My goodness.

2113
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:43,890
- Let's go.
- Do it for Ki Woong.

2114
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:44,950
Do it for Ki Woong.

2115
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:46,350
(The amusement park opens again.)

2116
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:47,450
Let's go.

2117
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:48,850
Let's go.

2118
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:50,520
(Ki Woong gets
the unique experience.)

2119
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,260
(Haha's tornado spin!)

2120
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:53,370
Okay.

2121
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,520
Let's go.

2122
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:56,470
The result is out.

2123
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:57,490
(The result
of Joint Responsibility Quiz)

2124
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:59,370
First place is...

2125
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:01,060
- Team Dr. Yoo.
- Okay.

2126
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,640
The points he can distribute...

2127
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,330
are 220 points.

2128
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:06,580
(He can distribute 220 points.)

2129
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:08,180
- How much will each member get?
- Dr. Yoo.

2130
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:09,450
- Dr. Yoo.
- Dr. Yoo.

2131
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:11,020
- Dr. Yoo.
- About 50 points, I suppose.

2132
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:12,620
- Dr. Yoo.
- Good work.

2133
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,790
Second place is...

2134
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:15,890
(Second place)

2135
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:18,060
Team Ahn Hee Yeon with 120 points.

2136
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:19,260
Okay.

2137
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:22,620
The remaining 2 teams
used to be 3rd place together.

2138
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,990
But thanks to ten points
from Suk Jin,

2139
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:26,430
- Team Jeon So Min is third place.
- That's right.

2140
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:28,600
- Team Song Ji Hyo is fourth place.
- Okay.

2141
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:29,700
All right.

2142
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,700
Team Ahn Hee Yeon, 110 points.

2143
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,770
Team Jeon So Min, 90 points.
Team Song Ji Hyo, 80 points.

2144
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:34,930
- That's right.
- Okay.

2145
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:36,510
Let's distribute the points.

2146
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,240
The captains need to do well.

2147
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,510
We worked hard like 220V.

2148
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:43,910
- We are the best.
- Yes.

2149
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,680
Jae Suk.

2150
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,910
You won't be exempt from the penalty
unless you take first place.

2151
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,410
- If you place third,
- Let's go.

2152
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,680
I will pick you for the penalty.

2153
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,390
The 1st and 2nd places
will be exempt from the penalty.

2154
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,450
Hold on. Why would you pick me?

2155
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:57,600
- What?
- Why would you pick me?

2156
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,330
You are an eyesore.
You are too good.

2157
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:02,490
It's his ploy
to keep you from giving us points.

2158
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:05,240
- We are at the bottom anyway.
- We have nothing to lose.

2159
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,470
- We are vindictive.
- Jae Suk, you will go first.

2160
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:15,850
- Show us.
- I divided the points equally.

2161
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,890
So 190 points for me
and 10 points for everyone else.

2162
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:19,760
(Jae Suk, 190 points;
Everyone else, 10 points)

2163
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,990
So 190 points for me
and 10 points for everyone else.

2164
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:25,220
(He gave 10 points
to everyone else.)

2165
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:26,570
He doesn't disappoint.

2166
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:27,870
He is a great host.

2167
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:30,200
- You could have given us 20 points.
- I gave you 10 points.

2168
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,100
Dr. Yoo, you are the best.

2169
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,470
- I divided the points equally.
- It was the perfect operation.

2170
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:35,070
Next comes Ji Hyo.

2171
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:36,510
I divided the points evenly.

2172
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:38,700
- So 40 points and 40 points.
- Yes.

2173
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:39,850
- Thank you.
- Really?

2174
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:41,010
- Hani.
- Let's go.

2175
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,410
I went with 90 points and 20 points.

2176
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:44,570
- Okay.
- What is up with that?

2177
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:45,720
Hey.

2178
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,850
I went with 32 points and 58 points.

2179
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:51,050
- Hey, So Min.
- Hey.

2180
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:52,760
Even So Min gave 32 points.

2181
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:55,260
- That leaves me with zero points.
- You are too much.

2182
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:57,220
You are no longer in the negative.

2183
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:59,800
- Okay.
- Thus, the distribution is over.

2184
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,160
Now comes
the last team member exchange.

2185
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:03,390
Captain Ahn Hee Yeon,

2186
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:05,430
you can exchange Suk Jin
with a member of your choice.

2187
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:11,200
- This is the last game, right?
- Only one game remains.

2188
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,570
I will go with the strongest member.

2189
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:14,950
- That's me. Okay.
- She is ambitious.

2190
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:16,070
Kim Jong Kook.

2191
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:17,180
Okay.

2192
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,280
We don't know
what the last game will be like.

2193
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,050
Suk Jin keeps coming back
to this team.

2194
01:08:21,450 --> 01:08:22,820
I am back...

2195
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:25,450
- because the lease ended.
- We don't know what it will be.

2196
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:27,090
- The lease ended.
- Okay.

2197
01:08:27,090 --> 01:08:30,200
- Welcome back.
- All right.

2198
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,300
Have you been well?

2199
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,320
- Welcome back.
- I am back from that team.

2200
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,890
So Min, you are next.

2201
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:36,100
I choose...

2202
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:37,470
- Si Yoon.
- Okay.

2203
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:39,810
- Se Chan, go to that team.
- Okay.

2204
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,470
Ji Hyo, you are up.

2205
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:43,230
You can exchange Se Chan.

2206
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:45,200
- Se Chan.
- Okay.

2207
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:46,610
- Why did she choose Se Chan?
- Okay.

2208
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:48,850
I am sorry, Haha.

2209
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:51,650
That means Haha will stay
with this team.

2210
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:52,910
Okay.

2211
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:55,520
- What is up with you?
- We will take good care of you.

2212
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,390
- Take good care of me.
- I will do that.

2213
01:08:57,390 --> 01:08:59,260
- For goodness' sake.
- Let's move.

2214
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,620
- Okay.
- So Min.

2215
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:02,520
What is this?

2216
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:04,320
I like what I see.

2217
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,970
(It looks like the last mission
requires brute strength.)

2218
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:08,120
It requires strength.

2219
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,490
I am done for.

2220
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,860
In the last mission
of You Raise a Man Up Race,

2221
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:15,160
the team members' strength
is the key.

2222
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,440
The game is Hand Fencing on the Log.

2223
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,640
- Fencing.
- It will go like this.

2224
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,200
This is the last mission.

2225
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:23,270
Dr. Yoo's team...

2226
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:25,650
has four men with low self-esteem.

2227
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,090
Four men with low self-esteem.

2228
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:28,310
Low self-esteem?

2229
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:30,450
The three of them fit
the description.

2230
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:32,650
- The three of them do.
- I can't believe it.

2231
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:35,360
The game is in line with reality.

2232
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:39,260
- You don't know real men.
- I can't believe it.

2233
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:41,560
I have three children. Forget it.

2234
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:44,860
I will say this.

2235
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:46,140
We have 3, 2, and 1 children
respectively.

2236
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:48,230
We have 3, 2, and 1 children
respectively.

2237
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,680
- Keep that in mind.
- One, two, and three children.

2238
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:54,350
The remaining six members
will be a team.

2239
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:55,650
- What?
- Really?

2240
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:57,350
I will give you the rules.

2241
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:58,520
How will that work?

2242
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,150
You will play 1-on-1 hand fencing
on the log.

2243
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:04,810
We will count the number of times
you touch the opponent's face.

2244
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:06,950
If you make the opponent fall,

2245
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,650
you will gain 20 points right away.

2246
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:09,780
If you make the opponent fall?

2247
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:12,400
If you feel like you will lose,

2248
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:14,360
it might be better
to go down with the opponent.

2249
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,560
- That's right.
- Go down with the opponent.

2250
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,490
- Okay.
- Decide on the order and tell us.

2251
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:20,900
Okay. Let's go, six of us.

2252
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:22,270
All right.

2253
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:23,570
I should self-destruct.

2254
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:25,310
There are two women.

2255
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:26,480
Oh, there are three women.

2256
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:29,070
Hold on. Suk Jin.

2257
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:31,910
Why are you glancing over at me?
Do you want to go against me?

2258
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:33,780
You, Ji Hyo, or Hani.

2259
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:36,190
- One of the three.
- Then go first.

2260
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,720
Okay. I will go first.

2261
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:41,150
The first match is
So Min versus Suk Jin.

2262
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:43,190
Put paint on your hands
and go up on the log.

2263
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,320
You actually kept your words.

2264
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,600
So Min, don't you need this?

2265
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,600
You have no fear.

2266
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:47,730
There is no problem.

2267
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:48,900
It will be an easy match.

2268
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:49,970
(They are confident
about going against each other.)

2269
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:51,140
So Min.

2270
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:52,860
(Face-touching, 1 point;
Making the opponent fall, 20 points)

2271
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:54,610
The staff members will count.

2272
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:55,970
If you make the opponent fall,
you gain 20 points.

2273
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:57,370
- Seok Sam.
- Good luck.

2274
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:58,610
- Okay.
- Okay.

2275
01:10:58,610 --> 01:10:59,770
Get ready.

2276
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:02,200
Set, go.

2277
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,570
Suk Jin, why are you so excited?

2278
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:08,280
Why are you so excited?

2279
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:10,190
Why are you so excited?

2280
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:11,450
I envy Suk Jin.

2281
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:13,390
(Slapping)

2282
01:11:14,230 --> 01:11:15,280
(Slapping)

2283
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:18,120
- He slapped hard.
- He slapped too hard.

2284
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,820
He slapped hard.

2285
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:21,560
So Min.

2286
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,400
Just self-destruct.

2287
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,400
So Min wants to beat Suk Jin.

2288
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,640
(So Min got attacked by her rival.)

2289
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,010
That startled me.

2290
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:30,400
I didn't hit you hard.

2291
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,700
So Min is a bit annoyed.

2292
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:33,940
She is annoyed.

2293
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,200
- Two points.
- So Min.

2294
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:39,150
So Min.

2295
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,280
(Slapping)

2296
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:42,780
Suk Jin is the worst.

2297
01:11:43,150 --> 01:11:44,310
What is wrong with him?

2298
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,280
- My goodness.
- How did he win?

2299
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,860
I heard a loud sound.

2300
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:49,780
- Are you okay?
- I heard a loud sound.

2301
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,430
Are you okay?

2302
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,060
- I am okay.
- Are you okay?

2303
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:55,020
- Suk Jin is the worst.
- He is the worst.

2304
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,190
- He is good at the game.
- I didn't slap hard.

2305
01:11:57,190 --> 01:11:59,400
The next player is Si Yoon.

2306
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:00,560
Let's go.

2307
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,010
- I have handprints...
- Suk Jin.

2308
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:03,680
- on my face.
- Go up on the log.

2309
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:05,010
I will beat all subsequent players.

2310
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:06,770
Now, watch Si Yoon beat up...

2311
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:08,200
Seo Jin.

2312
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,650
Si Yoon, slap him a lot.

2313
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:12,310
The next player is Si Yoon.

2314
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:13,440
- All right.
- Okay.

2315
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:16,190
- Get ready.
- Suk Jin, get in there.

2316
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,280
- It gets on your clothes.
- Show me your left-hand skills.

2317
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,590
(Suk Jin gained confidence
after a win.)

2318
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:21,760
I am sorry.

2319
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:23,360
Show us your superpower.

2320
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:25,060
Ji power.

2321
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,360
Will you self-destruct?

2322
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:27,990
- I can grab him.
- That's right.

2323
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:29,800
- Jujitsu.
- Ji power.

2324
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,990
- That's good.
- Did you splatter paint?

2325
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:33,030
Did you splatter paint?

2326
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:34,660
(They splatter paint to each other.)

2327
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:36,770
What is going on?

2328
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,230
They are splattering paint.

2329
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:39,570
It's like laser.

2330
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:40,610
(Splattering)

2331
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:41,680
Ji power.

2332
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,310
- That's it.
- Good.

2333
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,650
- Good luck.
- You haven't won a point yet.

2334
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:46,720
(Sputtering)

2335
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:48,690
(Si Yoon scores right away.)

2336
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:49,980
You need to attack now. Keep going.

2337
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:52,060
It's hard to reach the face.

2338
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:53,780
Si Yoon is good.

2339
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,560
(His orange teeth shine.)

2340
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:58,520
It's funny because he got some paint
on his teeth.

2341
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,660
(The man with orange teeth
keeps getting attacked.)

2342
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,730
(After getting beaten up,
he goes down with Si Yoon.)

2343
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:07,030
Good job.

2344
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:08,640
- Good job.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2345
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:10,010
- Who is next?
- Ji power.

2346
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:12,370
I did pretty well, right?

2347
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:14,370
The next match is
Ahn Hee Yeon versus Haha.

2348
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:17,020
Can you use both hands?

2349
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,720
- I thought we were using one hand.
- That's right.

2350
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,740
She got paint on both hands too.

2351
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,780
Let's use two hands in this match.

2352
01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:23,910
Okay.

2353
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:24,980
Will you be okay?

2354
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:27,060
- Get ready.
- Haha.

2355
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,890
Haha, allow her some points.

2356
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,120
- You are a man.
- You are going against Hee Yeon.

2357
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,160
The man of Mapo-gu
should allow her three hits.

2358
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:35,800
- Three hits.
- What should I do?

2359
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,940
You should allow her three hits.

2360
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:37,970
He looks happy.

2361
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:39,140
Go ahead.

2362
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:41,560
- What should I do?
- It's okay. It's a game.

2363
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:42,700
Slap him. It's a game.

2364
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,810
Don't slap me hard.

2365
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:47,010
Just put paint on my face.
Don't go for a full swing.

2366
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:48,980
Allow her some points.

2367
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,180
You are doing great, Haha.

2368
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,240
- Go.
- My goodness.

2369
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,410
- That's good.
- Okay.

2370
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:55,440
My goodness.

2371
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:57,150
You are doing great.

2372
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:58,450
- Okay.
- That's good.

2373
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:00,060
- Come on.
- He is such a middle-aged man.

2374
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,280
Haha seems like Kim Heung Gook.

2375
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:06,930
(He even has the mustache.)

2376
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:09,820
My goodness.

2377
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,970
(He is so annoying.)

2378
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:15,440
- He is like a neighbor.
- A neighbor.

2379
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,900
(A neighbor who is shadowboxing
at the water fountain)

2380
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:21,440
(She clenches her teeth
and sets out to strike back.)

2381
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:29,780
(Her entire face gets painted.)

2382
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:31,720
(The onlookers love it.)

2383
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,930
(Artist Haha created a masterpiece.)

2384
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:35,090
He painted her whole face.

2385
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:36,120
"Avatar".

2386
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,320
He painted her whole face.

2387
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,360
"Avatar".

2388
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,360
(She attempts to strike back.)

2389
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,020
(Team Other Members, Team Dr. Yoo)

2390
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,360
(She keeps
getting her face painted.)

2391
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,340
- Go down with him. There you go.
- All right.

2392
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:46,030
(Self-destruction)

2393
01:14:46,230 --> 01:14:47,640
- There you go.
- This is too much.

2394
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,660
Good job.

2395
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:49,730
That was funny.

2396
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,700
(This man had fun with blue paint.)

2397
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,770
It's my turn, right?

2398
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:54,980
I...

2399
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:56,940
- Hani, you will make it big.
- You will make it big.

2400
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:58,050
You became a Smurf.

2401
01:14:58,050 --> 01:14:59,180
Hani, you will make it big.

2402
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:01,590
- You look so cute.
- You always score a meme.

2403
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,720
(She succeeded in scoring a meme
on Running Man today.)

2404
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,910
Se Chan versus Jae Suk.

2405
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:06,780
- Okay.
- It will be a fun match.

2406
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,860
Se Chan, go for the mouth.

2407
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:11,620
That's a good tip.

2408
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:13,450
- It's sticking out.
- The closest facial feature.

2409
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,230
All right.

2410
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:17,560
- You scooped up paint.
- That's right.

2411
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,230
Hey. You scooped up paint.

2412
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:21,360
You scooped up paint.

2413
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,230
Get me more paint. Pink one.

2414
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:27,400
(The protruding mouths begin
the match.)

2415
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,400
Get ready.

2416
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:32,550
(Hoo!)

2417
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:33,780
It will be fun to watch.

2418
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:36,950
(Men with the protruding mouth
start off noisily as always.)

2419
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:41,590
They won't need to reach far
since their mouths are protruding.

2420
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:43,020
- I know.
- You will hit the mouth anyway.

2421
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,860
Even if you swing wildly,
you will hit the mouth.

2422
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:47,320
(Putting paint)

2423
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:51,060
(He throws the paint
he carried in his hand.)

2424
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:53,360
What is that?

2425
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,660
Is that snot?

2426
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:57,870
(Team Other Members, Team Dr. Yoo)

2427
01:15:57,870 --> 01:15:59,400
(Se Chan scores
while the green snot distracts him.)

2428
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,940
Watch out for a counterattack.

2429
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:03,680
- You are doing well.
- Watch out.

2430
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:04,770
They are tired now.

2431
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:06,150
They are tired now.

2432
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:07,280
There you go.

2433
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:08,720
(Dodging)

2434
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,450
(Team Other Members, Team Dr. Yoo)

2435
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:11,950
(Slapping)

2436
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:15,590
(They scored at the same time.)

2437
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:18,450
- A counterattack.
- The counterattack worked.

2438
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:20,150
What is that?

2439
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,470
My goodness.

2440
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:23,490
The counterattack worked.

2441
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:25,530
They are so ugly.

2442
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:27,010
(The counterattack
leaves Jae Suk looking ugly.)

2443
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:29,660
(Team Other Members, Team Dr. Yoo)

2444
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:31,270
(Rubbing)

2445
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:32,340
(Slapping)

2446
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,340
(Team Other Members, Team Dr. Yoo)

2447
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:36,740
(Thus began the slapping party.)

2448
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:37,770
(Team Other Members, Team Dr. Yoo)

2449
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:40,980
(They score points without a break.)

2450
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:43,440
Jae Suk turned green.

2451
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,720
They became so dirty.

2452
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:46,220
He is Shrek.

2453
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:48,450
(The gum color
and grasshopper color suit them.)

2454
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:50,730
(Their looks are beyond salvation.)

2455
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:52,360
Se Chan, grab his legs.

2456
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,020
(They go down together.)

2457
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,470
- How many points did they earn?
- What?

2458
01:16:57,470 --> 01:16:58,600
I wonder.

2459
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,600
(They earned points
and lost their clean faces.)

2460
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,010
Goblins.

2461
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:02,440
They are goblins.

2462
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,870
Both of you earned
the highest number of points.

2463
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:08,740
Jae Suk, we earned
the highest number of points.

2464
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,410
Okay.

2465
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,310
What will they do
about their faces...

2466
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:15,310
(Gosh!)

2467
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:18,360
The next match is
Ji Hyo versus Ki Woong.

2468
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:21,190
Se Chan is a mafia member.
His face is red.

2469
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:22,280
No.

2470
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:25,020
I am not a mafia member.

2471
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,230
He looks like a sweet potato.

2472
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:28,320
Let's begin the match.

2473
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,470
A sweet potato.

2474
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:30,770
Let's go.

2475
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:32,490
- Come on.
- Show us how scary you are.

2476
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:33,730
Let's go.

2477
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:35,360
Ki Woong, don't go easy on her.
Go in there.

2478
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:36,810
How dare you!

2479
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:40,110
(Giggling)

2480
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:41,680
- He is really handsome.
- Finish her off.

2481
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,370
- They are having a good time.
- Finish her off.

2482
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:45,350
- Why did it become romantic?
- They are having a good time.

2483
01:17:47,610 --> 01:17:48,690
Hey.

2484
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:50,480
(They were having a good time,)

2485
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,720
(then he pushed her off.)

2486
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:54,230
Hey, that was funny.

2487
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:55,390
Hey!

2488
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,980
That was the worst.

2489
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:58,230
She couldn't hit him once.

2490
01:17:58,230 --> 01:17:59,260
(Ji Hyo couldn't hit him once.)

2491
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:01,360
- Hey!
- I am sorry.

2492
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,400
Good job.

2493
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,990
- He kept his face clean.
- I am sorry.

2494
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:05,470
- I am sorry.
- Good job.

2495
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:07,840
Now comes the last player,
Jong Kook.

2496
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,230
- Here comes the boss.
- Go.

2497
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,440
Jong Kook, beat him.

2498
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:11,530
Avenge us.

2499
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:13,440
- Jong Kook.
- Give him the whole container.

2500
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,570
All right.

2501
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:15,940
- Will you use the left hand?
- Go.

2502
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:18,180
Currently,

2503
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:19,910
Team Dr. Yoo has 149 points...

2504
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,650
and Team Other Members has
142 points.

2505
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:23,150
- Okay.
- You have 142 points.

2506
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:24,690
You should slap him more.

2507
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:26,450
- Slap him many times.
- This match will decide the result.

2508
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:27,560
That's right.

2509
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,150
- My goodness.
- Hey, Ki Woong.

2510
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:30,620
(Ki Woong will win
if he goes down with Jong Kook.)

2511
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:31,760
Let's go.

2512
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,450
- You need to get over seven points.
- You need to hit him.

2513
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:34,900
I should have put paint
on my right hand.

2514
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:36,800
Don't give Jong Kook a lot of time.

2515
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,100
You need to go down with him.

2516
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,510
You need to go down with him.
That's the way we win.

2517
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:41,840
Let's go.

2518
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:43,510
You can do it.

2519
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:45,400
In any case...

2520
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:46,940
(Nervous)

2521
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:48,850
You can get dental implants anyway.

2522
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:49,870
Okay. That's good.

2523
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:51,610
Smack him across the face,
Jong Kook.

2524
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:53,150
He brought so much paint.

2525
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:54,810
Should I shoot some paint?

2526
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:56,610
I will shoot some paint.

2527
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:58,690
Go.

2528
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:01,020
- That's good.
- Ki Woong is so competitive.

2529
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:02,690
Ki Woong.

2530
01:19:02,690 --> 01:19:03,900
I have a longer reach.

2531
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:07,430
- Come on. Show us a great scene.
- Go.

2532
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:08,930
- Go.
- Hey.

2533
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:11,400
- It's a chance to slap someone.
- Just knock him out.

2534
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:13,560
If he gets knocked out,
he will get so much screen time.

2535
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,560
That's good.

2536
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,940
- One hit.
- One hit.

2537
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:17,110
Go.

2538
01:19:17,110 --> 01:19:18,640
Let's score one point at a time.

2539
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:21,310
- He is intimidated.
- It seems that way.

2540
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:23,110
- Don't get intimidated.
- Keep going.

2541
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:25,020
You got this, Jong Kook.

2542
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:26,650
- All right.
- Go.

2543
01:19:26,650 --> 01:19:28,150
- He seems fast.
- Touch his face.

2544
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:29,780
- Come on.
- Don't let him win.

2545
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:31,220
Intimidate him with a jab.

2546
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:32,980
Intimidate him with a jab.

2547
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:35,150
Just knock him out with a punch.

2548
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,950
Look at their feet.

2549
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:38,900
I like how they are fighting
with their legs too.

2550
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,360
Did your feet get caught?

2551
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:41,820
It's the other way around,
but it looks that way.

2552
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,360
(Ki Woong wants to beat Jong Kook.)

2553
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:46,560
That's good.

2554
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,030
It's like the war of nerves
at a boxing match.

2555
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:52,440
He is measuring the distance.

2556
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:53,980
Mayweather versus Pacquiao.

2557
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,050
He is going in.

2558
01:19:55,050 --> 01:19:56,050
(Hitting)

2559
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:57,110
(Team Other Members, Team Dr. Yoo)

2560
01:19:58,350 --> 01:19:59,980
(Chuckling)

2561
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:01,150
My teeth...

2562
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:03,890
- Ki Woong is startled.
- He is startled.

2563
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:06,260
- That isn't blood, right?
- That isn't blood.

2564
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,260
- Ki Woong is startled.
- He is startled.

2565
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,950
- That isn't blood, right?
- That isn't blood.

2566
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:10,230
- That isn't blood.
- It looks like blood.

2567
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:12,490
(He got paint on his front teeth.)

2568
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:15,060
I think I lost my memories
for two seconds.

2569
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:17,020
You should self-destruct.

2570
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,900
- Self-destruct.
- You don't hold a chance.

2571
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,190
You don't hold a chance.

2572
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,530
- Five points.
- Five points.

2573
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:23,400
Self-destruct. Don't think about...

2574
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,200
hitting him once.

2575
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,340
Let me hit him once.

2576
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:28,180
Jong Kook, slap him multiple times.

2577
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:30,050
(Thus began
Millstone Guy's challenge!)

2578
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:31,720
Duck your head.

2579
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,050
Go in there.

2580
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:34,240
Don't think of him as a person.

2581
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:36,350
(Reaching)

2582
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:38,060
(Jong Kook loses his balance!)

2583
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:41,950
(Will Millstone Guy
succeed in striking back?)

2584
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,650
My goodness.

2585
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:46,560
- We lost.
- We won.

2586
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,990
- Jong Kook.
- We won.

2587
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:49,160
(Team Dr. Yoo won.)

2588
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,430
- That was perfect.
- That was nice.

2589
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,600
- We won.
- All right.

2590
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:52,600
We won.

2591
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,970
- That was nice.
- The match was going well.

2592
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:56,110
We won.

2593
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:57,940
- Did we win?
- We won.

2594
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:01,400
Thus, Team Dr. Yoo won.

2595
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,940
(Team Dr. Yoo won.)

2596
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:05,150
- Good job. Okay.
- We won.

2597
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:06,480
What happens now?

2598
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:09,550
Now, Team Dr. Yoo...

2599
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:10,860
Okay.

2600
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:13,190
- You can distribute 120 points.
- Did you say 120 points?

2601
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:16,020
As for the rest, each team
can distribute 30 points.

2602
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:17,090
(Each team
can distribute 30 points.)

2603
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:18,150
Jae Suk.

2604
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:20,320
- All right.
- Here are the current rankings.

2605
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:22,660
Let's avoid the bottom.

2606
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:23,970
(Si Yoon and Se Chan
are the bottom two.)

2607
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:27,140
- You have 120 points.
- Yes. Give us 30 points each.

2608
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:29,030
Even if you do that,
you will be in the first place.

2609
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:30,030
- We need to avoid the bottom.
- Okay.

2610
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:31,980
- They have 30 points per team.
- I just need to be 1st place.

2611
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:33,640
- You just need to be first place.
- That will happen anyway.

2612
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:34,900
It's meaningless.

2613
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:37,070
- Jae Suk.
- Do we get 30 points?

2614
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:40,810
Let's check So Min
and Si Yoon's points first.

2615
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:41,890
(They check the points
So Min distributed.)

2616
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:43,980
They got 5 points
and 25 points respectively.

2617
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:46,650
So Min got 5 points
and Si Yoon got 25 points.

2618
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:48,150
- Hey.
- I can't believe So Min.

2619
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:50,430
That's not the way
you treated Se Chan.

2620
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:51,650
- So Min.
- Still...

2621
01:21:52,190 --> 01:21:53,320
Next.

2622
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:55,320
I gave 0 points to myself
and 30 points to Se Chan.

2623
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,400
Okay.

2624
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,730
- Really? Why?
- Why?

2625
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,560
Why is everyone going crazy?

2626
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,270
Let's see what happens.

2627
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,980
Hee Yeon.

2628
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:05,310
I distributed the points evenly.

2629
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:07,480
- Gosh, thank you.
- Both members got 15 points.

2630
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:08,480
Jong Kook won't be at the bottom.

2631
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,550
This time, I gave 30 points
to each member.

2632
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:12,980
All the members got 30 points.

2633
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:14,310
That's the right thing to do.

2634
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:16,050
- You're really cool.
- Okay.

2635
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:17,480
You're Dr. Yoo.

2636
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:20,410
Look at the Mafia and his red face.

2637
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:22,190
All right. Keep talking.

2638
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,190
What?

2639
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:25,650
- Did Haha just talk to us?
- Yes.

2640
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:27,190
- Did you talk to us?
- He just said,

2641
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:28,970
"Look at the Mafia
and his red face." Okay.

2642
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,600
You must feel at ease.

2643
01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:33,270
I'll announce the results now.

2644
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:36,110
Number 9 and 10 will get a penalty,
and number 1 and 2 are exempted.

2645
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:37,640
(Number 9 and 10 will get a penalty,
and number 1 and 2 are exempted.)

2646
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:40,870
(Did the 4 members at the bottom
manage to change their fate?)

2647
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:43,350
All right. Here are the results.

2648
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:45,150
Okay.

2649
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:47,240
I'm so relieved.

2650
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:48,690
- Ki Woong is number eight.
- Okay.

2651
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:50,190
Si Yoon gave way to him.

2652
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:51,720
So what do we do now?

2653
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:54,450
First, you should pick a person
to get a penalty with you.

2654
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:56,260
But I can't pick Jae Suk or Ji Hyo.

2655
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:57,950
- That's right.
- I can pick the rest of them.

2656
01:22:57,950 --> 01:22:59,950
I see. Is that so?

2657
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:02,160
- You two should talk about it.
- I know we should.

2658
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,770
What did you say earlier?
What about the Mafia?

2659
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:07,770
You looked cute.
That's what I meant.

2660
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:09,860
Number three must be
most disappointed now.

2661
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:11,640
- Right?
- I think so.

2662
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,940
It will be fun
if you pick number three.

2663
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:16,440
We ate together.

2664
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:19,410
And we did things together.

2665
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:21,440
We planned things together.

2666
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,810
I can't stop thinking of the people
who disappointed me.

2667
01:23:23,810 --> 01:23:25,190
Those who gave me hard times.

2668
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:27,150
Si Yoon said that
when we ate together earlier.

2669
01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:30,150
He kept saying
that the Mafia game was killing him.

2670
01:23:30,150 --> 01:23:31,320
- I was humiliated.
- Right.

2671
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:33,560
I was really scared too.

2672
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:35,800
I was so anxious.

2673
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:39,160
Si Yoon and I made a firm decision.

2674
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,270
I see.

2675
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:42,340
We will call the name then.

2676
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:44,640
In 1, 2, and 3.

2677
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,330
(Who will get a penalty with them?)

2678
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:56,700
- Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook.

2679
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,090
(Jong Kook)

2680
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,560
(Shaking his head)

2681
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,090
- He was so...
- Nice shot!

2682
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:05,040
During the Mafia Game...

2683
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,300
- But...
- He talked too much.

2684
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,410
It was suffocating.

2685
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:09,340
Nice shot.

2686
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:12,710
So Si Yoon, Se Chan,
and Jong Kook will get a penalty.

2687
01:24:12,710 --> 01:24:16,880
And today's penalty is necessary
for men with low self-esteem.

2688
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:20,210
To build up your lower body,
you'll do 100 squats.

2689
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:21,310
- Okay!
- Jong Kook likes it.

2690
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:23,490
- It's good for Jong Kook.
- He loves it.

2691
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:24,960
You'll do 100 squats
before you go home.

2692
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,990
(Squats? Okay!)

2693
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:28,130
- It's good for Jong Kook.
- He loves it.

2694
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:30,890
Look, Mr. Director.
It's supposed to be a penalty.

2695
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:33,020
Is this a penalty?

2696
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:34,370
(Jong Kook is getting a penalty,)

2697
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:36,090
(but it's not
a real penalty for him.)

2698
01:24:36,090 --> 01:24:38,760
- This is what Jong Kook likes.
- I can't believe this.

2699
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:41,370
- What is going on?
- It's not a penalty for him.

2700
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:42,370
He loves it.

2701
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:43,840
The lower body is
important for a man.

2702
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,710
- My goodness.
- Without the penalty,

2703
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:47,210
he will work out anyway.

2704
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,750
So the three of them
will get the penalty.

2705
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:50,920
The rest of you may go home now.

2706
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,880
- Thank you.
- Okay.

2707
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,810
Okay. Squats.

2708
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:57,210
Shall we begin? Ready.

2709
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:58,260
- Is it 100 squats?
- Yes.

2710
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,460
All right. Don't go too fast.
You should feel your muscles.

2711
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:02,880
- All right.
- Let's not waste the time.

2712
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,090
- Make the most out of it.
- Okay.

2713
01:25:04,090 --> 01:25:05,220
You know what I mean.

2714
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:07,590
- Bye.
- This isn't just a penalty.

2715
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:09,220
- Make the most out of it.
- Work out the lower body.

2716
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:11,370
That's right. Let's do this then.

2717
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:12,760
- One.
- One.

2718
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:14,240
- Two.
- Two.

2719
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:15,510
(He's absorbing the energy
from the beginning.)

2720
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:16,510
- Three.
- Three.

2721
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:18,410
- Four.
- Four.

2722
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,470
- Five.
- Five.

2723
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:23,050
Six. That's right.

2724
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:24,550
- Seven.
- Seven.

2725
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,620
- Eight.
- Eight.

2726
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:27,840
Nine.

2727
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,640
- Will you slow down?
- Ten.

2728
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,010
Slow down.

2729
01:25:31,010 --> 01:25:32,810
Hurry and do two squats. One more.

2730
01:25:32,810 --> 01:25:34,180
Okay. Let's do it again. One.

2731
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:36,290
- One.
- One. Two.

2732
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:37,300
Two.

2733
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:38,700
- Three.
- Three.

2734
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:39,890
- Good.
- Jong Kook, I'm reaching my limit.

2735
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:41,060
I'm reaching my physical limit.

2736
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:43,020
- Why did you call his name?
- Jong Kook, please.

2737
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,800
(Under Jong Kook's direction,
Se Chan is getting a penalty alone.)

2738
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,500
- Eight.
- My legs are about to burst.

2739
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,010
- They are about to burst.
- Seven.

2740
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,740
My goodness.

2741
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:51,240
Help me.

2742
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,300
Ten. Again.

2743
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,340
- One.
- My goodness.

2744
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:55,600
- One.
- My head hurts.

2745
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:56,950
- Two.
- My gosh.

2746
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:58,050
(It's the new-style forced squat.)

2747
01:25:58,050 --> 01:25:59,380
- Three.
- All right.

2748
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:00,510
- Four.
- Gosh.

2749
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:01,840
- Five.
- Stop him.

2750
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:02,990
- Six.
- Now.

2751
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:04,920
Seven. Eight.

2752
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,050
- Ten.
- Jong Kook.

2753
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:07,180
- Five.
- My back hurts.

2754
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:08,490
- Six.
- My back really hurts.

2755
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:10,260
Seven. Eight.

2756
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:11,830
- Nine.
- Oh dear.

2757
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:13,130
Ten.

2758
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:14,800
- We have ten squats left.
- Wait, Jong Kook.

2759
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,090
Hang on.

2760
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:18,590
Why did you pick me? Why?

2761
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,560
- All right. One.
- Hurry.

2762
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,260
- Two. Three.
- My friend.

2763
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:24,970
Four, five, six,

2764
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:27,880
seven, eight, nine,

2765
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,410
- ten.
- All right.

2766
01:26:29,410 --> 01:26:30,750
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2767
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:32,050
Thank you.

2768
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:33,810
- Well done.
- I'm honored.

2769
01:26:33,810 --> 01:26:36,310
- Okay.
- That was really nice.

2770
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:37,620
Gosh, it feels great.

2771
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:39,660
I wish we would get
this penalty every day.

2772
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:43,390
(The short
but intense penalty is over.)

2773
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:47,590
(Case Number 1617,
Interrogation Room 1)

2774
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:51,890
(Case Number 4075,
Interrogation Room 2)

2775
01:26:52,090 --> 01:26:53,510
That's what I always do.

2776
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:55,300
- Making fun of So Min.
- Look at that.

2777
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:57,380
That's because you're the Mafia.

2778
01:26:57,470 --> 01:27:01,100
(There's the Mafia
among the 7 of them.)

2779
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:03,810
(There's only one clue.)

2780
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:07,420
(The Mafia has explanations
for his actions.)

2781
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:08,710
I think I know who it is.

2782
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,210
(It's Interrogation Room 1 again.)

2783
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,490
- I'm going to...
- Why are you upset?

2784
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:16,660
(The interrogation begins to dig
into their abnormal behaviors.)

2785
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:18,130
I said it's not me.

2786
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:19,590
(With the member-specific
interrogations,)

2787
01:27:19,590 --> 01:27:21,300
(the Mafia starts
revealing its identity.)

2788
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,930
- That's the mission, right?
- Hang on.

2789
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:26,910
(They keep closing in on the Mafia.)

2790
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:27,930
Let's say it's me. I don't care.

2791
01:27:27,930 --> 01:27:29,410
(This is it. You're the Mafia.)

2792
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,410
(Is it me?)

2793
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:32,240
(And you're trying to frame me.)

2794
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,410
(Burping)

2795
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:37,620
(Catch the Mafia,
Running Man in Chaos)
