1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,560
Hello.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,340
What's going on?

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,570
What made you come all the way
to the beauty shop to see me?

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,810
What is happening?

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,980
- Hello, Se Chan.
- Nice to meet you.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,050
- You went to the beauty shop.
- Right, I did.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,610
I went to the beauty shop
to look good today.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,520
Why are you kidnapping me?
Where are we going?

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,380
- Hello. Nice to see you.
- Hello.

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,430
Hello.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,020
Take this phone first.

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,160
Gosh, this is...

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:40,470
(All the members get
the latest model smartphone each.)

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,180
What are we going to do
with this phone?

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,930
A lot of our viewers like...

16
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,280
- your talk during the opening.
- Okay.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,010
So we reflected their opinions
for today's episode.

18
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,540
We will start the opening
with an online group chat.

19
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,960
What?

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,930
- My gosh. With a group chat?
- Yes.

21
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,930
- Hang on.
- While you're in the car...

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,600
I'm not good at this.

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,650
My gosh.

24
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,360
You know I'm good
at online chatting.

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,460
- An online chat?
- Yes.

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,300
I'm not familiar
with the messaging app.

27
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,860
The 1st and 2nd one.

28
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,580
By the time I'm done typing,
they already changed the subject.

29
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,080
(We will now show you
the group chat...)

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,940
(of the talkative members
of Running Man for 3 minutes.)

31
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,290
I'll send a photo.

32
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,790
"Hello. Good morning."

33
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,750
(Haha: Hello. Good morning.
This is crazy.)

34
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,930
- He sent a photo.
- My gosh.

35
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,160
(Haha: Hello. Good morning.
This is crazy.)

36
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,550
"Hello."

37
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,550
(Se Chan: Hello.)

38
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,190
I should take a photo.

39
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,570
(He feels a lot more confident
after visiting the beauty shop.)

40
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,540
Done.

41
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,660
(Jae Suk: Dirty Mustache)

42
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,710
It's clean.

43
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,540
Se Chan looks good today.

44
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,150
Se Chan looks handsome
in the picture.

45
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,350
Gosh, I'm startled.

46
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
(Haha: Surprised)

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,690
(Jong Kook: Se Chan's picture
looks great.)

48
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,380
(Ji Hyo: It's So Min.
Jae Suk: It's a ghost.)

49
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,960
He calls her a ghost.

50
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,910
(Haha: It's like "The Ring".)

51
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,190
She looks like a Chinese ghost.

52
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,330
He calls me a ghost.

53
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,130
Why? Do I look different today?

54
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,800
I think I look pretty.
That's why they tease me.

55
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,770
(So Min: This is how I look today.
Haha: Oldie, jinks.)

56
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,560
(Se Chan: Suk Jin,
what are you doing?)

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,930
"I don't think
he knows how to text."

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,640
"He's old."

59
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,800
The Cheonjiin typing...

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
(The Cheonjiin typing...)

61
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,180
(The Cheonjiin lover is still not
used to the new culture.)

62
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,340
How can I use the Cheonjiin typing?

63
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,520
(The Cheonjiin lover is still not
used to the new culture.)

64
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,680
It's done. They are taking photos.

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
(Suk Jin: Mind your own business.)

66
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,780
"Mind your own business."

67
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,520
"Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong."

68
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,550
(Jae Suk: I'm Yoo Jae Suk.
Haha: Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong.)

69
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,700
(Suk Jin: I changed the keyboard
setting to Cheonjiin.)

70
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
(So Min: There's a rumor that
Suk Jin is learning Excel.)

71
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,670
(Jong Kook: I keep making typos.
Jae Suk: Have a nice day.)

72
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,060
Should I take a photo
and send it to them?

73
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,860
(Jae Suk: Thank you. I wish
they noticed it back then.)

74
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,510
(Jong Kook: I want to hang around
with him in Anyang.)

75
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,980
"What's with your nose?"

76
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,770
(Haha: What's with your nose?
Ji Hyo: He looks like a delinquent.)

77
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,770
(Jae Suk: I'm still a star.)

78
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,550
"I'm still a star."

79
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,420
(Se Chan: There's Mr. Jee.)

80
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,210
(Suk Jin:
My nose is a little puffy.)

81
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,960
(So Min: Jae Suk said this before.)

82
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,930
(Se Chan: It is swollen a lot.)

83
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,330
(Ji Hyo: What did you
eat last night?)

84
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,300
(So Min: Suk Jin's nose.
Suk Jin: Hey!)

85
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,170
(So Min: LOL)

86
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,520
(So Min: A gourd dipper.)

87
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,730
She calls it a gourd dipper.

88
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,770
That's funny.

89
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,560
(Jae Suk: I want to eat with you.
Se Chan: Buy us a meal.)

90
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,480
(Their talk has no common thread.)

91
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,800
"Jae Suk, don't be serious."

92
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,080
(Jong Kook: Why did you butt in?
Haha: LOL)

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,150
"Mint chocolate."

94
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,520
(Jae Suk: Do you guys like
mint chocolate?)

95
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,710
"Do you like it?"

96
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,490
"I like it."

97
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,520
(Ji Hyo: Yes.)

98
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,680
"I'm a mint chocolate lover."

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,780
(Haha: I'm a mint chocolate lover.)

100
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,120
This is so funny.

101
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,020
We are all old, so it takes us
a long time to do the typing.

102
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,430
(Suk Jin: I will teach
Jong Kook a lesson.)

103
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,800
(Se Chan: Can you still teach
Jong Kook a lesson?)

104
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,360
(Se Chan: Sexy)

105
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,530
(Jong Kook: Aren't you the extra
from the movie, "1987"?)

106
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,060
(So Min: He's handsome.
Haha: I got it. Jae Suk's mom!)

107
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,370
(Se Chan:
This is when he was clumsy.)

108
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,770
"He is cool."

109
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,680
(Jae Suk: He is cool.)

110
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
(While they are busy
chatting online...)

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,920
Gosh, Jae Suk.

112
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,550
"The opening talk is over.
Now we have two Mafias..."

113
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,650
"in the chat room."

114
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,580
(There are 2 Mafias
in the chat room?)

115
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,630
"The opening talk is over."

116
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,020
"Now we have two Mafias
in the chat room."

117
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,270
(Now we have two Mafias
in the chatroom.)

118
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,590
- What?
- Two Mafias?

119
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,140
(Among the 7 members in the
chat room, 2 of them are Mafias.)

120
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,640
There are two Mafias?

121
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,440
(They suddenly heard
about the 2 Mafias.)

122
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,650
"They successfully
carried out their mission..."

123
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,950
"during the chat.
For the next five minutes..."

124
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,910
(The 2 Mafias successfully
carried out their hidden mission.)

125
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,080
Hang on.

126
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,280
(While they were busy
talking about useless things,)

127
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,260
(the Mafias carried out
their hidden mission.)

128
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,390
Yang Se Chan.

129
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,330
Se Chan gave us
a lot of information.

130
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,160
He talked about many things.

131
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,790
I think it's Se Chan.

132
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,700
I bet he's the Mafia.

133
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,140
(They all start to suspect Se Chan.)

134
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,600
It's Se Chan.

135
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,370
Because he talks too much.

136
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,710
The one that talks a lot
must be the Mafia.

137
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,710
That's how it works
in the Mafia game.

138
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,040
(Are the photos Se Chan uploaded
the mission for the Mafias?)

139
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,650
I just sent them a lot of photos.

140
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,280
(I have to do something.)

141
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,980
Guys, I'm telling you
I'm not up to anything.

142
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,520
Please believe me.

143
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,700
I'm on my way!

144
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,420
Se Chan is the Mafia.

145
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,730
It's Se Chan.

146
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,440
(His unreasonable excuse
makes them more suspicious.)

147
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,830
It's Se Chan.

148
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,440
(Se Chan: What about Jae Suk
talking about mint chocolate?)

149
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,470
(At that moment, Se Chan
suspects Jae Suk.)

150
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,580
Right. It's strange that he suddenly
talked about mint chocolate.

151
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,390
"Mint chocolate."

152
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,890
(Jae Suk suddenly asked them
if they like mint chocolate.)

153
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,150
"Do you like it?"

154
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,150
Jae Suk is strange.

155
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,290
He was being too serious and polite.

156
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,020
Can you believe this?

157
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,160
"I want to eat with you."

158
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,290
That doesn't sound like Jae Suk.

159
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,290
(The polite message
doesn't sound like Jae Suk.)

160
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,270
They will definitely pick me.

161
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,870
I was being serious.

162
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,940
(Jae Suk shows a mysterious smile.)

163
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,670
Hello.

164
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,010
I got a message.

165
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,950
"You're the first Mafia."

166
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,780
(You're the 1st Mafia.)

167
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,950
Today,

168
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,280
we're having
Prisoner's Dilemma Race.

169
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,130
You and another member
are the first Mafias.

170
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,150
What will happen then?

171
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,400
I'll give you the first mission.

172
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,330
What is it?

173
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,790
The hidden mission
for the Mafias is...

174
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,570
They will have no idea.
They will totally fall for it.

175
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,330
(Jae Suk carried out the hidden
mission without anyone knowing.)

176
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,440
You get 300 dollars
for carrying out the mission.

177
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,380
(He got 300 dollars
for carrying out the mission.)

178
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,040
(The Mafias start taking
the lead with the black money.)

179
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,340
It's Yoo Jae Suk and Yang Se Chan.

180
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,320
I pick Yang Se Chan and Yoo Jae Suk.

181
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,540
(Suk Jin also names
Yoo Jae Suk and Yang Se Chan.)

182
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,780
Yang Se Chan and Yoo Jae Suk.

183
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,420
- I think Yang Se Chan...
- They all seem suspicious.

184
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,150
- The voting results are in.
- Okay.

185
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,850
Jae Suk, you've been named...

186
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,070
as a suspect for the Mafia.

187
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,270
The other suspect is not revealed.

188
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,160
(There's one more person
who's named as a suspect.)

189
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,830
(But they don't know
if the suspect is the Mafia or not.)

190
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,770
But in this Mafia game,

191
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,580
you're not eliminated
just because you're chosen.

192
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,120
(The game doesn't end
when the Mafia is arrested.)

193
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,710
The two members
with the most votes...

194
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,850
will be interrogated by the other
members in different rooms.

195
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,120
After the interrogation,
the two suspects will choose...

196
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,850
between silence or confession.

197
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,260
They can either win or lose money
according to the results.

198
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,960
Let's say the two suspects
are both Mafias.

199
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,030
If they both remain silent,
there won't be any change.

200
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,600
So they will stay as the Mafias
and carry out their missions.

201
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,080
This way, they can make more money.

202
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,380
But if one of them confesses,

203
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,650
and the other remains silent,

204
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,510
the one who confessed
will get money,

205
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,320
but the one who remained silent
will lose 1,000 dollars.

206
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,910
And there will be new Mafias.

207
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,390
(The Mafias will be replaced)

208
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,150
If they both confess,

209
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,060
they will lose 500 dollars each.

210
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,350
In this case, the Mafias
will also be replaced.

211
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,220
So the two suspects don't know
about each other.

212
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,770
If they both remain silent,
it will be the best choice.

213
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,940
If one of them confesses, he or she
will be the only one to make money.

214
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,070
And the other will
suffer a great loss.

215
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,080
- If the other suspect is innocent,
- That's right.

216
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,650
he or she will have no choice
but to remain silent.

217
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,820
In this case, if you remain silent,

218
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,150
nothing will change.

219
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,020
If you confess,

220
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,940
you will lose a little money,

221
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,720
and the other Mafia
will suffer a great loss.

222
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,050
(Mafia 1 loses 100 dollars,
and Mafia 2 loses 500 dollars.)

223
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,650
(For Jae Suk, it is important
to know who the other suspect is.)

224
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,320
So the Mafias should
confess together.

225
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,470
I have to make them confess
no matter what.

226
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,530
(The 5 members will interrogate
the suspects as detectives.)

227
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,930
So it's possible that both of
the two suspects are not Mafias.

228
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,060
(The detectives have to make
someone confess to earn money.)

229
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,010
It's interesting already.

230
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,750
First, Jae Suk, you will
go to the interrogation room now.

231
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,940
My goodness.

232
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,310
(Mafia Jae Suk goes
to the interrogation room first.)

233
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,490
(The suspects are moved separately,
so they can't see each other.)

234
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,760
(The other suspect might not be
the one I thought of.)

235
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,090
(Mafia Jae Suk is curious
about the other suspect.)

236
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,490
I will have to keep insisting
that I'm innocent.

237
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,790
(Mafia Jae Suk goes
into the interrogation room.)

238
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:30,100
(And the second suspect goes
into the other interrogation room.)

239
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,160
(Both suspects are
in the interrogation rooms now.)

240
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,010
(The quiet interrogation rooms
are waiting for them.)

241
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,440
I became the suspect
all of a sudden.

242
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,540
(Interrogation Room 1)

243
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,720
Stochastically, it is difficult...

244
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
to spot both of the Mafias.

245
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,150
Even though I'm picked,

246
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,720
it is possible that
the other suspect is innocent.

247
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,760
(Jae Suk thinks there is a citizen
in the other interrogation room.)

248
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,820
I will risk it.

249
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,860
(I will risk it hoping there is
a citizen in the other room.)

250
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,520
(Interrogation Room 2)

251
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,640
- What should we do to catch them?
- What?

252
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,500
What should we do
to catch the Mafias?

253
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,700
I have to see their faces first.

254
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,980
I need to look them in the eye.

255
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,700
(Who is the second suspect?)

256
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,800
Who is it?

257
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,900
- Se Chan.
- Hello.

258
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,510
It's not me.

259
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,770
Hey, sit down.

260
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,670
- Sit.
- Seriously, I'm not the Mafia.

261
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,780
I should turn off the camera first.

262
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,850
Why would you turn it off?

263
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,550
- This is nothing like that.
- What do you mean?

264
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,450
Have a seat.
This is an interrogation.

265
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,820
Let's go to the Room of Truth.

266
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,450
- You...
- Why Room of Truth?

267
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,600
This is what I said earlier.

268
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,520
I said I really didn't want
Jong Kook to come into this room.

269
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,900
- Why are you so dressed up?
- What?

270
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,470
- You're all dressed up.
- I just...

271
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,870
got a haircut.

272
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,290
And they did my hair there.

273
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,740
And you're wearing
fancy clothes today.

274
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,200
That's not true.

275
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,700
You think you're the main character
in today's episode.

276
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,610
Think about it. If I were the Mafia,
why would I show that?

277
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,800
You're just dressed like a Mafia.

278
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,350
No.

279
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,220
I can explain. In Gangnam...

280
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,590
I don't need your explanation.

281
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,940
- Don't bother.
- You go...

282
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,280
- to the same beauty shop with me.
- No.

283
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,280
Listen to me. I was going
to get a haircut today.

284
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,230
But I didn't want to leave the shop
only after a haircut.

285
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,730
So I got my hair
and makeup done there.

286
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,370
Then I heard about the mission.

287
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,470
- That can't be true.
- This is what it sounds like.

288
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,530
"I got my hair
and makeup done there."

289
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,660
- "Then I was told I'm the Mafia."
- That's not true.

290
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,400
- It's not me.
- You know what I mean.

291
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,240
I'm not the Mafia.

292
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,880
And one of you two is
trying to frame me.

293
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,670
Don't do that.

294
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,440
Don't give me that look.

295
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,120
Looked at objectively,
what he says doesn't make sense.

296
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,750
Do you know why?
Because I'm flustered.

297
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,890
You guys are cornering me
when I'm not the Mafia. It's not me.

298
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,050
He's overreacting.

299
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,260
I don't think both the suspects
are the Mafias.

300
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,320
But one of the suspects might
be the Mafia.

301
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
You think?

302
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,230
"One of the suspects might be?"

303
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,000
- "One of the suspects might be."
- You're a word magician.

304
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,660
I'm acting strange
because you're cornering me.

305
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,970
But it's not me, seriously.

306
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,160
I'm not the Mafia.

307
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,430
Where is he?

308
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,980
Hey, Yoo Jae Suk.

309
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,480
It's good to see him.

310
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,670
It's you.

311
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,150
- I'm 100 percent sure.
- Me too.

312
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,070
I'm telling you again.

313
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,720
- Excuse me.
- You made a wrong guess.

314
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,270
That's not true. We are right.

315
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,590
Take a look at this.

316
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,520
Listen, Jae Suk.

317
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,780
We were talking
about Suk Jin's nose.

318
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,990
That's what you like to talk about.

319
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,760
Because you like...

320
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,360
to make fun of Suk Jin.

321
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,550
- I see.
- Right?

322
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,970
- That's not true.
- But...

323
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,030
You had a good chance
to tease Suk Jin here.

324
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,430
While we were making jokes,

325
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,530
- you suddenly...
- Eating.

326
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,640
"I want to eat with you guys."

327
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,930
- He suddenly said that.
- I was serious.

328
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,350
And...

329
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,850
while we were confused,

330
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,750
you suddenly asked
if we liked mint chocolate.

331
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,940
You punk!

332
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,410
Why, you punk?

333
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,490
"Why, you punk?"

334
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,260
I've never seen you...

335
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,130
talk about mint chocolate
for the past 30 years.

336
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,500
It's just that
people like to talk...

337
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,140
- about mint chocolate these days.
- I don't know about that.

338
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,370
- Why did you suddenly bring it up?
- What's with mint chocolate?

339
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,800
I wanted to talk...

340
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,030
- about random things.
- Why?

341
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,930
- I told you.
- Because it was your mission?

342
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,880
It wasn't a mission? I just...

343
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,150
hated the flow of the conversation
in the chat room.

344
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,440
A few of us were leading
the conversation.

345
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,570
That's what you did.

346
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,020
I'm telling you again.

347
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,390
I just hated it.
That's why I brought that up.

348
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,990
- That's what you do.
- It's just strange.

349
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,120
You don't usually
talk about random things.

350
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,630
That's because I hated
the way the talk went.

351
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,360
From the beginning, you were like,
"I'm Yoo Jae Suk."

352
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,630
Does that sound like you?

353
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,650
- By the way, he is...
- What?

354
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,970
Do you even have
a license or something?

355
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,320
I do, you punk.

356
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,660
Why do you keep
calling me like that?

357
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,740
You're being like this
with your weak fingers.

358
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,340
You punk.

359
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,340
(Upset)

360
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,930
Let go of it.

361
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,240
- Let go!
- All right.

362
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,440
- That's true.
- I know.

363
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,800
So...

364
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,270
you shouldn't do this with force.

365
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Who do you think the Mafia is then?

366
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,520
- I thought it was Seok Sam.
- It's not me.

367
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,810
But it's not Seok Sam.

368
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,520
- I'm not the Mafia.
- Then...

369
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,860
- I think it's him.
- Se Chan.

370
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,150
- He suddenly picks me. Okay.
- Yes.

371
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,130
- It might be him.
- It's him.

372
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,500
- He talked a lot.
- Seriously, he is...

373
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,230
- Honestly...
- I'm serious.

374
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,600
- You.
- He's so gullible.

375
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,400
- Hey.
- Seriously...

376
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,640
- Ji Hyo.
- It's you.

377
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,770
He's strange.

378
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,530
All right. Se Chan
will confess anyway.

379
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,660
I'm sure he will.

380
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,880
All right. Se Chan
will confess anyway.

381
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,700
What will you do?

382
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,040
(Is it Yang Se Chan?)

383
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,650
See? You're dumbfounded.

384
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,590
- He will confess.
- You're the Mafia. Tell us.

385
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,090
It's not me.

386
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,890
- He will say your name anyway.
- No.

387
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,890
Jong Kook, listen. When we chatted
in a group chat before,

388
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,550
- I shared pictures too...
- See? He's talking about the past.

389
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,520
He behaved as he always does
on purpose. Do you see what I mean?

390
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,020
"I have always behaved like this,
so I won't get caught."

391
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,640
- He thought that if he were quiet,
- He improvised.

392
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,840
he would be suspected.

393
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,140
- So he chatted as he always does.
- You know I wouldn't do that.

394
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,480
- Come on.
- I bet he's taken aback now.

395
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,640
- No. That's not true. Okay.
- Try to talk calmly.

396
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,270
- Go ahead.
- I can tell he's the Mafia already.

397
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,380
- So try to calm down a little bit.
- I'm not the Mafia.

398
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,720
Just confess to us on the other one.

399
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,650
- You'd better do that.
- Gosh. This is driving me nuts.

400
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,890
Look at this.

401
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,520
The Mafia who confesses gets
100 dollars. That's better, right?

402
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,820
- Yes. Of course.
- Right?

403
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,820
- That's better.
- My gosh.

404
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,690
The Mafia who chooses silence loses
1,000 dollars, you know.

405
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,520
Hey, listen. Locust, we'll help you,
so just tell us.

406
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,530
- Tell us.
- Right.

407
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,930
I'm not the Mafia.
Why are you guys... This is crazy.

408
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,800
I'll give you information to clarify
the rules. In every mission,

409
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,670
there's only one Mafia
in each interrogation room.

410
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,010
That is, there's only one Mafia
in this room.

411
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,070
(There's only one Mafia
in each interrogation room.)

412
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,670
(That means Jae Suk is
the only Mafia among them.)

413
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,850
Besides, it'd be weird if I confess
when I'm not the Mafia.

414
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,250
That sounds suspicious too.

415
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,780
- I'm not lying. I'm not the Mafia.
- What do you mean by that?

416
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
- It'd be weird.
- What do you mean?

417
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,360
Why can't you speak
as well as you usually do?

418
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,890
I get nervous
when I'm with Jong Kook.

419
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
You see...

420
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,420
You know me. Wouldn't I have
told you if I were the Mafia?

421
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,100
Do you think "I want to eat
with you" is a funny comment?

422
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,340
He's the Mafia.
I'm 100 percent sure of it.

423
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,510
- The other one will snitch on you.
- No.

424
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,380
I'm telling you, Se Chan will
snitch on you anyway.

425
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,880
- Right. Snitch on the other one.
- Snitch on the other one.

426
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,040
- Just tell us.
- Should I show you again?

427
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,480
- If you don't...
- Yoo Jae Suk!

428
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,650
- Gosh. This is driving me crazy.
- Seriously...

429
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,480
- Come on.
- Darn it!

430
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,910
- What's wrong?
- Darn it!

431
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,910
- Darn it! I can't believe this.
- What's wrong?

432
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,260
- Darn!
- Hey, calm down.

433
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,520
- Wait. What is it?
- Why?

434
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
- Darn it!
- What is it?

435
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,920
- Gosh!
- Calm down.

436
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,550
- You little...
- Why are you doing this suddenly?

437
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,020
- Are you trying to...
- Hold him.

438
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,020
- What's the matter?
- Hey, don't harm yourself.

439
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,190
- Hold on a second.
- You see, I...

440
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,840
- Call Detective Kim.
- What do we do?

441
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,430
- We should calm him down.
- All you have to do is confess.

442
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,400
- It's okay. That happens.
- Just tell us.

443
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,980
- Things happen. You'll be okay.
- Tell us who the other one is.

444
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,300
- Tell us and get 100 dollars.
- This is so unfair.

445
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,110
- Seriously.
- You got involved in a crime.

446
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,940
- But that can happen.
- You must've been flustered.

447
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,540
- That can happen to anyone.
- I got involved...

448
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,850
Now, Jae Suk, you have to choose
between silence and confession.

449
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,940
You should choose to confess
no matter what.

450
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,180
(What could be
Mafia Jae Suk's choice?)

451
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,260
- I'm not the one. I have no choice.
- If that's true... Hey.

452
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,230
Listen. If he's not the Mafia,

453
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,950
- I said I'm not.
- he has no choice but to be silent.

454
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,790
- That's right.
- Yes, if he's not the Mafia.

455
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,870
- Then you chose silence, right?
- Yes.

456
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,770
- All right.
- He stayed loyal to the end.

457
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,610
- That's not it. I'm not the Mafia.
- Hey, guys.

458
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,930
I don't think he's the Mafia.

459
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,110
Hang on. Jae Suk...

460
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,170
- Will you confess?
- No, I can't. I'm not the Mafia.

461
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,380
- It's because we've been...
- I choose silence.

462
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,150
- He would've confessed if he's one.
- Yes.

463
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,770
- Se Chan chose...
- He confessed, right?

464
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,650
- Did he choose to confess?
- silence.

465
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,520
Oh, my. He chose silence?

466
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,090
- Both of them chose silence? Yes.
- Then there won't be a change.

467
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,550
The Mafias will get
another hidden mission.

468
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,750
I'll explain the rules
when everyone gathers.

469
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,190
Maybe we were wrong.

470
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,760
- But...
- I'm sure Se Chan is the Mafia.

471
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,720
I have no idea.

472
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,500
Today, there are Mafias
in each round.

473
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,460
It's Chaotic Running Man.

474
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,610
You will receive prize money
according to your ranking.

475
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,380
The Mafia gets 300 dollars
for completing a hidden mission.

476
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,320
- I see.
- The Mafias of the first round...

477
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,240
already received 300 dollars
while the others have no money.

478
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:39,180
After each round, you choose
two people to interrogate by vote.

479
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,130
You have to make them confess
to succeed.

480
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,690
The citizens get 200 dollars
if they catch the Mafias.

481
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,400
If the Mafias confess
and get caught,

482
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,660
the next Mafias are randomly chosen.

483
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,810
The final top 2 will get a prize,
and the bottom 2 will get a penalty.

484
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,080
- I don't know.
- Wasn't So Min in our room?

485
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,400
Hey, why did you say,
"Buy us a meal?"

486
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,700
- Exactly. Why did you say that?
- What do you mean?

487
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,350
- He said he wanted to eat with us.
- Yes, I did.

488
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,740
- He said that.
- I meant that.

489
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,740
Because he said that,

490
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,390
- I just replied.
- Didn't you try to help him?

491
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,620
- Who? Me? Why would I help him?
- Yes.

492
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,710
- Hey, if you point that out...
- You didn't have to...

493
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,390
You were the first to reply
when he asked about mint chocolate.

494
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,360
- True. You said you like it.
- That's right.

495
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,450
- Right.
- True. But after that...

496
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,530
- I've been suspecting him too.
- Right.

497
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,660
I mean... Listen to me.

498
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,420
Jae Suk, Suk Jin, Ji Hyo, and I...
The four of us were in the room.

499
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,190
There's one among us
and another among the others.

500
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,570
- We were told so.
- Really?

501
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,810
There's only one Mafia in each room.

502
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,110
- There can't be 2 Mafias in 1 room.
- We weren't informed of that.

503
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,470
- Then I'm off the hook.
- You're suspecting me?

504
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,440
- Me?
- It's weird that he brought it up.

505
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,580
- Why me again?
- He brought it up suddenly.

506
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,350
- We were talking about the nose.
- Believe me. I'm not the Mafia.

507
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,440
- She hasn't done it in a while.
- I think So Min is the Mafia.

508
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,410
- Right. I just realized it.
- What she said opened my eyes.

509
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,090
- "They never let me be the Mafia."
- This is driving me crazy.

510
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,130
- Is it you?
- Pardon? Me?

511
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,650
They never choose me
as the Mafia, you know.

512
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,030
- I'm not the Mafia today, Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin, you're so smart.

513
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,300
- You saw through her.
- In the next round,

514
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,570
- So Min will confess.
- I think so too.

515
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,780
- You're done for.
- Let's see if you confess or not.

516
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,170
- Why is everyone suspecting me...
- Choose her as a suspect.

517
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,850
- when I've done nothing?
- She'll confess if she's the Mafia.

518
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,440
- All of us haven't been one...
- We should check her comments...

519
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,710
- to find out what her mission was.
- You sent the photo as a reply.

520
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,480
- You might have...
- Okay. Then interrogate me.

521
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,010
I'll remain silent.

522
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,980
- What?
- Just know...

523
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,420
- that I'm not the Mafia.
- If we interrogate her,

524
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,330
- she'll tell us everything.
- She'll confess.

525
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,900
- Both of them will confess.
- Actually...

526
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,690
- She'll tell us everything.
- Absolutely.

527
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,420
- So Min can go home now.
- True.

528
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,300
- That's true.
- So Min will go home now.

529
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,300
- She'll tell us everything.
- Say goodbye to the viewers.

530
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,340
- Okay.
- It was a mistake.

531
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,610
- I'm stressed out.
- Once he suspects someone...

532
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,540
- It's really stressful.
- I know.

533
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,430
"You are the Mafia.
With Mafia Jae Suk..."

534
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,500
(So Min was chosen as the Mafia
along with Jae Suk.)

535
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
("You are the Mafia.
With Mafia Jae Suk, carry out...")

536
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,380
"You are the Mafia.
With Mafia Jae Suk,"

537
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,090
"carry out the hidden mission."

538
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,320
Am I the Mafia?

539
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,980
I'm the Mafia?

540
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,290
"Make an acrostic poem
with your name."

541
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,630
What's this?

542
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,750
"Write sentences starting with
your initials in the chat room."

543
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,400
(Making acrostic poems
with the Mafias' initials)

544
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,930
(The Mafias made acrostic poems
with "YJS" and "JSM".)

545
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:13,400
(Just like this.)

546
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,670
(Suk Jin has been learning to use
Excel according to rumors.)

547
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,710
I'm done.

548
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,890
(My, I'm embarrassed.)

549
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,120
I can be very funny
when I chat online.

550
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,210
(Yoo Jae Suk is here. Joyful shoot.)

551
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,710
(Seok Sam will be with us.)

552
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,650
(You should've seen me as a star.
Jae Suk said that before.)

553
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,750
What sentence should I make
starting with "S"?

554
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,100
That's Suk Jin's photo. Good.
"Suk Jin's nose..."

555
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,990
(You should've seen me as a star.
Jae Suk said that before.)

556
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,070
(Suk Jin's nose.)

557
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,100
It looks like a gourd dipper.

558
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,430
"Just so you know,
I'm still a star."

559
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,610
I can't think of any word
starting with "S".

560
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,810
"Small wishes of mine."

561
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,550
(Small wishes of mine.
I want to eat with you.)

562
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,910
"Small wishes of mine.
I want to eat with you."

563
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,410
What's this?
They'll notice something's going on.

564
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,620
Mine is really natural.

565
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,590
"Mint chocolate.
Do you guys like it?"

566
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:04,530
"Mint chocolate.
Do you guys like it?"

567
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,030
They won't know what I'm doing.
They'll be completely fooled.

568
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,570
- Great job.
- They won't know.

569
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,160
- I did a really good job.
- They can never figure it out.

570
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,870
It sounds so natural.
Since the others were talking a lot,

571
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,400
it was easy for me
to make it sound relative.

572
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,050
(But she faced a crisis right away.)

573
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,110
(Detective Kook's eyes are
already fixed on So Min.)

574
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,650
Please change your clothes. We'll
give the Mafias a new mission.

575
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,940
- Then we'll gather again.
- Got it.

576
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,290
- Okay.
- I'll keep an eye on So Min.

577
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,320
She'll try to complete
the hidden mission.

578
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,480
(The Mafias won't be replaced.)

579
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,720
(And the 2 Mafias will be given
a new hidden mission.)

580
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,250
You'll be given
the second hidden mission.

581
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,260
- You have to carry it out later.
- I see.

582
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,730
It's Speak in Melody.

583
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:44,930
What's that?

584
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,640
- My package has arrived
- Oh, I see. Okay.

585
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:52,880
The 2 of you should make
more than 5 comments like this.

586
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,440
- In total?
- Yes.

587
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,810
- Each must do it at least once.
- Understood.

588
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,710
Got it. They all know
about the hidden mission now.

589
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,150
I'll get the money if I complete
the mission, right?

590
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,620
(Jae Suk is moving
to the mission location.)

591
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,830
Jae Suk, the hidden mission is
so difficult this time.

592
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,150
Did you read
my acrostic poems earlier?

593
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,690
You should be loud enough
for everyone to hear you.

594
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,800
What should we do?

595
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,330
- Hey, So Min.
- Yes?

596
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,300
I'll start singing,
and you answer me.

597
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,430
You know what I mean, right?

598
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,610
Right?

599
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,810
(Jae Suk who is famous
for his playfulness will initiate.)

600
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,470
They'll suspect us anyway.

601
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,110
- You never know.
- Let's see how it goes.

602
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,000
Let's see how things go first.

603
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,050
- What?
- It was funny.

604
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,890
The two Mafias are here already.

605
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,910
Welcome

606
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,480
(Jae Suk sings to welcome him
as he walks in.)

607
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,290
Here we go

608
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,860
Here we go
What is this? What are you doing?

609
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,300
The two Mafias arrived before us.

610
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,760
- The Mafias are already here
- Look at him.

611
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,230
- We're so excited
- This is strange.

612
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,960
You're really something else

613
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,310
Why are you acting so arrogant?

614
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,380
Are you carrying out
a hidden mission or what?

615
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,670
- You're a know-it-all
- Are you singing?

616
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,320
La, la, la, la, the two Mafias

617
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,590
(He joined them in singing
without knowing what's going on.)

618
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,480
I am not the Mafia

619
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,060
I am not the Mafia either

620
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,030
I think you two are the Mafias

621
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,060
- That's not true
- You two are the Mafias

622
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,720
- Why are we the Mafias?
- You are wrong

623
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,160
I am not the Mafia

624
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,640
- Neither am I
- You're "Ma," you're "Fi"

625
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,230
You

626
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,610
- I'm "A"
- I am "Ma"

627
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,580
- She's "Fi", and you're "A"
- I'm "A"

628
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,500
- Ma, Fi, A
- Ma, Fi, A

629
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,150
Ma, Fi, A

630
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,940
- Welcome
- It's good to see you again

631
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,350
- The Mafias were here when I came.
- I see.

632
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,480
- Seok Sam is the Mafia
- You got caught

633
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,980
- He got caught
- He got caught

634
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,100
- He's "Ma," and she's "Fi"
- He got caught

635
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,030
- He's "A," Ma, Fi, A
- Ma, Fi, A

636
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,720
- Are there three of them?
- Yes.

637
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,300
That means
there are three Mafias here.

638
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,340
Two Mafias are enough.

639
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,000
No, he's "Ma," and she's "Fia"

640
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,700
- You're "A," Ma, Fi, A
- That's not true

641
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,780
What's going on? Please sit down.

642
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,580
Seok Sam is so funny.

643
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,050
- I know.
- Suk Jin is so funny.

644
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,170
- You're so funny, Suk Jin.
- Sorry?

645
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,710
I'll give you the first mission
right away.

646
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,510
The first mission is
Keyword Adventurer.

647
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,510
- What?
- "Keyword Adventurer?"

648
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,620
- I know a lot.
- I don't like this.

649
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,620
We'll give you...

650
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,420
- two keywords.
- Oh, gosh.

651
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,990
Discuss together to choose the one
that's been searched more.

652
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,300
- One that has been searched more?
- Yes.

653
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,220
If you look at this website,

654
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,460
when you enter two keywords,

655
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,460
(They'll use this website that shows
the search volumes in 16 regions.)

656
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,700
- Oh, it shows tallied volumes.
- it compares the search volumes...

657
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,780
- in the 16 regions in the country.
- Really?

658
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,430
- In different regions.
- You have to pick the keyword...

659
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,900
that's been searched more
in more regions to win.

660
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,320
The results are different
in those regions, right?

661
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,670
If it's searched more
in nine regions,

662
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,710
it's the winning keyword.

663
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,710
- That's the winner.
- Correct.

664
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,090
You get one point whenever you pick
the winning keyword.

665
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,290
And you'll be ranked in the end.

666
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,790
The person in 1st place gets
500 dollars,

667
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,250
and the person in 2nd place gets
400 dollars.

668
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,980
- The 3rd place gets 300 dollars.
- Okay.

669
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,650
- The bottom two won't get any.
- Okay.

670
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,660
The Mafias will get 300 dollars each
if they complete the hidden mission.

671
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,900
I see.

672
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,990
The Mafias will carry out...

673
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,540
- Are they doing it right now?
- their own mission...

674
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,540
- other than this one, right?
- Yes. They got a hidden mission.

675
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,700
(The citizens were reminded of
the hidden mission again.)

676
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,040
Have you been doing it
the whole time?

677
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,650
I'm not the Mafia.

678
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,610
I'll keep an eye on So Min
to find out what her mission is.

679
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,170
- Let's keep an eye on her.
- I'm really not the Mafia.

680
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,440
- I'll keep an eye on her.
- I'll look only at So Min.

681
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,510
- That's a good idea.
- I'll do the same.

682
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,710
I'll keep an eye on So Min too.

683
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,910
(Could they be able to sing 5 times
without being suspected?)

684
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,360
- Look.
- There are no lenses

685
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,420
(There are no lenses)

686
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,250
(The Mafias' Hidden Mission 1,
There are no lenses)

687
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,630
Jae Suk seems so energetic today.

688
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,100
- He's really energetic today.
- Indeed.

689
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,720
- He surprised me.
- He's so energetic.

690
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,640
- He won't take a break.
- There are no lenses

691
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,840
Why? Are you anxious
because you're the Mafia?

692
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,570
Yes, I'm the Mafia, I'm "Ma"

693
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,340
- I'm "Fi," and he's "A"
- She's "Fi," and you're "A"

694
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,140
- Ma, Fi, A
- There are only two Mafias here.

695
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,350
Not three.

696
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,350
- You're "Ma", and you're "Fia"
- It's confusing.

697
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,240
- Those who aren't the Mafias,
- You're "Ma"

698
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,290
- say that you're not the Mafia.
- You're "Ma", and you're "Fia"

699
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,290
(The Mafias succeeded twice
thanks to the naive Big Nose.)

700
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,790
Is it you?

701
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,150
Here go the first keywords.

702
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,290
(The 1st 2 keywords
will be revealed.)

703
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,590
- Ji Suk Jin versus...
- What?

704
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,090
- Ji Suk Jin?
- That's a weak competitor.

705
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,800
(What could be the other keyword?)

706
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,070
- I'm sure it wasn't searched a lot.
- I agree.

707
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,400
The other keyword is...

708
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,730
(The keyword
against Suk Jin's name is...)

709
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,260
- Yang Se Chan.
- I have a chance to win.

710
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,200
I have a chance to win.

711
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,040
- But you never know.
- Gosh, seriously.

712
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,640
- I might lose.
- Hey.

713
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,350
- You're no match for me.
- He became more popular...

714
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,470
- through "How Do You Play?."
- If I had to compare...

715
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,470
the search volumes to water,
they're trickling.

716
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,590
How dare you?

717
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,710
We compared the search volumes
in the past 12 months.

718
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,390
- In the past 12 months?
- I see.

719
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,090
- Hey.
- He drew attention recently.

720
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,590
Suk Jin may be popular
among those in their 50s and 60s,

721
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,060
but people in those age groups don't
use the internet often.

722
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,990
Teenagers and people in their 20s
would search my name.

723
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,990
But since he became
famous on social media,

724
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,540
they've looked up on him a lot.

725
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,200
Let's start by sharing
our own experiences...

726
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,140
- before discussing further.
- Okay.

727
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,700
The data
based on our own experiences...

728
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,350
can be realistic.

729
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,240
Did you search
Suk Jin's name recently?

730
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,550
- Never.
- Me neither.

731
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,620
What about you?

732
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,710
(They don't remember doing it.)

733
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,180
- Did you search his name recently?
- As for me...

734
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,980
I have never done it in my life,
not just recently.

735
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,290
- Not even once.
- Hey.

736
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,650
- That's sad. It's so hurtful.
- I've never searched yours either.

737
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,800
- Although he's my close friend,
- Have you searched your own names?

738
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,150
I never search his name
on the internet.

739
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,600
Me neither. Do you think I search
yours on the internet?

740
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,660
I searched Jong Kook's name
once a day several times.

741
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,260
- Why?
- Because of his YouTube channel.

742
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,640
- To check his subscribers?
- Exactly.

743
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,870
- I check that very often.
- I see.

744
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,280
The fact that I'm competing
against Se Chan itself...

745
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,780
- hurts my pride.
- I've searched Se Chan's name.

746
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,080
- I don't want to lose.
- Right? Your pride is on the line.

747
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,080
- I don't want to lose to him.
- It's because...

748
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,970
Suk Jin is famous but not popular.

749
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,440
He's that kind of celebrity.

750
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,050
Why? It's true.

751
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,180
- You know that.
- I see what you mean.

752
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,890
- That's comforting.
- You know, right?

753
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,890
- You know what I mean, right?
- You see...

754
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,890
I think we're neck and neck.

755
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,100
- The period makes it even harder.
- That's right.

756
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,690
- Although it was another show,
- Exactly.

757
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,100
- he became very popular.
- It made him much more popular.

758
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,990
- Since it's a year...
- If it's based on the past year,

759
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,460
his appearance on that show must've
had a great influence.

760
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,200
I can beat you without that.

761
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,970
- Without that...
- You'd be at the bottom without it.

762
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,650
- You wouldn't have a chance.
- Why is he acting so arrogant?

763
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,670
I can beat you.

764
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,440
Come on. You can't beat me.

765
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,390
Hey, how many followers do you have
on social media?

766
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,090
I have a little more than 700,000...
Not so many.

767
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,180
- Did you say 70?
- What? No.

768
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,890
- Don't be ridiculous.
- If he has 70 followers...

769
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,360
The staff members of this show alone
are more than 100.

770
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,600
Don't think that they all followed
your account.

771
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,100
All of you, follow my account
if you haven't yet.

772
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,800
- It's not too late.
- Seventy sounds just right.

773
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,100
- It's perfect.
- That's a good point, but...

774
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,460
- I have 2.3 million...
- You have 230 followers?

775
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,600
No, I have 2.3 million followers.

776
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,760
It's time to make a choice.

777
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,840
He's been popular lately.

778
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,700
- Also...
- Whatever the reason was...

779
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,170
Also, he became more popular
because he cried on TV.

780
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,550
(He gained popularity by crying.)

781
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,670
- That's true.
- He cried on TV shows.

782
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,010
Anyone would've felt bad.

783
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,280
- Using tears is...
- But that's...

784
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,440
- Using tears is...
- It's called "using sympathy."

785
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,320
- Oh, I see.
- Tonight

786
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,910
(Tonight, you and me alone together)

787
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,830
- Let's have a party
- Let's have a party

788
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,390
(Tonight, you and me alone together,
let's have a party)

789
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,190
(He started singing
inspired by the expression.)

790
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,250
- Do it one more time.
- Wait. Why did you sing?

791
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,260
(Wait. Why did you sing?)

792
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,100
- It sounds similar to "party."
- Oh, my.

793
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,900
- You got caught.
- You're "Ma," and you're "Fi"

794
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,110
It sounds similar to "party."

795
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,780
- He did the same thing earlier.
- You got caught.

796
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,640
(He did the same thing earlier.)

797
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,350
(Se Chan started to suspect
Mafia Song that he improvised.)

798
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,170
- He sang this.
- What was that?

799
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,050
- So Min sang with him, right?
- Yes.

800
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,410
- I just sang along.
- Actually...

801
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,890
- Before you guys came,
- Singing DJ DOC's song?

802
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,550
Suk Jin sang the song.

803
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,790
- Is that the hidden mission?
- He sang it.

804
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,290
You're so smart as always.

805
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,680
- Did he say "scary?"
- It sounded like "scary."

806
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,530
- "Scary?"
- I'm not scary.

807
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,650
- "Scary?"
- I just took a guess.

808
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,600
She is my only target.

809
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,660
- Right. I know.
- I don't worry about you.

810
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,070
- I agree with you guys.
- Just say you're sorry.

811
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,400
- Catching her will solve all.
- Absolutely.

812
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,730
She'll tell us the other one.

813
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,700
You know how the police catch
one drug dealer...

814
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,140
- and arrest so many others too.
- Jong Kook.

815
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,650
- Why would you...
- Look at So Min. She got rash...

816
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,080
- on her chin because of stress.
- If you're not...

817
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,170
- the Mafia, it'd be a good thing.
- I'm not the Mafia.

818
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,890
- It'd be a good thing.
- I wonder why he always picks me.

819
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,410
- That's not true.
- I'm "Ma"

820
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:54,920
(Jae Suk started singing the song
that guarantees success.)

821
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,190
- No, you're "Ma," and you're "Fia"
- There are two Mafias here.

822
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:00,870
There are only two of them.
Stop confusing me by singing that.

823
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,190
(Moving back and forth)

824
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,600
Why am I stuck between them? Gosh.

825
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,540
- The age group is important too.
- True.

826
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,080
Haha, you should pick my name.
Aren't you a young man?

827
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,670
Se Chan is more popular than him.

828
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,880
- Exactly. He's popular and famous.
- Suk Jin has been...

829
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,150
- working in this industry...
- He's famous too.

830
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,080
- for a long time, you know.
- He's more popular than me?

831
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,350
- Hey, you punk.
- Like I said before,

832
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,240
- he's not popular, and Se Chan is.
- They're so serious.

833
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,150
- Even when I'm wearing a mask...
- But Se Chan isn't so famous.

834
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,480
(Composed by Yoo Jae Suk,
Which one is more popular?)

835
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,590
(It's me)

836
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,980
(I don't know, it's definitely me)

837
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,220
Check if his mic is turned on,
Sound Director.

838
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,600
- But I think
- Why does he keep singing?

839
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,990
(But I think that Se Chan is)

840
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:36,260
(This much more popular
than Suk Jin)

841
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:40,070
(Nonsense, that's ridiculous)

842
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,810
(I am more popular than him,
do you know why?)

843
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,430
(I am more popular than you,
I can assure you)

844
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,170
- I'm more popular than he is
- Just make a choice already.

845
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,900
- You're C-class, I'm A-class
- Do you know...

846
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,350
he didn't say why?

847
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,170
Why didn't you write the lyrics
after "Do you know why?"

848
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,350
Why didn't he write the reason?

849
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,390
(It's because he's bad
at improvising)

850
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:00,290
(Chorus Se Chan,
Quit being a comedian)

851
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:03,360
(Chorus Haha,
Where did all my ideas go?)

852
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,830
(Help me find my ideas
that left my head)

853
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,190
(The reward is 200 dollars)

854
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,800
- Just quit
- That's too little

855
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,110
(The veteran comedian is
still excited.)

856
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,900
(Thanks to Big Nose, the Mafias
completed the hidden mission.)

857
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,500
Should I choose Suk Jin's name?

858
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,780
You should make your choices now.
We don't have much time.

859
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,970
- I choose my name.
- Ji Hyo.

860
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,880
I choose Suk Jin.

861
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,440
- I choose Suk Jin.
- I came to the same conclusion.

862
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,050
- I think it's his name.
- I choose Suk Jin too.

863
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,910
- I choose Se Chan.
- Hey!

864
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,090
- I'm the only one who chose him.
- It's because...

865
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,790
We both have a protruding mouth.

866
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,360
- I wonder who wins? I'm so curious.
- I'm curious too.

867
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,450
Can we really check that?

868
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,720
- It's fascinating.
- Do they really have such data?

869
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,150
I'll type Suk Jin's name first.

870
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,220
This is the result.

871
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,920
Now, I'm going to type
Se Chan's name.

872
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,570
- We'll see red spots on the map.
- Right.

873
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,300
If there are more red spots,
does it mean I win?

874
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,640
- Let's find out.
- Here we go.

875
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,810
(The star with 2.3 million followers
who gained fame with tears)

876
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,170
(Yang Ssaebssaeb who is popular
among young people)

877
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,780
- It was early August, right?
- Three, two...

878
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,470
When he was on the show
as MSG Wannabe...

879
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,510
Oh, my. Suk Jin wins.

880
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,740
That's amazing.
It's an absolute victory.

881
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,450
Hey, you can't... But you won
in Gyeonggi Province.

882
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,600
In Incheon...

883
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,810
(Suk Jin wins.)

884
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,640
(The winning keyword is
"Ji Suk Jin.")

885
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,720
In Incheon, Daejeon,

886
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,850
North Chungcheong Province,
and Busan, Se Chan won.

887
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:23,850
- Really?
- Yes.

888
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,030
- Se Chan must be sad.
- Thank you.

889
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,090
I knew it.

890
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,120
- You see...
- I lost to Suk Jin.

891
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,500
- That was the whole point.
- Right.

892
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,560
It is what it is.

893
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,590
Here go the second keywords.

894
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,270
"Jeon So Min" versus "Haha."

895
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,900
Obviously, So Min wins.

896
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,060
- No way. I think...
- Haha wins.

897
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,330
- that Haha wins.
- I don't think so.

898
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,210
It's because Haha has been doing
so many unnecessary things.

899
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,370
- Haha...
- Yes.

900
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,810
really does
a lot of unnecessary things.

901
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,520
- Haha...
- He's seen at a lot of places.

902
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,550
There's a rumor
that he does anything...

903
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,490
- for chump change.
- That's right.

904
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,580
- Everyone in the industry knows.
- True.

905
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,350
- Just a little...
- That's true.

906
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:57,320
I'd do anything for money,
but not for chump change.

907
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,000
- That's true.
- I have pride.

908
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,390
- He does almost everything.
- True.

909
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,420
- Not for chump change, you punk.
- Really?

910
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,030
I'd do anything for money.

911
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,390
Listen up, everyone.

912
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,900
- I'd take any jobs for money.
- Hey.

913
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,310
But I won't do it for chump change.

914
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,630
- Listen.
- It was unexpected.

915
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,210
Unlike your expectation,
Suk Jin would...

916
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,040
sign a contract
only if you offer a lot of money.

917
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,600
- Not chump change.
- That's why...

918
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,070
he's been stacking
a bad reputation in the industry.

919
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,280
- I cost more than you think.
- Right.

920
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,580
A lot more than you think.

921
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,380
This time around, I choose me.

922
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,110
I'll take the other route
and choose Haha.

923
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,260
I choose Haha too.

924
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,310
- I choose So Min.
- Ji Hyo.

925
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,460
- You're choosing So Min?
- Why?

926
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,650
Because...

927
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,620
- she's someone who...
- She stands out.

928
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,300
She's an eccentric character,

929
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,030
so people would look her up
out of curiosity.

930
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,200
- I'm not that well-known.
- Have you looked her up?

931
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,390
- No.
- They could have...

932
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,630
since they don't know her.

933
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,040
- They don't know me well.
- That's how it could be.

934
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,830
This is nerve-wracking in a way.

935
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,210
(Whose name
was searched more online?)

936
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,740
- It's obvious.
- Haha.

937
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,010
Who's in the lead? Haha or So Min?

938
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,140
- Haha has more votes.
- Then I choose So Min.

939
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,250
- I'm taking an aggressive approach.
- You're on the offence.

940
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,410
You've made your choices.

941
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,640
- It has to be Haha.
- I bet it's So Min.

942
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,020
Then I should've chosen Haha.

943
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,350
- It's So Min.
- It's So Min.

944
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,150
- The red...
- There's a huge spike.

945
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,190
- It's So Min.
- Gosh.

946
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,230
Look, So Min won.

947
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,650
(Haha, Jeon So Min)

948
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,300
(So Min wins.)

949
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,500
- You should be grateful...
- Gangwon Province.

950
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,700
- to those in Gangwon Province.
- And Gwangju.

951
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,740
What's that small region?

952
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,310
- Gwangju.
- Gwangju?

953
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,060
Gwangju, I love you!

954
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,630
Gangwon Province, I love you!

955
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,880
- Doesn't it feel great?
- It does.

956
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,670
- Both times...
- It feels great.

957
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,420
South Jeolla Province...

958
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,820
and Seoul!

959
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,940
(So Min is clearly ahead
in three regions.)

960
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,610
- Goodness.
- In South Jeolla Province.

961
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,520
- South Jeolla Province and Seoul.
- Jeolla Province.

962
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,880
- Of course.
- She filmed something there.

963
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,520
- You're right.
- Thank you, people of Wando.

964
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,860
She clearly took the lead
in North Gyeongsang Province...

965
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,400
- with 74 percent.
- I got it, all right?

966
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,730
- Hey.
- It's 74 to 26.

967
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,500
- That's enough.
- It serves you right...

968
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,690
- for teasing me.
- I get it.

969
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,540
- So much for teasing me.
- You sure aren't popular...

970
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,090
for someone who mimics
the dialect a lot.

971
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,210
I'm upset, you know.

972
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,040
That's exactly why
they don't like you.

973
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,670
- Gyeongsang Province!
- That's why they hate you.

974
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,270
Gyeongsang Province,
are you kidding me?

975
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,210
- That's why they hate you.
- They hate that tone.

976
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,570
Could we do one with Haha and me?

977
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,210
Yes, we can set it up.

978
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,520
- Me and Haha.
- Se Chan and Haha.

979
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,820
- Haha and Se Chan?
- Me and Haha.

980
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,940
You've got to be kidding me.

981
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,420
- His numbers were pretty low.
- Right?

982
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,320
It's why I challenged him.

983
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,630
His numbers were really low.

984
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:14,230
He lost to So Min 74 to 26.

985
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,290
Should we scrap the idea?
Would it only hurt your pride?

986
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,590
Let's do it.

987
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,090
Let's do this. I choose me.

988
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,840
- I choose Haha.
- It was close.

989
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,940
(A special match between
Haha and Se Chan)

990
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,070
- I choose Haha.
- Haha?

991
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,340
- I choose Haha too.
- Me too.

992
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,130
I choose Haha as well.

993
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,840
(I choose Haha as well.)

994
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,770
(He's the only one
who chose Se Chan.)

995
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:32,920
Let's see.

996
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,110
Did everyone choose Haha?

997
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,290
If everyone else chose Haha,
I'll switch to Se Chan.

998
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,710
Thank you.

999
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,210
The way I see it,

1000
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,750
it could be a strategic choice.

1001
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,320
Why are his numbers higher?

1002
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,460
(Whose name was searched more?)

1003
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,980
- There you go.
- Se Chan...

1004
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,060
- See?
- Haha won.

1005
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,000
Isn't it enough to make you crawl?

1006
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,590
- See?
- Haha won.

1007
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,420
Isn't it enough to make you crawl?

1008
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,790
(Isn't it enough to make you crawl?)

1009
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:54,860
(Grunting)

1010
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,630
It must feel great to be popular.

1011
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,270
Being popular...

1012
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,040
Lucky you!

1013
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,400
I didn't expect such a landslide.

1014
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,750
- Hold on a second.
- I must still be popular.

1015
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,770
- Nicely done.
- Haha,

1016
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,440
Suk Jin must be way below you too.

1017
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
- Right.
- Let me challenge Suk Jin.

1018
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,880
No, don't.

1019
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,290
Let's take a look.

1020
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,090
- It won't even be close.
- I can beat Suk Jin.

1021
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,380
- Go ahead then.
- What do you say?

1022
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,860
- Let's do it.
- I choose me.

1023
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,060
- I choose Haha.
- I choose me.

1024
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,920
- Haha.
- I choose Haha too.

1025
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,090
Haha, of course.

1026
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,230
- I'll bet my entire savings.
- I choose Haha.

1027
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,000
The result won't be the same.

1028
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,810
(The two winners go head to head.)

1029
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,040
Look.

1030
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,480
Crawl. Grovel at his feet!

1031
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:41,570
(The whole nation is blue.)

1032
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:44,040
Crawl. Grovel at his feet!

1033
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,250
I didn't expect
the difference to be this big.

1034
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,750
- Darn it.
- Gosh.

1035
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,790
I still have it.

1036
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,230
You're still very well-known.

1037
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,290
You're the best.

1038
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,090
At least two are
less popular than I am.

1039
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,790
Why do you find me so charming?

1040
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,270
You're not as charming...

1041
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,940
as So Min.

1042
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,000
- But Se Chan and Suk Jin...
- You're more charming than them.

1043
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,170
- That's your charm.
- You're right.

1044
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,440
- Nice.
- It's right.

1045
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,670
I'd like to see...

1046
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,310
Suk Jin versus mint chocolate.

1047
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,540
Mint chocolate?

1048
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,520
How about Jae Suk and Pengsoo?

1049
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,570
Why does he keep mentioning
mint chocolate?

1050
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,420
- Jae Suk and Pengsoo?
- No, mint chocolate.

1051
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,480
Look.

1052
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,650
No, mint chocolate. Look.

1053
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,380
- Mint chocolate.
- Mint chocolate won.

1054
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,460
(Mint chocolate wins
by a large margin.)

1055
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,590
Mint chocolate won.

1056
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,860
- Mint chocolate won?
- Mint chocolate won.

1057
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,900
Mint chocolate won.

1058
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,090
Gosh, mint chocolate won.

1059
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,520
But no one can...

1060
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,400
- beat mint chocolate.
- I love mint chocolate.

1061
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,460
We were only curious.

1062
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,000
How can one beat it?

1063
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,400
- I love mint chocolate.
- Jae Suk and mint chocolate.

1064
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,540
(Jae Suk vs mint chocolate)

1065
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,570
It's absolutely beatable.

1066
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,750
- Mint chocolate got crushed.
- It's absolutely beatable.

1067
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,920
- I won against mint chocolate.
- It's absolutely beatable.

1068
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,540
Let's see Jae Suk and Pengsoo.

1069
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,090
Even Pengsoo...

1070
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,420
- Nice!
- Even Pengsoo...

1071
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,460
- Maybe last year, but...
- What about Bboongbboong?

1072
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,860
Let's try Suk Jin and water bottle.

1073
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,750
- He'd definitely beat that.
- Water bottle.

1074
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,820
Water bottle?

1075
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,230
(Suk Jin's last shred of dignity
is on the line.)

1076
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,670
Water bottle won.

1077
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,340
Water bottle won?

1078
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,730
(Water bottle is more popular
than Suk Jin.)

1079
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,040
Suk Jin, do better, will you?

1080
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,810
What about Suk Jin and a pebble?

1081
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,380
(Suk Jin vs Pebble)

1082
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,210
- I'm only joking.
- See?

1083
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,980
He lost to water bottles...

1084
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,520
and then to pebbles.

1085
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,820
Let's see Haha and water bottle.

1086
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,190
Haha and water bottle.

1087
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,790
- Please let me win.
- I hope Haha wins.

1088
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,960
Of course he'll win.

1089
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,360
- Please.
- Haha will win.

1090
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,320
You can tell by the numbers.

1091
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,000
- He won.
- Haha won.

1092
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,590
(Groaning)

1093
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,270
You could tell by the numbers alone.

1094
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,190
How can a water bottle
be more popular than you?

1095
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,690
How is that possible?

1096
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,110
Watch.

1097
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,500
Call it "sir."

1098
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,540
Suk Jin, address it as "sir."

1099
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,810
How can this be?

1100
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,210
Always grab one
with two hands from now on.

1101
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,770
- Water bottles...
- My gosh.

1102
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,480
How can this be?

1103
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,670
(The battle only left
Suk Jin in scars.)

1104
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,380
What a nice way to wrap up a game.

1105
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,590
Right now,

1106
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,320
two are tied for first place.

1107
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,480
Haha and So Min.

1108
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,880
(Tied in 1st place
are Haha and So Min.)

1109
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,380
I guess a lot correctly though.

1110
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,690
- Okay.
- Next,

1111
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,290
in third place is Ji Hyo.

1112
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,150
(3rd place: Ji Hyo)

1113
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,320
And in fourth place is Jong Kook.

1114
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,770
Se Chan and Jae Suk
will receive 100 dollars each.

1115
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,940
Suk Jin receives nothing.

1116
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,900
- Suk Jin receives nothing?
- That's right.

1117
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,340
Seok Sam is at zero dollars

1118
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,400
I kept choosing wrong.

1119
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,480
- You're the smartest investor
- Seok Sam is at zero dollars

1120
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,210
It's fine. The game's not over yet.

1121
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,540
- The Mafia's secret mission...
- They completed it, didn't they?

1122
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,210
- Yes, they completed it.
- Both of them?

1123
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,040
- See? It's not me.
- Mint chocolate, the singing...

1124
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,420
- Mint chocolate, the singing...
- Near the end...

1125
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,820
It's you.

1126
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,520
You suddenly started singing.

1127
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,190
Once we get So Min,

1128
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,090
- we'll find out the rest.
- You suddenly started singing.

1129
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,590
We can kill two birds
with one stone.

1130
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,590
- With one stone.
- It really isn't me.

1131
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,900
(Will the citizens be able
to catch the Mafia?)

1132
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,500
- Is it really not you?
- No.

1133
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,500
Got it.

1134
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,040
The two I suspect? It's...

1135
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,210
So Min and Jae Suk.

1136
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,170
I still suspect Jae Suk.

1137
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,540
He mentioned mint chocolate again.

1138
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,880
Also, I trust Jong Kook's hunch.

1139
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,210
I choose So Min.

1140
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,420
- So Min and...
- Jae Suk.

1141
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,920
- Jeon So Min.
- And Jae Suk.

1142
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,960
I'm sure of it.

1143
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,060
(The suspects: So Min and Jae Suk)

1144
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,190
The vote has been tallied.

1145
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,090
You have been suspect as the Mafia.

1146
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,630
(Will they be able to protect
each other by remaining silent?)

1147
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,130
Let them question me already.

1148
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,500
I'm one of the people they suspect.

1149
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,940
Hey, Jong Kook.

1150
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,340
- Jae Suk and So Min.
- That's what I wrote.

1151
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,810
Yes, those two.

1152
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,540
Only this seems right.

1153
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,810
You all wrote Jae Suk
and So Min, right?

1154
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,440
- Of course.
- So Min will snitch on him.

1155
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,820
Jong Kook should
take care of So Min.

1156
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,420
I'll get her to snitch.

1157
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,020
I know I can get her to talk.

1158
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,090
Come on in.

1159
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,960
- So Min, you must be exhausted.
- Of course.

1160
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,690
That's right. I'm the Mafia.

1161
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,230
- Yes, we know.
- I'm the Mafia,

1162
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,400
- so have a seat.
- Get talking.

1163
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,460
Have a seat.

1164
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,090
- You sure gave up fast.
- Sit down already.

1165
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,630
The thought of being grilled
must've eaten you up inside.

1166
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,810
Whose name did you write down?

1167
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,570
- Apart from me.
- Jae Suk, of course.

1168
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,810
- You too, Ji Hyo?
- Of course.

1169
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,210
- It's the same for all of us.
- You too?

1170
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,810
We all wrote down you and Jae Suk.

1171
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,810
We already knew you were the Mafia.

1172
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,710
That's why Se Chan
had to remain silent.

1173
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,210
You were obviously the Mafia.

1174
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,840
And now, Jae Suk will rat you out.

1175
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,250
Does he know I'm a suspect too?

1176
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,560
- Of course.
- Of course.

1177
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,290
Is Jae Suk a suspect?

1178
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,790
- Of course.
- Or is it another Mafia?

1179
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,130
It's Jae Suk.

1180
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,290
- You're out of options.
- Just snitch on him.

1181
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,670
You can remain silent,

1182
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,770
- but that will only hurt you.
- If both remain silent,

1183
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,860
nothing will change.

1184
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,630
- Gosh.
- If you snitch,

1185
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,730
- you can at least get 100 dollars.
- Go ahead.

1186
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,710
If you choose to remain silent,
but he talks,

1187
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,670
you'll lose 1,000 dollars.

1188
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,770
So this is why it's asked.

1189
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,980
I bet the situation is upsetting.

1190
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,540
- It's your second time here.
- You know that...

1191
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,170
So Min will talk for sure.

1192
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,440
(Suk Jin and Se Chan
use tiger moth as leverage.)

1193
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,710
No, I don't know that.

1194
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,980
The Yoo Family of Gangneung.

1195
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,110
Just end it right here.

1196
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,480
Wait, are you a comedian?

1197
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,290
(He suddenly kicks off
a B-grade comedy sketch.)

1198
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,730
This isn't a police station.

1199
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,630
I've been wanting to do that.

1200
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,090
- Right.
- Jae Suk.

1201
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,500
- Yes, I'm a comedian.
- I see.

1202
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,590
- You like being cheeky.
- That's right.

1203
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,090
No wonder
he kept teasing others by singing.

1204
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,670
- I love being cheeky.
- Right.

1205
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,210
This is hilarious.

1206
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,440
- I do.
- I love it.

1207
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,270
(Detective Airhead
loves his character.)

1208
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,000
Just snitch and be over with it.

1209
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,570
Well, you see...

1210
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,110
You'll know that she'll talk.

1211
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,790
- I...
- So Min will snitch.

1212
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,920
- I can't do it for free.
- Then?

1213
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,480
Pay 100 dollars each
and offer me 200 dollars.

1214
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,020
(The snitch suddenly asks
for a deal.)

1215
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,150
Our money?

1216
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,570
- Forget it.
- You're bold, aren't you?

1217
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,090
- Look here.
- You love being cheeky.

1218
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,730
- I don't have any money.
- Same here.

1219
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,900
So you won't pay me?

1220
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,090
Then don't talk.

1221
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,630
- Just think about it.
- But know that So Min will.

1222
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,730
So Min will talk.

1223
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,310
Detective Jong Kook
went to handle her,

1224
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,900
and he's determined
to get an answer out of her.

1225
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,670
I'd like to hear
why you think I'm the Mafia.

1226
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,610
- We're not going to tell you.
- Because I did nothing suspicious.

1227
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,940
I won't say.

1228
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,750
- I won't tell you.
- Why not?

1229
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,210
- I won't tell you why?
- Why not?

1230
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:56,190
Why must there be a reason
when you're the Mafia?

1231
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,380
Why though?

1232
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,650
- It means nothing.
- Why?

1233
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,500
She gave up at first,

1234
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,230
but now she's trying another route.

1235
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,290
She thinks...

1236
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,400
- she can get out of this.
- That's not it.

1237
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,130
- I don't have any hope.
- Don't be hopeful.

1238
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,040
- I'm not hopeful.
- Just know,

1239
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,460
that we've made up our minds
about you being the Mafia.

1240
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,130
We're here to only
hear you snitch on Jae Suk.

1241
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,840
There's nothing else to talk about.

1242
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,440
The best option for you
is to confess...

1243
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,670
and for him to remain silent.

1244
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,380
- Then you'll make more money.
- You should stick with that option.

1245
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,650
If you choose to remain silent
and he confesses,

1246
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,020
- you'll have to pay a lot.
- That's right.

1247
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,110
The safest option
is the intersection.

1248
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,190
I can't confess for free.

1249
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,690
Then what?
What do you want us to do?

1250
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,650
The 3 of you
should pay me 100 dollars.

1251
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,790
- You want 100 dollars?
- Hey.

1252
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,630
Why would you want us
to give you 100 dollars?

1253
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,170
But you're at a disadvantage.

1254
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:45,040
Since he knows that you're
a suspect, he'll confess for sure.

1255
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,480
- I'm sure he will.
- Forget it.

1256
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,570
- He'll confess for sure.
- Let's just go. Just let her be.

1257
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:50,610
Let's go. Get up.

1258
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:51,810
Get up, guys.

1259
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:53,070
- Hold on.
- Get up.

1260
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,520
Jong Kook. We should talk...

1261
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,210
- since you're here already.
- But you said you won't confess.

1262
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,340
- But...
- You said you won't confess.

1263
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,040
Are you going to confess or not?
No, right? Let's leave.

1264
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,610
- If you say you will, we'll help.
- We gave you a chance.

1265
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,130
- I'll confess. I really will.
- You will?

1266
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,520
(So Min ends up promising to confess
due to the pressure.)

1267
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,250
- I will confess,
- Okay, good.

1268
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,270
but I need someone on my side.

1269
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,320
- We'll be on your side.
- We're on your side.

1270
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,670
Then you should defend me.

1271
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:13,790
- How?
- How do you want us to defend you?

1272
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,900
Well, you need to protect me.

1273
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,400
So this means...

1274
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,610
if she decides to remain silent,
she'll lose 1,000 dollars.

1275
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:23,440
- So give me 50 dollars each.
- The tiger moth is about to...

1276
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,540
- We have nothing to spare.
- How much do I have?

1277
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,420
You have nothing.

1278
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:29,520
(The senior detective is penniless.)

1279
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,420
- Why are the have-nots here?
- We don't have any money.

1280
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,250
- Se Chan has 100 dollars.
- And you want 50 dollars from me?

1281
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,480
- You...
- That's ridiculous.

1282
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,590
- You should give him 100 dollars.
- No, I can't do that.

1283
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,060
You're going to
win the prize money anyway.

1284
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,920
- This puts me in a pickle.
- I guess we've been too nice.

1285
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,500
- What should we do?
- What will you do?

1286
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,570
Are you going to get beaten again?

1287
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:49,570
(Moving slowly to punish him)

1288
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:50,710
- Are you serious?
- Hey.

1289
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:52,110
- What are you doing?
- Relax your arm.

1290
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,170
Why are you...

1291
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,000
Why are you twisting my arm?

1292
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,810
He's horrible at doing
improvisation.

1293
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,610
- Relax your arm.
- I mean...

1294
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,380
Why would you twist my arm?

1295
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,820
- Suk Jin.
- It's so upsetting that I couldn't.

1296
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,290
You're not even a real detective.
Why would you twist my arm?

1297
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:06,710
Just give me 50 dollars each.

1298
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:08,320
- Make it 100 dollars.
- I told you. I have no money.

1299
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,420
Are you going to confess?

1300
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,650
(The moment of choice
is drawing near.)

1301
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,250
- So Min, if you don't confess...
- For me...

1302
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,250
- You don't have to confess.
- You can remain silent.

1303
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,250
You'll take the fall.

1304
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,320
It doesn't matter to us.

1305
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,570
- If Jae Suk doesn't confess,
- Hey.

1306
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:21,190
- Stop it. Leave her be.
- then I'll sell my house next week.

1307
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,840
- Let her make her own decision.
- Make your choice now.

1308
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,840
Why would you tell her that?

1309
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,340
I just wanted to help her.

1310
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,570
Stop it.

1311
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,110
- I guess I care about you a lot.
- Let her make her own decision.

1312
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,900
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

1313
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,400
- Don't tell her.
- They're infuriating.

1314
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,750
- I just wanted to help her.
- They're infuriating.

1315
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,110
I'm telling the truth.

1316
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:36,880
- Stop it.
- I'll confess.

1317
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,190
(I'll confess.)

1318
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:40,020
(She surrenders completely
and repeatedly says she'll confess.)

1319
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,110
- I'll confess.
- You'll confess everything?

1320
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,130
- Will you confess everything?
- I'll tell you everything I know.

1321
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,090
I'll tell you
all the necessary information.

1322
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,790
I wanted to remain silent because
I was infuriated by Jong Kook,

1323
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:56,340
but I chose to confess
because of you.

1324
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,540
(Jong Kook's aggressive strategy
made her confess in the end.)

1325
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,630
- You're seriously...
- Get up.

1326
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,860
Are you not going to confess?
Let's get up.

1327
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,130
(Jong Kook's aggressive strategy
made her confess in the end.)

1328
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,000
I'll confess everything.

1329
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:09,440
- Gather your power and confess up!
- Gather your power and confess up!

1330
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,790
I'll confess everything.

1331
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,690
Just tell me
who is in the other room.

1332
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,250
- Jae Suk...
- Let's see.

1333
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,820
I'm sure he's going to confess too.

1334
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,980
(The only choice remaining
is Jae Suk's.)

1335
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,060
If you give me 100 dollars,

1336
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,500
- I'll confess.
- Give him 100 dollars.

1337
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,670
You're going to get 200 dollars.

1338
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:24,690
- That's right.
- For you,

1339
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,230
you'll be getting
an extra 150 dollars.

1340
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,500
- Are we getting 200 dollars?
- Yes, you are.

1341
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,570
You see?

1342
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:29,590
Then I'll accept it.

1343
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,230
I'm going to take it back
if you don't confess.

1344
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,810
- Okay.
- Let's give him 50 dollars each.

1345
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:33,810
- We'll give him 50 dollars each.
- All right.

1346
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:35,770
- Good.
- Who is the Mafia?

1347
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,150
It's So Min.

1348
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:39,150
- You're the Mafia too, right?
- Yes, I am.

1349
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:41,320
Jae Suk.

1350
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,150
- Jae Suk...
- I'm sure he confessed.

1351
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,750
confessed that So Min is the Mafia.

1352
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,710
(Jae Suk confessed.)

1353
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,480
- He didn't remain silent?
- I knew he'd confess.

1354
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,480
- He didn't remain silent?
- He would never.

1355
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,750
- Why would he not remain silent?
- He'd never remain silent.

1356
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:52,060
- Why would he?
- Of course he wouldn't.

1357
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,820
The Mafias who can't trust
each other and confess...

1358
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,420
- will lose 500 dollars each.
- I get it now.

1359
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,860
It's fair that you two
lost the money together.

1360
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,730
The citizens get 200 dollars each
for arresting the Mafias.

1361
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:02,170
(The detectives get 200 dollars each
for arresting the Mafias.)

1362
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,900
- Let's go have dinner.
- Thank you.

1363
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,630
We should go eat now.

1364
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,400
There's no need to even think.

1365
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,230
I'm sure she confessed.

1366
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,570
It's a given. I'm sure she did.

1367
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,710
- It's time for lunch.
- Okay.

1368
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:15,040
The Mafias have hidden missions
during lunch.

1369
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,440
When you return to your room,

1370
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,820
- we'll choose new Mafias.
- Of course.

1371
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,020
- Are you picking them randomly?
- Yes.

1372
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,190
We'll give them new missions.

1373
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,130
- Then we'll have lunch.
- Got it.

1374
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:26,420
He can become
the Mafia again, right?

1375
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,690
- That's possible.
- I could.

1376
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,130
- He can become one again.
- But that'll be difficult.

1377
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:30,690
- It's difficult to become one.
- It's difficult.

1378
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:35,940
(They're done selecting new Mafias.)

1379
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,840
(Who are the Mafias that received
the new hidden mission?)

1380
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,500
(A special place
for Running Mafias...)

1381
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,500
(who are easily moved
by chicken feed)

1382
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,650
This is insane.

1383
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:49,020
- This place is so nice.
- Look how fancy it is.

1384
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,320
It's so nice here.

1385
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,610
"Presidential"...

1386
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,020
It's really nice.

1387
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:54,520
- This is incredible.
- This is good.

1388
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,880
(And various dishes
placed in the middle of the room)

1389
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,090
Suk Jin always orders lamb
for room service.

1390
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,380
Thank you for the food.

1391
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,420
You can freely move around the room
as you eat.

1392
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,900
The Mafias are carrying out
the hidden mission.

1393
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,900
Did you pick the Mafias randomly?

1394
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,090
We picked them randomly
from the box we brought.

1395
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,540
Then can the ones who already
played Mafia be picked again?

1396
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,540
Where is the lamb?

1397
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,900
Suk Jin always orders lamb
whenever he goes abroad.

1398
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,150
- I should go over there, and...
- I love lamb.

1399
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,750
I love it too.

1400
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:23,820
- When we went to Mongolia,
- Mongolia.

1401
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,590
he couldn't eat lamb.

1402
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:27,520
Is the hidden mission to eat
someone else's food?

1403
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,460
Is that the mission?

1404
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,650
Doesn't your table have this?

1405
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:31,980
We don't have this dish.

1406
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,820
- You guys have different dishes?
- Yes, they're different.

1407
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:34,920
Oh, are they?

1408
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,560
- Se Chan, is there water?
- Sorry?

1409
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,520
- Why would you ask him?
- Water?

1410
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,190
So Min, are you at ease now?

1411
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,070
I feel so much better.

1412
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,000
I feel so relieved.

1413
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,500
Earlier, you were
sitting in the corner.

1414
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,770
I'm sure they are
doing their mission right now.

1415
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,440
Come sit here.

1416
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,250
Is that so?
Suk Jin is acting strange.

1417
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,840
- You guys have this too.
- It's just what's in your head.

1418
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,440
- You have this dish too.
- Everyone is acting strange.

1419
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,750
- He's really strange.
- Isn't he acting really strange?

1420
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,590
He's really strange.
What he just said was so awkward.

1421
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,880
- I've been here before.
- Oh, is that so?

1422
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,560
- There must be something here.
- It's so pretty here.

1423
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:06,750
Can I take a look around the room?

1424
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,000
- It's been so long...
- This is good.

1425
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,400
since I ate in a hotel.
It feels like I'm on a trip.

1426
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,420
I know.

1427
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,690
There's abalone too.

1428
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,170
Haha must be the Mafia.

1429
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:20,340
(Detective Kim fixates his radar
on Haha at once.)

1430
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,540
Haha is the new Mafia.

1431
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,310
Me? Fine.

1432
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:24,880
- I'm the Mafia.
- Yes, you are.

1433
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,540
You're acting up a little.

1434
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,340
- That was...
- Haha is the Mafia.

1435
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,820
the first time I opened my mouth.

1436
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:32,440
- Detective Kim is suspecting you.
- Fine.

1437
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,880
- Of course.
- I swear...

1438
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,920
(Detective Kim could be the Mafia.)

1439
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,590
- Detective Kim is really scary.
- I'm sure he'll confess right away.

1440
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:38,880
- What did you say?
- I dropped an apple.

1441
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,880
All right. He'll confess right away.

1442
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,790
Mister, don't move around!

1443
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,020
- I mean...
- Gosh.

1444
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,230
Then move to the other table.

1445
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:46,000
Move.

1446
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,170
You're the spy.

1447
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,960
You're the spy.

1448
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,000
("Spy"?)

1449
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,400
"Spy"?

1450
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,980
- It's "Mafia".
- Not Mafia?

1451
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,570
My goodness. Fine.

1452
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:56,940
- He's the Mafia.
- I mean...

1453
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,070
This is good.

1454
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:00,270
(Laughing)

1455
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:02,340
- Fine.
- Detective Kim is on him.

1456
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,570
(The word "spy"
awoke the sleeping viper.)

1457
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:04,690
I think you're done for.

1458
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:05,690
Okay, fine.

1459
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:07,190
- It's Haha.
- Fine. Let's see who wins.

1460
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,690
- Let's go the full distance.
- "Spy"?

1461
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,960
He said "spy".

1462
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:12,020
My gosh. This is infuriating.

1463
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:17,170
So Min, can you give me
some of yours? That one.

1464
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,630
- This?
- Yes.

1465
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:19,690
It's delicious.

1466
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:22,290
- You keep asking for their food.
- He keeps asking for our food.

1467
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:24,170
- Is your mission to eat their food?
- Can the same person...

1468
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:27,540
What do you mean? I can even go
to that table and eat there.

1469
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,130
Let's switch seats then.

1470
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,170
So Min, can you give me
the new bowl of rice?

1471
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:33,440
- Wait. You take it.
- You're acting strange.

1472
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:35,750
- They keep bringing their food.
- You should take it yourself.

1473
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,420
- Then I'll ask Ji Hyo to move.
- Take it yourself.

1474
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,090
I can't make Ji Hyo get it for me.

1475
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,110
- Thank you, Ji Hyo.
- I'll go get it.

1476
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,820
- You asked Ji Hyo?
- That's not it.

1477
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,920
- I know. That's why...
- He's being really strange.

1478
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,320
You've never asked Ji Hyo
to do anything.

1479
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,020
I was asking So Min.

1480
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,400
Se Chan is acting strange.

1481
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,320
He asked her to bring him
the bowl of rice.

1482
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,940
He was in a hurry too.

1483
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:55,630
Jong Kook is so scary.

1484
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,210
He said you're scary.

1485
00:50:58,210 --> 00:50:59,900
- Okay, fine.
- You...

1486
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,610
- I'm not the Mafia.
- Let's see.

1487
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,170
- His vibe changed a little.
- He seems different, right?

1488
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,380
He's a little elated.

1489
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,440
- When he's given a role...
- He's a little elated.

1490
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,610
The other Mafia must be really glad.

1491
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,380
(The other Mafia
must be really glad.)

1492
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:20,320
(The other Mafia
who is really glad...)

1493
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,560
- We're done choosing new Mafias.
- Okay.

1494
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,520
You're the new Mafia.

1495
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,590
(Suk Jin is the Mafia.)

1496
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:28,900
It's finally here.

1497
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:32,730
The other Mafia is...

1498
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,170
He's good.

1499
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:37,570
Your hidden mission
is to remain seated...

1500
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:39,670
if the other Mafia is standing.

1501
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:44,920
So if both of you are standing
or seated, then you'll fail.

1502
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,650
It's too difficult.

1503
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,110
- It's so difficult.
- If the other one is standing...

1504
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:50,880
(The hidden mission was given
to the Mafias.)

1505
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,290
- You're only eating.
- You're suspicious.

1506
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:54,560
- Then you should put it down too.
- Okay, I will.

1507
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,190
- You can't stop him from eating.
- Exactly. That can't be a mission.

1508
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,070
- I'll eat it.
- Here.

1509
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:00,360
Your mission
isn't to have rice, right?

1510
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,770
Seriously. Can you stop him?
I can eat the rice, can't I?

1511
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:05,540
- No, you can't.
- Then give me 50 dollars.

1512
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:07,070
Come on.

1513
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:13,770
(Right then, Suk Jin sits down.)

1514
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,110
(When Suk Jin sits down,
the other Mafia must stand up.)

1515
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:19,750
Can you pass me the spoon?

1516
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,290
- Sorry?
- The new spoon.

1517
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:23,020
He keeps asking for things.

1518
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,480
This is what I find strange.

1519
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,820
- Right?
- You asked me?

1520
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:29,860
It's not that I keep asking things.
The spoon is over there, that's why.

1521
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,920
He keeps asking for things.
It's really strange.

1522
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,590
- Just give me half.
- He's really strange.

1523
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,170
After the interrogation,
we returned to our rooms, right?

1524
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:37,170
(Detective Kim
is still suspecting Se Chan.)

1525
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,070
He wasn't saying anything
but spacing out.

1526
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:41,440
- He was thinking of what to do.
- He came into my room.

1527
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,880
- He was thinking of what to do.
- The shoot was over too.

1528
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,110
He didn't say anything,

1529
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,340
- The Mafia...
- and he kept watching TV.

1530
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,420
- is next to Jong Kook.
- Then you guys...

1531
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,150
I wouldn't go into your room
if I were the Mafia.

1532
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,590
Think about it.
I would never go into your room.

1533
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:54,690
That's why you came to my room.

1534
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:57,750
It's so strange that he asked
Ji Hyo to get something for him.

1535
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,820
The rice was on the other table,
so I asked So Min,

1536
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,130
but she didn't give it to me.

1537
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:03,150
- So Ji Hyo brought it for me.
- I'll try giving the rice to him.

1538
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:06,130
- What are you doing?
- I'm observing him.

1539
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:07,900
- Are you sure you're observing him?
- Yes.

1540
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,770
- Who are you observing?
- Ji Hyo is just eating.

1541
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,110
Can I take this?

1542
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:12,170
(Can I take this?)

1543
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,770
- Can you bring me some rice?
- No, you can't take it.

1544
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:15,610
(Haha suddenly sits down,
and Suk Jin runs out of ad-libs.)

1545
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,610
He's acting really strange.

1546
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,150
I'm telling you, I'm not the Mafia.

1547
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,020
- I swear I'm not the Mafia.
- Is this mine?

1548
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:22,820
What about Suk Jin?

1549
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:25,150
- I'm not the Mafia.
- I swear I'm not the Mafia.

1550
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:26,710
I'm not the Mafia.

1551
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,320
- It could be Suk Jin.
- You and I are the targets.

1552
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,820
(As Suk Jin sits down,
Haha gets up.)

1553
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,190
(The Mafia's thrilling tiki-taka)

1554
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,480
- It could be Suk Jin.
- You and I are the targets.

1555
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,150
Suk Jin was acting weird
in the beginning.

1556
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,460
- Right?
- I'm serious.

1557
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,290
I'll pay for this if I'm the Mafia.

1558
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:39,960
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1559
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:41,570
- Do you mean it?
- I'm not the Mafia.

1560
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:45,040
But with what Se Chan is making,

1561
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,440
- Of course he can.
- he can pay for this.

1562
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,570
- I'm sure it won't cost much.
- He said I can pay for it...

1563
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,070
with what I'm making.

1564
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,670
He's seriously...

1565
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,650
He never gives me a break.

1566
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:56,040
He's more than capable
to pay for this.

1567
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,040
- Of course he can.
- He can pay for this.

1568
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,690
- He's more than capable.
- Of course.

1569
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:00,820
But I don't think Suk Jin
can manage to pay for it.

1570
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,060
(But I don't think Suk Jin
can manage to pay for it.)

1571
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:05,880
(Even when they're talking
and laughing,)

1572
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,590
(they're secretly carrying out
their hidden mission.)

1573
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:12,020
- With what he's making?
- Suk Jin...

1574
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:14,040
With what Suk Jin is making,

1575
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,690
he won't be able to pay for this.

1576
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:17,960
- It's too much for him?
- No, he can't pay for it.

1577
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:22,170
You brat.

1578
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:23,980
- So Min, you're okay, right?
- Aren't you having the rice?

1579
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,170
Sorry?

1580
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:26,710
What is he doing?

1581
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:28,770
Don't touch my rice!

1582
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:31,250
What's with this rice?
Is there a hidden mission?

1583
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,420
Why isn't he eating it?

1584
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:33,710
Why are you obsessed with rice?

1585
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,420
- Why did you ask for it then?
- Wait a minute.

1586
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,980
(Wait a minute.)

1587
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:41,130
Isn't Suk Jin moving around a lot?

1588
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:43,000
- Yes.
- What?

1589
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,190
He tosses it to you.

1590
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,860
- He rarely moves around.
- Then you toss it back to him.

1591
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:46,960
- Then he gives it back to you.
- It's because you think it's me.

1592
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,230
- Hey!
- You toss it back.

1593
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:49,460
- Then he gives it to you.
- It's because you think it's me.

1594
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:52,170
- I just got goosebumps.
- Why?

1595
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,630
I'm sure Jae Suk is not the Mafia.

1596
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,130
Who is the person that's behaving
in a way that he or she never does?

1597
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,130
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

1598
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:58,570
Suk Jin rarely gets up
from his seat.

1599
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:00,440
- I know.
- Wow.

1600
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,940
(Flustered)

1601
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,190
But he went through the trouble...

1602
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:05,540
- to move around.
- He kept moving around.

1603
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,290
Suk Jin never does anything.
I know him.

1604
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:09,250
When I go somewhere, he'd ask me
to get something for him.

1605
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,590
- "Hey."
- Exactly. He always asks.

1606
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:12,750
He orders everyone around
except for Jong Kook.

1607
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,820
You get what I'm saying? He asks
everyone except for Jong Kook.

1608
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,920
(Glaring)

1609
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,690
- Hey.
- He got you!

1610
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,460
- Hey!
- He got you!

1611
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,070
- Wait a minute.
- Jong Kook!

1612
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,840
- Prosecutor Yoo.
- You make it look like I'm it.

1613
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,070
- You make it look like I'm it.
- Shall I change my target to you?

1614
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:29,270
I swear. It's not me.

1615
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,570
Jong Kook turned his attention
to him.

1616
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:34,270
- Today...
- I'm not the Mafia. Hey, Jae Suk!

1617
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,710
If you keep saying that,
we can't catch the Mafia.

1618
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:38,880
Your face is blushing.

1619
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,980
We can edit this out.

1620
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,420
- I had to...
- It's definitely Haha.

1621
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,790
- I had to move around.
- It's Haha.

1622
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:44,360
If you keep pointing
your finger at me,

1623
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,060
- He suddenly changed his stance.
- then it looks like I'm the Mafia.

1624
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,900
If you keep insisting, you make it
look like I'm the Mafia.

1625
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,730
- Suk Jin.
- I was just walking around...

1626
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:50,790
for the rice.

1627
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:52,460
Then why can't he be the Mafia?

1628
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,070
You see? He's accusing me now.

1629
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,400
That's not what I'm doing.
Fine. Just pick me.

1630
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,670
- Jong Kook.
- Just pick me. Whatever!

1631
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,670
I won't do anything from now.

1632
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:03,270
Just pick me. I'm serious.

1633
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:05,480
- He's acting.
- Make sure to pick me.

1634
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,880
- He gets mad when he's accused.
- Why would you be so upset?

1635
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,940
What are you looking at?

1636
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,980
Move!

1637
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,150
- Hey. Haha.
- Whatever!

1638
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,650
- Haha.
- What?

1639
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:15,790
Are you going to confess or not?

1640
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,960
I will. I'll make sure to confess.

1641
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,420
Why are you venting it on me?

1642
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:22,820
You pick on me for everything I do.

1643
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,190
Why are you doing this to me?

1644
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,070
You should vent it on Jong Kook.

1645
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,170
Please make sure to send me
to Haha's room.

1646
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:29,570
- What's strange...
- This is hilarious.

1647
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:32,440
is that Suk Jin laughed the most
when Haha said he'd confess.

1648
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,170
- Gosh, I laughed too much.
- Fine. Just pick me.

1649
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:37,170
You'll think it's me if you
keep insisting. Don't be fooled.

1650
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:40,150
Why would you think it's me
when Se Chan is being accused?

1651
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,670
- I know.
- It's...

1652
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,570
- Let's pick him.
- I'm sure this time.

1653
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:44,820
- Come here.
- Why?

1654
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,440
Why do you keep staring at me?

1655
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,980
- Because you kept acting strange.
- You must be the Mafia.

1656
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,960
You're the Mafia, and you're looking
for a reason to make everyone...

1657
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,020
think I'm the Mafia.

1658
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,360
- Suk Jin.
- Come on.

1659
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,420
(He burps while reasoning.)

1660
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,770
That's cheating.

1661
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:01,290
How can he burp while talking?
It's gross.

1662
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,440
How can he burp while reasoning?

1663
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:04,900
What was that?

1664
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:08,340
What kind of reasoning is that?

1665
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,610
It's so gross.

1666
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,570
- I can't take this.
- This is...

1667
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:14,420
It's so gross
regardless of the game.

1668
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,150
I've never seen anyone like that
after Myung Soo.

1669
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:17,170
Let me explain.

1670
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:20,290
I could burp because I was relaxed.

1671
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,690
- Because you were relaxed?
- I was really surprised.

1672
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:24,560
No, you couldn't digest
because you were nervous.

1673
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,060
Suk Jin, did you sit at this table
in the beginning?

1674
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:27,060
No, he was at this table.

1675
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:28,590
- I told you.
- So Min, you were here.

1676
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:30,020
- Yes.
- You two should switch seats.

1677
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,790
I told you.

1678
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:33,960
- Come here, So Min.
- Suk Jin is not that type.

1679
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,860
What are you talking about?

1680
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:38,130
I kept moving because of the rice.

1681
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,940
I know Suk Jin the best.

1682
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,310
Suk Jin doesn't move much.

1683
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,040
Are you sure it's not you?

1684
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,270
- What?
- Are you sure it's not you?

1685
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,150
I think it's Haha and Suk Jin.

1686
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,980
One of the people accusing me
must be the Mafia.

1687
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,980
- I think it's Haha and Se Chan.
- Jae Suk...

1688
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,540
is just suspecting me.

1689
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,750
- I think it's Haha and Se Chan.
- Se Chan.

1690
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,460
- You saw how he accused me, right?
- It's really not me.

1691
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,480
Anyone up for Coke?

1692
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,880
Jae Suk is just...

1693
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,460
- Okay, I'll take one.
- Okay.

1694
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,360
I want one too.
I'll just drink until today.

1695
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,730
Gosh, Jong Kook.

1696
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:08,540
He's driving me crazy.

1697
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:09,940
His eyes are on you.

1698
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:12,960
He isn't singling us out
because he wants to act sharp.

1699
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,940
- He's suspecting everyone.
- I know. He's not singling us out.

1700
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:17,130
- This is so good.
- Here's your Coke.

1701
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:19,610
Right. This is how you usually are.

1702
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:22,040
You weren't like yourself
when you asked for the rice.

1703
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,480
That's not who you are.

1704
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,590
- But...
- You're well-mannered.

1705
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:28,250
- Ji Hyo, tell them.
- He couldn't move because of me.

1706
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,150
- That's right.
- I don't know about that.

1707
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,420
I'm sure it's Suk Jin for now.

1708
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,190
- I think it's Suk Jin too.
- You keep...

1709
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:36,790
- The fact that he moved...
- I get where you're coming from.

1710
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:39,400
Jae Suk suspects me for no reason.

1711
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,130
Then who do you think
is the Mafia for certain, Haha?

1712
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:42,230
(Who do you think
is the Mafia for certain, Haha?)

1713
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:43,960
Is there a reason
why you're not the Mafia?

1714
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,230
Look at him.

1715
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,040
- He does things like that.
- You asked me!

1716
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,310
- Look at that punk.
- Wait a minute.

1717
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:52,570
- Just pick me then.
- Wait a minute.

1718
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,570
What is it?

1719
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,070
Why does one get up
when the other sits down?

1720
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:57,070
(Why does one get up
when the other sits down?)

1721
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,540
Then we'll be seated
at the same time.

1722
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:01,380
- We'll be seated at the same time.
- Wait a minute.

1723
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,190
- Why did you get up? What is this?
- Wait a minute.

1724
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,690
Hang on a second.

1725
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:07,320
- What?
- Wait a minute.

1726
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,190
- Is that the jumping dance?
- What?

1727
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:11,460
- Hey!
- The jumping dance.

1728
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,920
- Hey! When one sits...
- Is that the jumping dance?

1729
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,500
Both of you, sit down.

1730
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,860
(Even Detective Viper is shocked.)

1731
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,040
- Is that the jumping dance?
- These guys...

1732
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,460
Wait. That's the jumping dance!

1733
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,980
Hey! You brats!

1734
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,070
(When Suk Jin sits down,
Haha gets up.)

1735
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:25,670
What did I do?

1736
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:27,150
What did I do?

1737
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:28,670
- I got you.
- What do you mean?

1738
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:29,980
- I got you, you punks!
- My gosh!

1739
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,690
This is driving me crazy!

1740
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:32,980
Why do you keep suspecting me?

1741
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,190
(The two Mafias' hidden mission
got revealed in the end.)

1742
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:37,880
What's so strange about this?

1743
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,520
- What's so strange about this?
- Stop it!

1744
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:41,690
- I mean...
- My gosh.

1745
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:43,590
- What's so strange about this?
- I know.

1746
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:44,730
What's so strange about this?

1747
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:46,520
- This is driving me insane.
- Come on.

1748
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,400
- Don't do this to us.
- This was the mission.

1749
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,290
Fine. Then just pick us two.

1750
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:51,400
Just go with us.

1751
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,540
- Just go with us.
- They're the Mafias, right?

1752
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:53,630
I got you!

1753
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,170
Just go with us then.

1754
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:56,170
This is nonsense.

1755
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:57,670
We pick Haha and Suk Jin.

1756
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,540
- Just go with us then.
- This doesn't make any sense.

1757
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:02,710
Gosh, I nearly died laughing.

1758
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:07,090
It was hilarious. I couldn't
stop myself from laughing.

1759
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:09,880
It was so funny when Jae Suk
found out about the hidden mission.

1760
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,960
(He finds it absurd.)

1761
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,290
How did he find out?

1762
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:17,360
You've successfully completed
the hidden mission.

1763
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:19,400
Hey, Haha. I was about to call you.

1764
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,670
Hey, Suk Jin.

1765
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:23,170
- We should remain silent.
- We should.

1766
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:24,810
- If we remain silent,
- Right.

1767
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:27,880
- Then nothing will happen.
- then we can play one more round.

1768
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,900
Right. Suk Jin,

1769
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:32,380
I swear on my son's name.
I won't betray you.

1770
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,440
If I betray you this time,

1771
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,070
you don't have to see me
for a while.

1772
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,420
(Laughing)

1773
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,820
Don't laugh. I'm serious.

1774
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:42,090
If I... Okay, fine.
I won't swear either.

1775
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:44,460
Just trust me.
Let's remain silent together.

1776
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,480
I'm going to trust you.

1777
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,750
Okay. You're the strong one,
and I'm the fast one.

1778
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,790
We should remain silent
and accuse Se Chan and Ji Hyo...

1779
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:53,270
of being the Mafia
in the next round.

1780
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:54,790
Or we could accuse Jae Suk.

1781
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:58,170
Whoever it is, I'm going to choose
to remain silent.

1782
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:59,710
- Okay. Let's do this.
- Okay.

1783
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:01,230
- I'll remain silent.
- Promise me.

1784
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:02,710
- I promise you.
- Okay.

1785
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:03,710
(They give each other
a firm promise.)

1786
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:06,940
Should I trust him or not?

1787
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:08,250
(As soon as he hangs up)

1788
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,320
Should I trust him or not?

1789
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,090
I'm going to trust Suk Jin.

1790
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:14,340
I'll never yield to them.

1791
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:17,790
I'll never yield to them.
I trust him.

1792
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,360
Suk Jin is as good as caught.

1793
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:23,250
Old man.

1794
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,460
How dare you call me old?

1795
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:28,860
Let's not stall for time.

1796
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,540
I'll just say this out loud.

1797
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:34,360
I told you so many times
that it's not me.

1798
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,570
Sir.

1799
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:37,540
- You came to the wrong person.
- Sir.

1800
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:39,650
- I'm sorry.
- So...

1801
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,770
This is so frustrating.
The Mafia on the loose.

1802
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:45,480
- All right now. Shut your mouth.
- I'm not the Mafia.

1803
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:47,190
You were born in 1966, right?

1804
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:49,980
- Am I a criminal or something?
- This sounds real.

1805
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,960
No, I'm not saying that. Your
surname is of Chungju Clan, right?

1806
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,190
- Yes, it is.
- Okay.

1807
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:55,460
You went to
Suyu Elementary School, correct?

1808
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,790
And you went to
Shinil Middle School.

1809
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:59,520
Your nose is 7cm tall
and 5cm wide. Is that correct?

1810
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,960
(He questions Suk Jin's nose size
out of the blue.)

1811
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,170
- What on earth...
- This sounds real.

1812
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,040
- Yes, it is.
- We're asking these questions...

1813
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,170
- to check on the details.
- Sure.

1814
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:08,400
Excuse me.

1815
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:10,630
It looks like...

1816
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:13,500
all the soft-hearted ones are here.

1817
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,710
- The soft-hearted ones.
- But we have you.

1818
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:17,940
- We have you.
- One of you could be the Mafia.

1819
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,190
- I'm not the Mafia.
- Mr. Mafia.

1820
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:21,480
- Mr. Mafia.
- I told you. I'm not the Mafia.

1821
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:24,360
You arrogant Mafia.

1822
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,960
You're acting arrogant even in here.

1823
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,900
Are you going to confess or not?

1824
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,130
Oh, you're here.

1825
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:32,770
- Look at you.
- Why are you...

1826
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:34,360
Your tone is arrogant.

1827
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,130
- This is baffling.
- Baffling?

1828
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:38,170
Why do you think only two of us
came into your room?

1829
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,730
That means one of us is the Mafia.

1830
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:41,570
- What?
- One of us?

1831
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,070
I think it's Se Chan.

1832
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:45,070
You're such a good liar.

1833
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:46,810
Don't put your legs on the table.

1834
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:48,480
His surname is of Jinju Clan.

1835
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:51,190
He's 168cm tall? He lied.

1836
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:53,040
Who wrote that? I'm 171.5cm tall!

1837
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,150
- Hey, 168cm.
- Where did you get this info?

1838
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:57,520
- You're short. Shut your mouth.
- What are you talking about?

1839
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,590
- Keep quiet.
- Hey, you punk!

1840
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:01,500
- Keep quiet.
- My pride is at stake here!

1841
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,590
- Give it back.
- Don't be arrogant.

1842
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:06,320
When I'm in good condition,
I'm 172.5cm tall!

1843
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:08,860
Don't call me 168cm ever again.

1844
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,670
- Haha.
- Tell us honestly.

1845
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:13,860
Why don't you just confess now?

1846
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,940
No, I won't. Why would I confess
when I'm not the Mafia?

1847
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,670
You are the Mafia.

1848
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:19,480
- No, I am not.
- Who do you think is the Mafia?

1849
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,170
- I think it's Se Chan.
- Why?

1850
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:23,380
I voted for Se Chan.
You will saw it on TV later.

1851
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,540
- What?
- "You will saw it"?

1852
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:25,820
You will saw it on TV later.

1853
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:28,090
(Excuse me?)

1854
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:29,860
You will see it.

1855
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,060
- I am serious.
- All right.

1856
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,130
- I am not the Mafia.
- All right.

1857
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:34,920
I am not the Mafia,
so I am confident.

1858
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,560
Usually, the Mafia or spia...

1859
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,270
Oh, that came out wrong.
I meant to say "Spy".

1860
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:42,000
- What was that? Are you tired?
- Usually, the Mafia or spia...

1861
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,670
- He is nervous.
- No, I am tired.

1862
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,460
- You are flustered.
- Not at all.

1863
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,130
- How did I behave suspiciously?
- Earlier,

1864
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,500
why did you do that with Suk Jin?

1865
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,840
- It was funny.
- I bet you didn't even hide it...

1866
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,250
- because you got caught.
- It's not like that at all.

1867
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:56,250
- This is your chance. Confess.
- Whatever.

1868
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,690
- You won't? Let's go. Get up.
- Do you know why I won't confess?

1869
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:00,380
- Go.
- All right.

1870
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:02,420
- Go. I am not the Mafia.
- Won't you confess?

1871
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:04,090
- Won't you confess? All right.
- I won't confess.

1872
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,190
I can't because I am not the Mafia.
You are the Mafia.

1873
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:07,290
I am not the Mafia.

1874
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:09,520
Do you want to make a bet?
What will you do if I am a citizen?

1875
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,000
Do you want to hit me
across the face?

1876
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:12,690
- Are you confident?
- Yes.

1877
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,170
- I will hit you for real.
- Sure.

1878
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:16,840
- Are you ready to take a punch?
- I am not the Mafia.

1879
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,500
- Do you want to take it now?
- If Jong Kook is the Mafia,

1880
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,270
can you hit him across the face?

1881
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:21,770
- If he is the Mafia?
- Yes.

1882
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:22,940
I can't do that.

1883
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:24,480
- I can't do that.
- Then why will you hit me?

1884
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,810
I think I will win
if we have a fight.

1885
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:28,170
- Seriously.
- You will definitely win.

1886
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:29,610
- I think I will win...
- You will definitely win.

1887
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:31,290
- if we have a fight.
- Seriously.

1888
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:33,040
You are unbelievable.

1889
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,320
I think you are most likely
to be the Mafia.

1890
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,150
Look over here. Haha is the Mafia.

1891
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:39,920
- Let's say that I am.
- Suk Jin is in the other room.

1892
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:43,400
- Why did you pick me?
- You behaved suspiciously earlier.

1893
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,790
- That was...
- You admit it, right?

1894
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:47,270
I didn't do anything.
How did I behave suspiciously?

1895
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,730
You were so obvious
when you carried out a mission.

1896
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:52,630
- What do you mean?
- You sat down and stood out.

1897
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:55,340
- Do you think it was a mission?
- Of course it was.

1898
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:57,070
- Haha told me...
- They were like a seesaw.

1899
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,900
When one sat down,
the other one stood up.

1900
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,810
- Such a mission doesn't exist.
- Yes, it does.

1901
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:02,340
- We just witnessed it.
- Such a mission could exist.

1902
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,420
I doubt it.

1903
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:06,650
- I am not the Mafia.
- Your face is very red right now.

1904
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:08,610
- Your face is very puffy.
- Yes.

1905
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:10,650
I had ramyeon last night.
I was too hungry.

1906
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:12,150
My wife was at her parents' place.

1907
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:13,880
- I see.
- I ate other things too.

1908
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,290
- Was she at her parents' place?
- Yes.

1909
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,060
- She doesn't let me eat at night.
- I bet it was like a festival.

1910
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:19,290
(I bet it was like a festival.)

1911
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,690
A party.

1912
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:22,540
There was nothing to do,

1913
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:23,860
but it didn't feel half bad.

1914
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:26,170
- I bet it was like a festival.
- Yes.

1915
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:27,730
(The suspect reveals information
about his family matters.)

1916
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:29,070
She went there late at night.

1917
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:30,340
It was past 9 p.m.

1918
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,310
- I will say this.
- Okay.

1919
01:05:32,310 --> 01:05:34,310
Even if you don't confess,

1920
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:35,570
Haha will.

1921
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,840
- You...
- You know that.

1922
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,290
You need to remember that.

1923
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:42,150
- But I am not the Mafia.
- You saw what happened earlier...

1924
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:43,320
with me and So Min.

1925
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:44,920
We kept the damage at 500 dollars.

1926
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,860
If you don't confess,
you will lose 1,000 dollars.

1927
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,000
- You have 150 dollars right now.
- You have 150 dollars.

1928
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,590
- You will be in debt.
- What do you want me to do?

1929
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:52,860
You will be 850 dollars in debt.

1930
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,590
I am not the Mafia,
so I can't do anything about it.

1931
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:57,090
I don't know who the Mafia is.

1932
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:58,960
Just remember what will happen...

1933
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,170
- if Haha confesses.
- In any case,

1934
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:02,670
I am not the Mafia.

1935
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:04,130
- So you don't care.
- No.

1936
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:06,070
- Okay. Then...
- I don't care.

1937
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:07,170
we are done here.

1938
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,250
If things go south,
you will lose 1,000 dollars.

1939
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:12,110
Why would I lose 1,000 dollars
when I am not the Mafia?

1940
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:13,480
I am not the Mafia.

1941
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,520
Can't you see how relaxed I am?

1942
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,920
- You are suspicious.
- I am not the Mafia.

1943
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,360
- Haha.
- I am not the Mafia.

1944
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,860
- Okay.
- It's him.

1945
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:21,420
- Suit yourself.
- Suk Jin is in the other room.

1946
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,900
- Okay.
- He is bound to confess.

1947
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,900
- If you remain silent...
- I don't care.

1948
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,630
- I am not the Mafia.
- Stop it. We got the point.

1949
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:29,690
- Why would I confess...
- Suk Jin is in the other room.

1950
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:31,190
when I am not the Mafia?

1951
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:32,610
Hey, I think...

1952
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:34,310
- Suk Jin isn't the Mafia.
- Why would I do that?

1953
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,730
- Then tell Suk Jin...
- It must be So Min.

1954
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,880
- to confess.
- Listen to me.

1955
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,340
It seems like...

1956
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:40,610
- Haha is the Mafia.
- This is driving me crazy.

1957
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:45,020
But he is certain
that the other one can't confess.

1958
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:46,380
Then who could be the Mafia?

1959
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:47,710
It's either Ji Hyo or So Min.

1960
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:50,060
Judging from his demeanor,

1961
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,460
- he is certain...
- He knows he won't lose money.

1962
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:52,690
- that...
- This is frustrating.

1963
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:55,460
the other Mafia didn't get caught.

1964
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,250
Haha definitely is the Mafia.

1965
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,420
- He is confident...
- So it's 1 of the 2.

1966
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:02,630
because he knows
that the other one can't confess.

1967
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,860
- See? He is confident.
- He is relaxed.

1968
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:08,380
- That's the only explanation.
- It isn't too late to confess.

1969
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:09,980
What is it going to be?

1970
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,440
He won't confess.

1971
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,480
- Sir.
- Make the decision in one minute.

1972
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,650
You don't have much time.

1973
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:16,070
If you don't confess,

1974
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:18,320
you will lose 1,000 dollars.

1975
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,380
Do you think you will get
two more rounds? That won't happen.

1976
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:22,190
- Haha will confess,
- I don't have anything to confess.

1977
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:23,360
and you will lose 1,000 dollars.

1978
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,960
Haha is bound to confess.

1979
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,060
- That goes without saying.
- Remember that.

1980
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:29,960
A civilian can't confess.

1981
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,860
All right. Don't confess.

1982
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:33,860
It's over. We are done here.

1983
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:36,670
- Please make the final decision.
- Okay.

1984
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:38,570
Will you confess or remain silent?

1985
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,110
- Haha is bound to confess.
- That goes without saying.

1986
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:42,170
You know what Haha is like.

1987
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,400
If I am the Mafia...

1988
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,570
- You are the Mafia.
- Let's say that I am.

1989
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:48,570
- Let's say Haha and I are.
- Okay.

1990
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:49,940
Then Haha will confess, right?

1991
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,170
- Of course.
- I am 100 percent sure of it.

1992
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:52,380
- Of course.
- Suk Jin,

1993
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,440
I am 300 percent sure of it.

1994
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,650
I am 1,000 percent sure of it.

1995
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,710
You are torn...

1996
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:58,520
because your partner is Haha.

1997
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,250
If I am the Mafia,
I have every reason to confess.

1998
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,920
- Of course.
- Of course.

1999
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,960
Please make the final decision.

2000
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,920
(What will be the Mafia's decision?)

2001
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,730
- I will remain silent.
- Fine.

2002
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:10,090
Suit yourself.

2003
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:12,710
(Haha chose to remain silent.)

2004
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,810
Otherwise...

2005
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:17,810
Ji Hyo might be lying.

2006
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:21,110
(Haha even used a trick
to defend himself.)

2007
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,750
- The result is out.
- Okay.

2008
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:27,090
- Haha remained silent.
- Yes.

2009
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:30,250
The Mafia in the other room,
Suk Jin...

2010
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,730
(What did Suk Jin choose?)

2011
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,620
Suk Jin confessed.

2012
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:39,990
(Suk Jin confessed.)

2013
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,270
(He confessed?)

2014
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:47,310
(Suk Jin betrayed Haha
and confessed.)

2015
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:49,200
He is a fool. He really is a fool.

2016
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,700
You lost 1,000 dollars.

2017
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:52,870
You lost 1,000 dollars!

2018
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:55,410
Please make the final decision.

2019
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:56,670
- Okay.
- He will confess.

2020
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,170
Will you confess or remain silent?

2021
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:01,190
One, two, three.

2022
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:02,320
I will confess.

2023
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,750
(Whispering)

2024
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:06,730
(I will confess.)

2025
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:07,860
Good job.

2026
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:09,860
I don't want to be betrayed again.

2027
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:12,370
- My feelings will be hurt.
- It's understandable.

2028
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:14,120
- Haha...
- Read it again.

2029
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,770
That can't be the result.

2030
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:17,090
- That can't be the result.
- Haha is the Mafia.

2031
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,660
Perhaps you meant to say
that he is confused.

2032
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:19,940
He confessed.

2033
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:21,740
How did you trust Suk Jin?

2034
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,330
You should have seen this coming.

2035
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:25,000
How did you trust Suk Jin?

2036
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,310
(Unlike the usual times,
he had too much trust in Suk Jin.)

2037
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:28,040
You will be at the bottom.
This is the worst result.

2038
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,480
Seriously.

2039
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,320
Why did you trust Suk Jin?

2040
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:33,340
- The result is out.
- Okay.

2041
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,520
- He confessed.
- He confessed.

2042
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,690
Haha in the other room...

2043
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:38,860
remained silent.

2044
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:40,330
(Haha in the other room
remained silent.)

2045
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:44,450
(What?)

2046
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:47,160
Did Haha remain silent? Why?

2047
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,870
(He sold out his partner
to save himself.)

2048
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:50,460
In any case, congratulations
on winning 100 dollars.

2049
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,130
- You did well.
- Suk Jin,

2050
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:53,530
- you won money.
- You won 100 dollars.

2051
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:55,000
I know, but I feel bad.

2052
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:56,310
Why?

2053
01:09:56,310 --> 01:09:58,080
Haha lost 1,000 dollars.

2054
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,240
Suk Jin, here is 100 dollars.

2055
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,540
I don't want to receive
100 dollars like this.

2056
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:03,710
- Why not?
- Take it.

2057
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:05,710
- Why not?
- You won 100 dollars.

2058
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:07,880
You said Haha will confess.

2059
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,060
- I thought he would confess.
- You are the worst.

2060
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:12,060
- Why didn't he confess?
- Seriously.

2061
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,160
I will end you!

2062
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:16,420
Suk Jin!

2063
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,420
Suk Jin!

2064
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,620
(Haha's angry shouts
fill the place.)

2065
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:22,570
Listen.

2066
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:24,460
Let go.

2067
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:25,870
- Hey.
- I will end you!

2068
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,610
Suk Jin!

2069
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:28,670
(Suk Jin!)

2070
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:29,830
Hey!

2071
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,280
Hey!

2072
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,370
- He is here.
- Come on out.

2073
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,370
Old man!

2074
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:36,080
Old snake!

2075
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:37,980
You told me to trust you.

2076
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:39,950
- You told me to trust you.
- It's not like that.

2077
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:41,990
These three are...

2078
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:43,750
the absolute worst.

2079
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:44,880
How could you do this to me?

2080
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,060
We were so close!

2081
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,900
- I had set up a trick.
- How?

2082
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:52,420
I had gotten them
to suspect Ji Hyo and So Min.

2083
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:56,160
They were beginning to get confused.

2084
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,630
Had you stayed silent,

2085
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:00,700
we would have gotten another round
without getting caught.

2086
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:03,580
We could have done the mission...

2087
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,000
- in the open.
- Really?

2088
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,280
(Really?)

2089
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,480
Hurry up and give me 100 dollars.

2090
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:11,480
I have to take it from you.
I am so annoyed.

2091
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,650
I will give you 100 dollars.

2092
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:14,620
I remained silent.

2093
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:15,750
How did you do that?

2094
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,660
Did you change the character?

2095
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:18,990
I didn't change the character!

2096
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:20,860
Don't you have any trust in me?

2097
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,420
(The Mafia duo got caught
due to the lack of trust.)

2098
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,920
Please enter the room.

2099
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,200
I hope I don't become the Mafia.

2100
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,460
I really hope
I don't become the Mafia.

2101
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:29,990
(Since the Mafias got caught,
2 new Mafias get chosen.)

2102
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:33,940
The last Mafias are chosen.

2103
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,700
(The last Mafias are chosen.)

2104
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:38,330
You are the Mafia.

2105
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:39,840
(Who are the 2 last Mafias?)

2106
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,950
The hidden mission is...

2107
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:42,780
(What is their hidden mission?)

2108
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:45,490
The Mafias get caught
no matter what.

2109
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:47,080
The Mafias will get caught
no matter what.

2110
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,120
(Who are the 2 Mafias?)

2111
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:49,660
I didn't doubt you.

2112
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:51,080
You can trust me from now on.

2113
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,450
I am not a bad man.

2114
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:53,950
For the last mission,

2115
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:55,620
jump over the bar...

2116
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:57,750
using the Fosbury flop.

2117
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:58,990
- Like this?
- Yes.

2118
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:00,160
- What's the Fosbury flop?
- What?

2119
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,160
Like this?

2120
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,090
(The Fosbury flop is...)

2121
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:08,670
(a high jump technique
in which one lies backward.)

2122
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:10,370
(Woo Sang Hyeok showed...)

2123
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:13,480
(a textbook example
of the Fosbury flop.)

2124
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:17,120
Your best record will be your score.

2125
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,210
This is impossible.

2126
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:20,520
As for the female members,

2127
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,080
we will add 30cm.

2128
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,160
- Really?
- If you clear 80cm,

2129
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,750
your record will be 110cm.

2130
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:27,780
- Let's start at 80cm.
- All right. Eighty centimeters.

2131
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:30,860
- High jump is hard.
- Adjust the height afterward.

2132
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,160
Anyone can jump over that.

2133
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,990
- Anyone can jump over that.
- I know.

2134
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:36,030
You should go first.

2135
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:37,700
Anyone can jump over that.

2136
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,630
You should be able
to jump over the bar.

2137
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:41,700
It's just a simple jump.

2138
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:42,810
You just need to jump lightly.

2139
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,410
Jump lightly.

2140
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:47,780
(He cleared 80cm as he promised.)

2141
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:48,950
Nice.

2142
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:50,480
Ji Hyo.

2143
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,820
(Ji Hyo, 80cm)

2144
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:52,990
What is up
with everyone's facial expression?

2145
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:57,250
What is up
with everyone's facial expression?

2146
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:00,330
(The 1st slapstick comedy
at the baseline)

2147
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:02,160
- Okay.
- That was funny.

2148
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,860
- Out.
- How did that happen?

2149
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:05,200
Ji Hyo, that was funny.

2150
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:06,590
- Ji Hyo, that was funny.
- You are good.

2151
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:08,830
- All right.
- You are out.

2152
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,770
Ji Hyo, good job
with slapstick comedy.

2153
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:13,940
I don't think I will need to run up.

2154
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:15,000
Just jump.

2155
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,200
- Yes.
- Go.

2156
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,500
(She gets ready
in a haughty manner.)

2157
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,700
(So Min, 80cm)

2158
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:24,040
(Success)

2159
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,240
Will you jump?

2160
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,490
(With a blank facial expression,)

2161
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,620
(she jumps in a cheesy way.)

2162
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:30,990
So Min, you ran strangely.

2163
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,420
What was that?

2164
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:33,530
Her facial expression was
really strange.

2165
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:36,360
So Min, you ran strangely.
You ran like this.

2166
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:39,420
(Her father who is an athlete
would be appalled.)

2167
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,460
It was cool, right?

2168
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:42,490
Shouldn't I raise the bar?

2169
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:44,090
- Go ahead.
- I need to beat her.

2170
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:45,200
Raise the bar.

2171
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,530
I need to beat her.

2172
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:48,070
- Raise the bar.
- I will be at the bottom otherwise.

2173
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:49,980
Please raise the bar to 111cm.

2174
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:51,610
Did you say 111cm?

2175
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:53,200
- Hold on. I will do it.
- It's 1cm more than my record.

2176
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,950
- I think he will fail.
- You can't touch it.

2177
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,320
I think he will fail.

2178
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,150
- Okay.
- I think he will fail.

2179
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,620
That's it. Jump like this.

2180
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:03,780
Let's go!

2181
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:07,190
Did you learn the mask dance?

2182
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:08,730
Will you jump like this?

2183
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:09,750
There you go.

2184
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:11,900
How do I do this?

2185
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:13,700
- You guys are incredible.
- Put it up.

2186
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,130
He is a funny old man.

2187
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:17,200
(The sneak peek
leaves everyone excited.)

2188
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,460
- The icon of longevity.
- Longevity and health.

2189
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,530
We are rooting for you.

2190
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:24,530
- That's good.
- Come on.

2191
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:25,740
- Promise.
- Rev yourself up.

2192
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:28,340
That's good. Rev yourself up. Okay.

2193
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:30,410
- That's good.
- Put your heart into it.

2194
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:32,210
(Screaming)

2195
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:34,820
Put your heart into it.

2196
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,990
(He goes down with a shout.)

2197
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:39,120
Suk Jin.

2198
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:42,920
- He got scared.
- You jumped with two feet.

2199
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:45,060
- It's impossible to jump that way.
- Why couldn't I jump with one foot?

2200
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:46,090
That was great.

2201
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:48,370
- Your legs didn't go up.
- Why couldn't I jump with one foot?

2202
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:50,490
I think Ji Hyo will succeed.

2203
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:51,700
- Be daring.
- You need to run faster.

2204
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,940
- I run up and jump like this.
- That's right.

2205
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:55,580
- But you need speed.
- Really?

2206
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:57,240
Let me tell you how it's done.

2207
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:01,500
Run up and jump
as if you are lying on my bed,

2208
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,670
okay?

2209
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:03,670
That's how you do it.

2210
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,170
- "My bed"?
- "My bed"?

2211
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:06,950
"My bed"?

2212
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:09,020
"My bed"!

2213
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:12,230
(I want to be
the bed in your room for a day)

2214
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:13,530
"My bed"?

2215
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,330
(He ended up feeding them again.)

2216
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:16,730
- "My bed"?
- No.

2217
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:18,030
I meant to say "Your bed".

2218
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:21,120
Run up and jump
as if you are lying on your bed,

2219
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,370
Does that mean
she has lied on your bed?

2220
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:25,240
I meant to say "Your bed"!

2221
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:27,530
"Your bed"!

2222
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:29,940
(Se Chan and Haha show
a cute group dance.)

2223
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,080
(Biting his lips)

2224
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,370
- He started it.
- No.

2225
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:34,780
- So Min started it.
- No, I didn't.

2226
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,320
Why don't you put her at ease
by doing what you always do...

2227
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,950
and lie down
with your arm spread like a pillow?

2228
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:41,150
(Lie down
with your arm spread like a pillow.)

2229
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:45,080
(Jong Kook is ready
to cut off his arm.)

2230
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,830
- Like a pillow!
- He really startled me.

2231
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:49,900
- He really startled me.
- My goodness.

2232
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:52,120
- Not yet.
- Ji Hyo, jump.

2233
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:55,570
Jump as if you are lying
on your bed.

2234
01:15:55,570 --> 01:15:56,790
(Ji Hyo, 111cm)

2235
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:58,660
- Put your heart into it.
- That's good.

2236
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:01,570
- Put your heart into it.
- That's good.

2237
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:02,580
(Screaming)

2238
01:16:03,610 --> 01:16:05,870
(She crashed into the bed.)

2239
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:09,150
Her face was so funny.

2240
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:10,910
- Ji Hyo.
- That was funny.

2241
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:12,880
- That was funny.
- That was funny.

2242
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,280
- How did she do that?
- That was pure slapstick comedy.

2243
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,560
Did you learn
slapstick comedy somewhere?

2244
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,620
(They wonder
if she has taken lessons.)

2245
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:20,750
Her slapstick comedy was funny.

2246
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,060
You are funny.

2247
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,660
Your hairstyle resembles
Dr. Oh Eun Young's too.

2248
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:28,030
- That was great.
- Seriously.

2249
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:32,700
- Jae Suk, let's go.
- Grasshopper.

2250
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:34,910
I think you will succeed
if you have confidence.

2251
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:36,940
I have no confidence,
but I will succeed.

2252
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:38,440
(Jae Suk, 111cm)

2253
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,240
(No one has cleared 111cm.)

2254
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,320
Let's go.

2255
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,040
(Let's go.)

2256
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:49,080
Let's go.

2257
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,990
(He unfortunately fails.)

2258
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,380
You failed.

2259
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:54,780
I could see that he was scared.

2260
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,160
- I could see that he was scared.
- Could you see it?

2261
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,900
- Yes.
- He was like, "Let's clear 111cm."

2262
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,330
- All right.
- He failed.

2263
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,070
Go. That's good.

2264
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:03,090
He got this.

2265
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:04,830
It was scary.
It was scary at the end.

2266
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:06,370
- He got scared.
- It was so scary.

2267
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:09,410
(The fearless Jong Kook
attempts to clear 111cm!)

2268
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:12,810
(A clean success)

2269
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:13,870
You succeeded.

2270
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:15,310
It was a proper flop.

2271
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:17,370
It's called the Fosbury flop.

2272
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:19,280
- A flop?
- Who is next?

2273
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,620
- Okay.
- Se Chan.

2274
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:22,490
(Se Chan, 111cm)

2275
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:27,080
(He must have watched
a lot of high jump competitions.)

2276
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:31,290
(He is collecting energy
to clear mere 1m.)

2277
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:33,490
Give me more energy.

2278
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:36,400
He isn't intimidated
by the competent high jumpers.

2279
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:38,910
- He will attempt to clear 235cm.
- Let's go!

2280
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:39,940
Yes. Let's go.

2281
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:41,310
(The short high jumper imitates
Woo Sang Hyeok's passion...)

2282
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:42,370
He is enjoying himself.

2283
01:17:42,370 --> 01:17:43,830
(and gets revved up.)

2284
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:46,810
(He screams to bring up his energy.)

2285
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:49,170
Hold on. Isn't that a mission?

2286
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:50,450
Hold on.

2287
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:52,840
- It's not a mission.
- Hey.

2288
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,490
You are lying. Hey!

2289
01:17:54,490 --> 01:17:56,120
- Hey.
- It's not a mission.

2290
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,750
- Hey.
- High jumpers do this.

2291
01:17:58,750 --> 01:17:59,920
It looked a bit like a mission.

2292
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,060
- Seriously.
- I was gathering courage.

2293
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:02,290
When do high jumpers do that?

2294
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:04,290
- I have never seen it.
- Don't high jumpers do that?

2295
01:18:04,290 --> 01:18:06,530
- That came out of nowhere.
- So you just copied it?

2296
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:08,420
- It's something I do.
- He suddenly did a mission.

2297
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:09,700
(Se Chan is suspected
of being the Mafia.)

2298
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:10,940
It's not a mission.

2299
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:12,310
Here I go.

2300
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:13,500
Go.

2301
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,940
(Se Chan, 111cm)

2302
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:21,870
- Of course.
- Okay.

2303
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,120
(Light)

2304
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,320
(He cleared 111cm after Jong Kook!)

2305
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:27,320
Good job.

2306
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:29,710
Jong Kook, jump after you get
a round of applause.

2307
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:31,120
It will give you courage.

2308
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:32,330
- Isn't it hard?
- No.

2309
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:33,920
- I think I will fail.
- You know,

2310
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,990
Se Chan, you will have to compete
against Jong Kook...

2311
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:39,660
- to the end.
- That's right. Try it today.

2312
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,160
- I think I will lose to Jong Kook.
- Se Chan is good at this.

2313
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:43,400
He is too flexible.

2314
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,740
The height should be 121cm.

2315
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,330
- Really?
- Let's keep it tight.

2316
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:48,330
I raised it. Go.

2317
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:49,610
Can you jump over it?

2318
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:51,080
- I will.
- Can you jump over it?

2319
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,370
Se Chan jumped over the bar
with ease earlier.

2320
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:54,810
(Se Chan, 121cm)

2321
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,150
Here comes So Min's boyfriend.

2322
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,910
Stop it already.

2323
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:03,560
- That's just wrong.
- Stop it.

2324
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,060
- For goodness' sake.
- So Min.

2325
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:07,580
So Min, please move to the side.

2326
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:10,530
His hair came out well today.

2327
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:12,730
I used to do tracks.

2328
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:13,870
- Really?
- Yes.

2329
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:15,120
I learned the high jump too.

2330
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,590
- Really?
- You need speed to jump over.

2331
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:19,200
You did tracks
in elementary school, right?

2332
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,410
- Yes.
- You didn't go to middle school.

2333
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:25,130
(Swearing with his eyes)

2334
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:26,500
Look at his face.

2335
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,950
He is about to hit you.

2336
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,780
- Use your anger to jump.
- Watch what you say.

2337
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:33,020
Don't get scared.
Don't get intimidated.

2338
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,320
That's right.

2339
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,780
He will succeed.

2340
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:42,730
(Will he clear 121cm
with his experience in tracks?)

2341
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:46,330
He will succeed.

2342
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:47,990
He succeeded!

2343
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:49,900
That was perfect.

2344
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:51,960
He succeeded!

2345
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,460
(He succeeded with ease!)

2346
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,240
(Impressed)

2347
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:56,370
That was...

2348
01:19:56,370 --> 01:19:57,440
(Dongducheon's track team,
are you watching this?)

2349
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,370
- Se Chan is the best.
- He is like a professional.

2350
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:00,700
("Nobody" dance ceremony)

2351
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:02,410
(What?)

2352
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:03,540
- No.
- Isn't that a mission?

2353
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:04,840
My nose is runny.

2354
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,210
- "Nobody".
- I was expressing happiness.

2355
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:08,320
Is doing the "Nobody" dance
in front of the camera a mission?

2356
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,620
His ceremony was a mission.

2357
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:10,880
It wasn't a mission.

2358
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,190
- His ceremony.
- He did this.

2359
01:20:12,190 --> 01:20:13,730
The camera zoomed in on me.

2360
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:14,830
His ceremony was a mission.

2361
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:16,420
- His ceremony.
- Come on.

2362
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,160
Let's do this.
Se Chan has good movement.

2363
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,270
(Jong Kook is Se Chan's only rival.)

2364
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:22,900
Here I go.

2365
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:23,940
(Kim Jong Kook, 121cm)

2366
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:30,310
His energy is overflowing.

2367
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:32,540
(He jogged...)

2368
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:33,610
(and did the vertical jump.)

2369
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:35,310
His energy is overflowing.

2370
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:38,020
- Let's try 135cm.
- Just raise your legs a bit.

2371
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:39,240
- Okay.
- Let's try 135cm.

2372
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:41,040
I won't be able to succeed.

2373
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,120
When you jumped earlier,
there was enough space.

2374
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,410
You will succeed.
You jumped with ease earlier.

2375
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:46,420
Hey, So Min.

2376
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:47,920
What are you doing?
Are you watching a movie?

2377
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,230
Are you watching a movie?

2378
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:50,490
I want to give Se Chan energy.

2379
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:51,920
- You want to give Se Chan energy.
- Yes.

2380
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:55,490
Se Chan is really good.

2381
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:58,740
(Dongducheon's track team member
will attempt to make a new record.)

2382
01:20:58,740 --> 01:20:59,740
Track team.

2383
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:01,110
Let's see.

2384
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:03,200
Let's see.

2385
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:06,000
You are cool!

2386
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:07,200
- You are cool!
- Hey.

2387
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,240
(He cleared 135cm.)

2388
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,840
(It was the perfect Fosbury flop.)

2389
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,380
- Good job.
- Seriously.

2390
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:14,540
- That was incredible.
- You jumped properly this time.

2391
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:16,120
He really was in a track team.

2392
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,580
- Don't be scared.
- Seriously.

2393
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:18,750
- He is cool.
- He is really cool.

2394
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,880
- He is cool.
- That was sexy.

2395
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,330
Se Chan, that was incredible.

2396
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,620
Forget it.

2397
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:24,750
(Jong Kook, 135cm)

2398
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,030
One, two, three.

2399
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:27,030
(He is the only rival
to Dongducheon's Woo Sang Hyeok.)

2400
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:33,270
(He succeeded.)

2401
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:34,270
That's impressive.

2402
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:36,780
While he wasn't in a track team,
he jumps over with brute strength.

2403
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:38,310
I can't win against him.

2404
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:40,540
(The mission ended
when they failed to clear 140cm!)

2405
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:42,110
The first-place winners,

2406
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:44,980
Jong Kook and Se Chan
will receive 1,000 dollars each.

2407
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:47,380
- Okay.
- Did you say 1,000 dollars?

2408
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:49,750
- That's a lot of money.
- I have zero dollars.

2409
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,060
Do some people have zero dollars?

2410
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:54,690
Now, it's time to announce
the result of the hidden mission.

2411
01:21:55,490 --> 01:21:56,790
The hidden mission...

2412
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:02,070
(If their guess is correct,
Se Chan carried it out.)

2413
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:04,900
failed.

2414
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,160
- What?
- I knew it.

2415
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,830
(Did the hidden mission fail?)

2416
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,410
The Mafias didn't do it.
They gave up.

2417
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:13,280
- They gave up.
- They did it to stay hidden.

2418
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,910
- So it wasn't the clapping.
- Of course not.

2419
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:16,980
The last interrogation
will be kept short.

2420
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:18,840
Follow your cameraman...

2421
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,120
and vote for the two Mafias.
Then the interrogation will ensue.

2422
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,710
It means the Mafias
didn't carry out the mission.

2423
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,620
It must be Jong Kook.

2424
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,250
If I must pick two people...

2425
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:30,090
(What does
Jae Suk's intuition say?)

2426
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:31,790
Jong Kook and Se Chan.

2427
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:34,660
So Min and Jong Kook.

2428
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:35,940
(Suk Jin suspects
So Min and Jong Kook.)

2429
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:37,070
That's my vote.

2430
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:38,570
Se Chan and Ji Hyo.

2431
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:39,700
Se Chan.

2432
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:40,960
I vote for Se Chan.

2433
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:45,310
I need to get his confession.

2434
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,500
- Here is the man I suspected.
- Seriously.

2435
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,870
You got it all wrong.

2436
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:51,710
- Don't be like that.
- You ruined it.

2437
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,240
- Just confess.
- You got it all wrong.

2438
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:54,710
- Jong Kook.
- I am serious.

2439
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:56,580
Here is what I think, Jong Kook.

2440
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:59,560
You are the only one
who would ignore the mission.

2441
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,330
- That's not true.
- Everyone else would attempt it.

2442
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:03,700
- Like who?
- You said that earlier.

2443
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:05,290
- When?
- "You can just not do the mission."

2444
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:07,920
I did say that. I guess
the Mafias followed my advice.

2445
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:10,070
Let's take this slow.

2446
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:11,590
You were born in 1976, right?

2447
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,200
- You were born in 1976.
- That's right.

2448
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,280
Once you start to suspect someone,

2449
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,410
you harass the person
until the end...

2450
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:18,810
and tire him or her out,
is that true?

2451
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:19,810
Yes.

2452
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,620
You know my style.
If I were the Mafia,

2453
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:24,240
- I would tell you the truth.
- Who do you think it is then?

2454
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,210
I can't hide it.
I'm sure it's Yang Se Chan.

2455
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:28,710
(He protests his innocence
and names Se Chan.)

2456
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:30,910
- And I'd suspect you.
- Me?

2457
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:32,420
- Yes.
- All right.

2458
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,530
- Jong Kook.
- What's with your hands?

2459
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:36,090
- What's with your hands.
- Jong Kook.

2460
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:37,700
I'm tired. Let's make it short.

2461
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:39,620
- I know we're tired.
- So...

2462
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:41,290
Listen. I'm not the Mafia.

2463
01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:43,490
If you are done, just get out.

2464
01:23:43,570 --> 01:23:45,960
- Hey.
- Get out. I don't want to talk.

2465
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:49,280
Talking to him doesn't work.
He is...

2466
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:51,610
- So Min is...
- Hey, shall we go to Room of Truth?

2467
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:52,700
- What?
- Room of Truth.

2468
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:55,340
Can we please go to Room of Truth?

2469
01:23:55,450 --> 01:23:57,710
(The suspect is glad
to hear about Room of Truth.)

2470
01:23:57,710 --> 01:23:59,620
- This is the Room of Truth.
- Please go to Room of Truth.

2471
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:00,910
- Come here.
- Okay.

2472
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:02,620
- Thank you.
- Gosh.

2473
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:03,620
Wait.

2474
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:06,060
(They go into Room of Truth
where the truth is revealed.)

2475
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:13,330
Good. That was okay.

2476
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:15,090
We found out the truth.

2477
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:16,700
It is like an old comedy skit.

2478
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:19,030
- This is what I used to do.
- We found out the truth in there.

2479
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,030
- I'm telling you.
- But...

2480
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:23,670
It's not me and neither are you.

2481
01:24:23,670 --> 01:24:24,670
- I'm not the Mafia.
- And it's not you.

2482
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:26,000
- Is it you?
- It's not me.

2483
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,170
And it's not me. Then who is it?

2484
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:28,700
How would I know?

2485
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,020
- I think it's you.
- It must be you.

2486
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:31,780
There won't be the next round.
This is the last one.

2487
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,320
You saw what happened to me.

2488
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,910
If you...

2489
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:36,080
Listen to me.

2490
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:37,990
- He was born in 1966.
- Yes.

2491
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:39,420
Don't say that.

2492
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:40,530
That's all you can say.

2493
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:41,730
- I see.
- He was born in 1966.

2494
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:42,900
- All right.
- And I was born in 1972.

2495
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:45,230
- You guys are old.
- I know.

2496
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:46,870
- We are older than you.
- That's why they're here.

2497
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:48,530
- You should listen to us.
- You punk.

2498
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:51,270
Have you made up your mind?

2499
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,920
- Silence.
- He chose to remain silent.

2500
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,020
Aren't you the mafia?

2501
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,370
I'll definitely remain silent.

2502
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:05,920
- All right.
- No matter what.

2503
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:08,130
(The last Mafia is not arrested.)

2504
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:10,060
- My gosh.
- Who is it?

2505
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:11,260
Who is it then?

2506
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:13,580
I'll announce the results then.

2507
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,510
- The last Mafias are...
- Who are they?

2508
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:21,550
(Who are the two Mafias
that have survived?)

2509
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:24,180
Kim Jong Kook and Jeon So Min.

2510
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:25,290
See?

2511
01:25:25,290 --> 01:25:27,510
(Kim Jong Kook and Jeon So Min)

2512
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:29,350
I was right
when I talked about So Min.

2513
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:31,550
- I was right about that.
- See?

2514
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:32,890
Their hidden mission was...

2515
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,020
drawing a stroke on your name tags
to change your names.

2516
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:37,370
I couldn't do it.

2517
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:40,560
Jae Suk, she kept trying to do
something on my name tag earlier.

2518
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,970
Really? You did it?

2519
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,560
No. I didn't. I had to use
a permanent marker, but I couldn't.

2520
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,130
I'll announce
the final results then.

2521
01:25:46,130 --> 01:25:47,130
I hope I'm not the last one.

2522
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:48,170
Number one is...

2523
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:51,140
Kim Jong Kook with 1,600 dollars.

2524
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:54,050
I got a lot of money
at the last minute.

2525
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:56,010
Number two also came from behind.

2526
01:25:56,010 --> 01:25:57,640
Yang Se Chan with 1,450 dollars.

2527
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,090
(Number 2 is Yang Se Chan
with 1,450 dollars.)

2528
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:01,620
So these two members win the prize.

2529
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:03,720
- The prize is...
- What is it?

2530
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:07,130
It is the high-quality chocolate
that will make you feel better...

2531
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:08,720
after the confusing time.

2532
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,170
My goodness.

2533
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:12,060
- That's nice.
- It must be sweet.

2534
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:14,130
Among Haha, Jae Suk, and Suk Jin,

2535
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:16,410
two members will get the penalty.

2536
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:18,040
(Among Haha, Jae Suk, and Suk Jin,
two members will get the penalty.)

2537
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,130
- Is it me?
- I hope it's me and Suk Jin.

2538
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:21,880
- You two...
- Why?

2539
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:22,970
- All right.
- Suk Jin?

2540
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:24,840
The last two members
to get the penalty are...

2541
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,770
(Who are the two members
to get the penalty?)

2542
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:29,220
My son will love this place.

2543
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,640
(Haha and Suk Jin are
getting the penalty together.)

2544
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,450
What is the best one here?

2545
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:33,980
- This one looks nice.
- I know.

2546
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,260
- Shall we buy this one?
- I'll have two of these.

2547
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:37,350
Yes.

2548
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:40,330
This is important. Here?

2549
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,020
Okay.

2550
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:46,370
Thank you.

2551
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:48,470
- One each.
- Thank you.

2552
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,730
It feels like this is for us.

2553
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:52,410
I'll give this to you
during the opening.

2554
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:54,770
- Congratulations.
- Enjoy.

2555
01:26:57,950 --> 01:27:00,170
(The gym is in danger
of going bankrupt.)

2556
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:02,670
(You should come early
and work out hard...)

2557
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:04,050
(to make the national team.)

2558
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:07,180
(Look at you guys.
What time do you think it is now?)

2559
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,660
(The old gym users
don't feel nervous at all.)

2560
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,090
(They are
a rag-tag bunch of loafers.)

2561
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:15,090
(New members show up at the moment.)

2562
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:16,830
(Mi Joo, Lee Young Ji, Lee Sang Jun)

2563
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,300
Do squats.

2564
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:19,800
(With the unusual new members,)

2565
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,890
(the gym is reviving.)

2566
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:24,170
(Then they have an election
for the captain.)

2567
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,380
The captain should have
a sense of responsibility.

2568
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:27,840
(Those who are
loyal to Jong Kook...)

2569
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,080
(can enjoy a comfortable time
in the gym.)

2570
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:33,580
(Otherwise...)

2571
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:36,810
(you'll go through harsh training.)

2572
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:40,920
(Will Trainer Jong Kook be able
to revive the gym?)

2573
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,510
(Gym Revival Project,
Trainer Jong Kook and National Team)
