1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,110
(A shabby container
located in a remote place)

2
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,780
(It used to foster elite athletes
who swept many competitions.)

3
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,190
(But now it is covered with dust
with no people.)

4
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,160
(It's called "Tiger Gym".)

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,430
(Trainer Kook dreams
of reviving the gym here alone.)

6
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,210
(He even handed out leaflets
on the verge of going bankrupt.)

7
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,640
(Recruiting new members.
Tiger Gym is all free.)

8
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,850
People should work out.

9
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,540
They shouldn't be like this.
What are they thinking?

10
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,060
They all should be disciplined.

11
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,720
The gym is in danger
of going bankrupt now.

12
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,460
They should come here...

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,630
and become a member
of the national team.

14
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:08,290
But will they join the national team
if they work out here?

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,370
What event would it be?

16
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,930
What would they play
in the national team?

17
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,310
- You train athletes of all kinds.
- Really?

18
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,780
Actually, all kinds of sports
have something in common.

19
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,780
(He tries to focus on
his character.)

20
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,310
Gosh, what time is it now?

21
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,620
Why isn't anyone coming?

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,040
(The door is open!)

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,650
(Slamming the door)

24
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,950
What was that?

25
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,060
(Peeping)

26
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,650
- Why?
- He glared at me.

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,350
(The eyes of a poisonous snake)

28
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,730
Our eyes met.

29
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,400
- Who?
- Jong Kook.

30
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,260
He stares at me sharply.

31
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,930
- It was really sharp.
- I'm serious.

32
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,540
I had no choice
but to close the door.

33
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,200
(The old member plucks up
his courage and opens it again.)

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,400
- Hey, Trainer Kook.
- Hang on.

35
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,980
- "Hey, Trainer Kook?"
- He's so scary.

36
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,980
- My gosh.
- The thing is...

37
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,920
What time do you think it is now?

38
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,250
It is 10:12 a.m.

39
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,650
- Stand in a line.
- Hello.

40
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,150
- In a line.
- Today...

41
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,560
- Stand in a row.
- What is all this?

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,430
- Is this for your YouTube channel?
- We're in trouble. It'll be tough.

43
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,560
(It is expected to be
an exhausting day.)

44
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,700
- Is this "Gym Jong Kook"?
- Stay quiet.

45
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,060
- By the way...
- My gosh.

46
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,460
Hey.

47
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,660
Come on in and stand in a row.

48
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,770
(The man tried to escape,
but he got caught right away.)

49
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,740
- I need to go.
- Just stand here.

50
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,080
I feel uncomfortable
from the beginning.

51
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,470
- I'm tired.
- This is a gym.

52
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,650
It's just...

53
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,580
- By the way...
- What kind of gym is this?

54
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,780
What?

55
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,990
I want to go somewhere else.

56
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,180
Where do you want to go?

57
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,810
- This is...
- You're a member here.

58
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,590
The old man is not good at skits.

59
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,620
- Hey!
- Listen.

60
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,830
What time is it now? You can't join
the national team like this.

61
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,190
Who are you, by the way?

62
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,900
Are you a gangster or what?

63
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,840
Are you a trainer?

64
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,460
He wants you to come close.

65
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,840
(He shakes his finger at him.)

66
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,000
- Hey.
- He wants you to come close.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,960
- Why?
- How dare you...

68
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,280
In the morning...

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,810
- Who are you?
- What do you think you are?

70
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,940
(The man in a blue cap
stands in his way.)

71
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,870
- Excuse me.
- You stay out of this.

72
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,410
Who are you?

73
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,910
- You're one of us.
- How dare you...

74
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,340
- Attention.
- He's being cheeky.

75
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,860
- Look straight ahead.
- Look forward.

76
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,860
- Okay.
- Put your legs apart...

77
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,860
- at the shoulder width.
- Spread your legs.

78
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,360
- Do squats.
- Do squats.

79
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,860
- My thighs still hurt.
- Just do it.

80
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,960
Do squats.

81
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,560
- One.
- My goodness.

82
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,000
- Just do it.
- Two.

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,930
- Continue. Three.
- Two.

84
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,630
- Just do it.
- Four.

85
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,560
Five, six... My goodness.

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,030
Can he beat me?

87
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,370
Just continue.

88
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,810
- Go.
- Hurry.

89
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,110
- Seven.
- Go further down.

90
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,650
Put yourself together. Get a grip.

91
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,680
- Focus.
- Eight, nine,

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,750
- ten.
- Good.

93
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,910
- Thank you.
- Go back to your spot.

94
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,280
What do you guys think you are?
Why do you keep meddling?

95
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,750
I've been a member here
for a long time.

96
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,990
"Keep meddling?"

97
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,560
They are old members of our gym.

98
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,120
- I see.
- Hey.

99
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,830
I'm an old member,
and he's just an old fart.

100
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,830
(An old member, an old fart)

101
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,960
An old fart?

102
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,560
Is he an old fart?

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,870
Isn't he an old fossil?

104
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,160
- An old fart?
- He's an old fart.

105
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,930
What time do you think it is now?

106
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,060
You can't join
the national team like this.

107
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,430
- The national team?
- Yes.

108
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,340
- The national team?
- The national team?

109
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,180
- Will we join the national team?
- Wait.

110
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,340
The oldest member here...

111
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,810
is 56 years old.

112
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,520
A member
of the national gate ball team.

113
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,990
He can join
the national gate ball team.

114
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,150
- The national team?
- For what?

115
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,460
What event?

116
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,750
Mental strength is as important
as physical strength.

117
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,880
- Okay.
- You should be punctual.

118
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,620
You can't be late.

119
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,860
Excuse me.

120
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,520
Sometimes we can be late.
Aren't you being too harsh?

121
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,890
- What?
- It doesn't happen a lot.

122
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,000
Come forward.

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,760
- Come forward.
- Go forward.

124
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,470
- What?
- He is older than you,

125
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,110
but you should discipline him
when you need to.

126
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,680
- Don't spare the rod.
- Okay.

127
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,350
Attention. Look straight ahead
and do squats.

128
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,010
I can do squats.

129
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,570
- What are you doing?
- What was that?

130
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,770
What is he doing?

131
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,050
I can do squats.

132
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,920
(Moving his pelvis back and forth)

133
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,510
- What are you doing?
- What's that? Why is it so slow?

134
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,750
Why does it look strange?

135
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,880
- He got a penalty yesterday.
- Do squats.

136
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,250
Who'd do squats like that?

137
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,100
You're still vigorous.

138
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,560
Squats for your health.

139
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,870
- Love.
- Happiness.

140
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,740
- Stop it and go back to your place.
- American squats.

141
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,870
Okay. Return to your spot.

142
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,870
And about you two.

143
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,700
I heard...

144
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,570
- What?
- you two danced together yesterday.

145
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,930
These two.

146
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,750
You danced to "Rollin'".

147
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,270
(The members had an online
fan meeting the previous day.)

148
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,550
(They showed
some group performances...)

149
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,310
(as well as various
cover performances.)

150
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,990
We danced to "When We Disco".

151
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,060
- Hey.
- I see.

152
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,880
All right. You need to warm up
before working out.

153
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,360
- All of a sudden?
- It's a cardio exercise.

154
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,890
I want you two to show us the dance.

155
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,000
- All of a sudden?
- Out of the blue?

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,160
Yes.

157
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,670
What's with this gym?

158
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,830
- All of a sudden?
- Because you need to warm up.

159
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,630
So Min seemed very confident.

160
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,630
All right. Go ahead.

161
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,970
Dance together.

162
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,200
(An automatic response)

163
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,370
They're so good.

164
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,750
- Gosh, I hate that.
- They dance so well.

165
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,010
Good.

166
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,680
Good dance.

167
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,010
(They have
provocative glaring eyes.)

168
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,860
(Disco in perfect harmony)

169
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,360
- Look at them.
- They are really good.

170
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,500
(Disco in perfect harmony)

171
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,430
- They are good.
- They look so confident.

172
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,430
Isn't this nice?

173
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,820
Look. This is a cardio exercise.

174
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,260
They dance so well.

175
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,310
Done.

176
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,540
(The special performance is over.)

177
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,700
That was amazing.

178
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,110
(The special performance is over.)

179
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,570
This is a good cardio exercise.

180
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,120
You should warm up.

181
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,350
Dance to "Rollin'" now.

182
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,850
(He summons Ji Hyo
who danced to "Rollin'".)

183
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,920
She danced pretty well.

184
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,010
- There you go.
- There you go.

185
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,430
(This is her cover of "Rollin'",
"Jollin'".)

186
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,890
(After hesitating a little,
she starts dancing.)

187
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,120
Creaking.

188
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,370
Her body is...

189
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,890
Her body is being warmed up.

190
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,260
You're good.

191
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,330
(She dances with a demure smile
on her face.)

192
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,740
This is nice.

193
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,410
Ji Hyo, you're great.

194
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,980
The stingray dance.

195
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,750
There's the stingray.

196
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,510
(A stingray shows up.)

197
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,810
Gosh, this is so...

198
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,420
My goodness.

199
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,010
- She's cute.
- They're dancing together.

200
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,120
I can tell she memorized the moves.

201
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,060
Okay.

202
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,120
The trainer thinks
you're really lovely.

203
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,450
(The trainer thinks
you're really lovely.)

204
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,370
The trainer thinks
you're really lovely.

205
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,190
What's going on?

206
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,500
- It's not like that.
- When Ji Hyo danced like this,

207
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,200
- he found her really adorable.
- No.

208
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,630
You made me dance
because you wanted to see it.

209
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,270
I'm not sure if they're warmed up,

210
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,910
but I do feel better now.

211
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,500
He loves her so much.

212
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,680
The trainer loves it.

213
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,920
I feel better.

214
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,790
There's something going on
between them.

215
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,180
He admitted it.

216
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,620
It did make me feel better.

217
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,560
You find her so lovely.

218
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,490
What?

219
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,800
Isn't that true?

220
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,000
That's enough.

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,450
I just saw it myself.

222
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,620
He says he saw it.

223
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,190
- Jae Suk says he saw it.
- Stop it.

224
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,240
- I don't know what will happen.
- What do you not know?

225
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,610
I'm just...

226
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,930
I saw him...

227
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,910
- smile from ear to ear.
- I find her adorable,

228
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,180
but I'll find you dead.

229
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,180
- Be careful.
- Okay.

230
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,570
All right then.

231
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,980
- Now, Suk Jin...
- He was good too.

232
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,120
You should do something.

233
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,680
- He danced to "Summer Ocean Again".
- "Summer Ocean Again".

234
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,120
He danced to "Summer Ocean Again".

235
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,310
I was really surprised.

236
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,990
Is this a talent show or what?

237
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,010
There you go.

238
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,160
Start.

239
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,800
He's cute.

240
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,300
(Smiling)

241
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,430
My goodness.

242
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,800
- He's good.
- This is nice.

243
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,370
- This is exciting.
- Good.

244
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,060
(His dance moves make
everyone want to dance together.)

245
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,240
This is nice.

246
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,910
He looks so healthy.

247
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,930
We wish you all the best.

248
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,130
All right.

249
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,440
This is exciting.

250
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,980
All right.

251
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,080
Great. Okay.

252
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,320
Korean culture is the best.

253
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,720
- Nice.
- Korean culture is the best.

254
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,860
- I love Korean culture.
- This is nice.

255
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,050
That was great.

256
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,120
- You did a good job.
- Suk Jin.

257
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,200
- Does it have moves like this?
- Sure.

258
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,000
- Does it?
- I came up with it myself.

259
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,830
- That means stars?
- Yes.

260
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,240
You're really good.

261
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,390
Thanks to you, we're all warmed up.

262
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,800
- We're warmed up.
- Before working out,

263
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,940
we're all warmed up,
and the joints are healthier now.

264
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,130
This is nice.

265
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,450
"Summer Ocean Again" is
perfect for warm-up.

266
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,350
- Someone's coming.
- What?

267
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,910
(The door opens,
and someone shows up.)

268
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,010
- My gosh.
- Hey.

269
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,380
- It's Mi Joo.
- There's Young Ji.

270
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,690
And Sang Jun.

271
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,990
(The 3 new members are
in Tiger Gym.)

272
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,990
My goodness.

273
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,020
- Hello.
- Hey.

274
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,050
- Sang Jun.
- Hello.

275
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,620
- Hello.
- Hi, Sang Jun.

276
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,420
- Hi.
- Sang Jun.

277
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,970
Hello.

278
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,500
- You look like catfish.
- What are you talking about?

279
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,840
I can tell how things will go today.

280
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,800
Now that I see the three of them,
I can tell what it will be like.

281
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,610
- This is all about laughter.
- It should be exciting.

282
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,210
I know what it will be like.

283
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,850
- We saw this, so we came here.
- We came because it's free.

284
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,640
- You saw the leaflet.
- Yes, I did.

285
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,410
Hey, Sang Jun.

286
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,480
Mi Joo and Young Ji...

287
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,750
- became stars with our show.
- That's right.

288
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,990
- Don't you think so?
- They are very grateful.

289
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,830
It's like we have
two monstrous rookies here.

290
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,050
Two monstrous rookies and a monster.

291
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,020
- He's a real monster.
- A monster.

292
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,160
By the way, I think...

293
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,130
Se Chan brings
a lot of his friends to our show.

294
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,500
My gosh. You...

295
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,630
I just realized...

296
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,260
- he brings a lot of his friends.
- Did you bring him here?

297
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,260
I did?

298
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,340
- I had no idea.
- I did it for you.

299
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,580
- I bet he recommended you.
- Go further down.

300
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,400
- All right.
- I knew it.

301
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,450
He had no reason to join our show.

302
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,080
But he...

303
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,220
- He joined us for no reason.
- Bow lower.

304
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,620
We can have Sang Jun on our show,

305
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,650
but it doesn't feel right that he's
here with Young Ji and Mi Joo.

306
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,380
- They don't seem to mix well.
- You should do a good job.

307
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,420
All right. I'd like you
to introduce yourselves.

308
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,550
- Okay.
- Young Ji.

309
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,600
I heard a video of Jong Kook doing
weightlifting gets high views.

310
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,160
So I came back...

311
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,340
before the aftereffect of
Suk Jin's vaccination is gone.

312
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,070
I'm Rapper Lee Young Ji.

313
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,110
(Young Ji came back
before Suk Jin's 2nd shot.)

314
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,440
Hello.

315
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,110
I used to be an idol artist...

316
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,900
I mean, I was an idol trainee,
but I had nothing else to do...

317
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,140
- She's a comedienne.
- So I became a comedienne.

318
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,510
- Is she a comedienne?
- Yes.

319
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,620
- She's a comedienne?
- She is.

320
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,820
- She's a monster in variety shows,
- She's a monster.

321
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,550
but she's also a monster
in the world of empty heads.

322
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,150
- Seriously?
- She's unbelievable.

323
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,020
Mi Joo is being...

324
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,020
- trained by So Min.
- Really?

325
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,600
- She's So Min's person.
- They are together.

326
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,370
Right. She's So Min's person.

327
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,500
We are close friends.

328
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,130
- She's my minion. Attention.
- I'm not her minion.

329
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:12,800
Attention. How dare you...

330
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,870
Do squats. Spread your legs.

331
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,870
One and two.

332
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,240
- Hang on.
- Go further down.

333
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,400
She sounds strict.

334
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,580
Hey, what's that?

335
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,300
This is the old convention
that should be removed.

336
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,910
(Bowing deeply at the waist)

337
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,670
This is the old convention
that should be removed.

338
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,280
(So Min is following the old
tradition that should be removed.)

339
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,050
I don't care about what she said.

340
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,190
When I saw Mi Joo doing squats,

341
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,460
- It was shocking.
- I was astonished.

342
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,550
Why?

343
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,790
I can tell she's never...

344
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,250
A workout...

345
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,290
No.

346
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,890
Isn't this it?

347
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,700
I can tell she's never...

348
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,970
(Shutting his eyes tight)

349
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,340
- A workout...
- Isn't this it?

350
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,080
Hey! Stop it.

351
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,900
(Just like So Min, she has
brazen looks and gestures.)

352
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,250
My gosh. I like...

353
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,900
- Mi Joo's squats for variety shows.
- Hey! Stop it.

354
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,010
My goodness. Do something about her.

355
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,120
- She's Empty Head.
- She's funny.

356
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,410
- She's good.
- This is what Empty Head does.

357
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,910
- Cut it out.
- I like that she has guts.

358
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,780
- She's Empty Head.
- I'm sorry.

359
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,360
- This is a variety show squat.
- A variety show squat?

360
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,730
On a variety show,

361
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,360
this is how I do squats.

362
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,650
Do you have to touch someone
as you do squats?

363
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,150
Is this a variety show squat?

364
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,260
- I see.
- This isn't about exercise.

365
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,940
- Look at Sang Jun.
- Variety show squats.

366
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,840
Can I come back later?

367
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,530
They are getting all the spotlight.

368
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,210
I just can't mingle with them.

369
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,580
- We have nothing in common.
- Sang Jun.

370
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
- You picked the wrong day.
- I know.

371
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,850
- This is so sad.
- Because...

372
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,120
- these two are like monsters.
- My point.

373
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,250
If I leave now,

374
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,950
it will be easier to cut me off.
Maybe I should come next time.

375
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,410
(If I leave now, it will be easier
to cut me off. I should come later.)

376
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,490
Sometimes, you have to make
hard decisions in life.

377
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,620
And I support your decision.

378
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,280
- Just give it a try.
- He's quick-witted though.

379
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,730
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

380
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,660
All right. Today, we will...

381
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,260
The thing is,

382
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,890
your goal is to join
the national team.

383
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,030
(Your goal is to join
the national team.)

384
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,500
It can be any even though.

385
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,940
As you know,

386
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,270
I've trained all sorts of athletes.

387
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,080
- That's true.
- Athletes of all kinds.

388
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,620
Actually, he taught
Son Heung Min soccer.

389
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,770
- Really?
- No.

390
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,010
(He is
Son Heung Min's soccer teacher.)

391
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,320
He also taught Park Ji Sung soccer.

392
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,380
That's a misunderstanding.

393
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,690
- It's not a misunderstanding.
- I didn't teach them soccer.

394
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,620
I taught them
other kinds of exercises.

395
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,090
Anyway, he's the best expert
in exercise.

396
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,460
- He's the best in the world.
- All sports...

397
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,000
- share the same basics.
- That's right.

398
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,230
So I will teach you
the basics of exercise.

399
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,790
Who's the man in the blue cap?

400
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,200
- Why do you keep meddling?
- Why are you butting in?

401
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,300
Hey, stay quiet.

402
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,370
Suk Jin, you should fight him.

403
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,610
You punks, how dare you...

404
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,030
- What?
- I'm scared.

405
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,870
What was that?

406
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,980
My gosh.

407
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,220
(The members are having
a hand-to-hand fight.)

408
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,320
Hang on.

409
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,590
- Hey.
- Wait.

410
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,010
The three of you, come on out.

411
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,510
- Come here.
- Me?

412
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,960
Come over here.

413
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,990
- Rotten player, come over here.
- Why me?

414
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,890
You can't fight
with other members in my gym.

415
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,100
- You shouldn't fight.
- I just got hit.

416
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,570
- I'll let them go run a lap.
- That's good.

417
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,160
(I'll let them go run a lap.)

418
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,700
- Who is he?
- What do you think you are?

419
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,400
Who do you think you are?

420
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,970
- I can't believe this guy.
- Jae Suk.

421
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,480
- Who is he?
- Do you see the wall over there?

422
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,170
- Go touch the wall.
- Okay.

423
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,710
- In a line.
- Stand in a line.

424
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,800
What's wrong with him?

425
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,040
Why are we listening to him?

426
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,750
Start with the left foot.

427
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,410
One, two.

428
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,850
Why are we following his directions?

429
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,050
Left foot.

430
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,510
They are walking.

431
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,460
(One and two)

432
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,550
Okay.

433
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,050
- That was nice.
- Isn't that nice?

434
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,100
- It's nice.
- All right.

435
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,120
Pull yourselves together.

436
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,730
Let's move on.

437
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,030
- Trainer Kook, can I drink water?
- What?

438
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,370
- Cool water.
- No, you can't.

439
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,300
I'm talking to the trainer.

440
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,740
I'm talking to the trainer.

441
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,850
- I asked the trainer.
- No, you can't.

442
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,540
You should be patient
when you work out.

443
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,040
Trainer Kook, look at him.

444
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,720
(The old member opened the fridge
without the trainer's permission.)

445
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,140
- It's okay.
- The old member...

446
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,550
I'm not one of them.

447
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,380
(He carefully claims
a special favor for the elders.)

448
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,550
I'm not one of them.

449
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,500
(He carefully claims
a special favor for the elders.)

450
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,100
Hey.

451
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,100
What on earth are you talking about?

452
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,370
- Hey.
- You're being ridiculous.

453
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,000
He wouldn't let me drink, so...

454
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,160
Put it back in.

455
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,260
My goodness.

456
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,610
- We can drink this, right?
- That's okay.

457
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,370
This is okay, right?
We can drink this.

458
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,900
- Come here and drink some water.
- Drink water, guys.

459
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,210
Hey. Is this...

460
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,450
a prison camp or something?

461
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,670
There aren't so many things
we can't do.

462
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,720
- Seriously...
- Is this a prison camp or what?

463
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,410
(Trainer Kook wouldn't
even let them drink water.)

464
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,850
(So it was hard for them
to relieve their thirst.)

465
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,780
Listen while you're drinking.

466
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,590
Today, we have Trainer Kook
who is trying to revive Tiger Gym...

467
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,730
by fostering good athletes...

468
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,620
and the members who joined the gym
just because it's free.

469
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,790
It's called Trainer Jong Kook
and National Team Race.

470
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,870
The nine players will participate
in many different competitions,

471
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,110
and their goal is to collect
prize money from each competition.

472
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,710
The player
with the most prize money...

473
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,450
will receive a special benefit.

474
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,540
- Only one person.
- So it's an individual game.

475
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,770
Trainer Kook will participate
in competitions like the players,

476
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,780
but he can't win the prize money.

477
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,360
However, the athletes may give him
some of the prize money...

478
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,590
- as a membership fee.
- That's great.

479
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,230
Trainer Kook also needs enough money
to get a benefit...

480
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,460
- that helps to win.
- I see.

481
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,730
The winner of each round receives
prize money.

482
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,570
You can give Trainer Kook
as much money as you want from it.

483
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,570
The person who saves the most money
from the prize money...

484
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,630
receives a special benefit.

485
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,630
Trainer Kook has to get as much
membership fee as possible...

486
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,530
- to get a great benefit.
- Oh, I see.

487
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,370
Also, during the race,

488
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,040
Trainer Kook can train the members
whenever he wants.

489
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
(Trainer Kook can train the members
whenever he wants.)

490
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,850
- That's great.
- Indeed.

491
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,320
- It's good.
- Director.

492
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,250
That man in a blue cap doesn't have
any authority, right?

493
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,280
- Is it a corrupt relationship?
- Tell us the truth.

494
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,550
Young Ji just said
we're in a corrupt relationship.

495
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,750
- I see you've been studying.
- No.

496
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,020
I guess she's been watching
the news lately.

497
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,630
There will be a captain like him
by Trainer Kook's side.

498
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,530
- "A captain"?
- Great.

499
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,940
Change your clothes and come back
for the captain election.

500
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,170
- Okay.
- We're going to elect the captain.

501
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,610
(The Captain Election)

502
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,510
Now we're going to elect the captain
who will be...

503
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,250
Trainer Kook's right-hand man
and his pet.

504
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,050
- Are we going to elect the captain?
- Yes.

505
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,960
All of you except for Trainer Kook
are candidates.

506
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,850
You'll have time to prepare
for your election speeches.

507
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,460
And then the voting will begin.

508
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,170
Each of you has 1 vote
whereas Trainer Kook has 5 votes.

509
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,440
- That's how... Yes.
- He has five votes?

510
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,500
- Hold on.
- That's really great.

511
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,970
- Was that a complaint?
- Can't he have more votes?

512
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,940
- No, I wasn't complaining.
- Right?

513
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,210
I'll tell you the benefits
that the captain has.

514
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,250
The captain will get 100 dollars
as congratulatory money.

515
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,380
- Really?
- Yes.

516
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,610
- One hundred dollars?
- And the captain will be exempt...

517
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,840
from the training that begins
whenever Trainer Kook pleases.

518
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,310
- Oh, my.
- That's a great benefit.

519
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,110
- Indeed.
- That's amazing.

520
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,160
- The captain will be exempt?
- The first one is chosen by voting,

521
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,190
but after that,

522
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,900
Trainer Kook can replace the captain
as he wants.

523
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,460
- Really?
- Also,

524
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,130
you get an additional 100 dollars...

525
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,530
if you don't get replaced
until the next round.

526
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,830
- Okay.
- We know what type he likes.

527
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,800
- I wonder what type he likes.
- What type does he like?

528
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,770
Since this is a variety show,
the captain should be funny.

529
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,210
- A good sense of humor.
- Then I'm not confident.

530
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,540
I also want the captain
to take working out seriously...

531
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,010
and to be loyal.

532
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,540
- These are important to me.
- The captain should be loyal?

533
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,540
Yes.

534
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,250
Are we electing someone to be
his dog or something? Why loyalty?

535
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,750
- You see, Trainer Kook.
- Yes?

536
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,820
I understand everything else,
but loyalty doesn't sound...

537
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,430
I mean why must the captain
be loyal to you?

538
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,850
Step forward, please.

539
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,670
(Step forward, please.)

540
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,630
- This is great.
- Come on.

541
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,640
(Blue Cap has been called out
while complaining.)

542
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,830
- Hurry up and step forward.
- Oh, gosh.

543
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,210
Stop. Go back to your seat now.

544
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,070
Sit down. Come on.

545
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,910
Gosh, you guys won't even look me
in the eyes.

546
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,480
- Hey, Mi Joo.
- Sit down.

547
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,840
- Young Ji. Hey, So Min.
- He's a stranger to me now.

548
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,150
- You can do whatever you want.
- How can you guys do this to me?

549
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,040
- Sit down. Now, come forward.
- This is ridiculous.

550
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,110
Come forward.

551
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,580
Yes, sir.

552
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,850
Do you think
that loyalty is important or not...

553
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,630
- for the captain?
- I believe it's important.

554
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,790
- It's important, right?
- Yes.

555
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,970
It's such a simple matter,
and you complained about it.

556
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,970
- You shouldn't do that.
- I knew you would be in trouble.

557
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,440
- Understood.
- You may go back to your seat.

558
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,000
- Yes, sir. It won't happen again.
- Okay.

559
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,600
In a nutshell,
we're electing his minion.

560
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,140
The captain will get a benefit.

561
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,540
It's reasonable.
You also get 100 dollars each round.

562
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,540
We won't just make you work.

563
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,480
You'll be paid fairly.

564
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,190
Sir, I'm done writing.

565
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,750
Oh, I see.
Hey, you wrote a lot of stuff.

566
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,420
- I'll show you my loyalty.
- I'm sorry, but is it...

567
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,850
- Should I go first?
- Is it a letter of apology?

568
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,850
- Pardon me?
- Is it a letter of apology?

569
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,320
- No, it's not.
- Really?

570
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,550
- It's true. I...
- That was so fast.

571
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,160
I bet he wrote all the things
that can please Trainer Kook.

572
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,760
- What's that?
- I didn't have to think about it.

573
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,260
- It took me only 30 seconds.
- How did you finish so quickly?

574
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,530
- That's amazing.
- Since I respect you,

575
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,380
- I just wrote down my feelings.
- I see.

576
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,380
- It was easy.
- You used difficult words...

577
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,380
and wrote in different colors...

578
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,000
Then I'll go first, sir.

579
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,210
Hey, I'll go first.

580
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,450
- I'll go first.
- I'll go first, sir.

581
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,610
- That's good.
- I'll go first, sir.

582
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,750
- It's a good attitude.
- I'll go first, sir.

583
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,220
I'll remember your passion.

584
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,580
- I'll go first, sir.
- Let me go first, sir.

585
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,010
Great. Then...

586
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,420
- Pro can go first.
- Yes, sir.

587
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,020
But I finished before he did.
What is wrong with you?

588
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,320
- What is wrong with me?
- I'm sorry.

589
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,430
- Come forward.
- I'm sorry.

590
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,670
- I said, come forward. Now.
- I'm sorry. It wasn't like that.

591
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,020
- Hurry up. Run.
- Come forward.

592
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,630
- I finished writing before he did.
- Stop talking.

593
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,060
Do ten squats. Ready, go. One.

594
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,830
Lower. That's two. Three.

595
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,500
- Three, four, five,
- That's how you should do squats.

596
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,640
- six, seven...
- That doesn't count.

597
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,600
- Squat lower than that.
- He's doing it wrong.

598
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,770
- Lower.
- Six, seven.

599
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,650
- Hold on. Stop.
- Yes.

600
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,310
- The way you're doing squats...
- Yes.

601
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,610
is how elderly people do squats.

602
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,840
You mean jumping as I come up?

603
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,850
- No. I mean the angle.
- I see.

604
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,660
- That's perfect for elderly people.
- Really?

605
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,750
How did you know that?

606
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,250
Well, I wasn't aiming to do it
at a particular angle.

607
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,760
I'm sure that the energy I got
from you helped me. Ten.

608
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,530
- It's a good method for your body.
- Thank you.

609
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,440
- Good job.
- Sir, then I'll begin...

610
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,360
- my speech.
- Sure. Go ahead.

611
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,860
First of all, I'd like to say...

612
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,330
that I'm honored to be the first
to give a speech...

613
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,250
as a candidate for the captain
who will put our team together.

614
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,040
That's great.

615
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
(He sounds disciplined
as a captain candidate should.)

616
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,010
- I like your attitude.
- Thank you, sir.

617
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,420
- Then I'll begin my speech.
- All right.

618
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,420
(The ambitious candidate
Jae Suk's promises)

619
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,130
"My Oath".

620
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,190
"Oath".

621
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,960
First, if I become the captain...

622
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,570
I will give away 90 dollars to you.

623
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,730
- That's a good one.
- That's tempting.

624
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,780
Second...

625
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,780
(Second!)

626
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,900
I'll make sure everyone gets
a buzz cut to unify the team.

627
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,080
(To make sure everyone has
a buzz cut to unify the team)

628
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,790
Hey.

629
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,050
- We'll show the power of unity...
- What is that?

630
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,020
- by having the same buzz cut.
- Great.

631
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,090
- That's a good idea.
- We'll have to get haircuts?

632
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,980
- A buzz cut?
- Third,

633
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,920
we will get rid of hierarchy,

634
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,990
so the youngest will be treated
with the highest respect.

635
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,130
- Great.
- I like that.

636
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,340
- I should vote for him.
- We should all vote for him.

637
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,230
- This is a promise to Trainer Kook.
- All right.

638
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,640
I promise I will never talk about
Yoon Eun Hye.

639
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,440
(I will never talk
about Yoon Eun Hye.)

640
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,610
I promise...

641
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,280
From now on,

642
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,320
I will never even bring up
her name again.

643
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,560
You just said her name four times.

644
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,910
I mean I won't do it again
in the future.

645
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,950
I'm saying this to show you
how determined I am.

646
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,450
Fifth,

647
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,100
there will be no romance
between the gym members.

648
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,070
To help everyone focus
solely on the training,

649
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,490
I'll make sure
to tell Trainer Kook...

650
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,870
- I don't like that.
- if there are any romantic vibes.

651
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,340
I like that one.

652
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,540
- Sixth,
- Okay.

653
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,110
I'll provide you
with vitamin drinks...

654
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,670
and get product placement
for our show.

655
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,410
We'll need money to get a vehicle...

656
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,380
- for the gym members, right?
- That's great.

657
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,910
- That's all.
- That's interesting.

658
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,620
My, that was fun.

659
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,120
- Thank you, sir.
- Good job.

660
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,480
I think he can get many votes
from the gym members.

661
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,600
But he didn't say much
about how he'll assist me.

662
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,220
- Who will go next?
- Yes.

663
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,030
- I'll go next.
- I'll go next, sir.

664
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,930
All right. So Min,
come forward to deliver your speech.

665
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:52,930
When will it be my turn?

666
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,040
Wait for a while.

667
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,930
- It's not fair.
- Just wait.

668
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,140
What's the rush?

669
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,470
Hello. I'm candidate number two,
Jeon So Min.

670
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,210
You may think that I'm too weak
and not good enough to be a captain.

671
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,910
- So I'll tell you about myself.
- Great.

672
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,290
Here are the things about me
that you should know.

673
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,020
My father is the coach and player
of a morning soccer club.

674
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,590
- He played soccer in high school.
- What is that?

675
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,220
- Your father played soccer?
- Why would you talk about him?

676
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,920
My younger brother
majored in taekwondo.

677
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,990
He's a fitness trainer now.
He won several fitness competitions.

678
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,830
- He works as a trainer currently.
- He sounds similar to me.

679
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,430
My mother has been doing
aerobic dance for ten years.

680
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,110
My uncle has been playing tennis
for more than ten years...

681
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,170
and is a morning soccer club member,
playing an important position.

682
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,810
My aunt majored in
traditional Korean dance.

683
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,000
My great-aunt won
several singing contests...

684
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,120
and worked as a singing instructor
for housewives for over ten years.

685
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,440
And my aunt on my mother's side...

686
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,290
enjoys different sports
including cycling and hiking.

687
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,330
- I have a question.
- Yes.

688
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,130
- Your entire family seems...
- Yes.

689
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,720
to be quite athletic.

690
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,390
- Then why are you so bad at sports?
- Then why...

691
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,830
- She doesn't have what it takes.
- I agree.

692
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,040
- I'll do my best. Thank you.
- Good job. Go back to your seat.

693
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,540
- She's not captain material.
- Right.

694
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,930
Especially, she has a soft spot
for love.

695
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,170
- That's true.
- Yes.

696
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,470
I'm the best when it comes to love.

697
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,240
- That's not true.
- She's the worst.

698
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,710
All right. Who wants to go next?

699
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,320
I think it's time for me
to deliver my speech.

700
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,710
- I'll go next.
- All right.

701
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,820
- Thank you.
- Darn it!

702
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,530
- One, two. Here we go.
- Gosh, seriously.

703
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,180
It's Yang Ssaebssaeb's turn.

704
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,920
(Captain Candidate, Yang Se Chan)

705
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,720
- I'll be your dog.
- Okay.

706
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,070
I can't believe him.

707
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,270
- Paw.
- You won't get any votes from us.

708
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,570
- None of us will vote for you.
- I'll make realistic promises.

709
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,040
- Okay.
- First,

710
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,730
if anyone acts up,
I'll take off his glasses...

711
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,380
- and slap him in the face.
- Okay.

712
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,320
The few members who wear glasses
have been acting up.

713
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,410
- They've been acting up.
- He's the worst.

714
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,290
- You refer to specific members.
- If any of them acts up,

715
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,850
I'll slap him in the face at once...

716
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,020
- to stop him.
- I can imagine that.

717
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,890
- It's a realistic promise.
- Okay.

718
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,180
- Second,
- Yes.

719
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,180
as the captain,

720
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,360
I promise I'll become
Trainer Kook's mad dog.

721
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,690
I'll bite and bark
as you tell me to.

722
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,890
Okay.

723
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,600
- Hey, but...
- He's the worst.

724
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,370
That's what you always do.

725
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,810
Hey, do you really want to live
like that?

726
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,000
Third... This one is
really practical.

727
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,280
From 100 dollars
of the congratulatory money,

728
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,200
I'll give Trainer Kook 50 dollars...

729
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,240
and ten dollars to Mi Joo, Young Ji,
So Min, and Sang Jun each.

730
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,850
I'll keep ten dollars for myself.

731
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,740
I promise I'll give you the money.

732
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,790
- You promise?
- He abandoned us.

733
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,860
- That's tempting.
- I'll take care of you guys.

734
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,120
I promise. You can trust me.

735
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,480
- I don't think he's lying.
- That's great.

736
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,090
- That's the worst.
- Last but not least,

737
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,250
if you vote for me,

738
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,750
I'll transfer 50 dollars
to your account...

739
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,630
- right after the election.
- What?

740
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,990
- Real money?
- I'll give you 50 dollars.

741
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,430
- Are you serious?
- For me,

742
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,600
you'll have to find an ATM.

743
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,610
(You'll have to find an ATM.)

744
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,270
I still don't use Internet banking.

745
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,610
- Start using it. It's convenient.
- The same goes for me.

746
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,970
- I...
- Why?

747
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,580
- I'll need mine in cash.
- Same here.

748
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,170
These are the realistic promises
I make to you.

749
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,470
- They really are realistic.
- Yes.

750
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,140
- Those are all realistic.
- Okay.

751
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,290
I like his promises.

752
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,850
- Those are all realistic.
- Yes.

753
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,710
- You may go back to your seat.
- Will you really give us the money?

754
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,320
Will you really give us 50 dollars?

755
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,390
He's losing his chance to win
the election.

756
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,190
- I should've gone first...
- He's losing his chance.

757
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,870
- You should hurry up.
- Okay. Next.

758
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,870
- Who's next?
- Will you go next?

759
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,390
- I'll go next, sir.
- Good. Go ahead.

760
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,100
Come forward.

761
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,140
The promises they made are similar
to one another's.

762
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,310
- I won't make lots of promises.
- He's at least consistent.

763
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,380
- I believe the mindset is the key.
- By the way...

764
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,200
- That's what matters most.
- Dr. Oh Eun Young is here.

765
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,620
- Dr. Oh.
- She looks like Dr. Oh.

766
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,890
- So... This is what I wrote.
- Okay.

767
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,240
Let's check it out. "Tiger Gym".

768
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,150
- "Tiger Gym. These are..."
- What's this?

769
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,250
- "my promises to Trainer Kook."
- She drew a tiger.

770
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,590
Is that a poster or something?

771
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,630
Maybe that's what she calls him.

772
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,330
Hey, do you think
that's good enough?

773
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,890
- Be quiet.
- Go on.

774
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,990
- I'll continue.
- Yes.

775
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,190
"I respect you. I love you.
I'm grateful to you."

776
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,270
She said she loves him.

777
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,900
- She loves him.
- Oh, my.

778
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,070
- Continue.
- Just ignore what they said.

779
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,580
"I respect you. I love you.
I'm grateful to you."

780
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:56,050
- Thank you.
- "With this mindset,"

781
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,380
"I'll serve Trainer Kook
and all the gym members."

782
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,670
And there's more.

783
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,410
"Song Ji Hyo,
the perfect candidate..."

784
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,710
"to be Trainer Kook's
right-hand person".

785
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,150
- All right.
- She thinks she'd be the best...

786
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,680
- Of course.
- As his right-hand person.

787
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,290
- It's because she's right-handed.
- It's simple. I like the drawing.

788
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,890
- You put so much effort into it.
- You know...

789
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,360
Trainer Kook seems to find her
so adorable.

790
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,420
(The man in the blue cap
couldn't hold back.)

791
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,340
- Come forward.
- I mean... Seriously.

792
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,990
- Come forward.
- If anyone acts up,

793
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,070
- I'll slap him in the face.
- Come.

794
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,610
- If you just let me, I'll slap him.
- But it's true.

795
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,470
He looked at Ji Hyo
with so much affection. Didn't he?

796
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,840
- Come forward.
- I could see that.

797
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,700
- Right? You could see that.
- That's true.

798
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,520
- Sit down.
- I don't really care about you two.

799
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,880
Just sit down.

800
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,410
- Do squats.
- Sit down.

801
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,850
Sit down. Hands on your ears.

802
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,890
My gosh.

803
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,790
- Go touch the wall and come back.
- He gets all types of penalties.

804
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,250
- Trainer Kook.
- Yes?

805
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,890
You can't make me do that
on a variety show.

806
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,480
- Touch the wall and come back.
- Just do it already.

807
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,600
- This is good exercise.
- Just do it.

808
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,270
Sang Jun came on a variety show
after a long time.

809
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,420
Go now.

810
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,890
- My junior comedians...
- I...

811
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,100
I respect you.

812
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,270
Our senior comedian
whom we respect...

813
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,500
Do you always do things like this
on your shows?

814
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,070
- Go on now.
- My gosh.

815
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,610
- Go.
- Keep going.

816
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,110
- That's good. You're doing well.
- Keep going.

817
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,200
- Make him imitate a duck too.
- Good.

818
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,400
- Make him imitate a duck.
- Right.

819
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,470
- I feel bad for him.
- Imitate a duck while doing it.

820
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,320
- What does a duck say?
- Quack.

821
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,890
- What does a duck say?
- Quack.

822
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,250
- I feel bad for him.
- I said the truth. Why is it wrong?

823
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,860
- Come on. Keep moving.
- It's humiliating.

824
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,590
- Hurry.
- Okay. I'm moving.

825
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,420
- You may stand up now.
- Yes, sir.

826
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,690
He's taken aback.

827
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,630
- Don't make unnecessary remarks.
- I won't do that, sir.

828
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,600
- Okay. Go back to your seat.
- Yes, sir.

829
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,990
- You did an excellent job.
- I'll go next, sir.

830
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,640
- All right. Mi Joo will go next.
- Go for it, Mi Joo.

831
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,040
Okay. Nice.

832
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,770
- Mi Joo is So Min's person.
- With light steps

833
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,430
(Hopping)

834
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,670
(The next candidate is cheesy
just like So Min.)

835
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,350
I like how she's making
her entrance.

836
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,140
I like it very much.

837
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,320
- Let's go.
- Is she So Min's person?

838
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,350
(I was born)

839
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,350
(As a man)

840
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,790
- You're not a man.
- I have a lot to do as a man

841
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,360
- Nice.
- Here we go

842
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,320
- She's good at it.
- Hello.

843
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,390
I'm candidate... It's 1, 2, 3...
I'm candidate number 7,

844
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,590
- Candidate number seven.
- Lee Mi Joo.

845
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,190
- What's that?
- It says "Mom" and "Dad".

846
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,190
- Is your father a PE teacher?
- Yes.

847
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,070
My mom and dad got married
and had me.

848
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,870
And my dad is...

849
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,300
- a PE teacher.
- That's true.

850
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,300
- That's the truth.
- Yes.

851
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,540
- He's a real PE teacher.
- Really?

852
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,640
An athlete's blood runs
through my veins...

853
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,610
- in my body.
- Right.

854
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,280
- I'll donate my blood. Go ahead.
- All right. Done.

855
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,470
- He played along with that.
- Done.

856
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,350
(He played along with her joke.)

857
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,480
- He played along with that.
- I can't believe it.

858
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,680
- He played along with that?
- Why?

859
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,180
- That's not fair.
- Hey...

860
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,790
- But she... Why?
- I can't believe him.

861
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,790
- How could you do that?
- It was funny. She did well.

862
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,150
- I can't believe you just did that.
- "Done."

863
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,220
She was funny.

864
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,420
Why would you eat her blood?

865
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,890
- I tasted her blood.
- Why would you do that?

866
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,870
She does have an athlete's blood
running through her veins.

867
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,690
I'm so upset. I can't believe
he played along with that.

868
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,810
It took me four years
to get that reaction from him.

869
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,000
- You taught me well.
- He's the worst.

870
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,230
- It took her 4 years.
- It took me 4 years.

871
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,380
I can do push-ups.

872
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,880
- I've learned archery too.
- Really?

873
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,350
- I've played volleyball too.
- Volleyball?

874
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,410
- I've played basketball too.
- Nice.

875
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,940
I'm good at every sport.

876
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,050
Are you good at playing
foot volleyball?

877
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,120
As for foot volleyball...

878
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,210
I'll learn fast
because I'm athletic.

879
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,290
- She was born athletic.
- I can learn fast.

880
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,390
- Exactly.
- My stance is good, right?

881
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,250
I can do it right away.
If you trust me and choose me...

882
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,030
But why did you release the bow,
not the arrow?

883
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,690
- Exactly.
- Wouldn't it hit your face?

884
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,540
You'd probably get hit by the bow.

885
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
That's funny.

886
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,140
Mi Joo is really bad at sports.

887
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,080
Mi Joo is not athletic at all.

888
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,700
Then which part do I release?

889
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,170
You should release the arrow
like this.

890
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,280
If you release the bow,
it would hit you in the face.

891
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,280
I can do that.

892
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,180
- Did you see that?
- "Then which part do I release?"

893
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,240
That's not good.

894
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,560
Do the "Pick Me" dance.

895
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,980
- Pardon me?
- Do the "Pick Me" dance.

896
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,060
- Oh, right.
- The "Pick Me" dance.

897
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,680
I'd appreciate it
if you vote for me.

898
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,060
(She starts dancing so suddenly.)

899
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,300
(Dancing excitedly)

900
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,420
(Her dance moves won
the voters' hearts.)

901
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,890
That's great. Keep going.

902
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,160
(Her dance moves won
the voters' hearts.)

903
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,270
(She's dancing in double time
to redeem herself.)

904
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,610
- That's great.
- Look at her.

905
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,500
I think her pelvis just popped.

906
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,670
- She's amazing.
- Thank you.

907
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,080
(She finishes with a 90-degree bow.)

908
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,080
(Impressed)

909
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,050
- Thank you.
- That was unexpected.

910
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,020
- She's so good at it.
- Great job.

911
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,890
You see... She does seem...

912
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,790
- like So Min's person.
- Yes.

913
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,860
- But she's an upgraded version.
- That's right.

914
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,530
- I'll go next.
- Okay.

915
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,690
- I'll keep it short.
- Okay.

916
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,070
- I wrote it from my heart.
- Good.

917
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,800
- Didn't you go already?
- What?

918
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,390
- What's that?
- Although...

919
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,200
Oh, gosh.

920
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,970
(What did he write
with such neat handwriting?)

921
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,280
- He's sad.
- My gosh.

922
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,240
- What's the matter?
- Don't do that.

923
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,140
- What's wrong?
- I grew up in an unhappy family...

924
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,670
What's this?

925
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,590
- He's appealing to pity.
- What is he doing now?

926
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,180
I like it
when he does things like this.

927
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,480
- I see what's going on.
- I like this.

928
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,320
- Go on.
- He's trying to gain sympathy.

929
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,520
(He's asking for votes
while wrinkling his nose.)

930
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,980
What? Why? Go away.

931
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,750
- Stop it. Don't rip it.
- Why?

932
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,250
- Go on.
- What? Why? Go away.

933
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,770
(Jae Suk came to stop him
from using pity.)

934
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,490
- Hey.
- Let go of me.

935
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,340
- Mister.
- Why? Hey.

936
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,370
- What's wrong with him?
- Kick him out.

937
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,870
- Calm down.
- How dare he...

938
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,640
- use pity to win votes?
- He's using pity.

939
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,970
- How dare you?
- With a sad story,

940
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,380
- he's appealing to pity.
- You can't use pity to get votes.

941
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,110
- Let's hear him out.
- I didn't make up this story.

942
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,620
All right. We'll hear you out.

943
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,140
It's a true story.
As Trainer Kook...

944
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,980
- and some others know...
- Yes.

945
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,090
I didn't grow up in a happy family.

946
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,320
(I didn't grow up
in a happy family.)

947
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,980
- I really like this.
- My mom and dad...

948
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,180
That's right. My dad went broke.

949
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,360
(My mom and dad...
That's right. My dad went broke.)

950
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,890
- You punk.
- Come on. Stop it.

951
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,490
What's wrong with you?

952
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,890
- Go away.
- Don't do that.

953
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,070
Leave me alone.

954
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,640
- He hates it when Haha does that.
- I really hate it.

955
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,140
- "Don't appeal to pity."
- Some of us like it...

956
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,380
- when he does that.
- Take this seriously.

957
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,400
You all made empty promises.
Is it my turn now?

958
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,610
It's over.

959
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,050
He says it's over.

960
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,240
(The speech time is over.)

961
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,410
- What about me?
- We heard everyone's promises.

962
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,620
It's time to vote.

963
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,980
Yes. Let's begin voting.

964
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,680
- Hey.
- We'll wrap things up here.

965
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,590
- But I haven't...
- Please sit.

966
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,360
- These are incredible promises.
- Sit down, please.

967
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,220
- Just get a close-up shot of it.
- You'll regret this.

968
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,300
Take a picture of it
and post it on social media.

969
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,360
- Assistant Administrator,
- Yes?

970
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,490
you can go ahead
and give your speech.

971
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,490
- Right. Go ahead.
- What did you call me?

972
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,870
- "Assistant Administrator".
- "Assistant Administrator"?

973
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,800
- Assistant Administrator.
- Why would you call me that?

974
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,870
Let's hear it.

975
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,770
Actually,

976
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,500
I finished writing this
in only 30 seconds.

977
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,810
- But...
- That sounds half-hearted.

978
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,400
He didn't give me a chance.

979
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,500
- Because you were half-hearted.
- I realized...

980
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,580
that I wrote everything
that the others already said.

981
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,580
(I realized that I wrote everything
that the others already said.)

982
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,480
"I'll be your dog."
And everything else.

983
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,590
He's so cute.

984
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,060
"My only hope is to become
your minion."

985
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,360
I wrote all the stuff they said.
Seriously.

986
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,530
(As he goes on complaining,)

987
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,950
(the voters started losing
their interest.)

988
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,570
So I got rid of it
and wrote a new one.

989
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,870
I thought...

990
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,640
- that I would...
- We're dying from boredom.

991
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,230
(One of them even fainted.)

992
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,400
(Slipping)

993
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,440
- Oh, gosh. Let's just vote for him.
- All right.

994
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,140
- Let's vote for him. It's not over?
- Hey.

995
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,850
I summarized what I wanted to say
on one piece of paper.

996
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,380
Check this out.

997
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,290
If I become the class president...

998
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,890
(If I become the class president...)

999
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,910
"Class president"?

1000
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,980
(If I become the class president...)

1001
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,060
He said "class president".
It's "captain".

1002
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,560
My gosh.
"If I become the class president"?

1003
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,570
- We're not at school.
- "If I become the class president"?

1004
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,890
- That's it.
- "Class president"?

1005
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,690
- It's not a class president.
- Hey.

1006
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,200
- Is it a class president campaign?
- Yes.

1007
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,900
The class president election is held
in the next building.

1008
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,430
Hey, stop it.

1009
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,780
- You should go...
- "Captain" or "class president"...

1010
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,170
- They're all the same.
- No.

1011
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,610
He doesn't know
what he's running for.

1012
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,210
- "Class president"?
- Take him out.

1013
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,740
If you vote for me,

1014
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,240
I'll put my apartment in Jamwon-dong
under your name.

1015
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,120
- Come on. That's a lie.
- As if.

1016
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,290
- Are you serious?
- That's nonsense.

1017
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,890
- Who will receive it?
- It's a lie.

1018
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,690
He said "class president" too.
I can't believe him.

1019
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,250
You should've given me
the chance sooner.

1020
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,400
They already made the promises
that I came up with.

1021
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,290
- Go back to your seat, please.
- "Class president"?

1022
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,440
- Gosh, seriously.
- He's running for class president.

1023
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,100
He's running for class president.

1024
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,940
"If I become the class president..."

1025
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,400
- Hey.
- Yes?

1026
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,310
Let's begin voting.

1027
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,640
We'll hand out the ballots.

1028
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,940
- Good.
- You came to the wrong place.

1029
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,940
(Trainer Kook has 5 votes.)

1030
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,980
Good.

1031
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,710
- Am I allowed to write my own name?
- No.

1032
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,940
I can't vote for myself, right?

1033
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,690
- It's not allowed, right?
- I think that Se Chan...

1034
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,080
It's important to choose
the right side.

1035
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,730
It'll be a disaster
if Se Chan gets chosen.

1036
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,330
Who we vote for matters,

1037
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,560
- but not as much as our trainer's.
- Exactly.

1038
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,900
- He has the power.
- He has a total of five votes.

1039
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,600
- It'll show who he's fond of.
- I didn't vote for only one person.

1040
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,830
I'm putting my faith in you.

1041
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,940
(They all cast their votes.)

1042
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,100
I'm putting my faith in you.

1043
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,080
- All right.
- I'll mark the votes.

1044
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,170
- You...
- Yes?

1045
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,500
- It suits you.
- So...

1046
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,940
You know how it's done, right?

1047
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,080
(Sang Jun will help
count the votes.)

1048
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,540
- All right. Yoo Jae Suk.
- What...

1049
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,980
Did you hear him just now?

1050
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,120
Yoo Jae Suk.

1051
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,150
Me?

1052
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,520
Thank you.

1053
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,790
I'll do my best.

1054
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,020
Put your faith in me.

1055
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,980
- He's acting like he already won.
- Okay!

1056
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,020
- Hold on a second.
- Is it Jae Suk?

1057
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,520
- Is it Sang Jun?
- Yoo Jae Suk.

1058
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,770
(The second vote
also goes to Yoo Jae Suk.)

1059
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,600
- Everyone.
- This is bad.

1060
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,170
- Hold on.
- I'll get the job done.

1061
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,770
- How did you win them over?
- I'll be of service.

1062
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,170
I'll get it done.

1063
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,210
- What is it?
- Is it Jae Suk?

1064
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,500
Why...

1065
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,810
Again?

1066
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,540
- Jeon So Min.
- What?

1067
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,420
(Jeon So Min, 1 vote)

1068
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,690
Someone wasted their vote.

1069
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,810
It's as good as not voting.

1070
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,060
- You can't write your own name.
- No way!

1071
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,460
Who was it?

1072
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,710
- Who was it?
- But...

1073
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,120
- Who...
- Who was it?

1074
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,790
- You two...
- You and Mi Joo...

1075
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,560
Did you write each others' names?

1076
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,960
- Seriously?
- What is it?

1077
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,100
(Seriously?)

1078
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,520
I went about this all wrong.

1079
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,620
- Who is it?
- It must be Jae Suk.

1080
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,790
Is it Jae Suk?

1081
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,140
(Who got the vote
that startled the trainer?)

1082
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,230
It must be Jae Suk.

1083
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,540
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Yes!

1084
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,940
He must've bought the votes.

1085
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,770
- This is bad.
- Everyone...

1086
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,770
Us?

1087
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,350
- Did you buy the votes?
- I'll keep my word,

1088
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:25,310
- so don't worry.
- I wasn't expecting this.

1089
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,810
It's why you had to be smart
with your five votes.

1090
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,350
Things have taken a weird turn.

1091
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,120
He'll suffocate us all
if he's the captain.

1092
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,980
- Hold on a second.
- Yoo Jae Suk!

1093
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,890
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Yoo Jae Suk!

1094
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,150
- Nice!
- Yoo Jae Suk.

1095
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,650
- You wasted your five votes.
- Jong Kook...

1096
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,420
must not have wanted this.

1097
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,600
(He opens the next ballot.)

1098
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,400
It must be Jae Suk. He must've won.

1099
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,370
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

1100
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,460
- Why?
- You voted for Jae Suk too.

1101
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,600
Of course.

1102
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,730
- Who else would I vote for?
- Hold on.

1103
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,100
What other option did I have?

1104
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,580
(After all the complaining)

1105
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,150
What other option did I have?

1106
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,580
- Thank you.
- I had no choice.

1107
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,650
- What...
- Here you go.

1108
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,920
Come on.

1109
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,080
I mean,

1110
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,850
he made a few promises.

1111
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,620
After all the complaining you did?

1112
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,560
He promised us benefits.

1113
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,520
- Our welfare...
- He always does this.

1114
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,850
He always votes for me.

1115
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,330
He said he'd give us money.

1116
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,290
- You also voted for him.
- He promised us money.

1117
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,100
He complained endlessly...

1118
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,770
- when he had voted for me too.
- What?

1119
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,330
- Yang Se Chan.
- Yes!

1120
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,500
Trust, faith, and love.

1121
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,440
- Jong Kook adores Se Chan.
- Se Chan as captain will be bad.

1122
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,810
If he becomes the captain,
we'll be in trouble.

1123
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,000
I hope I become the trainer's pet.

1124
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,350
- Suk Jin...
- We have our top two candidates.

1125
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,750
- Yang Se Chan.
- Nice!

1126
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,920
- Young Ji...
- Of course.

1127
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,650
- Thank you, Young Ji.
- I voted for him.

1128
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,080
- Young Ji...
- Yang Se Chan.

1129
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,650
That's what I'm talking about.

1130
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,460
- The trainer's pet is coming!
- No way.

1131
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,460
It could be anyone now.

1132
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,560
Se Chan as captain
will be a disaster.

1133
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,350
- Just wait and see.
- It'll be a dictatorship.

1134
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,460
- Oh, no.
- I won't wait once I'm the captain.

1135
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,730
- He won't hesitate.
- Glasses Tribe will be annihilated.

1136
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,270
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Yes!

1137
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,640
Okay, fine.

1138
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,710
Yoo Jae Suk.

1139
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,670
(Jae Suk 5 votes, Se Chan 3 votes)

1140
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,000
- Yang Se Chan.
- Yes!

1141
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,480
Thank you, my comrades.

1142
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,520
- Yang Se Chan.
- Okay!

1143
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,480
- He's closing the gap.
- This is bad.

1144
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,150
Yoo Jae Suk.

1145
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,210
- Gosh.
- Oh, no. He's falling behind.

1146
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,480
Let's widen the gap!

1147
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,650
- There are only two votes left.
- Se Chan and...

1148
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,520
- Only two votes.
- Only two votes remain.

1149
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,400
- Wait.
- What is it?

1150
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,960
- Who is it?
- Did someone write Haha's name?

1151
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,670
It must be Se Chan.

1152
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,600
- Who is it?
- Hold on.

1153
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,540
- This...
- It can't be Se Chan.

1154
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,060
It will be a bloodbath.

1155
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,600
Just you wait!

1156
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,670
Please.

1157
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,330
(2 votes will decide
who will be captain.)

1158
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,540
Yang Se Chan.

1159
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,020
(Se Chan wins a vote.)

1160
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,980
(Jae Suk 6 votes, Se Chan 6 votes)

1161
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,040
- It'll be the end if he's captain.
- Trainer Kook...

1162
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,310
- It'll be over for us.
- Hardly.

1163
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,150
- It'll be over if it's Jae Suk.
- Trainer Kook...

1164
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,060
- Please.
- Let it be Jae Suk.

1165
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,960
- Trainer Kook.
- Let's see.

1166
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,960
(Will it be buzz cut Jae Suk...)

1167
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,960
(or Trainer Kook's loyal dog
Se Chan?)

1168
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
(The last vote will decide
who becomes captain.)

1169
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,000
Is it Jae Suk?

1170
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:09,990
Yang Se Chan.

1171
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:14,750
(Se Chan is captain!)

1172
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,430
(The result: Se Chan 7 votes,
Jae Suk 6 votes, So Min 1 vote)

1173
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,720
To the front, everyone.

1174
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,790
Gather around!

1175
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,220
That's what I'm talking about.

1176
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,160
- Trust, faith, and love.
- Nice.

1177
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,740
- Faith, love, and hope.
- Trust, faith, and love.

1178
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,970
- Young Ji, join me.
- Faith, love, and hope.

1179
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,060
Trust, faith, and love.

1180
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,000
- How did this happen?
- Thank you.

1181
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,040
- All right.
- Take off your glasses.

1182
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,580
Take out your phone and pay up.

1183
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,810
You...

1184
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,100
- Pay up.
- Come on.

1185
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,470
Where's your phone?

1186
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,120
- All right.
- I voted for you.

1187
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,350
- Hurry up.
- I voted for you.

1188
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,120
This is what happens when the one
with power favors someone.

1189
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,560
How cool is that?

1190
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,930
So Min is completely
on his side today.

1191
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,930
(Captain)

1192
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,560
- Thank you.
- That's so cool.

1193
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,330
- All right.
- The leader of the gag squad.

1194
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,270
You'll now enter
your first competition.

1195
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,100
In this first competition,

1196
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,410
you'll have to guess your ranking.

1197
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,270
It's the 2021 Guess Your Ranking
Asian Games.

1198
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,640
- Sounds like fun.
- We'll be aiming.

1199
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,080
I'm quite good at it, you know.

1200
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,370
No, this is how you shoot a rifle.

1201
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:13,410
In collaboration
with a survey center,

1202
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,120
we showed your names and faces...

1203
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,390
to people within the age range
of 10 to 69...

1204
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,950
and conducted various surveys.

1205
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,060
Your job is to guess
your own ranking.

1206
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,390
The team who guesses
more correctly will win...

1207
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,930
and receive the prize money.

1208
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,430
You can start off
by splitting into teams.

1209
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,560
- Go with those wearing spectacles.
- Spectacles?

1210
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,790
Those with spectacles.

1211
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,470
Okay, we'll go with glasses.

1212
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,200
- Who wears contact lenses?
- We'll go with Team Glasses.

1213
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,600
Join us if you've had
laser vision correction.

1214
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,680
- Join us if you've had...
- Mi Joo.

1215
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,040
- Laser vision correction.
- I wear contacts.

1216
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,750
Laser vision correction.

1217
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,910
- You?
- Yes, me.

1218
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,390
- You're one of us, right?
- She wears contacts.

1219
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,540
- She wears contacts.
- No, I have great vision.

1220
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,060
I have 12-12 vision.

1221
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,080
- Get over here.
- Come on.

1222
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,160
You wear contacts.

1223
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,180
- Okay, this will be the teams.
- Sure.

1224
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,220
We'll begin the ranking game then.

1225
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,330
- All right.
- Let's do this!

1226
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,250
(Tiger Gym)

1227
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,160
- We will see results.
- Love for Jong Kook!

1228
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,270
- Love!
- Love!

1229
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,470
Loving Jong Kook
is like loving your country.

1230
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,330
- Love!
- Love!

1231
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,660
- Love!
- Unbelievable.

1232
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:11,000
It sounds like
you're not happy at the moment.

1233
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,600
Wasn't he acting up just now?

1234
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,830
I wouldn't put it like that,

1235
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:17,080
but he is ruining the mood.

1236
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,270
- I'd appreciate it if...
- Come on, Trainer Kook.

1237
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,370
Am I not allowed
to even make sounds?

1238
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,950
Hold on a second.

1239
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,290
Why did you raise your tone
at the end?

1240
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,620
- What was that?
- That's just how I speak.

1241
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,560
You're allowed to make
any exclamations you want,

1242
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,000
but please remember
that we're a group.

1243
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,700
That's how Team Glasses speak.

1244
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,270
- He scanned you up and down.
- Did you see his gaze?

1245
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,810
You two, please stand up.

1246
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:43,270
(The bold duo
has been asked to stand.)

1247
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,700
- Get up.
- He's talking to you.

1248
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,330
You two, stand up.

1249
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,810
Get them on their feet.

1250
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:50,370
Okay, fine. Seriously.

1251
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,540
The one with glasses
sitting next to them.

1252
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,620
He should stand as well.

1253
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,180
- But I didn't say anything.
- No, you need to stand.

1254
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,490
The three of you...

1255
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,620
will be punished together
if one is out of line.

1256
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,020
Do better, all right?

1257
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,450
Put your arms around
each other's shoulders.

1258
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,490
- What?
- Is this a prison camp?

1259
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:06,330
- Is this necessary?
- You'll do ten...

1260
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,430
Quiet!

1261
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,020
I'm sorry, but can I join them...

1262
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,600
since I haven't been doing anything?

1263
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,790
- I'll join them.
- Stick to his side then.

1264
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Tell us what we did wrong.

1265
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,240
Do ten squats.

1266
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,430
Squat ten times.

1267
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:20,040
- Mi Joo should join us too.
- Why?

1268
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,750
Mi Joo can't do it
since her legs hurt.

1269
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,850
Join them.

1270
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,770
(She tried to be cute.)

1271
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,450
(But it didn't work
on Trainer Kook.)

1272
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,180
- He hates that the most.
- Put your arms around each other.

1273
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,810
- He loathes it.
- Got it.

1274
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,750
That muscular pig.

1275
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,330
- Jong Kook!
- Love!

1276
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,020
- Love.
- Jong Kook.

1277
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,220
- Love.
- Sit.

1278
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,770
- Jong Kook!
- Love!

1279
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,160
- Sit.
- Jong Kook.

1280
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,520
- Love.
- Love!

1281
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,890
He didn't say it.

1282
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:47,160
Squat ten times.

1283
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,560
- Go ahead.
- Wait.

1284
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,640
- You never pointed at me.
- Do it.

1285
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,830
Suk Jin is getting
a good workout today.

1286
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,750
Say "Jong Kook, love"
while you're at it.

1287
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,850
Jong Kook, love.

1288
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,250
Jong Kook, love.

1289
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,910
- Good.
- Jong Kook, love.

1290
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,120
- Jong Kook, love.
- Nice.

1291
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,560
Love.

1292
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,620
Love who? Jong Kook.

1293
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,790
Love!

1294
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:09,620
That was great.

1295
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,060
See? It livened up the mood.

1296
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,250
Wasn't it nice?

1297
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,500
Did you see Suk Jin at the end?

1298
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,870
(Jelly legs)

1299
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,200
The mood became better instantly.

1300
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,930
- I did a year's worth of squats.
- That alone livened up the mood.

1301
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,040
- I did a year's worth of squats.
- Nice.

1302
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,970
Just so you know,
this isn't the military.

1303
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,180
- You're members of his gym.
- We're athletes.

1304
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,770
- It's supposed to be a gym.
- He makes it seem that way.

1305
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,200
Squats are a great workout.

1306
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,540
Why give the trainer
a total of five votes?

1307
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,250
- Unbelievable.
- It's unfair.

1308
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,060
Anyway, you're competing
in the first tournament.

1309
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,020
Here's the first survey
that was conducted.

1310
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,180
We asked those in the age range
of 10 to 69.

1311
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,930
If someone upset them,

1312
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,720
who'd get revenge
in any way they can?

1313
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,720
(If someone upset them,)

1314
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,720
(who'd get revenge
in any way they can?)

1315
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,700
- This one...
- It has to be So Min.

1316
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,970
- She probably got the most votes.
- No.

1317
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,240
I'm probably ranked second...

1318
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,640
- because of my image.
- It's your image.

1319
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,870
- Right. I'm pretty 2nd.
- I bet she came in 2nd.

1320
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:59,870
- I bet she's ranked pretty high.
- So Min...

1321
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:00,910
- must've gotten the most votes.
- You must be ranked pretty high.

1322
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:02,270
- It has to be you.
- If Kwang Soo were here,

1323
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:03,970
- he would've gotten the most votes.
- Right.

1324
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,180
What about me?

1325
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,850
- Do you think I'd take revenge too?
- Revenge...

1326
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,080
You'd do it if we're filming.

1327
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,850
- But your image...
- Yes.

1328
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,410
People see you as a nice guy.

1329
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:12,720
- So you're probably ranked low.
- That's true.

1330
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,520
- Here's why.
- I don't do that personally.

1331
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,120
- I'd do that on variety shows.
- He'd do it on camera.

1332
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,200
- He must be ranked 8th or 9th.
- Right.

1333
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,220
He's either 7th or 8th.

1334
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,370
- What about you, Young Ji?
- I'm pretty young,

1335
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,200
but people think I'm evil.

1336
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,870
- So I might've been ranked high.
- Right.

1337
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:29,330
- That's true.
- People think I'm evil and mean.

1338
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,770
- You're energetic and hyper.
- Right.

1339
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,930
- She surprised us at first.
- Right.

1340
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,600
But you don't take revenge
on people. Right?

1341
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,120
- In real life,
- You're a cool girl.

1342
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,540
I can be pretty evil.

1343
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,850
(In real life,
I can be pretty evil.)

1344
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,450
- Even in real life?
- I get even. And I double it.

1345
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,450
- Really?
- Yes.

1346
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,160
- She does take revenge.
- Yes.

1347
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,750
- I'm totally for revenge.
- Right.

1348
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:48,790
- Totally.
- That's cool.

1349
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:49,830
What about you, Mi Joo?

1350
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,950
I think Jong Kook
will be ranked first.

1351
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,200
- You'll be 2nd.
- I'll be ranked 1st.

1352
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,850
- You're 3rd. You, 4th.
- I'm sure I'll be ranked 1st.

1353
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,370
- You're 5th. You, 6th.
- Me? Why?

1354
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:57,870
- You're 5th. You, 6th.
- Me? Why?

1355
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,100
She's ranking us based on our looks.

1356
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,640
- Other than Jong Kook,
- Hey.

1357
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,700
- she ranked us based on looks.
- Mi Joo.

1358
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,740
- Right?
- Mi Joo.

1359
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,410
- First, second, third,
- I'm so angry.

1360
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,810
- This is so annoying.
- Hey.

1361
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,100
- You're unbelievable.
- Who's ranked fifth?

1362
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,580
- You'd better be smart about it.
- Why am I...

1363
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,580
First, second,

1364
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,520
third, fourth...

1365
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,540
So being ranked fifth is good.
Right? That's good.

1366
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,950
So Min, do you take revenge?

1367
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:19,950
I don't openly talk about it.

1368
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,080
She definitely gets even.

1369
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,180
- I...
- She should get the most votes.

1370
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,890
I make my move after coming up
with the best plan.

1371
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:26,520
- It's a long-term project.
- That's the scariest.

1372
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,160
That's the scariest.

1373
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,870
Here's what I did a long time ago.

1374
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:32,200
I was so angry. And it was when...

1375
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,830
- people used wired earbuds.
- Right.

1376
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,540
The wired earbuds
were neatly organized.

1377
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,600
But I got the wires all tangled up
on purpose. That's my revenge.

1378
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,830
- That's...
- That's your kind of revenge.

1379
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:41,330
- That's...
- So you thought about doing that?

1380
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:42,680
- What?
- That you should do it?

1381
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,770
- No, I even carried it out.
- Gosh.

1382
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,470
- She did it.
- She would carry it out for real.

1383
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,140
- Jong Kook would get even.
- Totally.

1384
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,250
- He'd do it, no questions asked.
- In fact,

1385
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,520
up until my mid-30s, I thought...

1386
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,750
I should get back at people
and that was the nature of things.

1387
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,660
- The nature of things?
- Yes.

1388
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,680
- I thought that was fair.
- That's scary.

1389
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,100
I thought it was fair for everyone.

1390
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,520
Jong Kook has gotten very kind now.

1391
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,000
- I thought that was justice.
- Justice.

1392
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,500
- What about now?
- I don't do that now.

1393
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,410
I thought about
what my biggest revenge was.

1394
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:11,640
- It's working hard like this.
- Right.

1395
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,830
Are you watching?

1396
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,500
I'll make you see me
on every channel.

1397
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,040
- That's enough!
- Stop it!

1398
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,450
- Are you watching?
- Someone must be...

1399
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,950
shaking with the remote control.

1400
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,520
- I'll make you see me on TV.
- "So Min."

1401
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,040
- "Are you watching me?"
- I'm so sick of that.

1402
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,640
- Any stories, Young Ji?
- You should ask me...

1403
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,220
if I ever had a boyfriend first.

1404
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,390
- Right. Don't ask her that.
- That's the right order.

1405
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,430
- You've never had one?
- No.

1406
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:30,830
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- Really?

1407
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,220
- She's young.
- Not even one.

1408
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,620
Don't you meet guys
now that you're a rapper?

1409
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,290
Well, those guys like...

1410
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,370
women, cars, and money.

1411
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,970
- We have nothing in common.
- I see.

1412
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,200
- It's strictly business.
- Right.

1413
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:42,370
- She's professional.
- You keep things professional.

1414
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:43,540
- See?
- Right.

1415
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,430
Do you get why I said
Young Ji and Mi Joo are amazing?

1416
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,330
- I'm more like PG-13.
- She's bold.

1417
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:49,250
- Their ratings don't match mine.
- She's hip.

1418
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,700
- Sang Jun, watch.
- Okay.

1419
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,120
Did you listen to their stories?

1420
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,640
- You need stories like that too.
- What's happening?

1421
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,850
- I'm sure you'd get even too. Yes.
- Me?

1422
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,310
Even when people tease me,
I don't do say anything.

1423
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:02,330
- What about how...
- Really?

1424
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:03,930
- your ex hurt your feelings?
- By the way,

1425
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:06,220
you might be surprised to hear this,
but he's usually the one...

1426
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,100
who hurts girls,
instead of getting hurt by them.

1427
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,560
- No way. Seriously?
- He's a bad guy.

1428
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,560
- How does he do that?
- He's really popular.

1429
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,100
- Really?
- He dates a lot of people.

1430
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,390
- Really?
- He's popular?

1431
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:15,700
- He's very popular.
- Why?

1432
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,770
He's popular?

1433
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,160
- And he's a typical bad guy.
- You?

1434
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,370
No. But I don't take revenge.

1435
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:22,040
- Do they want to experiment?
- What?

1436
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,250
- Is this just an experiment?
- No.

1437
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,680
I'm just popular among girls.

1438
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,080
- Once I ask them out...
- You're just popular?

1439
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:28,520
I'm popular.

1440
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,310
- They laugh at my jokes.
- You're popular?

1441
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,890
It's embarrassing to say it myself,
but they laugh at my jokes.

1442
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,020
But when I ask them out,
they don't call me back.

1443
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:37,060
- They don't call him back.
- But women like...

1444
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,330
- guys like him.
- Right. They are popular.

1445
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:40,350
He's likable.

1446
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:42,470
- Sang Jun is very charming.
- Right.

1447
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,870
He's the kind of guy
I would want to have meals...

1448
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,140
- and drink tea with.
- But...

1449
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,870
- you can't possibly kiss him.
- Really?

1450
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:49,640
- I would never kiss him.
- What about kissing him?

1451
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,060
- I'd never kiss him.
- Look at him.

1452
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,600
- No. I'd only eat with him.
- Imagine kissing that face.

1453
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,910
- You'd never kiss him.
- Never.

1454
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,950
- He's just a close friend.
- Right. A close friend.

1455
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,370
- Just a close friend.
- I see.

1456
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:00,680
- Don't you get friend-zoned a lot?
- That's how it all starts.

1457
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,520
Don't people say
they could bathe with you even?

1458
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,620
Guys tell me that from time to time.

1459
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,310
- Bathe?
- "I could even bathe with you."

1460
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:08,450
What does that mean exactly?

1461
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:09,720
So nothing will happen between us.

1462
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,850
- Nothing will happen.
- Nothing will happen.

1463
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,290
You'll be a good friend to girls.

1464
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:13,850
- That's true.
- I'd like to get to know him.

1465
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,790
- Right? He's charming.
- Right.

1466
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,500
- Okay. I'll ask you out soon.
- But there's no progress.

1467
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,700
No.

1468
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:21,970
Do you know how
Sang Jun gets back at people?

1469
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,140
It's asking them out.

1470
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,410
"I like you."

1471
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,000
- Recently... Yes.
- That's so true.

1472
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:29,200
- You know?
- "I became to like you."

1473
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:31,680
When people break up,

1474
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,370
- they wish each other good luck.
- Right.

1475
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:34,950
So that way...

1476
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,580
I'm sure you wished her luck.

1477
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:40,910
But do you think
she wished you luck too?

1478
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:45,020
- Hold on. That was random.
- You're trying to provoke him?

1479
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,390
You're doing that now?

1480
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,560
Yes, now.

1481
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,220
- Okay.
- Hey, your eyes are back.

1482
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,000
You're in your 30s again.

1483
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,060
Look. Those are the eyes I remember!

1484
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:55,200
- Those are the eyes.
- These are the eyes.

1485
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,500
- Gosh.
- Okay.

1486
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,600
- His eyes are back.
- Let the nature take its course.

1487
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,240
I saw those eyes again.

1488
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,600
- I must get even.
- Gosh.

1489
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,600
- Jong Kook in his 30s...
- Okay. Great.

1490
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:05,850
All right. Let's come up
with the order now.

1491
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,350
- I think I'll be ranked first.
- Let's do this. Me too.

1492
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:11,020
- Jong Kook too. This is our bet.
- Yes. Put me there too.

1493
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:13,560
You and I should be ranked there.

1494
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,910
This is all about our image.

1495
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,080
It's about our image.

1496
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,680
I think I'll be ranked fourth.

1497
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,850
Fourth.

1498
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:20,850
- Fourth.
- Fifth.

1499
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:22,220
- I'll go with fifth place.
- Okay.

1500
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,020
- Fifth place.
- No, fourth place.

1501
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:27,160
- Put me in sixth place.
- It's iffy. Sixth place.

1502
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,910
- I'll go with seventh place.
- No.

1503
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:30,060
I'll go with seventh place.
It won't matter.

1504
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,160
(Se Chan, Ji Hyo, and Suk Jin
are expecting to be ranked low.)

1505
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,040
- Ninth and eighth.
- Ninth.

1506
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,830
- Trust me and pick the ninth place.
- Okay.

1507
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,350
All right. You're done.

1508
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:37,950
I'll reveal the result now.

1509
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,370
Bring in the result.

1510
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,250
(Is it what they predicted?)

1511
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,490
- We were spot on.
- Let me see.

1512
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,220
- See?
- Gosh.

1513
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,310
- It's what Jae Suk said.
- I told you.

1514
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,450
Did I get it right?

1515
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,790
- I told you.
- Sang Jun is ranked first.

1516
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:49,850
- Sang Jun is ranked first.
- Really?

1517
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,390
- Me? Why?
- It's him.

1518
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,560
- You're ranked second.
- Gosh, Sang Jun.

1519
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,930
Se Chan was right.

1520
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,020
- I was right.
- Why am I ranked so high?

1521
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,600
- I was ranked ninth.
- It's about our image.

1522
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:00,160
We were right. Mi Joo,
where did you get ranked?

1523
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,790
- Mi Joo.
- I was ranked eighth.

1524
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,240
(Only Se Chan and Suk Jin
were right.)

1525
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,810
Me? Why?

1526
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,910
(Only he can't understand
the rankings.)

1527
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,540
Why am I ranked first?

1528
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:09,000
I'm ranked tenth.

1529
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,810
(He's the least likely person
people expect to take revenge.)

1530
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,620
Only Se Chan guessed right.

1531
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,720
- I was right.
- I don't take revenge.

1532
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,270
- And Suk Jin.
- I was right too.

1533
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:17,080
- Gosh. Sang Jun.
- You were right too.

1534
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,450
- Why am I ranked first?
- Se Chan's guess was right.

1535
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,660
I was right.

1536
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:20,720
Can you tell us why?

1537
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,560
People chose him because...

1538
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,560
they thought physiognomy is science.

1539
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:26,350
"Physiognomy is science."

1540
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,620
- "Physiognomy is science"?
- Isn't that too harsh?

1541
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,470
- How does my face look?
- It's the mole.

1542
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,700
That brings revenge.

1543
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,870
No, this mole brings food.

1544
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:33,790
- You have the eyes of a snake.
- That's how I look?

1545
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,240
- You might start an uprising.
- You are like...

1546
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,140
- I have a likable face.
- His face screams revenge.

1547
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:38,330
Here's why.

1548
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:40,240
He played some distasteful roles...

1549
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:41,970
- Right.
- in "Comedy Big League".

1550
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:43,040
- His lines are brutal.
- Right.

1551
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,450
But I'm not like that in real life.

1552
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:46,540
- Tell people about that.
- I know you're not like that.

1553
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,680
- I don't do that.
- He's such a good friend.

1554
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,390
- They are all scripted.
- He's a nice guy.

1555
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,160
And Jong Kook was ranked second
because people thought...

1556
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,660
Jong Kook would bully and torture
them until they fully realize...

1557
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,620
their mistakes and sincerely
reflect on their wrongdoing.

1558
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,450
- That's so spot on.
- He'd be stubborn.

1559
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:02,220
Well, his gaze has changed a lot.

1560
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,290
- He has a kind gaze now.
- Right. My gaze is gentle.

1561
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:05,740
- Look. He's smiling with his eyes.
- Right.

1562
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:06,870
- Right.
- Yes.

1563
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:09,000
And people ranked Jae Suk last...

1564
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:11,470
because they thought
he'd know nothing about revenge.

1565
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,200
- It's about his image.
- Seriously.

1566
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,600
I'm so sick of hearing that.

1567
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,970
- I'm sick of it.
- He has such a nice image.

1568
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:18,040
- The 1st and 10th places...
- But...

1569
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,140
are sitting together.

1570
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,720
- Mr. Physiognomy...
- Hey.

1571
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:23,140
- It's true that I don't do revenge.
- That's physiognomy too.

1572
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,020
I don't take revenge
because it's a hassle.

1573
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,410
That's interesting.

1574
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,020
Jong Kook's team won...

1575
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,850
- by one point.
- Okay!

1576
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:32,520
- Well done.
- Good job.

1577
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,200
You picked the right captain.

1578
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,870
- Gosh.
- All right.

1579
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,120
The members of the winning team...

1580
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,290
will get 200 dollars
except for the captain.

1581
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:40,740
And the losing team
will get ten dollars each.

1582
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:42,600
That's all you'll get.

1583
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,270
And the winning team
must come forward and show me...

1584
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:48,140
with their fingers how much they'll
put away for the membership fee.

1585
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,410
Then I'll give you the money
after I deduct the fee.

1586
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,520
- But...
- I should have picked good ones.

1587
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,470
And the fees will go to the trainer.
But I won't disclose the amount.

1588
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,790
- You won't disclose it?
- Right.

1589
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,310
- So you won't tell him?
- Are you sure?

1590
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,410
- Young Ji.
- Okay.

1591
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:01,750
I'll only disclose
the amounts of money,

1592
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:02,890
but he won't know who paid how much.

1593
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:04,930
- You should disclose the numbers.
- Gosh.

1594
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:06,830
I can just tell that Young Ji is...

1595
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,000
- quite extreme.
- I'll give you the money for sure.

1596
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,330
Young Ji, you can start.

1597
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,970
Gosh, what a shame.

1598
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,700
Come on. Be generous.

1599
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,700
Point at the number you want to give
away as the membership fee.

1600
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:19,000
If we give him 50 dollars each,
he'll get 200 dollars.

1601
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,740
(How much will she pay
for the membership fee?)

1602
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:22,540
Okay.

1603
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:24,700
Gosh. I love Jong Kook.

1604
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,450
Ji Hyo, you're next.

1605
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,540
- For the membership fee?
- Yes.

1606
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,080
- Point at it.
- I can give him half.

1607
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,580
I won't hesitate.

1608
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,680
How much for the membership fee?

1609
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,220
I don't even expect you
to give me 50 dollars.

1610
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,850
- Have a conscience though.
- You need to get 50 dollars.

1611
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:39,660
Come on. Don't be so stingy.
We all worked hard.

1612
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:41,000
So Min, are you
looking for the number, zero?

1613
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,520
- No.
- That wasn't on the book.

1614
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,560
(She's caught red-handed.)

1615
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,740
Are you looking for a zero?

1616
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,100
(She's trying to skip paying
the membership fee.)

1617
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,270
You know...

1618
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:51,470
- Se Chan.
- Okay.

1619
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,100
(Next up is the captain, Se Chan.)

1620
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,180
I can sort of see
where your finger is headed.

1621
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:59,720
(He's Trainer Kook's right-hand man.
What about Captain Yang?)

1622
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,910
- Se Chan's finger didn't go down.
- No.

1623
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,520
When I looked,
the number I wanted was at the top.

1624
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:07,350
All right.
I'll give you four numbers.

1625
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,660
Trainer Kook, you can ask me...

1626
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,080
how much 1 out of the 4 paid
for the membership fee.

1627
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,000
- Just one.
- What?

1628
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,750
- You didn't tell us about that.
- Right.

1629
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,160
- He should ask.
- I just need to ask one person.

1630
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,020
- He should have a chance.
- The fees you got...

1631
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,540
(Paid amounts
for the membership fee)

1632
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,160
are 10 dollars, 10 dollars,
10 dollars, and 30 dollars.

1633
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,640
(10 dollars, 10 dollars, 10 dollars,
and 30 dollars)

1634
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:26,740
(3 of them only paid 10 dollars.)

1635
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,000
Gosh.

1636
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:29,470
Who was that?

1637
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,140
You can just pick anyone.

1638
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,540
- He needs to know who paid 30.
- Gosh.

1639
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,470
- If you picked us...
- I pointed at the wrong number.

1640
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:35,680
- Come on.
- Everyone, get up.

1641
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:36,950
- I pointed at the wrong number.
- Up.

1642
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:38,080
Totally.

1643
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,290
I picked the wrong number.

1644
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:41,120
You got 200 dollars.
How can you only give me 10 dollars?

1645
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,430
- How could they?
- Are you even human?

1646
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:44,850
- How could they do it?
- What do you think, Blue Hat?

1647
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,200
I told you, didn't I?

1648
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,020
- Listen.
- You picked the wrong people.

1649
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,470
- You should've picked us.
- We don't do pull stuff like that.

1650
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:51,470
Listen. You chose
such dishonest people.

1651
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:54,040
Pick another captain
and join our side.

1652
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,200
I paid 30 dollars.

1653
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,870
No, I paid 30 dollars.

1654
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:58,830
- No, I did.
- I paid 30 dollars.

1655
00:53:58,870 --> 00:53:59,930
May I ask now?

1656
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:01,930
You can ask how much
just one person paid.

1657
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,970
All you need to know
is who paid 30 dollars.

1658
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:05,580
- Find who paid 30 dollars.
- It was me.

1659
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,350
- Find who paid 30 dollars.
- I paid 30 dollars.

1660
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:08,350
(He'll know about the rest...)

1661
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:09,350
(once he finds out
who paid 30 dollars.)

1662
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,520
I choose Ji Hyo.

1663
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,580
(My Ji Hyo...)

1664
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:14,810
- Tell me how much she paid.
- I bet she paid ten dollars.

1665
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:15,950
Ji Hyo...

1666
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:21,060
(If Ji Hyo paid 30 dollars,
it'll mean the rest paid 10.)

1667
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,520
Ji Hyo paid 30 dollars.

1668
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,830
(Ji Hyo paid 30 dollars.)

1669
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,160
(He killed 3 birds with 1 stone.)

1670
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,970
- Can you believe it?
- Busted!

1671
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,370
Darn, he's scary.

1672
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:34,240
- She must love him a lot.
- I did it for the team.

1673
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,450
It's not like 30 dollars is a lot.

1674
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:38,200
- Let's be honest.
- It's more than ten dollars!

1675
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,140
- It's more than 10 dollars!
- It's 3 times more than the others.

1676
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,180
I know it's three times the amount,
but it's not a lot.

1677
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,990
I would've at least paid 50 dollars.

1678
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,040
There's no big difference between
10 and 30 dollars.

1679
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,060
- You...
- My gosh!

1680
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,450
Do ten push-ups right now.

1681
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,160
Do it this instant.

1682
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,830
- Get on with it.
- Do ten right now.

1683
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,950
- But I'm the captain.
- Captain?

1684
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,970
Captain, my foot!

1685
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,290
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

1686
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,370
Go down deeper.

1687
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,930
You haven't even done one yet.

1688
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,770
Three, four,

1689
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,310
- five, six.
- He's good at them.

1690
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:09,080
- Seven, eight.
- Anyone could do that.

1691
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,040
Nine, ten. Good.

1692
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,370
- Sit back down.
- That was cool.

1693
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:14,850
Suk Jin said that
anyone could do it.

1694
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,790
Okay, go ahead.

1695
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:17,790
Do ten.

1696
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:19,850
Ten? I could at least do 30.

1697
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,250
Then do 30 push-ups.

1698
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:23,830
If you manage 30 push-ups,
I'll give you 150 dollars.

1699
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:25,580
- You'll give me 150 dollars?
- Yes.

1700
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,220
- So 150 dollars for 30 push-ups?
- Proper push-ups though.

1701
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,700
- Money motivated him.
- Here he goes.

1702
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,890
They must be proper push-ups though.

1703
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,020
I see he's motivated by money.

1704
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,870
- One, two.
- No, go down deeper.

1705
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:35,560
- Three, four.
- This will do, right?

1706
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,870
Five, six, seven, eight.

1707
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:39,870
(He's on his way to winning 150
dollars by doing proper push-ups.)

1708
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,770
That's 10, 11, 12.

1709
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:45,270
And 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

1710
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:47,870
And 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.

1711
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,290
That's 26 and 27.

1712
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:52,290
- Oh, no.
- And 28, 29.

1713
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:53,390
- Thirty.
- Nice!

1714
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,390
(He managed 30 push-ups.)

1715
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:56,390
Thirty!

1716
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,290
- Thirty!
- Bring over my 150 dollars.

1717
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,060
Why?

1718
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,930
You agreed to pay me 150 dollars.

1719
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:04,000
No.

1720
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,390
(He suddenly changed his mind.)

1721
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,930
I just don't want to.

1722
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,500
- It was only a verbal contract.
- It's understandable.

1723
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,870
- It's possible.
- That could happen.

1724
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:13,870
(He unexpectedly
lost all his energy.)

1725
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,270
(Lunchtime)

1726
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,220
"Eating is part of the workout."

1727
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,220
(Eating is part of the workout.)

1728
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,410
- My gosh.
- Everything looks good.

1729
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:25,390
- No way.
- "Eating is part of the workout."

1730
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:28,290
The training and competing
must've made you hungry.

1731
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:30,660
- You'll now have your lunch.
- Right.

1732
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,930
Despite not having enough to spare,
Trainer Kook prepared...

1733
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:35,750
- a healthy meal for you.
- Really?

1734
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:40,390
Jong Kook will hand out
the rice and main side dishes.

1735
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,270
- Me?
- Yes, at your discretion.

1736
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:44,770
He holds the ultimate power.

1737
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:48,330
Since being frugal is in his nature,

1738
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:49,870
he didn't prepare enough
for everyone.

1739
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,140
There's not a lot of food.

1740
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,680
The gym doesn't make
that much money, you see.

1741
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,350
Not a lot.

1742
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,640
I'd like to make a contribution.

1743
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,720
Well, what you give me personally,

1744
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,080
- I won't reject.
- Right.

1745
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,410
I'll hand some over.

1746
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:05,680
- Do I give out the food myself?
- Yes.

1747
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,830
He'll be handing out
the food himself.

1748
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,600
There really isn't a lot,
but it still looks good.

1749
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,040
Look at Captain Yang.

1750
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,040
He should be helping,
not be first in line.

1751
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,770
- Unbelievable.
- You should give him a hand.

1752
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:19,270
This is what loyalty looks like.

1753
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,370
This is loyalty.

1754
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,470
Darn him.

1755
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:26,250
(A big smile)

1756
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,640
- There you go.
- He's not wrong though.

1757
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,490
That's ten dollars.

1758
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:32,220
(Captain Yang shows loyalty
in exchange for stir-fried squid.)

1759
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,080
(This is 10 dollars' worth.)

1760
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,850
- Seriously?
- Hold on.

1761
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:41,350
- This is loyalty.
- Yes, loyalty.

1762
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:44,700
- I see you're loyal.
- I sure am.

1763
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,700
Are you kidding me?

1764
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,060
- I see only two pieces of squid.
- There's really not a lot.

1765
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:52,370
- The squid...
- It'll be tough competition.

1766
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,700
What on earth?

1767
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,770
- Even though you paid?
- That's right.

1768
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,410
This is a miniature version
of society!

1769
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:58,950
He won't give you a lot
even though you paid?

1770
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:01,450
This is loyalty.
No, this is bulgogi.

1771
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:04,140
Okay. That's great.

1772
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:05,720
Okay.

1773
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:07,750
I should just open a gym of my own.

1774
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:08,910
Are you serious?

1775
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,450
How much did you pay for this?

1776
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:12,250
- A total of 40 dollars.
- For that?

1777
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,700
What he got was 40 dollars' worth?

1778
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,200
I'm considering
the distribution of wealth.

1779
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,270
(A 40 dollars' worth feast)

1780
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,100
Darling.

1781
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,200
Did you hear her?

1782
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,200
(A bulgogi side dish
got him a girlfriend.)

1783
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,700
She just called me "Darling."

1784
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,910
How dare you flirt with my man!

1785
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,450
Are you kidding me?

1786
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:33,750
You have no idea.

1787
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:36,310
Right. One should eat her fill.

1788
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:39,080
- There really isn't much.
- We'd get nothing at this rate.

1789
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,160
Did you say "we"?

1790
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:44,450
Don't touch the rice!

1791
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,060
- Leave it.
- I actually almost cried just now.

1792
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:49,970
It's been a while since anyone
told me not to touch the food.

1793
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:51,620
- I want some food.
- No.

1794
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,430
This buys you squid.

1795
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,140
And this buys you bulgogi.

1796
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:59,100
- You dirty pig.
- No, don't!

1797
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,810
Why would you eat with your hands?

1798
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,080
This truly is upsetting.

1799
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:06,350
How can you take
all the bean sprouts?

1800
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,180
Move, mister.

1801
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,490
- You took all the bean sprouts.
- There's no more soup.

1802
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,890
- It's good though.
- It really is.

1803
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,180
(Lunch at Tiger Gym teaches you
to be hungry for success.)

1804
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:16,950
We're sweet enough
just to eat what we're given.

1805
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,560
There's not a lot for me.

1806
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,930
This is what I get
for being considerate.

1807
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:22,970
I have nothing to eat.

1808
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:24,560
Is that all for you?

1809
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:25,970
(A plate full of bulgogi)

1810
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:27,370
(A bowl full of bean sprouts)

1811
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:29,600
- There isn't a lot.
- Check out all the bean sprouts.

1812
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,600
(Now's the time.)

1813
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:34,310
There's practically nothing to eat.

1814
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:36,250
(Hey!)

1815
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:38,410
Hey!

1816
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,350
You're done as captain.

1817
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:41,950
Get up. I'm taking that.

1818
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:43,680
No, I'm sorry.

1819
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,410
(Captain Yang loses his position
after stealing bulgogi.)

1820
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:47,410
Get up.

1821
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,750
I hate it when people steal my food.

1822
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:51,580
- Get over here.
- Sure thing.

1823
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:54,120
You're out. I've had it with you.

1824
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,660
Here's the congratulatory money
for the new captain.

1825
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,500
- Thank you.
- You receive 100 dollars.

1826
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,060
- Goodness.
- Okay.

1827
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,040
- Thank you.
- It's my pleasure.

1828
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,200
- All right.
- Move!

1829
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,660
- Captain Yang.
- Help us out a little.

1830
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,500
Can we each get ten dollars?

1831
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,770
- Thank you.
- It's what you promised.

1832
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,600
Thank you so much.

1833
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,970
(Captain Yoo starts his term by
helping his teammates financially.)

1834
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:13,970
Thank you.

1835
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,580
- How cool is that?
- We're in it together.

1836
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:17,790
Here's to celebrate
my term as captain.

1837
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:18,890
- Is that ten dollars?
- What?

1838
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,680
- Seriously?
- Just ten dollars?

1839
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,560
- Are you serious?
- Hold on a second.

1840
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,450
- I mean...
- How much did you receive?

1841
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:26,500
- Only 100 dollars.
- He got it just now.

1842
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,220
Do better, all right?

1843
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,160
- Got it.
- Don't cross the line.

1844
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,270
I'll do my best.

1845
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:34,470
Since I just made captain...

1846
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,660
(Since I just made captain...)

1847
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,500
- More congratulatory money?
- Well,

1848
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,770
I'll be collecting a membership fee.

1849
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:41,870
(A membership fee)

1850
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,970
Are you kidding me? Darn it!

1851
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:46,140
This is wrong. He can't do this.

1852
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,410
- This can't be allowed.
- Why not?

1853
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,580
It makes no sense.

1854
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,290
- Twenty dollars.
- After you eat...

1855
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:52,950
- Twenty dollars.
- Twenty dollars.

1856
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:55,250
Collect the membership fee
and split it with me.

1857
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,750
Of course. You don't have to worry.

1858
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,520
- Once you're done eating...
- This is close to stealing.

1859
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,200
We'll gather around, all right?

1860
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,330
- No way.
- Sure.

1861
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,930
- He's good at things like this.
- He's different, isn't he?

1862
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:07,100
The food is tasty though.

1863
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,770
- It really is.
- Right.

1864
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:11,060
(After a delicious and healthy meal)

1865
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:13,240
Are we playing
foot volleyball again?

1866
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,410
- Everyone!
- Hold on a second.

1867
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:20,250
Guys, since I just made captain,

1868
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:23,140
I'd like to ask
for your cooperation.

1869
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:25,180
We'll celebrate my first term...

1870
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,580
by paying 50 dollars each.

1871
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:28,560
- What?
- That's too much.

1872
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,160
(To even out the wealth,
he proposes a high membership fee.)

1873
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,200
- As a membership fee.
- But 50 dollars?

1874
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,750
- That's...
- I only suggest this because...

1875
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,660
It's too much,
and no one has that kind of money.

1876
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,270
- I don't have that.
- Let me handle him.

1877
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:39,660
Why are you stealing from the poor?

1878
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:40,660
What authority do you have?

1879
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,700
- I'm the vice-captain.
- Vice-captain, my foot.

1880
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,740
- Hey.
- Come on.

1881
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,560
Guys, hold on a second.

1882
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,830
We may have a new captain,

1883
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:48,930
but that doesn't mean
Team Glasses...

1884
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:50,540
climbed up the social ladder.

1885
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:52,770
- Dorks in glasses...
- I knew it.

1886
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:53,770
- Dorks in glasses?
- Get back.

1887
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:54,870
Those wearing glasses...

1888
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,790
I may trust the captain,
but not all those wearing glasses.

1889
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:59,950
I'll collect 30 dollars
from each member, sir.

1890
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,180
That I approve.

1891
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:02,390
- You.
- Fifty dollars was too much.

1892
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:05,290
We're going to
confess our love to you.

1893
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,220
Keep this up
and we'll declare our love.

1894
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,250
- To me?
- Yes.

1895
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,770
- Okay, fine.
- You've been warned.

1896
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,660
- A confession of love?
- Hold on a second.

1897
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:13,270
- Confess our love.
- I'm going to.

1898
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:14,740
- Go ahead.
- How will you do it?

1899
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:16,060
How about 20 dollars?

1900
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,060
Pay up the 30 dollars.

1901
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,970
- But 30 dollars is too much.
- It's too steep.

1902
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,080
- Pay up the 30 dollars.
- Hands out of your pockets!

1903
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,270
Do we really have to pay up?

1904
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:24,470
Hold on a second.
Big Glasses, shut it.

1905
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:26,950
- Hands out of your pockets.
- So 30 dollars.

1906
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,220
Just think of it...

1907
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:29,990
- as a fee you must pay.
- Members should have equal amounts.

1908
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:31,310
Yes, exactly.

1909
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:33,680
- So Min.
- He just took my money from me.

1910
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,910
- This is unfair.
- You can't do this!

1911
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:37,930
- This shouldn't be allowed.
- How can he do this?

1912
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:39,290
Think of it as a membership fee.

1913
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:41,250
- How will this be spent?
- It'll benefit all members.

1914
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,290
How will this be spent?

1915
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,220
- To help the members in need.
- Okay.

1916
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,290
- Thank you.
- I'm the one who needs the money.

1917
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:47,600
I'm in need of the money too.

1918
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:49,700
- Okay.
- I'm the one who needs the money.

1919
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,240
(Come here.)

1920
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,330
He's like a thug!

1921
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:55,180
Did you see him just now?

1922
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,410
- What was that?
- They have collusive ties.

1923
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:58,470
- People are watching.
- They're conspiring.

1924
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:59,500
What on earth is this?

1925
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,520
- Is he working for him?
- Seriously?

1926
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,390
- We'll sort this out later.
- Is this the Mafia?

1927
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:04,890
- Exactly.
- Are you forcing us to pay?

1928
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:07,490
Meanwhile, the members
who weren't on the winning team...

1929
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:08,810
- Right.
- Here!

1930
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,390
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1931
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:12,060
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

1932
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,450
- Thank you.
- Good job.

1933
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:14,660
Hold on a second.

1934
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:17,060
- He took 30 dollars from 4 people.
- That's right.

1935
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,200
- Hold on a second.
- Not so fast.

1936
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,200
- Why?
- Get over here.

1937
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,270
- You collected from four people.
- This will be the team's money.

1938
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:23,430
- Wait.
- We could get on a bus...

1939
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:24,560
and buy some hotteok to eat.

1940
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,370
Get over here for a second.

1941
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:27,770
The captain can fend for himself.

1942
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,700
I should get one per person.

1943
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,500
- Get what?
- One bill per person.

1944
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,680
You collected from four people
and only gave me this.

1945
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,370
He collected 120 dollars in total.

1946
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,580
Hand it over.

1947
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,490
But you see...

1948
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:41,290
It should look amicable,
so hand it over with a smile.

1949
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:42,290
(It should look amicable,
so hand it over with a smile.)

1950
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,560
- Trainer Kook, here you go.
- Right.

1951
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,950
Thank you for this.

1952
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,850
Trainer Kook, does such a gym
exist in real life?

1953
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:51,100
I know. Even I think...

1954
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,370
- This gym is so corrupt.
- Listen.

1955
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:54,770
He picks a captain...

1956
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:56,810
and makes him collect money.

1957
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,700
The gym is free.

1958
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,040
- Hold on.
- The gym is free.

1959
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,640
Stand properly.

1960
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,470
- The gym is free.
- Besides,

1961
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,310
Trainer Kook needs some money
to operate the gym.

1962
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:08,220
I don't know anything.

1963
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,890
- It's for the facility.
- This is too much.

1964
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:11,680
Please make me the vice-captain.

1965
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,390
- What?
- The vice-captain.

1966
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:14,750
Get down on the floor.

1967
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,180
For real?

1968
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:19,220
- Watch what you say.
- Will you allow that?

1969
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:20,950
- I will see what he does.
- Sang Jun, come here.

1970
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:23,220
- Sang Jun, come here.
- Okay.

1971
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:25,270
Hey, move to the end.

1972
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:27,500
Didn't the men in glasses
make a trio?

1973
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,930
- No.
- The group fell apart.

1974
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:30,310
- They are different.
- Listen.

1975
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:33,310
There is a difference
between our glasses.

1976
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:35,330
- Their glasses are fake.
- Yes.

1977
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,180
Their glasses have no lenses.

1978
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:38,250
No lenses.

1979
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,720
- Seriously.
- Their glasses are fake.

1980
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,950
- Only one wears real glasses.
- Their glasses are fake.

1981
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:42,410
- No lenses.
- Only one wears real glasses.

1982
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:44,390
- Lenses versus no lenses.
- His glasses are the original.

1983
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:45,580
That's right.

1984
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,250
The second game is...

1985
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,160
the World T.T.F. Championship.

1986
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:51,790
- What?
- T.T.F.?

1987
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,250
T.T.F.?

1988
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:57,290
It's a combination of tennis,
table tennis, and foot volleyball.

1989
01:04:57,390 --> 01:04:59,160
- You use the table tennis rackets.
- The table tennis rackets.

1990
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,000
On the court that resembles
a table tennis table,

1991
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,700
the players will use a tennis ball
and table tennis rackets...

1992
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,240
and have a rally as they follow
the foot volleyball rules.

1993
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,770
Only the rules are
from foot volleyball.

1994
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:08,580
A round ends
once a team scores seven points.

1995
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,500
Okay. We have a chance of winning.

1996
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,870
But for each round,

1997
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,410
we will have a draw...

1998
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,640
for an action you need to follow.

1999
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,720
That's the catch.

2000
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,060
If you don't follow it,
two points will be deducted.

2001
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,290
Okay.

2002
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:23,160
- How will the teams be decided?
- This time,

2003
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,330
we will have Team Young Ji
and Team Mi Joo.

2004
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:26,850
Team Young Ji and Team Mi Joo.

2005
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:28,560
They are neck-and-neck.

2006
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:32,060
- I know that...
- I am good at foot volleyball.

2007
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:34,540
- Young Ji has no athletic skills.
- I am good at foot volleyball.

2008
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,810
She is the worst player.

2009
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:38,100
Pick the team members.

2010
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,970
- Do they get to pick?
- Play or lose,

2011
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:41,040
- rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2012
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,080
Gosh.

2013
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:43,640
Trainer Kook.

2014
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:46,310
You can pick only if you win, right?

2015
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:48,870
Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors.

2016
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:50,220
- Haha.
- Okay.

2017
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:51,910
Play or lose,

2018
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,290
- rock-paper-scissors.
- Jae Suk.

2019
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:55,580
(Team Mi Joo:
Mi Joo, Haha, Jae Suk)

2020
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:56,790
- Se Chan.
- Se Chan.

2021
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,250
Hold on. Please look this way.

2022
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,120
Hold on. Please look this way.

2023
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,830
Please look this way.

2024
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:03,020
- Play or lose...
- All right.

2025
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,160
- Consider the gender ratio.
- I know.

2026
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,790
- She picked all the men.
- Play or lose,

2027
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:08,470
- rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2028
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,040
- Ji Hyo.
- Hey.

2029
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,930
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

2030
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:14,140
We need Ji Hyo.

2031
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,600
(You wench!)

2032
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,950
Mi Joo, we need Ji Hyo.

2033
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,410
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

2034
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:23,990
- We need Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

2035
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:25,890
Mi Joo, you should take So Min.

2036
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:28,310
The rest of the members
are in Team Young Ji.

2037
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:30,430
Gosh, I am on the same team
as Jong Kook.

2038
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,490
Make up the team
for the rounds like this.

2039
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:34,160
Two men and one woman,
one man and one woman,

2040
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,450
and one man and two women.
Okay. We got it.

2041
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:40,140
There is an option for this round.

2042
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,290
- An option.
- An option.

2043
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,500
It might be something like
"Don't speak English."

2044
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,240
This is the option for Round One.

2045
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,540
Taking a formal tone is prohibited.

2046
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:51,200
- It's too hard.
- Okay.

2047
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,700
- They are at a disadvantage.
- Okay.

2048
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,520
- It's too hard.
- All right.

2049
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,810
- Do I speak casually to Suk Jin?
- Hey.

2050
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:57,810
How about him?

2051
01:06:57,810 --> 01:06:59,080
- Do I speak casually to Suk Jin?
- Hey.

2052
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,220
Do I speak casually to Suk Jin?

2053
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:01,580
- Come on.
- Suk Jin.

2054
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:03,220
- Don't intimidate him.
- Hey.

2055
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:05,020
Do we take a casual tone?

2056
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,180
- Do we take a casual tone?
- Yes.

2057
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:07,790
- How about "Big brother"?
- You take a casual tone.

2058
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,390
- Yes.
- Jong Kook, you take a casual tone.

2059
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:10,930
Suk Jin, let's go.

2060
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:12,290
You take a casual tone.

2061
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,600
Hey, don't you understand?

2062
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,290
- Jong Kook, you take a casual tone.
- Can't you get it in your head?

2063
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:17,660
- Jae Suk.
- I didn't mean it like that.

2064
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,040
I just wanted to check
if you understood.

2065
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,470
- What did you say?
- He teased you too.

2066
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:22,310
- Calm down.
- It's just a casual tone,

2067
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:24,870
but some people take it too far.

2068
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:27,040
The round ends
once a team scores seven points.

2069
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:28,270
- Seven points.
- Seven points.

2070
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:29,470
Seven points. That's good.

2071
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:30,950
- We can do it.
- Where is the ball?

2072
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,450
Okay.

2073
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:33,490
Give me the ball.

2074
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,080
Suk Jin,
why is your team going first?

2075
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:36,620
Let me serve. What?

2076
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,620
Why is your team going first?

2077
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,060
- Then go first, you punk.
- Hey.

2078
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:41,060
- Why did you get angry?
- What are you doing?

2079
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,250
Why did you get angry?

2080
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:44,160
Not taking a formal tone
is the rule.

2081
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,970
- Suk Jin, don't swear.
- Suk Jin.

2082
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,870
- Don't get angry.
- Hey.

2083
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:49,370
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

2084
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:50,770
- Suk Jin.
- You shouldn't be like that.

2085
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:52,000
It's just a game.

2086
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,770
- Don't misunderstand.
- All of us are friends.

2087
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:54,810
Okay.

2088
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:56,180
- All right.
- Suk Jin, apologize.

2089
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:57,680
- I am sorry.
- All right.

2090
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,970
- There you go.
- Suk Jin.

2091
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:00,270
Don't misunderstand.

2092
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:01,770
- All right.
- For goodness' sake.

2093
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:02,970
I am a bit out of it.

2094
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,450
He has always used
a lot of swear words.

2095
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:07,450
Seriously. Suk Jin has a problem.

2096
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,810
Serve from the back.

2097
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:11,490
- Okay. I will serve.
- You can do it.

2098
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:12,950
Here I go.

2099
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:14,290
Hey.

2100
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:15,600
- Hold on. The tennis ball...
- Here I go.

2101
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,220
(It goes under the net.)

2102
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,160
- Here I go.
- What are we going to do?

2103
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:21,790
- It feels different.
- Is the score 1 to 0?

2104
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:23,270
What? Already?

2105
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:24,430
- This is driving me crazy.
- Suk Jin.

2106
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,240
I am sorry.

2107
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:27,870
The ball hit the end of the racket.

2108
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,740
The court is big.

2109
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,080
- Okay.
- Do well.

2110
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,310
Let's go.

2111
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:33,470
Seok Sam, can I serve?

2112
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:35,970
I am Suk Jin, not Seok Sam.

2113
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:37,310
- Suk Jin, can I serve?
- Yes.

2114
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,310
(It's Se Chan's turn to serve.)

2115
01:08:39,310 --> 01:08:40,790
- Go. Hurry up.
- Go.

2116
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:42,660
There you go.

2117
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,880
- Okay.
- There you go.

2118
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:47,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

2119
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,200
Hey.

2120
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:49,720
Se Chan!

2121
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,000
- Hit harder.
- Hit harder than you usually would.

2122
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,670
It didn't go
as much as I thought it would.

2123
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:56,560
- You can serve from the two blocks.
- Really?

2124
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,870
Guys, you can serve
from the two blocks.

2125
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:00,270
- "Guys"?
- Yes, sir.

2126
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:01,930
Oh. Okay.

2127
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:03,100
- "Guys"?
- Yes, sir.

2128
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,910
Oh. Okay.

2129
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,710
- Team Young Ji lost points.
- Why?

2130
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,140
Young Ji used a formal tone.

2131
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:10,590
Okay.

2132
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,120
- I used a formal tone.
- Don't do it.

2133
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,790
Confucianism is in my blood.

2134
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:16,590
Do we lose points...

2135
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:17,960
- if we use the wrong tone?
- Yes.

2136
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,330
We need to use a casual tone
with the production crew, right?

2137
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,130
- You should...
- We can't use a formal tone.

2138
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,300
You should use
a formal tone with me.

2139
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:24,920
Bo Pil, we should be able
to use a casual tone with you.

2140
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,740
- You told us to use a casual tone.
- This is too much.

2141
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:29,000
- This is too much.
- Scrap the points. You messed up.

2142
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:30,370
You are the one who messed up.

2143
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:32,930
(You are the one who messed up.)

2144
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:35,080
(My goodness.)

2145
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:38,140
That's it.

2146
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,750
Hey.

2147
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:41,210
You should take responsibility.

2148
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,380
Good job.

2149
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:44,620
This is great.

2150
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:45,620
The score is 2 to 0.

2151
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:46,790
Let's go Se Chan.

2152
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:48,460
- Okay.
- Gosh, this is...

2153
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:49,880
- Receive it.
- Okay.

2154
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,760
I will bounce it. Come and take it.

2155
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:52,850
Don't be ridiculous.

2156
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:54,890
I will bounce it. Come and take it.

2157
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:56,020
Don't be ridiculous.

2158
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:58,300
- For goodness' sake.
- It was the worst toss.

2159
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,460
Hey, we want to sweat.

2160
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:03,240
- Suk Jin.
- Seok Sam, what was that?

2161
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,370
I am sorry.

2162
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:06,740
You usually aren't this bad.
We need a balanced team.

2163
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,270
- You should receive it.
- I will stand in the middle.

2164
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:10,670
- It's not like you need to kick.
- Okay.

2165
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:11,950
Focus.

2166
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:13,710
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2167
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,310
- I will receive it.
- I think he is bad at this game.

2168
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:16,790
- Focus.
- Okay.

2169
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:18,050
Focus.

2170
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:19,950
Receive it.

2171
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:21,490
- He received it.
- That's good.

2172
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:22,660
It's too high.

2173
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:24,380
- Hey!
- Out.

2174
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,260
Hey, come here!

2175
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:27,300
(Hey, come here!)

2176
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,700
- Hey!
- Out.

2177
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,390
Hey, come here!

2178
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:31,720
- I needed to practice.
- Did he get it over the net?

2179
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:32,720
I needed to practice.

2180
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,630
- I needed to practice.
- Do ten push-ups.

2181
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,200
One. Wake up.

2182
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,740
- Hey.
- Wake up.

2183
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:38,800
Wake up.

2184
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,740
- Seriously.
- Jong Kook,

2185
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:41,880
we got your point already.

2186
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,300
- Come on.
- Friends can say that.

2187
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:48,450
- I know. I am just looking.
- Okay.

2188
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:50,340
- Let's focus.
- My goodness.

2189
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:51,640
Let's make it fun.

2190
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:54,550
- He is scary.
- Come on.

2191
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:55,710
Let's go.

2192
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:57,220
- Here I go.
- We can do well.

2193
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,550
- Receive it.
- You can receive it, right?

2194
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:03,670
- You can receive it, right?
- He will send it over the net.

2195
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:07,060
(It's time to show
the result of the fierce training!)

2196
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:08,500
He will send it over the net.

2197
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,670
Okay!

2198
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,710
(Se Chan fails to receive it.)

2199
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:14,580
Good job. That's the power
of a middle-aged man.

2200
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:15,800
That's it.

2201
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:18,010
Suk Jin is good.

2202
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,080
- That's it.
- Good job, Seok Sam.

2203
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,140
I did a good job, right?

2204
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:22,310
- I will give it to you.
- Give it to me.

2205
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:24,380
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2206
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:25,620
- It was meant for me.
- Nice.

2207
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:26,810
Send it up.

2208
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:28,620
- Hey.
- Okay.

2209
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,050
(Despite the shaky toss,
Sang Jun saves the ball.)

2210
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:31,660
It didn't go out.

2211
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:33,700
(Spike)

2212
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,130
- You are good.
- Okay.

2213
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,200
- You are good.
- Okay.

2214
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,800
You should have used a spike!

2215
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,540
- Okay.
- Good job.

2216
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:43,090
Good job.

2217
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:45,600
- We have good teamwork.
- Did you see that?

2218
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,040
- Hey.
- We have good teamwork.

2219
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,630
- You should receive it like this.
- How did I receive it?

2220
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,640
- Those rookies.
- Good job, Suk Jin.

2221
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,210
- We can do this.
- Seok Sam is good.

2222
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:57,550
- Those rookies.
- Good job, Suk Jin.

2223
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:58,640
- We can do this.
- Seok Sam is good.

2224
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,010
You need to score seven points.

2225
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:01,210
I won't play around.

2226
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:04,350
- Go.
- Go, Sang Jun.

2227
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:06,520
- Shall I begin?
- Yes. Go.

2228
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,520
- Okay.
- He is good.

2229
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,050
Be careful.

2230
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:11,960
Okay.

2231
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,000
(Se Chan sends the ball
over the net.)

2232
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,760
All right. Send it up.

2233
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,840
Young Ji.

2234
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,060
- Okay.
- Hold on.

2235
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:19,630
Young Ji.

2236
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:20,670
- Okay.
- Hold on.

2237
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,380
(My goodness.)

2238
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,710
(The ball took him by surprise
when he thought they had scored.)

2239
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,170
That was cute.

2240
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:30,080
(Their power evaporated
in less than a minute.)

2241
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,210
(Seok Sam.)

2242
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:32,590
Are you okay?

2243
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:33,880
Are you okay?

2244
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:36,260
Seok Sam,
you should have received it.

2245
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:38,550
Why did you just stand there?

2246
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:39,630
Suk Jin.

2247
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,920
I mean...

2248
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,760
- Let's go.
- Set point.

2249
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,370
- What's the score?
- Let's end the round.

2250
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:46,020
It will end in a boring way.

2251
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,430
(If Team Mi Joo scores again,
the round will end.)

2252
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:48,870
- Be careful.
- Let's go.

2253
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,240
Don't be too confident.

2254
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,340
- Okay.
- Don't be too confident.

2255
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,380
Okay. That's good.
They won't be able to receive it.

2256
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:01,070
- Receive it.
- Run.

2257
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:02,350
- That's it.
- Receive it.

2258
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,110
- Spike. There you go.
- Receive it.

2259
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:07,520
(They have a rally
for the 1st time in 30 minutes.)

2260
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,760
- All right.
- Send it up.

2261
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,020
Okay. I got it.

2262
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,390
- Young Ji.
- It's over the net.

2263
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:13,520
(The ball is over the net.)

2264
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,820
It's over the net.

2265
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,390
(Spike)

2266
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:18,800
(The ball hits Young Ji's body.)

2267
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,470
There you go. Good job.
Send it over the net.

2268
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,060
Send it over the net.

2269
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:26,860
(He messed up.)

2270
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,230
Hey, we won.

2271
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:32,340
- Good job.
- We won.

2272
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:34,070
- We won.
- Good job.

2273
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:36,520
- We did it.
- It was one mistake.

2274
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:39,180
Get up.

2275
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:40,890
It was one mistake.

2276
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:42,390
What was that?

2277
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:43,810
Why couldn't you send it
over the net?

2278
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,480
Is the round over?

2279
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,630
For goodness' sake.

2280
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:47,930
- It's time for Round Two.
- Is the round over?

2281
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:49,520
- Is the round over?
- Be careful.

2282
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,960
Use a formal tone now.

2283
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,060
- Oh, is it over?
- For goodness' sake.

2284
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,800
I will pick the second option.

2285
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,800
Okay.

2286
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,170
Here comes the second option.

2287
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,640
Speak with a smile
and don't get angry.

2288
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,730
- Okay. Don't get angry.
- This is...

2289
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:03,900
- Give me the ball.
- Trainer Kook, don't get angry.

2290
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,640
- Give me the ball.
- Don't look so serious.

2291
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,380
- Trainer Kook, smile.
- Jae Suk.

2292
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:09,140
- Toss the ball.
- Okay.

2293
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,420
(Happy)

2294
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:11,640
Okay.

2295
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,280
- Trainer Kook.
- Yes?

2296
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,480
You are bound to get angry.

2297
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,720
I won't get angry.

2298
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,650
- You are playing with So Min.
- I won't get angry.

2299
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:19,020
- Really?
- Of course.

2300
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:20,890
You are bound to get angry
when you play with So Min.

2301
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:23,460
That won't happen.

2302
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,270
If we decide that you got angry,
we will deduct points.

2303
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,670
- Okay.
- Okay.

2304
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,100
Smile.

2305
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,270
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2306
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:31,970
Smiling will bring good fortune.

2307
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,170
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2308
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:34,770
Okay.

2309
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:38,010
- Smile.
- Good shot.

2310
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:39,640
- This is fun.
- Let's go.

2311
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,180
- We need to win this round.
- Okay.

2312
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:42,180
So Min, let's go.

2313
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:44,520
- Okay.
- Okay.

2314
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,310
(Laughing)

2315
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:48,720
(He feels anger,)

2316
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,890
(but he manages to suppress it.)

2317
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,630
(So Min is happy
to see Jong Kook laugh.)

2318
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:54,730
My goodness.

2319
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:56,300
Jong Kook bit his lips.

2320
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:58,230
So Min.

2321
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,600
We only have three chances.

2322
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:03,640
- For goodness' sake.
- The score is 1 to 0.

2323
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:05,730
- Hey.
- That was great.

2324
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:06,900
The score is 1 to 0.

2325
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,340
Enjoy the game.

2326
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,430
Enjoy the game. Smile.

2327
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,100
Seok Sam, move out of the way.

2328
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,180
Keep smiling.

2329
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,810
That's right, Seok Sam.

2330
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:16,740
That's it.

2331
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:17,810
(Positive energy fills the gym.)

2332
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:20,550
I wondered
if I should say this earlier.

2333
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:22,110
You look so old today.

2334
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:24,180
(Laughing)

2335
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,020
Nice comment.

2336
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:27,650
- It has always been that way.
- Okay.

2337
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:29,150
- That's it.
- Okay.

2338
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,730
- It's nothing new.
- It's okay.

2339
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:31,800
- All right.
- It's nothing new.

2340
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,970
- Let's resume.
- Let's go.

2341
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:35,630
- All right.
- Okay.

2342
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:37,970
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2343
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:41,470
Okay.

2344
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:44,230
(He is all smiles.)

2345
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:47,050
Get on the floor.

2346
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:49,050
Get on the floor.

2347
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,720
- Get on the floor.
- What was that?

2348
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,980
(They laugh at Jong Kook.)

2349
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:55,480
Hurry up and get on the floor.

2350
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,720
- Come on.
- Get on the floor.

2351
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,820
- Get on the floor.
- I am a trainer.

2352
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:00,930
I am a trainer.

2353
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:02,630
- I don't care.
- I am a trainer.

2354
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:03,990
Do it like we did
when we made a mistake.

2355
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:04,990
- No way.
- Get on the floor.

2356
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:06,890
- I am a trainer.
- He is so cheeky.

2357
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:08,690
Gosh, he refused
to get on the floor.

2358
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:10,800
- I am a trainer.
- He is witty.

2359
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,970
I went easy on them.

2360
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:14,810
- Okay. Let's go.
- Okay.

2361
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:16,530
- Here I go.
- Let's go.

2362
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,880
- Put a smile on your face.
- I am smiling.

2363
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:22,210
I am smiling.

2364
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,180
(She makes a mistake
with the serve.)

2365
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:25,550
(Her face turns serious.)

2366
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:27,740
You need to smile.

2367
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:31,610
(They use Kwang Soo's techniques
to ridicule her.)

2368
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:33,150
- I am sorry.
- It's okay.

2369
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,280
What was that?

2370
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,190
(Ji Hyo, what was that?)

2371
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:39,020
- What was that?
- Okay.

2372
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:40,800
- Let's do better, Ji Hyo.
- Okay.

2373
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:42,430
I am sorry.

2374
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:43,730
That was so witty.

2375
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:45,470
(Why aren't you smiling?)

2376
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:46,900
Are you frowning?

2377
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,600
- Ji Hyo, smile.
- I didn't know the rules.

2378
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,600
I am sorry.

2379
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,010
- Okay.
- All right.

2380
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:53,680
- All right.
- Let's go.

2381
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:55,740
- Okay.
- That's good.

2382
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,520
There you go.

2383
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,020
- Come on.
- Hit it lightly.

2384
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,350
- Hit it lightly. That's it.
- Okay.

2385
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:01,520
You are good.

2386
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:02,780
Okay.

2387
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:05,090
(Team Young Ji made the score even.)

2388
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:06,090
Good job.

2389
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:08,650
- Ji Hyo, it's okay. Smile.
- It's okay.

2390
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:11,100
- It's okay, Jae Suk.
- We are doing well. It's okay.

2391
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,860
We can do this.

2392
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:13,890
(This is so much fun.)

2393
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:17,800
(She ridicules them
for the 2nd time.)

2394
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,470
You are so bad at this.

2395
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:22,100
- What was that?
- What?

2396
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,880
- I gave her the ball.
- Did you see that?

2397
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:26,050
He hit her head with the ball
because he was angry.

2398
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:28,440
- Didn't he show anger?
- Give him a warning.

2399
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,810
- Suk Jin.
- What?

2400
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:31,110
Get lost if you aren't playing.

2401
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,920
(Laughing)

2402
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,390
For goodness' sake.

2403
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,720
That little insect.

2404
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:39,760
All right.

2405
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,390
- For goodness' sake.
- Okay.

2406
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:42,960
- Shall we begin?
- Ji Hyo, move to the front.

2407
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,990
Bounce it on the floor
before you hit it.

2408
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:46,730
So Min, move up a little.

2409
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:49,100
Stand before the line.

2410
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:50,270
(Laughing)

2411
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:53,810
There you go. Why on earth
would you stand so far behind?

2412
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:56,510
You can serve from here. All right.

2413
01:17:57,310 --> 01:17:58,340
- There you go.
- Good job.

2414
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,010
- There you go.
- Good job.

2415
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:02,400
- So Min.
- Okay.

2416
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,270
- That's good.
- Okay.

2417
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:05,440
(Jong Kook sends the ball over
pretty high.)

2418
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,720
- Spike.
- Nice.

2419
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:12,110
(My goodness.)

2420
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:16,150
(Laughing)

2421
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:17,490
- What was that?
- Hey.

2422
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:18,630
That was So Min's ball.

2423
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:20,970
- Smile.
- So Min didn't move toward it.

2424
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:21,990
That was So Min's ball.

2425
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:23,890
I tried to get the ball
because she didn't move toward it.

2426
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:24,970
(The little ones aggravate them.)

2427
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:27,560
That was So Min's ball. Hey!

2428
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:29,060
- Come on!
- You did well.

2429
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:30,210
- He got angry.
- He got angry.

2430
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:31,710
- He got angry.
- Suk Jin got angry.

2431
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:33,480
- Hey.
- Leave the court.

2432
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:35,210
Suk Jin, you lost points.

2433
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,350
Why?

2434
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:38,810
- You yelled at So Min.
- We received a report.

2435
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:40,610
- From whom?
- Why did you get angry?

2436
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:42,520
Suk Jin is happy.

2437
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,720
- When did you get angry?
- It didn't bother me.

2438
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,760
I simply called her loudly.

2439
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,390
Hey, you got angry.

2440
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:51,430
Smile.

2441
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:52,860
You pulled my ear.

2442
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,300
You got angry.

2443
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,340
- Gosh.
- Come on.

2444
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:57,490
Gosh.

2445
01:18:57,490 --> 01:18:58,730
(Jae Suk runs away
with the glasses without lenses.)

2446
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:00,310
What a punk.

2447
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,600
Bring them back.

2448
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,050
Hey, bring them back.

2449
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:09,010
- Hey.
- Jae Suk.

2450
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:10,350
Jae Suk, throw them here.

2451
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,720
Hey.

2452
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,680
Bring them here!

2453
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,720
What?

2454
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:18,280
- He got angry.
- He was smiling.

2455
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,760
- I was smiling.
- I am sorry.

2456
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,460
- He was smiling.
- I was smiling.

2457
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:22,960
He is gentle on the inside
and tough on the outside.

2458
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,800
Suk Jin.

2459
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:26,930
Stop losing points
and go back to your seat.

2460
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,300
Go.

2461
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,890
I can't tell if people are smiling
or crying.

2462
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:32,900
Let's go.

2463
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,470
Hit hard, So Min.

2464
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:36,340
- Okay. Here I go.
- Hit hard, So Min.

2465
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,210
- Good luck.
- Hit hard.

2466
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:39,710
- Okay.
- You are good.

2467
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:41,100
Ji Hyo.

2468
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,020
- Ji Hyo, send it over.
- That's good.

2469
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,310
Ji Hyo, that's good.

2470
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,520
- Okay.
- Send it over.

2471
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,420
(Locust smash)

2472
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:51,110
- Okay.
- There you go!

2473
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:52,560
(Gosh.)

2474
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,350
(I am happy!)

2475
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,320
(Hold on.)

2476
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:59,190
Jong Kook bit his lips.

2477
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:01,100
No, I didn't. When did I do that?

2478
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,100
I didn't do anything.

2479
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,230
He just has healthy teeth.

2480
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:05,690
Here is a replay.

2481
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:07,210
- Here.
- Jong Kook, are you okay?

2482
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:08,360
- Okay.
- Of course.

2483
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,640
- Of course.
- Are you okay?

2484
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:10,730
Of course.

2485
01:20:11,230 --> 01:20:12,530
- Let's go.
- This isn't hard.

2486
01:20:12,530 --> 01:20:14,010
- Let's go.
- We can do it.

2487
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,270
It's the worst player,
Ji Hyo's turn.

2488
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,740
- She is really bad.
- That's it.

2489
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:18,770
Okay.

2490
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:21,480
- She is really bad.
- That's it.

2491
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,890
(She served to the ceiling.)

2492
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:26,650
(The original boomerang serve)

2493
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:27,850
I am sorry.

2494
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:29,960
It's okay.

2495
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,600
(They ridicule Ji Hyo
for the 3rd time.)

2496
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:35,230
I can't contain my laughter.

2497
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:37,030
You hit it like this.

2498
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:38,890
The ball hit the side.

2499
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:41,640
- You are really bad at this.
- I am sorry.

2500
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:44,310
I didn't know
the game could be this funny.

2501
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:46,640
- That was fun.
- Ji Hyo, you are so funny.

2502
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,710
That was fun.

2503
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:50,070
It's nice to laugh.

2504
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:51,740
- I know. It's nice.
- It's nice.

2505
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:54,140
- Here I go.
- It will bring good fortune.

2506
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:55,550
My goodness.

2507
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,020
Okay.

2508
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,720
My goodness.

2509
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,730
(Locust failed to receive it.)

2510
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,590
(Come here, Jae Suk.)

2511
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:03,630
Hey.

2512
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:05,960
I told you to get a grip.

2513
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:08,230
(They give him full-body therapy.)

2514
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,990
I told you to get a grip.

2515
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:12,690
- He is really bad.
- Isn't that anger?

2516
01:21:12,690 --> 01:21:14,210
I told you to get a grip.

2517
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,880
Good job.

2518
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,010
(They continue to smile.)

2519
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:19,980
We were close to winning.

2520
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:22,480
- Okay.
- You are really good at this.

2521
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,110
Give us the ball.

2522
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:26,220
- It's here.
- The ball is on your side.

2523
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:27,740
Is that so?

2524
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:28,780
Good luck.

2525
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:31,520
That's good.

2526
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,610
- Out.
- Edge.

2527
01:21:32,610 --> 01:21:33,650
- Line.
- Edge.

2528
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:35,480
(Did it go out?)

2529
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:36,800
That's good.

2530
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,490
(It's in because it hit the line.)

2531
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:40,730
Edge!

2532
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:41,730
(The athlete's daughter completes
a difficult technique.)

2533
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,060
Edge!

2534
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:45,990
- It's okay.
- It hit the edge.

2535
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:47,810
That was nerve-racking.

2536
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:48,840
Gosh.

2537
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:51,210
So Min, you are edgy.

2538
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,770
That was nerve-racking.

2539
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,600
Tease them.

2540
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:56,920
(She dances in a flippant way.)

2541
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:58,810
- Go.
- Are you angry?

2542
01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:01,020
- Just go.
- I think she is angry.

2543
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:02,110
Just go.

2544
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:04,020
- I can't believe I did that.
- I think that was anger.

2545
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,890
- That was so cool.
- What's the current score?

2546
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:07,520
Let's do well. Let's go.

2547
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,130
- Do you want to serve?
- Yes.

2548
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:10,960
All right. You are good.

2549
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,460
(So Min receives
Trainer Kook's trust.)

2550
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:14,990
Okay.

2551
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:19,810
(She loses a point
as soon as she gains trust.)

2552
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:21,600
(What was that, So Min?)

2553
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,810
- Okay.
- My goodness.

2554
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:24,810
- We are saved.
- Get on the floor.

2555
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:26,240
We won.

2556
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:28,480
- So Min is so funny.
- Did you see that?

2557
01:22:29,270 --> 01:22:31,810
You should have checked the floor.

2558
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,390
Let's do this.
The current score is 6 to 5.

2559
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:35,610
The current score is 6 to 5.

2560
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:36,920
Let's receive the ball.

2561
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:38,090
- Let's go.
- Match point.

2562
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:39,110
Okay.

2563
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:40,430
- Okay.
- Okay.

2564
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:42,850
We need to win this round.

2565
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:43,850
You can do this.

2566
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,820
- You just need one more point.
- Okay.

2567
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:47,470
(He shows off his healthy teeth.)

2568
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:49,230
Smile. You have healthy teeth.

2569
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:51,340
It's Locust
who's really bad at this.

2570
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:54,340
- He's terrible at this.
- He's so mean.

2571
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:55,710
He's really annoying.

2572
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:58,930
(I'll send the ball to you,
so make sure to hit it.)

2573
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:00,510
(She's feeling excited again.)

2574
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:03,480
(A surprise attack)

2575
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:05,720
(Making a fuss)

2576
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,350
(Suddenly dodging the ball)

2577
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,480
Hey. What?

2578
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,350
(Trainer Kook failed
to receive the ball.)

2579
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:13,480
(The game is over
with Team Mi Joo's victory.)

2580
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,980
The game is over.
Whose fault is that?

2581
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,090
Why did you dodge the ball?

2582
01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:18,060
- Whose fault is that?
- Why did you dodge the ball?

2583
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:20,230
So Min.

2584
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:22,820
(So Min tested Trainer Kook's
patience until the end.)

2585
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:24,190
Hey!

2586
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:25,890
Okay.

2587
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:28,970
All right. Team Mi Joo wins.

2588
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:30,600
- Okay.
- Nice.

2589
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,680
That's corruption, right?

2590
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:33,770
I won without doing anything.

2591
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:36,310
The 4 members of
Team Young Ji get 10 dollars each.

2592
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,350
And you guys should decide
how much you'll pay.

2593
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:39,850
The membership fee? Okay.

2594
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:42,240
- Come over here one by one.
- For Trainer Kook...

2595
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,520
- Trainer Kook took good care of us.
- We should be nice to him.

2596
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,180
I did a lot of things for you.

2597
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:49,180
I'll leave it up to you.

2598
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:50,490
- Make it reasonable.
- Right.

2599
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:53,860
All right. Jong Kook, you can
ask about one member.

2600
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:56,060
- The total amount is...
- Okay.

2601
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:58,190
(How much is
the membership fee collected?)

2602
01:23:58,530 --> 01:24:01,400
They are 10, 20, 20, 30,
and 30 dollars.

2603
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,030
That's a lot. It's generous.

2604
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:05,900
- That's a lot.
- They paid good money.

2605
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:08,180
My previous team was really mean.

2606
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,520
What? Who paid only ten dollars?

2607
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,520
Who paid only ten dollars?

2608
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,420
- I know.
- It's 10, 20, 20, 30, and 30.

2609
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:16,240
Did you say
10, 20, 20, 30, and 30 dollars?

2610
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:18,610
Hang on.
It's 10, 20, 20, 30, and 30 dollars.

2611
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:19,780
No. It's not me.

2612
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:20,850
Ten dollars?

2613
01:24:20,850 --> 01:24:21,850
(Trainer Kook turns into
Detective Kim to interrogate them.)

2614
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:23,020
It's not you, is it?

2615
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:25,020
- It's not me.
- I swear it's not me.

2616
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:26,630
It would be shocking
if it was the captain.

2617
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:28,820
- You seem nervous.
- Me? No, I paid 20 dollars.

2618
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:30,390
(Me? No, I paid 20 dollars.)

2619
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:31,990
(What?)

2620
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:34,770
Now that Se Chan says 20,
I think it's him. Hang on.

2621
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:37,570
He doesn't say he paid 30 dollars.
He said 20 instead.

2622
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:39,510
- Whether it's 20 or 30...
- I paid 20 dollars.

2623
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:40,710
(Se Chan claims
that he paid 20 dollars.)

2624
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:42,070
(What's Detective Kim's choice?)

2625
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:43,310
I pick Yang Se Chan.

2626
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:44,610
(I pick Yang Se Chan.)

2627
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,780
I'll give you another chance.

2628
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,420
- I pick Se Chan.
- Se Chan paid...

2629
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:51,090
- He must've paid 30 dollars.
- No, he paid 10 dollars.

2630
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:53,020
- I wish he paid 30 dollars.
- I'm sure he paid 10 dollars.

2631
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:55,150
He's the only one
who paid ten dollars.

2632
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:56,180
(Yang Se Chan paid ten dollars.)

2633
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:57,520
He's the only one
who paid ten dollars.

2634
01:24:57,690 --> 01:24:59,460
Hey, you. Come here.

2635
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:01,360
Get ready for burpees.

2636
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:05,230
(He pretended to hesitate
and chose ten dollars right away.)

2637
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:06,230
(He's doing the burpee test
as a penalty.)

2638
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:07,970
- Hurry.
- Jong Kook is the best.

2639
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:09,210
Hurry. We don't have time.

2640
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:10,810
- Jong Kook is the best.
- Hurry.

2641
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:12,880
- Jong Kook is the best.
- Are you kidding me?

2642
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,070
I was going to give you
some money in secret.

2643
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:16,240
- He's nothing like how he looks.
- Se Chan is unbelievable.

2644
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,920
He's the worst.

2645
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:19,520
Guys, please gather around here.

2646
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,520
- Okay.
- I feel dizzy.

2647
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,780
- We've got an invitation.
- An invitation?

2648
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:24,960
I want the trainer to read it.

2649
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:25,980
What is it about?

2650
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,590
Who is it for?

2651
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:29,590
(An invitation has arrived
at Tiger Gym all of a sudden.)

2652
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:30,650
An invitation?

2653
01:25:30,650 --> 01:25:32,300
(What is the invitation about?)

2654
01:25:32,490 --> 01:25:35,060
- What?
- Why?

2655
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:37,390
- What is it?
- The 2021...

2656
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:39,600
(The 2021 New Female Player Draft)

2657
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,400
(Trainer Recruitment)

2658
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,340
The 2021 New Female Player Draft,
Trainer Recruitment.

2659
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:44,400
- What?
- What is that?

2660
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,810
Kim Yeon Koung, Kim Hee Jin,
Oh Ji Young,

2661
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:49,510
Eom Hye Seon,
Lee So Young, Ahn Hye Jin,

2662
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:53,440
and Park Eun Jin will be placed
in the draft on Running Man.

2663
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,140
They fascinated the whole nation...

2664
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:57,810
(Kim Yeon Koung and Kim Hee Jin)

2665
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,020
The nation's beloved center.

2666
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:01,930
(Eom Hye Seon and Oh Ji Young)

2667
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:05,020
(Ahn Hye Jin,
Lee So Young, Park Eun Jin)

2668
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:09,190
(The volleyball players are
placed in the Running League Draft.)

2669
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:11,890
(Trainer Kook is excited
to see the super rookies.)

2670
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:14,210
(However...)

2671
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:15,860
(The bold rookies don't care
about the gym's financial problem.)

2672
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:18,310
(They only care about their pay.)

2673
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,100
(The rookies' assertive attitude
leaves Trainer Kook dumbfounded.)

2674
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:23,570
(And Trainer Yoo?)

2675
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:26,590
(The two gyms will have
nerve-racking battles.)

2676
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:28,720
(However...)

2677
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:29,890
(Jae Suk!)

2678
01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:34,090
(The rookies are so competitive
that they get out of control.)

2679
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:36,180
(A tall player shows up...)

2680
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:38,460
(to toy with Trainer Kook!)

2681
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:39,690
(Okay, Long Legs. Bring it on!)

2682
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:41,890
- Hey.
- Hello.

2683
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:44,390
(If I get paid 130 dollars,
I'll do as much as 130 dollars.)

2684
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:46,670
(And they get paid 320 dollars,
they'll do as much as 320 dollars.)

2685
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:50,070
(Her negotiation skills
make people lose court.)

2686
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:54,570
(She makes puppets
of the two trainers.)

2687
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:56,350
(Okay, Kwang Soo.)

2688
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:58,240
- Kwang Soo!
- Don't blame Ji Hyo.

2689
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:01,610
(The real Long Legs who are worse
than Kwang Soo visit Running Man.)

2690
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:04,720
(Female Volleyball Team,
Fierce Transfer Contract)
