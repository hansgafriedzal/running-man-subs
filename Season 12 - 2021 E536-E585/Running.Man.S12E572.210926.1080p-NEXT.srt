1
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,070
(Last week)

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,850
Today, we have Trainer Kook...

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,390
(Trainer Kook decided to foster good
athletes to revive Tiger Gym.)

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,960
(So he accepted new members
and trained them harshly.)

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,660
Do you think
that loyalty is important or not?

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,960
(The members went through
harsh training...)

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,530
(for the revival of Tiger Gym.)

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,330
- I feel bad for him.
- You two, please stand up.

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,300
- Is this a prison camp?
- Tell us what we did wrong.

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,030
It's over the net.

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:36,370
(Thanks to the trainer, the members
have become good athletes.)

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,050
Good job. That's the power
of a middle-aged man.

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,650
(During the hard training,
they got something.)

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,880
(The members
who just finished their training...)

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,290
(got an invitation out of the blue.)

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,000
(What is the invitation for?)

17
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,760
(Surprised)

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,520
(What is the invitation about?)

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,130
(The 2021 New Female Player Draft,
Trainer Recruitment)

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,910
(Kim Yeon Koung)

21
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,270
(Kim Hee Jin, Oh Ji Young)

22
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,650
(Yeum Hye Seon,
Lee So Young, Ahn Hye Jin)

23
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,310
(Park Eun Jin)

24
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,370
(Coming soon)

25
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,480
(The national volleyball players
are participating in the draft.)

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,660
(Trainer Kook smiles broadly
looking at the amazing rookies.)

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,590
(However)

28
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,120
(The uncontrollable rookies
dominate the gym.)

29
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,560
(Jae Suk!)

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,000
(Okay, Kwang Soo.)

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,030
Okay, Kwang Soo.

32
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,060
- One more time. Feeling!
- Intuition!

33
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,730
(The draft with the best rookies
will begin soon.)

34
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,200
We are recruiting new trainers...

35
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,840
to bring in promising rookies, so we
look forward to your participation.

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,780
So, this team...

37
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,220
- To lead this team?
- Today's winner...

38
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,310
will be a new trainer
to train the promising rookies.

39
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,560
- Really?
- What?

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,310
I mean, next week.

41
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,030
- What?
- There's no chance I can win.

42
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,090
- Me neither.
- There will be Kim Yeon Koung...

43
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,120
and many other players.

44
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
- Hang on.
- I want to be a trainer.

45
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,620
Will Sang Jun be
here again next week?

46
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,000
We don't know yet.
It depends on the results.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,470
Really? Then I'll try hard
from now on.

48
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,140
- I didn't know.
- It's too late.

49
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,860
- I'll come back next week.
- All right.

50
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,030
Can I become a trainer too?

51
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,030
You can.

52
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,370
- My gosh.
- Is there a chance of an upset?

53
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,410
This is thrilling.

54
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,870
A trainer to lead this team?

55
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,940
(This is how they set up a new gym.)

56
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,780
(A week later)

57
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,780
(The day of the draft)

58
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,900
Hello. I'm Caster Jung Woo Young...

59
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,120
who will host
the 2022 Running League Draft.

60
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,270
Just like last year, we have
a lot of promising rookies...

61
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,560
in the Korean sporting world.

62
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,210
A lot of gymnasiums who got
the invitation from the league...

63
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,570
competed fiercely for the draft.

64
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,250
And only two trainers won
the draft rights to the rookies.

65
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,540
(Trainer Kook from Tiger Gym)

66
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,540
(And Trainer Yoo Jae Suk?)

67
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,220
(Last week, they had the last match
for the huge prize money.)

68
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,160
(They struggled
to win the prize money.)

69
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,530
(A snailfish shows up.)

70
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,060
I'll announce the final results.

71
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,270
(The winner was announced
after the match.)

72
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,000
The trainer who will get a new gym
and 800 dollars is...

73
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,180
(Captain Yoo became a new trainer...)

74
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,780
(after pocketing
the membership fee.)

75
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,410
(I want to get away
from Trainer Kook,)

76
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,020
(so I kept pocketing the money.)

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,460
(I will bring shame to you.)

78
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,780
(I have my own gym now,
so keep your mouth shut!)

79
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,850
(Trainer Kook of Tiger Gym)

80
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,770
(Trainer Yoo of Locust Gym)

81
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,270
The trainers who are here
to unearth the promising rookies...

82
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,910
will enter now.

83
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,910
"Pain is a gift from up above."

84
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,210
Trainer Kim Jong Kook of Tiger Gym.

85
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,470
(Trainer Kook of Tiger Gym.)

86
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,750
"A student of today
is a rival of tomorrow."

87
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,020
Trainer Yoo Jae Suk of Locust Gym.

88
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,880
All right.

89
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,820
- Chan Hee is back.
- He's back.

90
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,290
(Both trainers are talkative.)

91
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,220
(Trainer Yoo trained by Trainer Kim
is seeking to bring in rookies.)

92
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,470
Nice to meet you.

93
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,290
- Nice to meet you.
- All right.

94
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,140
(They take a seat
making idle remarks.)

95
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,340
Trainer Yoo won the last race.

96
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,600
- That's right.
- He was just lucky.

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,880
So I'm the owner of my team.

98
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,040
I made it happen.

99
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,320
So you became independent
from Trainer Kook.

100
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,170
Right. Like I always say,

101
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,090
I don't like to work for someone.

102
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,550
I should let him go when it's time.

103
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,850
- Right.
- I see.

104
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,550
I do admire Trainer Kook's
athletic ability...

105
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,760
- and experience. But...
- I see.

106
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,900
he still lives in the past.

107
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,160
It's like an apprentice system.

108
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,430
- Do I live in the past?
- He's too strict.

109
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,770
- I'm rather strategic.
- Really?

110
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,510
- I utilize AI.
- You think you use your brain.

111
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,230
- That's right.
- I'm not like that.

112
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,340
Training brings about good results.

113
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,210
- I see.
- It's all about training.

114
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,150
I don't know
who will join my team yet,

115
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,890
but I'll make sure
to filter out the players...

116
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,780
who are not good enough...

117
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,320
- to participate in the draft.
- We have to.

118
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,350
- That's what we have to do.
- Right.

119
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,460
- Now the first players will enter.
- Who is it?

120
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,420
Do we have to see the players
coming from that way?

121
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,990
"I will show you the power
of a father with three children."

122
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,070
He's an old rookie, Haha.

123
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,230
He doesn't look that way,
but he used to be a student athlete.

124
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,230
An old rookie, Yang Se Chan.

125
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,340
(Yang Se Chan used to be
in an athletic club.)

126
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,670
They're making a fuss already.

127
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,170
I can't pay them
more than five cents.

128
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,980
Do we really have to pay them?

129
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,980
(Their lame performance
doesn't even deserve 5 cents.)

130
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,660
I can't pay them
more than five cents.

131
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,330
- We're here.
- I don't like stuff like this.

132
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,590
I don't like it either.

133
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,720
- Sport is no joke.
- Sure.

134
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,900
- When you exercise...
- I know.

135
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,270
The father of three children
is so pretentious.

136
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,900
He's so annoying.

137
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,530
All right. I'll introduce
the next players.

138
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,270
"I'm on the next 60-level."

139
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,970
"But I have a heart
of the MZ Generation."

140
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,170
An old rookie, Ji Suk Jin.

141
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,150
A good face.

142
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,580
Good power.

143
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,720
And good dating skills.

144
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,410
Song Ji Hyo.

145
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,110
A touching story of a forever judge.

146
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,760
An old rookie, Jeon So Min.

147
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,290
- They are...
- They are all of a sort.

148
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,770
Are they traffic lights or what?

149
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,090
I'm watching...

150
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,270
- their movements carefully.
- Turn around.

151
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,470
But I haven't seen anything useful.

152
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,080
There's nothing worth
saving from them.

153
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,510
Gosh, it's hot.
Why is it so hot in here?

154
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,010
- Look at the guy in the blue suit.
- Okay.

155
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,340
That guy is...

156
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,110
- What about me?
- He's a troublemaker.

157
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,610
- He's a troublemaker.
- Right.

158
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,450
- What?
- We're better off without him.

159
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,820
Did you hear the rumor already?

160
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,390
Let's hurry and...

161
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,020
- We should move on.
- Right.

162
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,260
Let's move on to the main round.

163
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,530
All right then.

164
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,850
I'm excited.

165
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,790
- You've waited so long.
- We have to do this.

166
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,590
- The promising rookies will...
- All right.

167
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,220
- enter now.
- Promising rookies.

168
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,990
- Enter now.
- Who are they?

169
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,230
Christian has the Bible.

170
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,160
Buddhism has Buddhist scriptures.

171
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,930
And volleyball...

172
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,140
has Kim Yeon Koung.

173
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,380
Rookie Kim Yeon Koung.

174
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,800
(All-time number one
volleyball player, Kim Yeon Koung)

175
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,040
She's a rookie.

176
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,280
The Olympic top four good-looker,

177
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,890
Rookie Kim Hee Jin.

178
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,020
(The byword for good looks,
Kim Hee Jin)

179
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,180
This is unbelievable.

180
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,050
- They look so cool.
- They are perfectly proportioned.

181
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,260
They look amazing.
They are like models.

182
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,420
(The two pillars
of the national volleyball team)

183
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,360
(The living legend recognized
around the world, Kim Yeon Koung)

184
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,510
(Powerful spike
that nothing can block)

185
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,710
(An all-around player
with an impenetrable defense)

186
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,510
(Captain Yeon Koung's leadership
brings her team together.)

187
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,450
(We live in the time
of Kim Yeon Koung.)

188
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,220
(The powerful main armament
of the national team, Kim Hee Jin)

189
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,660
(She sends a ball
only to empty spots like GPS.)

190
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,960
(Her destructive offense
from the 3-meter-high point)

191
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,130
(High-level defense)

192
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,160
(Showing the impenetrable blocking,)

193
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,430
(the magical teddy bear
captivated people's hearts.)

194
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,880
(The rookies who live up
their names show up.)

195
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,080
They're really tall.

196
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,080
Kwang Soo!

197
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,340
Kwang Soo!

198
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,170
- Isn't this what you do?
- In 1, 2, and 3.

199
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,520
(They ignore
what other members say.)

200
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,660
They look amazing.

201
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,660
(A heart serve)

202
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,630
They show good performances.

203
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,190
(The old rookies' lame toss)

204
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,320
(She responds to it
with a sweet spike.)

205
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,600
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

206
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,030
It's so nice to see you here.

207
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,600
Thank you.

208
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,510
- Hello.
- Hello.

209
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,800
- You're the best.
- By the way...

210
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,780
- Hello.
- You guys look...

211
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,480
- like models.
- Hello.

212
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,750
- You look amazing.
- Unbelievable.

213
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,300
(They have the charisma
that comes from their height.)

214
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,440
They're so tall.

215
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,850
As Yeon Koung walked in,

216
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,080
- she looked like Kwang Soo.
- I thought she was Kwang Soo.

217
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
- She was like Kwang Soo.
- I get that a lot.

218
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,180
- I know.
- Her long hair.

219
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,860
- They say we have similar images.
- This is unbelievable.

220
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,030
Seriously, you look
just like Kwang Soo.

221
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,230
You look just like him.

222
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,500
I will try to replace
Kwang Soo today.

223
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,420
- Because I look like him.
- Okay.

224
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,160
And we have Hee Jin here.

225
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,100
- She's really handsome.
- I know.

226
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,800
- All right. Go up there.
- Why?

227
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,110
You guys are standing up now.

228
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,280
You didn't stand up when we came in.

229
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Just go back to your seats.

230
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,300
- My goodness.
- All right then.

231
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,750
- Let's sit.
- Gosh, it's hot.

232
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,020
- I got the vaccine yesterday.
- Gosh, Suk Jin.

233
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,020
Turn on the AC.
Suk Jin is feeling hot.

234
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,810
He got the vaccine yesterday,
so he's running a fever.

235
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,760
He had the second Pfizer shot,
so he's feeling hot.

236
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
I got the second Pfizer shot.
I'm feeling really hot.

237
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,320
Today...

238
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,160
Since you got the second shot,

239
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,870
- you may go home early.
- Right. You should go home.

240
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,460
No, I'm fine.

241
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,770
- They're so cool. Their shoes.
- They are amazing.

242
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,690
We have five more players.

243
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,830
(There are more players to meet.)

244
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,300
Number one in the dig ranking
of the Tokyo Olympics.

245
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,330
She's the best libero,

246
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,880
Rookie Oh Ji Young.

247
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,800
- Libero!
- Oh Ji Young.

248
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,070
She's the nation's beloved setter
with volleyball DNA,

249
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,250
Rookie Yeum Hye Seon.

250
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,150
- Yeum Hye Seon!
- Yeum Hye Seon!

251
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,780
(After Ji Young's defense,
Hye Seon scores.)

252
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,030
Welcome!

253
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,730
Hello.

254
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,600
(The official scoring duo,
Yeum Hye Seon and Oh Ji Young)

255
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,320
(Yeum Hye Seon: Setter)

256
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,600
(She's the master
of a spin-free serve.)

257
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,700
(Her dancing serve emasculates
the opposition defense.)

258
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,940
(But she also shows good defense.)

259
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,440
(Nation's beloved setter,
Yeum Hye Seon)

260
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,580
(Oh Ji Young: Libero)

261
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,680
(Perfect defense ranked first
in the digs of the Tokyo Olympics)

262
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,730
(Oh Ji Young receives the ball...)

263
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,920
(and Yeum Hye Seon finishes it.)

264
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,320
(All scores start with her defense.)

265
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,400
(Forever libero, Oh Ji Young)

266
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,660
(The keepers of the national team
show up.)

267
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,800
Throw the ball.

268
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,010
(The libero's spike performance)

269
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,200
(Excited)

270
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,570
They're the best.

271
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,940
Hello.

272
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,680
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

273
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,910
(Since they are volleyball players,
they slap high-fives.)

274
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,360
- That was amazing.
- This is what they do.

275
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,050
I saw them do this.

276
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,190
Please come here.

277
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,920
- You guys do this when you score.
- Right.

278
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,270
That's so cool.

279
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,530
- Please say hello.
- We have Ji Young and Hye Seon.

280
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,370
When they were with other players,

281
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,430
- they didn't look so cool.
- Right.

282
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,010
- But in the flesh...
- In the flesh,

283
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,480
Hye Seon and Ji Young are very tall.

284
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,110
- We have to look up at them.
- I know.

285
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,940
It's not like that.
Before I came here...

286
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,480
They all are very tall.

287
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,310
I didn't want to look short,
so I put on high heels.

288
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,160
- I didn't want to look short.
- I understand.

289
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,160
Please have a seat.

290
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,420
All right. Please have a seat.

291
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,550
This is really...

292
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,920
My goodness.

293
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,900
- The place is full.
- Trainer Kook and I will...

294
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,000
My goodness.

295
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,870
I'm not sure if it's okay
to pick players I want.

296
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,030
We have three players left.

297
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,700
I'll introduce them all together.

298
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,850
She's an all-around player who's
good at attacking and defending.

299
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,250
She's called Air So Young.
Rookie Lee So Young.

300
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,780
- Lee So Young.
- So Young.

301
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,210
She's called Jangchung Shin Min A
with perfect serves.

302
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,360

303
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,780
Jangchung Shin Min A!

304
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,180
- The new cute giant at the center!
- Who looks like Shin Min A?

305
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,000
- The rookie player, Park Eun Jin?
- Shin Min A?

306
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,900
(The new cute giant Park Eun Jin
who blocks the center area)

307
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,370
(The Generation MZ who dominated
the Tokyo Olympics are here.)

308
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,930
(The youngest players
with skills and passion...)

309
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,510
(who are the future
of Korean volleyball)

310
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,700
(Lee So Young, left-side hitter)

311
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,670
She scored a point at the right time
whenever she joined the game.

312
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,280
(She scored a point whenever needed
with her jump skill and agility.)

313
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,880
She's hitting the ball.
And it worked.

314
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,940
(She destroys blocks
with her unique bowstring spikes.)

315
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,850
(Air So Young)

316
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,850
I agree.

317
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,410
(Ahn Hye Jin,
setter and right-side hitter)

318
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,050
Ahn Hye Jin is
serving the ball again.

319
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,660

320
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,360
(The master of tricky serves
that are hard to receive)

321
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,030
Player substitution.
Park Eun Jin is going in.

322
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,400
(Park Eun Jin, middle blocker)

323
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,660
Park Eun Jin hit the ball.

324
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,030
She hit it long. But it's blocked.

325
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,530
Kim Yeon Koung scored.

326
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,640
(She turns the tide
whenever her team faces a crisis.)

327
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:19,930
Park Eun Jin hit the ball.

328
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,410
She hit it long. But it's blocked.

329
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,170
(The team scores
whenever Eun Jin serves.)

330
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,210
- Eun Jin served the ball very well.
- Exactly.

331
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,310
(Park Eun Jin is the starting point
of all attacks.)

332
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,490
- Juggle, everyone!
- Oh, my.

333
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,660
(The Youngest Avengers are here.)

334
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,680
My goodness.

335
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,120
(The members are welcoming them
with an air juggling performance.)

336
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,450
Welcome!

337
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,660
- They're all so tall.
- I know, right?

338
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,320
- They're so tall.
- Indeed.

339
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,660
(The cuties are here.)

340
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,260
They planned it together.

341
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,660
It's nice to see you all.

342
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,000
- It's nice to see you.
- Hello.

343
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,290
- Welcome.
- Hello.

344
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,190
- The cuties are here.
- Hey, why are you standing there?

345
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,530
- Hello.
- Welcome.

346
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,410
(They bumped into each other.)

347
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,700
- Hi.
- This is so exciting.

348
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,740
(But the passionate youngest players
didn't care.)

349
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,070
- I'm exhilarated.
- Let's go!

350
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,510
This is so exciting.

351
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,520
(It feels like a festival.)

352
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,540
- So Min is 170cm tall. She's tall.
- Right. I'm not small.

353
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,860
- But she looks so cute.
- Stand right next to her.

354
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,180
- I'm surprised.
- I know.

355
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,180
They're all so tall.

356
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,730
Hey, kids, go back to your seats.

357
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,660
- They look like babies now.
- I'm so excited.

358
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,230
Come on. Stop joking around
and go to your seats, kids.

359
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,600
Today,

360
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,560
- Jong Kook is excited.
- Trainer Kook and I...

361
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,870
(Jong Kook likes it
when athletes come on the show.)

362
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,870
- He's excited.
- Sorry?

363
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,060
You look so cute
standing next to Yeon Koung.

364
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,640
- You look like a baby.
- Can you pinch his cheeks?

365
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,910
- Please do that for us.
- Pinch his cheeks.

366
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,380
- Pinch his cheeks just once.
- I can't stand next to her.

367
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,200
Can you just pat him on the head?

368
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,880
- Put your arm around my shoulders.
- Right.

369
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,710
- My, he looks so cute.
- How cute.

370
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,850
- Whenever you get bored...
- Kwang Soo.

371
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,180
She looks like Kwang Soo.

372
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,350
- How cute.
- We haven't met anyone...

373
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,410
- She did it like Kwang Soo used to.
- as tall as Kwang Soo in a while.

374
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,950
- They all look fabulous.
- Now we'll begin the interview...

375
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,820
- to learn more about the rookies.
- That's important.

376
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,530
Before that, let's give the national
volleyball team players...

377
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,420
- a round of applause.
- All right.

378
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,740
Welcome.

379
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,100
(The national volleyball team
players, welcome.)

380
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,660
They're so cool.

381
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,300
Their games moved my heart.

382
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,830
- They were incredible.
- I was touched too.

383
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,280
- No words can describe it.
- Exactly.

384
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,480
- It was amazing.
- I was filming the game at the end.

385
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,910
- Really?
- Yes, the moment of the victory.

386
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,440
He's excited.

387
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,990
- He must be happy to meet them.
- He seems so happy.

388
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,150
- He's a big fan of athletes.
- He gets so excited.

389
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,660
- He's exhilarated now.
- I was recording that moment.

390
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,180
- You filmed as you're watching it?
- His left foot is out.

391
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,320
I was sure that they would win.

392
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
As a workout enthusiast,
it was so amazing.

393
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
(He got choked with emotion
and couldn't go on.)

394
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,030
- I see.
- He looks like an athlete.

395
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,060
- He looks like an athlete.
- He's just a gym lover.

396
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,770
- I'm just a gym lover.
- Yes.

397
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,660
- He just loves to work out.
- I'm a gym lover.

398
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,270
I'm like an expert
when it comes to that.

399
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,430
He's like a town gym lover
who can be seen in any town.

400
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,980
(Laughing)

401
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,380
(The gym lover is excited to meet
the international sports stars.)

402
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,380
- He likes to train others too.
- True. I like that too.

403
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,310
We'll interview each of you briefly.

404
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,520
- First up is Yeon Koung.
- Yes.

405
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,180
How have you been
since the Olympics?

406
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,890
- I've been doing great.
- Yes.

407
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,820
I got a lot of offers
for advertisements.

408
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,000
- You deserve it.
- Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

409
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,130
You all worked hard.

410
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,690
If I were close to her,
I would've asked her to treat me.

411
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,130
Hey, be quiet.

412
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,600
Come on. Be quiet!

413
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,640
(The original steps up.)

414
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,010
- How dare you make a noise?
- What did you say?

415
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,380
I'm here as a rookie too.

416
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,610
By the way, Suk Jin,
are you not feeling well?

417
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,510
- I think he is. He's sweating.
- He's sweating.

418
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,040
Why would I be feeling unwell?

419
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,710
- I mean it's such a special day.
- Are you all right?

420
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,850
- Don't mind me and go on.
- We need a stretcher.

421
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,020
He really is sweating here.

422
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,410
- His lips are so pale.
- Gosh, seriously.

423
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,760
- I'm worried about him.
- Shouldn't he lie down?

424
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,490
- Gosh. This is driving me nuts.
- His lips are so pale.

425
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:30,290
Anyway, Yeon Koung, you've been
the team captain for a long time.

426
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,420
Have you ever thought
that you're bossy?

427
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,900
- I'm sure she has.
- Right.

428
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,830
I think... Have I ever been bossy?

429
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,910
Pardon?

430
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,640
- You just acted bossy.
- Did I?

431
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,010
- Yes, you did.
- That's what bossy people say.

432
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,280
- "Have I ever been bossy?"
- Right?

433
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,850
- Oh, I didn't realize that.
- She didn't know.

434
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,800
- To be honest, I'm not sure.
- I see.

435
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,880
- But sometimes...
- You didn't realize it, right?

436
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,570
- No, I didn't.
- That proves you're bossy.

437
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,890
- Gosh. I'm bossy?
- You're bossy if you don't know.

438
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,310
- If you do, you're not bossy.
- That's right.

439
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,550
Hey, have I ever been bossy to you?

440
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,420
- Answer me.
- It's good to see you, Yeon Koung.

441
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,860
(The bossy Haha jumps in.)

442
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,000
I am bossy too.

443
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,900
Don't talk while I'm talking!

444
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,790
(In terms of that, he's on the same
level as Queen Yeon Koung.)

445
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,370
Hey, listen.
Don't talk while I'm talking.

446
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,230
We have so many bossy people here.
There are three of them.

447
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,230
- She's definitely bossy.
- They love being bossy.

448
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,740
What did he say?

449
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,000
- What was the question?
- You didn't realize it, right?

450
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,050
Suk Jin just whispered to me...

451
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,470
asking what we were talking about.

452
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,050
- He wasn't even listening.
- We're talking about being bossy.

453
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,510
- He didn't hear you.
- I see.

454
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,290
- He never listens to others. Bossy.
- That's true.

455
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,360
- Then let's ask her teammates.
- Let's do that.

456
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,720
Has any of you ever thought...

457
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,420
- that Yeon Koung was bossy?
- Tell us.

458
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,600
- That never happened, but...
- I see.

459
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,020
We once said we wanted to cover her
with a blanket...

460
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,070
- and beat her up at least once.
- That's right.

461
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,300
- Covering her with a blanket?
- Yes.

462
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,960
(Covering her with a blanket
and hitting her?)

463
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,110
Covering her with a blanket?
What does that mean?

464
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,910
- After all the matches ended...
- You wanted to hit Yeon Koung?

465
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,550
we all had a beef with her
after several months.

466
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,080
- So on the last day...
- Like slapping her on the back?

467
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,550
- No, we'd kick her too.
- Just like a game penalty.

468
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,240
It would never be
just slapping me on the back.

469
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,890
- Well, she said that.
- They'd beat me up...

470
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,560
without letting me know who hit me.

471
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,950
That's what a blanket is for.

472
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,210
- That's right.
- Oh, I see.

473
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,020
Then how about we give you
a chance to do so at the end?

474
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,450
Sure. If you prepare a blanket,
I would...

475
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,360
- Why don't you make a promise?
- It will be a good chance.

476
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,750
- We'd appreciate it.
- What's with you?

477
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,490
- Really? They all like the idea.
- Do you have a blanket?

478
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,830
- A blanket.
- We'd appreciate it very much.

479
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,040
We don't even need a blanket.
Just cover her face.

480
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,410
- We just need to cover her face.
- Just her face.

481
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,760
Oh, my. You all seem so excited.

482
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,640
- Considering their reactions...
- We should do it today.

483
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,170
- Pardon me?
- We should do it today.

484
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,610
Are you saying you want to try it?

485
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,880
Please step forward.

486
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Are you saying you want to try it?

487
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,170
(He approves of it unintentionally
with a pale face.)

488
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,550
Let's cover him with the carpet.

489
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,620
- I didn't mean it.
- Help him.

490
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,590
- That's not what I meant.
- We'll cover his face with this.

491
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,290
(Since the vaccination, Pfizer Ji
volunteers to get anything.)

492
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,890
- He volunteered to be hit.
- Right.

493
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,300
In the pre-interview,
she was asked...

494
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,450
which cast members she thought
she looks better than...

495
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,600
- and to rate us on our looks.
- On our looks.

496
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,070
And she said, "Se Chan is
no match for me."

497
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,000
(She answered,
"Se Chan is no match for me.")

498
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,160
(By her standards,
Se Chan is the ugliest.)

499
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,170
That was her answer.

500
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,000
- Also...
- How could you tell them?

501
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,170
- There's one more thing.
- I only told that to the writer.

502
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,270
That means she thinks
Jae Suk is ugly too.

503
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,980
- Yes, she said that too.
- Right?

504
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,710
She said, "Jae Suk sure is popular,
but he's not handsome."

505
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,390
- That was between you and me.
- I like that comment.

506
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,590
- That's a good comment.
- She picked the two of us.

507
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,160
- You see...
- Se Chan and me.

508
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,190
One of the good things
about her is...

509
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,830
- that she always speaks her mind.
- True.

510
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,920
- She gave an honest answer.
- Yes.

511
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,340
When you were invited to this show,

512
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,540
you said you wanted to be here
with your junior players.

513
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,570
- What was the reason?
- I wonder why.

514
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,610
- I'm too embarrassed to say it.
- I see.

515
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,640
Do you want me to do it for you?

516
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,550
Actually, I got invited
to many other TV shows as well.

517
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,050
- But this is the most popular show.
- Yes.

518
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,180
It's one of the best variety shows.

519
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,620
- I'm honored to hear that.
- Thank you for saying that.

520
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,180
And they all are huge fans
of this show.

521
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,660
- Really?
- They love this show.

522
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,860
So I divided them into two groups.

523
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,090
One group would be on another show
with me.

524
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,420
- And the other would be here.
- Oh, I see.

525
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,630
- You divided them into two groups?
- As far as I heard...

526
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,900
Actually, I met Yang Hyo Jin
and Kim Su Ji.

527
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,340
- Yes.
- And Su Ji told me the same thing.

528
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,000
"We wanted to be on 'Running Man'
too, but Yeon Koung divided us."

529
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,200
- They weren't chosen.
- Did you randomly divide them?

530
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
No, that's not true.

531
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,500
- I let them choose the show.
- I see.

532
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,970
The players who didn't play long
in the games...

533
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,740
- wouldn't get many chances...
- You're right.

534
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,470
- to appear on a TV show.
- You did the right thing.

535
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,290
So I suggested we should give them
a chance too...

536
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,180
and divide the team.

537
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,410
It's always the same person who gets
to be on a TV show. It's Hee Jin.

538
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,980
It's always the same person,
and it's Hee Jin.

539
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,750
- That's true.
- Hee Jin appeared on many shows.

540
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,800
- I mean, she didn't play that well.
- Okay.

541
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,490
But she's the only one
who gets invited to those shows.

542
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,720
- She appeared on many shows.
- She's so funny.

543
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,900
- She's hilarious.
- That's not fair.

544
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,600
- They have so much to talk about.
- Right.

545
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,960
I saw her on "The Manager"
not long ago.

546
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,410
You're right. She appeared
on a lot of shows.

547
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,170
- She's done all sorts of stuff.
- I can see that.

548
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,470
- That's true.
- She filmed a TV commercial too.

549
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,910
Are the others scheduled
to be on another show?

550
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,620
- No.
- No, they're not.

551
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,320
- They didn't get invited.
- That will change after this.

552
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,910
- Give it your all.
- Okay.

553
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,320
- Let's do this.
- We can do this.

554
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,160
- Things will work out well for you.
- Let's do this.

555
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,360
- We'll kill it.
- Pour everything you have in this.

556
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,520
First of all, Hee Jin was chosen
as a national team player...

557
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,600
- when she was in 12th grade.
- She was in 12th grade?

558
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
(She joined the national team
at the age of 19.)

559
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,160
It's hard for a high school student
to be chosen.

560
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,200
- She has short hair now,
- Yes.

561
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,260
- but her photo with long hair...
- Yes.

562
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,700
- drew a lot of attention.
- That's right.

563
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,270
- Yes.
- They'll reveal that photo.

564
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,620
- She had twin tails back then.
- Oh, no.

565
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,270
- It's viral.
- I want to see it.

566
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,980
- They'll show us the photo.
- Do we have her photo?

567
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,550
Really? She had twin tails?

568
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,820
(The comedians are pretending
they saw the photo.)

569
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,450
She really had
that hairstyle before?

570
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,090
(Laughing)

571
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,180
(Staring)

572
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,020
- I'm scared.
- She's so scary.

573
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,900
- We comedians are good at this.
- We can make it funnier.

574
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,190
Hee Jin, you said
that you're quite tenderhearted,

575
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,870
and that you get timid
whenever you make a mistake.

576
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,930
That's understandable.

577
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,200
- I could see that about you.
- True.

578
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,200
- I always want to do well.
- Yes.

579
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,850
And I should score points
as an offensive player.

580
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,350
So I get downcast
when I can't score enough points.

581
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,850
Is it just how you feel?

582
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,330
- Or are you worried about someone?
- Does someone put pressure on you?

583
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,330
(Glancing)

584
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,300
(She glanced at Yeon Koung
instead of answering.)

585
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,070
- She just looked at...
- Is someone over there?

586
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,190
- Was there someone there?
- Is anyone there?

587
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,610
Is there anyone over there?

588
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,230
- I think she looked over there.
- She looked...

589
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,810
- Is someone going to come out?
- I think she looked over there.

590
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,040
But I saw her eyes...

591
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,080
- I have a slight squint.
- Okay.

592
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,810
I'm pretty sure she looked...

593
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,110
I see.

594
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:23,290
If I had to talk about our teams...
I won't say their names.

595
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,010
But some of the cast members won't
be happy to join...

596
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,750
- Trainer Kook's team.
- Absolutely.

597
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,160
- They won't be happy about it.
- I mean...

598
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
- we didn't even say anything.
- Exactly.

599
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,360
But those punks tiptoe around us
for no reason.

600
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,420
- "Those punks?"
- That's why we can't seem to...

601
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,720
- He said, "those punks."
- perform at our very best.

602
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,070
- That's exactly my point.
- Yes.

603
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,640
- So Min, anything you want to say?
- Yes?

604
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,930
- Do you have anything to say?
- No.

605
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,930
(She cautiously says no.)

606
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,230
- Is there anything you want to say?
- No, sir.

607
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,910
You've dressed like a referee again.

608
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,000
Look at the color.

609
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,140
Right.

610
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,910
I guess she has no intention
of playing in any games.

611
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,120
- Next up is Yeum Hye Seon.
- All right.

612
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,350
The three generations of your family
have played volleyball.

613
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,210
- Is that true?
- Really?

614
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,360
- Really? That's cool.
- I didn't know that.

615
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,160
Your grandmother and your parents
used to play volleyball.

616
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,480
- Really?
- Yes, that's true.

617
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,250
- I see.
- But...

618
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,800
- they were not so famous.
- Even so.

619
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,990
- But they used to play volleyball.
- Oh, I see.

620
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,370
- Your grandmother too?
- Yes.

621
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,490
- So I...
- That should be a long time ago.

622
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,100
Oh, my. That's impressive.

623
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,930
So whenever she has a game...

624
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,110
- Since it's a volleyball family,
- That's right.

625
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,640
- your parents and grandmother...
- True.

626
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,700
often nag you about how you play.

627
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,940
- I'm sure they do.
- They did so in the early years.

628
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,470
- Did your grandmother do that too?
- When I was a freshman in college,

629
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,120
my grandma called me
after every game I played in.

630
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,440
- What did she say?
- What did she say?

631
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,620
At first, she said,

632
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,520
"What was that?
You call that a game?"

633
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,590
- That's so funny.
- But I couldn't yell at her.

634
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,160
- I think I know how it feels.
- That's so funny.

635
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,630
She imitated her grandmother.

636
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,960
- She must've told you her stories.
- That was hilarious.

637
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,800
"Goodness. What was that?"

638
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,230
- "Do you call that volleyball?"
- "Do you call that a game?"

639
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,640
"You're there to play volleyball.
What have you been doing?"

640
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,370
- She said things like that.
- She sounds like a granny.

641
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,080
But I hated to hear her nagging.

642
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,700
Didn't your grandmother say anything
after the Olympics?

643
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,200
After the Olympics,

644
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,440
she was busy playing gateball.

645
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,090
Can she let Suk Jin join her?

646
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,510
Why don't you...

647
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,510
- She was busy playing gateball?
- Suk Jin could join her...

648
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,590
- She's funny.
- Indeed. She's so funny.

649
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,830
- She's really funny.
- Yes, she is.

650
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,160
- I like her story. Hye Seon,
- Right?

651
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,720
I'll give you an extra point
for your story.

652
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,600
- You get points for funny stories.
- Yes.

653
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,100
- That was a good one.
- He evaluates their sense of humor.

654
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,430
Exactly.

655
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,230
- I see her nickname here.
- Right.

656
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,370
She has a nickname? Oh, my.
What is this?

657
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,640
- What does Yeum Cheater mean?
- What does it mean?

658
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,240
(Yeum Cheater?)

659
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,410
- She's a crook.
- Yeum Cheater?

660
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,410
"Yeum" as in "salt?"

661
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,850
- No, her family name.
- Like "The Boy Who Cried Wolf."

662
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,820
- There are a few entertainers...
- Oh, I see.

663
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,010
who have the image of a crook.

664
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,010
- That's true.
- Today's show will be fun.

665
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,090
- Is she a crook?
- Watch out for her.

666
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,020
For example, when I block
during a game,

667
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,630
and it's obvious
that the ball hits my hand,

668
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,630
I'd lie that it didn't touch my hand
without a guilty look.

669
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,830
- Oh, I get it.
- I see.

670
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,900
- They all need that kind of skill.
- I see.

671
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,640
- That's why I got that nickname.
- That's a good thing for the team.

672
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,700
- It's embarrassing.
- Su Ji talked about it too.

673
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,930
No player would admit it
if the ball touches their hands.

674
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,310
- Really?
- Yes.

675
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:05,470
But in her case, it's unreasonable
because if it's obvious...

676
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,580
- True.
- that it touched her hand,

677
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,510
- she should admit it.
- She should admit it?

678
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,980
- But she denies even in that case.
- Let me explain.

679
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,160
- The other team would request VAR.
- I mean...

680
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,510
- I'd deny until they ask for it.
- They would make this signal.

681
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,360
- Everyone saw that.
- I wouldn't admit it until then.

682
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,520
- But she would deny.
- She keeps denying until then?

683
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,900
- Yes, she would keep denying.
- Really?

684
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,220
- What's funny is...
- Really?

685
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,860
that she even lies
to her teammates too.

686
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,630
- Really? What does she say?
- Even her teammates.

687
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,870
- "It didn't touch my hand."
- That she didn't touch it.

688
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,230
- When we ask her...
- Then they'd use VAR.

689
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,540
if she touched the ball,
she would say she didn't.

690
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,960
- It's not like that.
- Right?

691
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,070
- Let me explain.
- What happens when it's confirmed?

692
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,770
- I just apologize.
- She apologizes.

693
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,910
But she knew it all along.

694
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,770
- I'd say sorry.
- By the way, Yeum Cheater.

695
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,470
If your hands moved,
you can't deny it.

696
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,890
But it works once in a while.

697
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,320
- Really?
- Because she denies?

698
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,160
It works sometimes
since I have short arms.

699
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,060
- If it works 1 out of 10 times...
- Even when I tell the truth,

700
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,520
- they don't believe me now.
- We don't believe her.

701
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,090
Then I would say
that I'm really telling the truth,

702
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,690
- but they don't believe me.
- She's just like us.

703
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,260
- I see why you got that nickname.
- Like "The Boy Who Cried Wolf?"

704
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,960
Is that why your nickname is
Yeum Cheater?

705
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,600
- Next, we'll interview Ji Young.
- Okay.

706
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,370
- It's Ji Young's turn.
- As for Ji Young,

707
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,930
- I met her on another show.
- Did you?

708
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:10,200
You look more sophisticated
than you did last time.

709
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,150
- His pronunciation is funny.
- I was wearing my uniform then.

710
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,510
- Oh, that's why.
- Yes.

711
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,210
Are you saying
that she looked tacky before?

712
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,410
- Right? He subtly criticized...
- Exactly.

713
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,710
- Don't make a comment like that.
- Wait.

714
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,410
He thinks that the national team
uniform looked tacky.

715
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,420
- I agree.
- Right?

716
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,160
He just said that our uniform
looked tacky.

717
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,330
When did I say that?

718
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,750
- Right?
- How dare you say such a thing?

719
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,160
- She's good.
- Keep going.

720
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,220
That's great.

721
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,870
- Oh Ji Young!
- Oh Ji Young!

722
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,260
- Let's do this!
- Oh Ji Young!

723
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,040
Let's make it hard for him
to say anything.

724
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,230
This is great!

725
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,040
- She should be an offensive player.
- Hey.

726
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,240
You must know that I never used
the word "tacky."

727
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,210
- You never use that word.
- I just said that she became...

728
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,740
- even more sophisticated.
- That's right.

729
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,510
- Anyway, Ji Young, that's it.
- We should be careful.

730
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,710
- When we hire players...
- Oh, right.

731
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,210
- Wait. No.
- You see,

732
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,510
- I consider everything.
- I mean she didn't stop...

733
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,250
- Let's not hire her.
- When I interviewed her before,

734
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,860
- she bad-mouthed the coach too.
- Really?

735
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,990
- She backbit him.
- Did she really do that?

736
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,260
- Yes, she did.
- Stop saying that.

737
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,840
- Oh Ji Young, checked.
- Which page is she on?

738
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,800
- She's on Page Ten.
- I see.

739
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,870
- Hey, don't join his team.
- Okay.

740
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,540
- I'll never join his team.
- Good.

741
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,380
Oh Ji Young should be our trainer!

742
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,110
- Even if my team loses,
- Yes.

743
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,670
I won't hire Ji Young.

744
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,240
Trainer Yoo got upset.

745
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,710
- My goodness.
- He's upset.

746
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,320
- He's holding a grudge.
- I'll never join his team.

747
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,120
And I'll make him beg me
to join his team. You'll see.

748
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,480
She's right.
We don't have to impress them.

749
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,980
- That's true.
- Of course.

750
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,290
- What did you say?
- We didn't need to impress you.

751
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,750
You don't need to impress us.

752
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,520
We never wanted to hire you.

753
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,600
- Hiring you is like a penalty.
- Exactly.

754
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,020
You'll have to hire me eventually.

755
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,140
- That's so funny.
- We won't hire you.

756
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,500
We should talk about
your relationship with Yeon Koung.

757
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,170
Yeon Koung is one year older
than you.

758
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:50,350
You've known her since when you two
were on the youth team, right?

759
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,500
- Oh, my.
- Yes.

760
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,620
- What does she mean to you?
- I wonder that too.

761
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,940
Well... She's like my senior player
by many years.

762
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,480
Although people point out
that we both were born in 1988...

763
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,010
- What? Hold on.
- We both were born in 1988.

764
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,250
- Then you two are the same age.
- But I was born...

765
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,020
- in the early month of the year.
- Oh, I see.

766
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,990
- So I started school a year early.
- That's right.

767
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,070
That's why I'm her senior.

768
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,900
They're like me and Park Jin Young.

769
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,920
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

770
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,690
It seems that athletes have
a strict seniority system.

771
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,840
Do you use honorifics
when talking to Jin Young?

772
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,160
- Pardon?
- Do you...

773
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,430
- Can you speak more loudly?
- Speak up.

774
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,930
Do you speak formally or casually
to him?

775
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,580
I'm sorry, but if you text me,

776
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,910
- I'll reply right away.
- Please text us.

777
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,080
- Can't you hear me?
- No.

778
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,410
- We'll read it for everyone.
- Please text me instead.

779
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,510
- We'll read it for everyone.
- We'll do that.

780
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,950
There's something wrong
with their ears.

781
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,090
My goodness.

782
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,830
Hey, do you have mold in your ears?

783
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,090
- Do you have mold in your ears?
- Listen.

784
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,800
- Text me.
- Can't you hear me?

785
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,830
- Text me.
- He said "mold in the ears".

786
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,990
Why would I text you
when we can talk to each other?

787
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,630
- I can't hear you clearly.
- We can't hear you.

788
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,070
You can't hear me again?

789
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,490
- Gosh, those jerks.
- Now...

790
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,840
(He blurts out a swear word
that's inappropriate for a TV show.)

791
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,340
We make jokes like this
to make our guests laugh.

792
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,770
- Did that feel good?
- Yes!

793
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,910
Why?

794
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,850
We have an MC here too.

795
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,820
- Go on.
- He's an MC too.

796
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,590
- Stop chatting there.
- It's quite fun.

797
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,710
- Why would you interfere us?
- This is like a YouTube channel.

798
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,010
- It's so much fun.
- Let us do our own show.

799
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,130
- It's just like small talk.
- You just keep going.

800
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,630
We'll just have a little chat here.

801
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,830
We have the best MC
for small talks, so let us do this.

802
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,100
It's being broadcast simultaneously.

803
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,990
- Next up is So Young.
- All right.

804
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,730
Finally! Yes!

805
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,140
- It's her turn.
- It's her turn.

806
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,430
It's finally her turn.

807
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,340
How have you been, So Young?

808
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,500
I played in another team
before the Olympics.

809
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,670
As I transferred to a new team...

810
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,200
- That's a good thing.
- Right.

811
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,700
- It's a good thing.
- Changing your look.

812
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,710
- It was to create a new mindset.
- Upgrading yourself.

813
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,970
- She wants to show that.
- That's what it symbolizes.

814
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,320
She's determined to devote herself
to her new team.

815
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,410
We need a mindset like this too.

816
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,980
Absolutely. We all need it.

817
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,790
- I signed with a new agency.
- You did?

818
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,630
Do you think I should shave my head?

819
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,100
- I'm not afraid of doing it, but...
- I see.

820
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,990
- I'm not sure how this might sound.
- Okay.

821
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,720
People like me look very different
depending on our hairstyles.

822
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,370
- True. His look would change a lot.
- I know.

823
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,430
- You see...
- It's old-fashioned style.

824
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,110
His hairstyle doesn't make him
look handsome.

825
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,910
(He must think that he looks good
because of his hairstyle.)

826
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,340
He's delusional.

827
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,170
- He says your hair doesn't matter.
- It doesn't make you look handsome.

828
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,230
- Absolutely not.
- He says you don't look handsome.

829
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,770
- Why would he think that way?
- What makes you look better is...

830
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,670
- your glasses.
- I was so puzzled.

831
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,670
By the way...

832
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,150
- You saw who said that, right?
- Hold on.

833
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,410
- I understand Se Chan and Haha.
- Exactly.

834
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,010
- But why did Hye Seon say that?
- She argued strongly.

835
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,010
I couldn't help but hear
them talking.

836
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,480
Yeum Cheater, why did you jump in?

837
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,680
I told you to watch out.

838
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,950
- Yeum Cheater heard us.
- Yeum Cheater.

839
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,950
Yeum Cheater, I gave you
an extra point earlier.

840
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,130
- I'm disappointed.
- Me too.

841
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,490
He's writing down something again.

842
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,370
By the way...

843
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,230
So Young said that she was
a big fan of our show.

844
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,370
- Is she? I'm grateful.
- Yes.

845
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,500
(How do I control my mind?)

846
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,430
(The answer is
watching Running Man.)

847
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,470
(Running Man!)

848
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,910
(As a fan, So Young dreamed of
coming on the show.)

849
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,480
(So did Hye Jin.)

850
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,620
- Yes, this is my favorite TV show.
- Really?

851
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,910
I watch the show every single week.

852
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,950
- Which episode is your favorite?
- That's great.

853
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,180
The one about stock investment.

854
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,130
- Oh, the stock investment?
- You must know well.

855
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,130
- That was good. You liked it too.
- That was the best.

856
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,130
She must know how things work
on the show.

857
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,460
I'm sure she does.

858
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,140
Then you must understand
why I always yell at Suk Jin.

859
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,000
- Of course. I fully understand.
- Great.

860
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,140
- I'm relieved.
- You can understand him?

861
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,140
That's a relief.

862
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,170
By the way,

863
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,700
she has played against Yeon Koung's
team as the team captain.

864
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,110
- Oh, right.
- Really?

865
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,940
- When was that?
- In that game,

866
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,980
I was determined
to block all her attacks.

867
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,320
- Were you?
- Yes.

868
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,120
- You must've done your best.
- How did it turn out?

869
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,750
How did the game go?

870
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,790
- My team won.
- Really?

871
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,950
You lost?

872
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,400
When did you win?

873
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,520
I mean, in general,
not just one game.

874
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,100
- Oh, in general?
- Yes.

875
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,260
I see. Okay.

876
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,260
(Oh, in general? I see. Okay.)

877
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,800
(I see. Okay.)

878
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,430
- So Young seems agitated.
- Wait.

879
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,160
- Yeon Koung seems upset.
- Indeed.

880
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,230
- I got taken aback.
- But...

881
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,700
I won the MVP
in the national league.

882
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,940
- I see.
- As an individual player...

883
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,550
And she won the MVP
in the championship league.

884
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,120
Both of us win the MVP.

885
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,410
- So Young, I have a question.
- Go ahead.

886
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,860
Is there something that Yeon Koung
says often when she nags at you?

887
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,520
- Right. I want to ask everyone.
- No, right?

888
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,720
- She rarely nags at us.
- If you had to pick something.

889
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,750
She often says, "Hey, smile."

890
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,420
"Smile."

891
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Isn't that what a bully would say
when taking money?

892
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,040
That's exactly how it sounds.
While training, she says,

893
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,140
"Let's liven up the mood.
Cheer the others up."

894
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,230
There were times when we all got
a little downcast.

895
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,410
So I told her to smile to spread
positive energy in the team.

896
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,700
So Young was on the mid-level.

897
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,940
- Between senior and junior players.
- Oh, I see.

898
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,150
- So she played an important role.
- That's the most important role.

899
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,210
So I told her to smile and talk
to the others to liven up the mood.

900
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,090
- I often told her that.
- Couldn't you smile first?

901
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,830
- I always do, you know.
- Really?

902
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,560
If she doesn't smile when I do,

903
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,360
- those younger won't smile either.
- Can't you...

904
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,750
- say that with a smile?
- Please say that with a smile.

905
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,400
- But I'm smiling.
- Smile, everyone.

906
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,870
I guess we should smile too.

907
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,840
- Aren't I smiling?
- She's like Kwang Soo.

908
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,460
It's the same smile Kwang Soo has.

909
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,340
She's hilarious.

910
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,610
Next up is Ahn Hye Jin.

911
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,240
(Ahn Hye Jin:
Born February 16, 1998)

912
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,200
(Position:
Setter, right side hitter)

913
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,770
I have no idea
what kind of serves she hits,

914
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,680
but due to its erratic behavior,

915
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,660
her serves are known among teammates
as a dirty serve.

916
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,220
(She displayed her dirty serve
in the Olympic games too.)

917
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,920
(The receiver faltered.)

918
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,060
What on earth is that?

919
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,900
- A dirty serve?
- How can a ball be erratic?

920
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,130
It must drop suddenly.

921
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,800
It'd soar but then suddenly drop.

922
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,230
- How fascinating.
- The drop is steep.

923
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,960
Those who have
received them before...

924
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,840
say that they're the dirtiest.

925
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,340
So they're like Suk Jin's ad-libs.

926
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,340
- They're dirty.
- They're hard to respond to.

927
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,610
- So dirty.
- It's not a compliment though.

928
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,010
I'd love to try and
receive her ball.

929
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,740
(Due to the vaccine aftereffect,
he lets out a dirty response.)

930
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,390
- I'd like that.
- Hold on.

931
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:35,560
He needs to rest,
so please don't ask him anything.

932
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,180
- I'd love to receive it.
- Suk Jin...

933
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,680
- Pfizer Ji.
- I think it's better for him to...

934
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,330
- Pfizer Ji.
- Go, Pfizer Ji.

935
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,330
Anyway,

936
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,690
Loony Kid is one of your nicknames
while the other one is...

937
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,690
- Shin Min A.
- Right, Shin Min A.

938
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,310
- What?
- What on earth?

939
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,470
- How did that happen?
- Who calls her that?

940
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,930
- Are you calling yourself that?
- Haven't you heard it before?

941
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,270
- I only found out just now.
- Me too.

942
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,380
- Did you see their reaction?
- I had no idea.

943
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,740
How can you not know this?

944
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,850
- They were all just as shocked.
- It's...

945
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,350
- She's pretty but...
- No one came to her defense.

946
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,390
I know she's pretty,

947
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,820
- but Shin Min A is a first.
- Still...

948
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,010
Shin Min A on the volleyball court,
say your piece.

949
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,950
Is it a nickname you came up with?

950
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,850
No, of course not.

951
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:17,770
The fans call me that out of love.

952
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,060
- What do you think of it?
- Sorry?

953
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,460
Don't you find it to be wrong?

954
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,730
I do look like her in some ways.

955
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,440
- What the...
- She's angry.

956
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,310
- Do you need a blanket?
- She's angry.

957
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,730
- Do you need a blanket?
- At the end...

958
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,480
- At the end?
- I'll let the anger build up more.

959
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,910
Hye Jin's also not one...

960
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,580
to be intimidated
by Yeon Koung either.

961
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,120
You have no idea
how vicious they can be.

962
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,690
They're even worse than I am.

963
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,890
They're the ones to look out for.

964
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,660
They've built
a sweet image for themselves...

965
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,020
which is why
it looks like I'm scolding them.

966
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,250
- Hye Jin...
- I'm the victim, you know.

967
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,830
- So Hye Jin...
- That I agree.

968
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,460
You're saying
you do look like Shin Min A.

969
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,600
I guess I do.

970
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,730
(I guess I do.)

971
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,790
She's no pushover.

972
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,440
- You have no idea.
- I love it.

973
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,170
- She's gutsy.
- Nice.

974
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,730
I give her points for being gutsy.

975
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,000
(Points for being gutsy)

976
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,410
- Nice.
- Points for being gutsy.

977
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,080
- We need that, you know.
- Of course.

978
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,370
She's Shin Min A
of the volleyball court.

979
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,750
That's how I like my people.

980
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,480
I would've thought twice
if you had cowered.

981
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,790
That showed us
what kind of a person she is.

982
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,350
- Also...
- She thinks they look alike.

983
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:18,020
- She didn't say it herself.
- Others did.

984
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,520
Others gave her the nickname.

985
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,850
- What can she do about it?
- Exactly.

986
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,170
That can only be translated
to being gutsy.

987
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,170
It's rare for an athlete...

988
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:27,770
to ask a team owner
to call her as Cutie.

989
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,190
You seem to have a lot of requests.

990
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,270
- I...
- She does it all the time.

991
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,370
- That's my first request.
- Is that so?

992
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,270
Why do you want
to be called that way?

993
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,750
Because I look cute.

994
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,670
Gutsy!

995
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,080
I'm loving the confidence.

996
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,670
Ms. Gutsy!

997
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,940
- Another spoonful of gutsiness.
- She's adorable.

998
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,250
Take my gutsiness!

999
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,060
I give you
the top grade in being gutsy.

1000
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,060
Nice.

1001
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:52,230
It's been a while since we had
someone like her on the show.

1002
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,520
Now that it's been mentioned,
I see the resemblance.

1003
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,660
What?

1004
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,600
Why is it...

1005
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,290
that I don't see the resemblance?

1006
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,410
- Take a look.
- You can see it.

1007
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,670
- I see the resemblance.
- You do?

1008
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,500
- It's subtle, but...
- How?

1009
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,640
Shin Min A...

1010
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,140
(She boldly twirls around
for the others to see.)

1011
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,440
- Shin Min A?
- In what way?

1012
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,310
Just how?

1013
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,750
- Shin Min A?
- Hey!

1014
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,690
- It's just that...
- As if you know anything.

1015
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,580
I don't see the resemblance!

1016
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,890
As if you know anything.

1017
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,560
- Is it an illusion?
- As if you know anything.

1018
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,830
Must one stare to see it?

1019
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,020
- Like this?
- Hey!

1020
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,250
Quiet, everyone!

1021
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,460
- Hey, sit back down.
- Sit down.

1022
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,600
Sit back down.

1023
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,730
- Quiet.
- I see the resemblance.

1024
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,420
It can only be seen
by those with kind hearts.

1025
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,670
Kind hearts?

1026
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,330
Quiet. You'll see it
if you have a kind heart.

1027
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,600
- I'll try all day to spot it.
- Anyway,

1028
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,140
- don't...
- Yes?

1029
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,540
- Don't look for the resemblance.
- Just don't.

1030
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,210
- Gosh.
- We're not saying that...

1031
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,350
- she's Shin Min A.
- Exactly.

1032
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,020
- So don't look for a resemblance.
- Just don't.

1033
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,140
She has the same eyes.

1034
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,350
- Just consider it as an opinion.
- Exactly.

1035
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,920
All right. So at...

1036
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:58,020
- the Dokko Olympics...
- Dokko?

1037
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,830
(He suddenly chokes on his words.)

1038
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,620
- Dokko?
- What's that?

1039
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,460
- What was that?
- The Dokko Olympics?

1040
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,870
- He is flustered.
- Is it for the elderly?

1041
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,040
The trainers are flustered!

1042
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,040
(The Shin Min A debate
threw the trainers off balance.)

1043
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,940
- The Dokko Olympics?
- We help each other out, right?

1044
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,330
- So that's why.
- As you know,

1045
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,830
helping each other out
is the Olympic spirit.

1046
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,980
That's why.

1047
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,040
Anyway,

1048
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,140
so you see...

1049
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,640
- The day before the games...
- You must've been traumatized.

1050
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,060
You're too traumatized
to speak properly.

1051
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,960
(The veteran show host of 30 years
hits his first slump.)

1052
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,620
You stuttered just now.

1053
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,690
Hye Jin, I apologize.

1054
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,370
The Shin Min A debacle...

1055
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,020
Why can't anybody tell me
why she looks like Shin Min A?

1056
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,060
I want to know.

1057
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,190
Why are you obsessed with this?

1058
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,230
- Is she a mystery woman?
- Why do you want to know?

1059
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,440
Why do you keep asking?

1060
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,600
Why do you want to know?

1061
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,370
So far, I've found five reasons
why she resembles Shin Min A.

1062
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,870
- Really?
- Five reasons.

1063
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,080
- Already?
- Yes.

1064
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,140
That was fast.

1065
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,480
Next up is Park Eun Jin.

1066
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,420
Her nickname is...

1067
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,920
Ms. Positive
on the volleyball court.

1068
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,580
I like people
with positive attitudes.

1069
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,690
She has a lot of bright energy.

1070
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,560
The moment she steps onto the court,
the whole team is energized.

1071
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,690
- "Go, team!"
- She's the only one...

1072
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,520
- that Yeon Koung complimented.
- The only one.

1073
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,660
She exudes positive energy.

1074
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,170
- Is that so?
- I stick to the technical stuff.

1075
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,670
Just so you know,

1076
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:16,190
she was excited when
Hye Jin mentioned the blanket.

1077
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,540
Is that so?

1078
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,600
(Glancing)

1079
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,370
Eun Jin's the youngest member
of the team.

1080
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,940
- Yes.
- She was born in 1999.

1081
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
I'm sorry to ask,
but when was your father born?

1082
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,270
My dad was born in 1969.

1083
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,640
(Her father was born in 1969.)

1084
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,980
Suk Jin was born in 1966.

1085
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,810
(Pfizer Ji was born in 1966.)

1086
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,480
- What did you just say?
- Well...

1087
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,660
Well, Eun Jin was born in 1999.

1088
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,330
- So of course.
- What are they talking about?

1089
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,920
- They're complimenting you.
- Really?

1090
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,390
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

1091
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,460
What did Suk Jin say just now?

1092
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,600
I couldn't hear a thing
because your voices overlapped.

1093
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,810
(The simultaneous broadcast
is a mess.)

1094
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,940
Just know that Suk Jin is in pain.

1095
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,170
He's sick.

1096
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,940
- He's at his weakest.
- Is he?

1097
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,080
I'm not in any pain.

1098
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,500
- This was fun.
- Right.

1099
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,350
I love listening
to the players' stories.

1100
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,670
For some reason, I'm now starving.

1101
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,980
That was a long introduction.

1102
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,850
- And now...
- Finally!

1103
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,080
Is it time?

1104
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,120
Finally!

1105
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,420
The draft begins.

1106
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,560
Were you able to check
the status of their mentality?

1107
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,790
- Of course.
- Same here.

1108
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,850
It was a lot of help.

1109
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,920
We will now begin...

1110
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,830
the 2022 Running League
Rookie Draft.

1111
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,500
- That's right.
- Unlike actual drafting events,

1112
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,230
the players will choose gyms...

1113
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,210
after participating...

1114
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,500
in a salary negotiation
with the trainers.

1115
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,980
The trainers may
draft their players...

1116
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,980
with the money
they earned in the previous race...

1117
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,640
and an additional amount
of 500 dollars.

1118
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,060
- We're given 500 dollars each.
- The amounts they have are like so.

1119
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,480
Trainer Kook has 990 dollars.

1120
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,020
- That's a lot.
- Did he say 990 dollars?

1121
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,730
Meanwhile, Trainer Yoo
has 1,300 dollars.

1122
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,920
That's a lot!

1123
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,250
It's all thanks to me.

1124
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,690
I have more room to splurge.

1125
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,170
The trainers
will choose three players...

1126
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,460
and write down their names
along with the desired salary.

1127
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,100
The players will check
how much was offered...

1128
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,670
and choose the gym
they'd like to join.

1129
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,620
If you're not satisfied
with the salary,

1130
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,420
you may negotiate.

1131
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,420
All right.

1132
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,690
You may also choose
the gym you desire...

1133
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,120
regardless of the salary
that was offered.

1134
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,190
Really?

1135
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:21,060
Each gym may only draft six players.

1136
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,600
- Only 6?
- Just 6.

1137
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,520
- We can only have six players.
- Right.

1138
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,270
Once one gym recruits
all of its members,

1139
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,410
the remaining trainer and players...

1140
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,170
will automatically become a team.

1141
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,040
The remaining recruits.

1142
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,310
- Right.
- Before salary negotiations,

1143
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:38,850
players will try...

1144
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,940
and hit uncooked eggs
that are at a distance...

1145
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,710
- by spiking a volleyball.
- I'm doomed.

1146
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,920
(Ball control: Hitting uncooked eggs
by spiking a volleyball)

1147
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,190
(Speed: Ball's speed
will be measured with a speed gun.)

1148
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,250
Ball control.

1149
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,660
Yes, this we must see.

1150
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,480
Or speed.

1151
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,020
You may choose one category...

1152
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,960
to show off your talents
to the trainers.

1153
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,190
You will be divided
into four groups.

1154
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,770
In Group One are Oh Ji Young,
Jeon So Min, and Ji Suk Jin.

1155
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:05,330
In Group Two are Kim Yeon Koung,
Yang Se Chan, and Park Eun Jin.

1156
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,080
In Group Three are Song Ji Hyo,
Lee So Young, and Ahn Hye Jin.

1157
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:12,440
In Group Four are Haha,
Yeum Hye Seon, and Kim Hee Jin.

1158
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,980
- Group One will go first.
- All right!

1159
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,140
- Group One.
- Oh Ji Young, Jeon So Min,

1160
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,210
and Ji Suk Jin,

1161
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,390
please step forward.

1162
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,850
- Do we go down there?
- Yes, please step down.

1163
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,020
Okay.

1164
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,250
I'll be watching you
even when you step down the stage.

1165
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,420
(Their every movement
will be reflected in their salary.)

1166
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,850
So Min, good going.

1167
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,420
Go, So Min.

1168
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,230
What?

1169
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,290
(What?)

1170
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,870
(For some reason,
her serve travels behind her.)

1171
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,910
- Nicely done.
- Are you sure they aren't rocks?

1172
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,640
Suk Jin will go first.

1173
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,170
Out of speed and ball control,
which one will you choose?

1174
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,520
- Me?
- Go ahead and choose.

1175
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,310
I'll go with ball control.

1176
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,640
- You chose ball control.
- I will hit...

1177
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,940
- the one in the middle.
- Suk Jin,

1178
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,790
which gym would you like to join?

1179
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,120
Truth be told,
neither of them speaks to me.

1180
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,560
So I'll go with the one
that values my talent.

1181
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,290
The one that offers me
the most money.

1182
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,100
- Got it.
- If that's the case,

1183
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,170
you won't be drafted into any team.

1184
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,890
Just so you know,
chump change won't cut it.

1185
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,940
But chump change is all we have.

1186
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,210
(They only intend to offer him
chump change.)

1187
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,370
You...

1188
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,940
- Please know that.
- That's minus five points for you.

1189
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,230
You just lost five points.

1190
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,100
Can you show us your jump?
Let's do the vertical jump test.

1191
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,350
- Is it possible?
- Jump on the spot.

1192
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,370
(Whee!)

1193
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,440
(The miraculous jump
that burns 0 calories)

1194
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,620
- That's not much of a jump.
- I'm sorry but,

1195
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,790
are you taking a photo?

1196
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,810
Here I go.

1197
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,920
Suk Jin chose to focus
on the ball control.

1198
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,730
The ball control?

1199
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,020
- Please show us.
- I won't hit with this one.

1200
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,000
- Health, long life, blessing!
- Long life, blessing!

1201
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,000
(The first step
of the oldest rookie player)

1202
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,060
(Will he be able to hit the egg
in 10m?)

1203
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,810
That was amazing.

1204
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,310
(Hurling it down)

1205
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,730
- That's enough. Thank you.
- He got to hit the ball.

1206
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,910
Should I even pay him?

1207
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,980
I choose ball control.

1208
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,250
- Ball control?
- Yes.

1209
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,620
Which team do you want to join?

1210
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,290
- Well...
- You can just hit the egg.

1211
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:04,850
- Oh, really?
- Does anyone of you want me?

1212
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,350
They're avoiding her eyes.

1213
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:09,750
- They're avoiding her eyes.
- Excuse me. Can't you hear her?

1214
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,620
- She's talking.
- Look at Jong Kook.

1215
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,790
- She's talking to you.
- What did you say?

1216
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,870
- What did you say?
- Could you say it again?

1217
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:16,230
- It was a communication error.
- I can clean, cook, and...

1218
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:19,330
- We hired a service for that.
- It's fine.

1219
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,270
Then I can just ace in this, right?

1220
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:22,980
- I'll try it now.
- Wait. Ms. Jeon.

1221
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,850
Could you show us
your jump in place?

1222
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,580
- As expected.
- She's so cute.

1223
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,850
- She's cute.
- She doesn't know how to jump.

1224
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,120
I jumped really high though.

1225
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,350
(The player
both teams want to avoid the most)

1226
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,710
(Player Jeon's ball control test)

1227
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,830
As expected.

1228
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,750
(As expected,
she hurls the ball down.)

1229
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,890
She's good.

1230
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,120
- Can you give me one more chance?
- No, it's okay.

1231
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,770
- I'd pick So Min no matter what.
- That's enough.

1232
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:48,170
- She's a bit better than Suk Jin.
- The two of you...

1233
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:51,440
But I want to give her more points
than Suk Jin.

1234
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,440
- Oh, really?
- She's a bit better.

1235
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,310
- She did better than you.
- Right. She's way better.

1236
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:57,000
You jeered at me when I spiked,
but why are you...

1237
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,370
- approving her spike?
- Health

1238
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,350
(The filial song
shuts the old man's mouth instantly)

1239
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,290
- Next is Oh Ji Young.
- Health

1240
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:08,080
Which one are you going to choose?
Speed or ball control?

1241
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,190
I'm going to choose both.

1242
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,250
- Both?
- Yes.

1243
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,960
- Then Ji Young...
- Can they choose both?

1244
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,230
- Ji Young.
- Is there a team you prefer?

1245
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,620
I want to join your team!

1246
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,000
Jong Kook's team? Got it.

1247
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,670
(Jong Kook's team? Got it.)

1248
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,120
- He likes it.
- Jae Suk is sullen.

1249
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:22,770
- But Ji Young...
- All right!

1250
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:24,640
- Ji Young...
- You got this, Trainer Yoo!

1251
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,770
- In any case...
- Kim Jong Kook!

1252
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:27,910
All right.

1253
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,310
- Ji Young chose both.
- He wrote something down.

1254
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,040
(Stepping on the line)

1255
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,870
- You're stepping on the line.
- The line.

1256
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:37,310
- Ji Young, you're stepping on it.
- You're stepping on the line.

1257
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,140
- It needs to be shown.
- Oh, does it?

1258
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,810
You guys are really strict.

1259
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:43,060
- They really are.
- Here I go!

1260
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,790
- Here I go!
- Okay.

1261
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:46,330
- You can let that slide.
- I should hit it like this.

1262
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,520
(She was the best digger
in the Tokyo Olympics.)

1263
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,730
(How good is her spike?)

1264
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,140
(She missed the target,
but it was sharp.)

1265
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,960
- She didn't hit the target either.
- She's good.

1266
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,440
She got 0 points,
and it was 67km per hour.

1267
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,480
- Got it. It was 67km per hour.
- I should've hit it.

1268
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,480
She missed it.

1269
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,250
Now, you should offer the players
of this group their salary.

1270
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:07,600
How much should we offer?

1271
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,750
- For now...
- You should consider their skills.

1272
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,250
(Exclaiming)

1273
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,420
(The master of slapstick)

1274
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:18,790
He just showed slapstick.

1275
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,520
- He got hit in the face.
- Are you okay?

1276
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,000
- That was...
- Long life

1277
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,390
(They start singing the filial song
as Suk Jin is healthy enough...)

1278
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,420
(to show slapstick.)

1279
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,830
Why does it bounce so much?

1280
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,040
(Darn it.)

1281
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,540
(Player Ji is at the risk
of being forced to retire.)

1282
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,730
- This is dumbfounding.
- Stay healthy, Suk Jin.

1283
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,000
He's showing his character well.

1284
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,480
- Darn it.
- I hope you live long.

1285
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,210
Wait a minute.
Since I have 1,300 dollars...

1286
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,310
Do we have to use up all the money?

1287
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:43,770
There will be a competition
between you two,

1288
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:45,040
so it'd be better if you leave
as much money as you can.

1289
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,190
- Right?
- Yes.

1290
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,960
- So the less you spend...
- So we should spend little...

1291
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,480
- to scout the players.
- That's right.

1292
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,850
That'd be advantageous for you.

1293
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:54,690
Then how much
should I offer Ji Young? Hold on.

1294
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,000
I need to plan it well.

1295
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,920
What if they offer me ten cents?

1296
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,420
What if they offer me ten cents?

1297
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,640
They'll offer you a lot.

1298
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,940
(Even the libero
on the national team is nervous.)

1299
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,810
- Did you write it down?
- I'm ready.

1300
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:08,640
- Hold on.
- Lift the board at the same time.

1301
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,370
Since it's our first round,
we need to study how it goes.

1302
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:12,480
He told me to write it big.

1303
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:15,540
Please reveal their salary.

1304
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,520
In 1, 2, 3.

1305
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,210
Here you go.

1306
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,290
Here you go.

1307
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,960
- Fifty dollars?
- Two cents?

1308
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,020
One cent?

1309
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,850
- What? One cent?
- He offered one and two cents.

1310
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,520
- He offered me fifty dollars.
- One cent? Come on.

1311
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,190
He's offering me a lot, isn't he?

1312
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,330
(Trainer Yoo: Ji Young 50 dollars,
Suk Jin 1 cent, So Min 2 cents)

1313
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,790
- What on earth?
- What? You're offering 0.1 cents?

1314
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,060
(Trainer Kook:
Ji Young 100 dollars,)

1315
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,330
(Suk Jin 0.1 cents,
So Min 0.1 cents)

1316
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:36,600
How can you offer 0.1 cents
as a salary?

1317
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,440
- I couldn't help it.
- We can only offer this much.

1318
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,370
- This is driving me crazy.
- You need to be understanding.

1319
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:45,000
- It's too little.
- There's not much money I can use.

1320
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,940
- But...
- What do you do in this situation?

1321
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,940
- You must thank them at all costs.
- This hurts my pride.

1322
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:51,620
- Can you add a zero to mine?
- Sorry?

1323
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,210
- Make it 20 cents.
- Twenty cents?

1324
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,620
- Twenty cents.
- Hey.

1325
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:55,810
She's negotiating.

1326
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,750
Why would you beg them?
Just get what they're offering?

1327
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,120
I'm going to negotiate.
Make it 20 cents.

1328
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,830
- He's adding a zero.
- For me...

1329
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:03,390
I'm in a good mood
after a long time.

1330
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,330
- I'll offer her two dollars.
- All right! I'll join your team.

1331
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,190
- Really? You're offering so much?
- Yes. I'm offering her two dollars.

1332
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:09,040
- Can I make my decision now?
- Excuse me.

1333
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,640
- Why are you offering her so much?
- Isn't one cent too little?

1334
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,100
Salute!

1335
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,440
You're selling your soul
just over two dollars?

1336
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,710
Of course!

1337
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:17,770
- Whatever. I don't care now.
- He's paying me two dollars.

1338
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:18,810
How much are you offering?

1339
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,580
- I'll offer you ten cents.
- Ten cents?

1340
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,620
Yes.

1341
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:25,310
Add another 0, will you?
You're offering So Min 2 dollars.

1342
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,310
Then I'm worth only 1-20th
of what she's worth?

1343
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,850
- Why are you yelling at me?
- Why are you yelling?

1344
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,660
Of course I'm upset.
Look at this yourself!

1345
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,980
Why are you being so rude?

1346
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,660
- Why would you talk like that?
- We're team owners.

1347
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,920
The next group is waiting.
Seal the deal already.

1348
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,620
- What's wrong with you?
- He blocked it.

1349
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,390
- Hurry up and be done with it!
- Wait a minute.

1350
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:43,670
- Mister.
- I'm trying to negotiate here.

1351
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:46,810
Both teams will hold off
the recruitment of Suk Jin.

1352
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:48,810
- Hold off?
- Please remove him as a candidate.

1353
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:52,410
Ji Young,
you chose Trainer Kook, right?

1354
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,370
Of course she should join
that team. He offered 100 dollars.

1355
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:55,640
- He's offering 50 more dollars.
- I'm joining his team for sure,

1356
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,480
but you're not going to offer me
a higher salary, are you?

1357
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,480
- She must be considering his team.
- She's trying to negotiate.

1358
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:02,080
- Wait a minute.
- She wants to negotiate with him.

1359
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,690
- Ji Young...
- I'll be negotiating later?

1360
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,730
Why don't you raise it a little?

1361
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,500
I'm much more athletic
than the rest of them.

1362
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,690
Since we'll be playing many games...

1363
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,790
Watch how they
spike the balls later.

1364
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,420
I bet I was the best one
out of them.

1365
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,640
You should offer her more.

1366
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,190
Gosh, you're only raising that much?

1367
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:18,310
Of course.

1368
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:19,830
You're offering her
just ten more dollars.

1369
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,210
- Ji Young is being offered...
- All right now.

1370
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:22,410
- I'll offer her ten more dollars.
- What use is that?

1371
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,540
- Ten more dollars?
- Yes.

1372
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:24,600
Why don't you all sit down?

1373
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,750
- I'll offer you 110 dollars.
- Then I'll offer you 10 more.

1374
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,850
- My gosh.
- They're offering 110 dollars?

1375
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:30,310
- You're raising it to 110 dollars?
- Of course.

1376
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:31,980
You should've increased more.

1377
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,890
- I should offer the same at least.
- He's so stingy.

1378
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,710
- I'll join this team.
- All right.

1379
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:36,810
(She chooses Tiger Gym.)

1380
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:38,890
- All right! This is great.
- Yes!

1381
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,060
That was amazing.

1382
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,560
Group Two, please step forward.

1383
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,330
Let's go, Group Two.
Yeon Koung, Eun Jin, and Se Chan.

1384
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,060
This group is...

1385
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,960
- I don't think I'll hit it.
- We're in trouble.

1386
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,390
(They set off
with resolute determination.)

1387
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:51,460
They're so cool.

1388
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,500
(They check the ball first
as they're pro players.)

1389
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,940
- They're so cool.
- It won't hit the target.

1390
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,170
It's quite far too.

1391
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,540
- They're practicing a lot.
- This isn't an official ball.

1392
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,850
You weren't considerate
of us with the balls.

1393
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,370
This is a ball for foot volleyball.

1394
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:04,440
She's...

1395
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,210
She's quite aggressive.

1396
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:08,560
Let me just say this to you guys.

1397
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,520
You need to take me so that
it'll be advantageous during games.

1398
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,580
- Right. Good thinking.
- Yes.

1399
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,350
I hope you'll offer me a lot.

1400
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:15,850
- Okay.
- Offer me at least ten dollars.

1401
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,790
If you offer me below that,
I won't join your team.

1402
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,670
- He's...
- Both of you.

1403
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:20,890
You must've intimidated him
so much...

1404
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,370
that he's asking
for ten dollars only.

1405
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:24,190
- How can he...
- Offer me at least ten dollars.

1406
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,140
- Don't go below ten dollars.
- My goodness.

1407
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,170
You need me
so that you get a chance to win.

1408
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:29,810
- All right.
- Wasn't he in "Shaolin Soccer"?

1409
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:31,810
- Good luck.
- I think I've seen him in it too.

1410
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,040
- You got this.
- Let's do it.

1411
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,710
(High-five)

1412
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:39,080
I've never raised my arm so high
for a high-five.

1413
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,750
- You got this!
- Here we go.

1414
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:41,980
(After the high-five,
he gets ready for the test.)

1415
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,190
- Go.
- Don't go over the line.

1416
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,250
(He hit it!)

1417
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,390
Speed?

1418
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,100
(Se Chan's ball
was faster than expected.)

1419
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,170
- He's good.
- He's good.

1420
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:55,440
It was 52km per hour.

1421
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,290
- It was really fast.
- That was incredible.

1422
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:58,910
I hit as hard as I could,
but it was only 52km per hour.

1423
00:49:58,910 --> 00:49:59,960
(Even the pro players are surprised
by Ssaebssaeb's speed.)

1424
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,310
You're generous with compliments.

1425
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:02,710
- How did you...
- I hit as hard as I could, but...

1426
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:04,230
She's asking for a high-five.

1427
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,100
You're really good.

1428
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,540
(Jumping)

1429
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:10,770
That was so cute.

1430
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,210
He jumped for the high-five.

1431
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,710
It feels like I'm hanging out
with women older than me.

1432
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,710
Eun Jin, which one will you choose?
Ball control or speed?

1433
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,020
- Speed.
- Speed?

1434
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,250
- Yes.
- Everyone will go for speed.

1435
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,620
- You chose speed?
- Yes.

1436
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,460
(The youngest middle blocker,
Eun Jin's spike)

1437
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,520
Let's go.

1438
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,100
(It was light,
but the ball hit the target hard.)

1439
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:30,890
- That was fast.
- It was really fast.

1440
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:33,170
It was 64km per hour.

1441
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,600
That was really fast.

1442
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,230
All right, we got it.

1443
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,040
- Yeon Koung, which one...
- Ball control or speed?

1444
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,540
- Tell them you'll go for speed.
- I'll go for both.

1445
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,810
- Both?
- Both?

1446
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:42,870
I'll give it a try.

1447
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,290
Which team do you want to join?

1448
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:47,850
- I'll see first.
- Okay.

1449
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,080
- She's so cool.
- She's good at negotiating.

1450
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,520
She's very relaxed.

1451
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,980
She needs to take the upper hand.

1452
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,750
- You're offering her a lot.
- Yes, I am.

1453
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,020
- You must offer her a lot.
- Of course.

1454
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,290
- Can I hit it now?
- Yes.

1455
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,420
The decision will be important
for our team.

1456
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:01,270
She's awesome.

1457
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:04,100
Yeon Koung ripped up the court!
She scores.

1458
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,870
Yeon Koung scores again!

1459
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,040
Kim Yeon Koung!

1460
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,170
- She roars!
- Let's go.

1461
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,960
I should hit it though.

1462
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,960
(She'll show her spike
in front of the two trainers.)

1463
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,340
- Can I hit it now?
- Yes.

1464
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,340
(She'll show her spike
in front of the two trainers.)

1465
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:22,360
That was close!

1466
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:25,170
(Powerful spike)

1467
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,400
- I should've hit it.
- It wasn't close.

1468
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,840
- It wasn't close.
- Not close at all.

1469
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,650
It was 60km per hour.

1470
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:33,270
- Wait a minute. Yeon Koung...
- That was pretty fast.

1471
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:35,250
Trainer Yoo!
This ball isn't good enough.

1472
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:37,020
You should get better balls.

1473
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:41,380
The three of you
are done with the test.

1474
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,090
Please decide their salary now.

1475
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:45,520
I don't think they'll get
more than what I got.

1476
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,560
- What do I do?
- I dare say...

1477
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,920
that we're the aces.

1478
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,420
You did really well though.
You were really good.

1479
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,630
- You'll need to pay us a lot.
- You were really good.

1480
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:54,860
He's the ace. I mean it.
You did really well.

1481
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,980
We can always negotiate later, so...

1482
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,710
You can just offer a lot
from the beginning.

1483
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:02,080
It's better for us to accept a deal
than to negotiate.

1484
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,150
So that we'll all be happy.

1485
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,880
Please reveal their salary.

1486
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,250
- Reveal the salary for Group Two.
- Hold on.

1487
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:07,340
- Goodness.
- Wait a minute.

1488
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,980
- It's really difficult.
- It's difficult.

1489
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,290
- Goodness.
- Wait a minute.

1490
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,520
You need to spend a lot
for this group.

1491
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,130
- You can trust us.
- Is that so?

1492
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,730
It's hard for us too.

1493
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:18,250
Here we go. In 1, 2, 3.

1494
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,590
In 1, 2, 3.

1495
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,420
- Here.
- She's offered 150 dollars?

1496
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:24,770
- How much did you offer?
- How much did you offer?

1497
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:25,940
(Trainer Yoo: Yeon Koung 120 dollars,
Se Chan 15, Eun Jin 110)

1498
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,210
(Trainer Kook: Yeon Koung 150,
Se Chan 10, Eun Jin 110)

1499
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,060
This won't do. Yeon Koung!

1500
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:30,980
- You offered her 150 dollars?
- What's with you?

1501
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,000
- Yours is so much higher than mine.
- Come on.

1502
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,110
Se Chan is offered 15 dollars?

1503
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:38,540
- That's too low.
- They offered me 110 dollars?

1504
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:39,880
He did better than the two of them.

1505
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,920
- He did really well, right?
- He did.

1506
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,710
- You can negotiate with us.
- Okay.

1507
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:48,830
Did you offer only that much,
so you can negotiate with us?

1508
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:51,360
(Striding toward the trainers)

1509
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,520
She's too...

1510
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,730
- She's too aggressive.
- She's so scary.

1511
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:57,770
- Trainer Yoo.
- First of all...

1512
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,270
Are you testing us?

1513
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:00,960
- What do you mean?
- I don't like people testing me.

1514
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:02,340
That's not what I'm doing.

1515
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,610
- Are you sure?
- You're testing her.

1516
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:05,080
I don't like it when the salary
ends with two.

1517
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,270
- It should be fivefold.
- What was that?

1518
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,880
- It should be fivefold, right?
- He was trying to test me...

1519
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,900
and wrote 2. He was thinking
of raising it to 5.

1520
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,610
- Exactly. He wanted to negotiate.
- He wanted to negotiate.

1521
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:15,440
That's what negotiating
is all about.

1522
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,210
Are you willing to raise my salary?

1523
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,730
I can pay as much
as Trainer Kook is offering.

1524
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,460
- I can also...
- That was too low.

1525
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,400
I'm willing to pay more
for Yeon Koung.

1526
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,770
- You should negotiate too.
- They're offering the same amount.

1527
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:29,560
- You can ask us comfortably.
- Could you raise it by ten dollars?

1528
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,940
Is that so? Let me see.

1529
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,630
- They're both fixing the amount.
- Since she asked...

1530
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:34,670
How much did you add?

1531
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,400
- They're both fixing the amount.
- Listen.

1532
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,610
Can't you ask them
to give some of yours to me?

1533
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:41,500
What? Why would I do that? No.

1534
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,170
He asked me to offer my salary
to him.

1535
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,250
- He's so cunning. No way.
- What are you, a beggar?

1536
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:49,650
- If you're willing to raise it,
- How much do I have?

1537
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:50,920
- then raise it now.
- Wait a minute.

1538
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,460
I'm sorry, but can't you see me?

1539
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,020
Can't you see me?

1540
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,560
- We'll talk later.
- Wait there.

1541
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,520
- Just stay still.
- Since you're an amazing player...

1542
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,190
Of course, I'm willing to raise it.

1543
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,920
If you're willing,

1544
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,630
then just offer the final price
without negotiating.

1545
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:06,230
- She's a bit...
- Offer me the highest salary.

1546
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:08,610
I know that she's good,
but she's making me uncomfortable.

1547
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,610
- Wait a minute.
- I'm having a bad feeling.

1548
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:11,710
- I think...
- Right?

1549
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,310
- It's a bit...
- Seeing her behave...

1550
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,000
- Don't regret it later.
- Wait a minute.

1551
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,440
- They both find her difficult.
- We should...

1552
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,580
They find Yeon Koung difficult.

1553
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:19,610
Wait a minute.

1554
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:22,540
I'm offering the highest salary
that I can offer.

1555
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:23,540
- Wait.
- Okay.

1556
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,560
(They fix the offering salary
after accepting to negotiate.)

1557
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,560
- You offered 130 dollars?
- How much is it?

1558
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,090
- He offered ten more dollars.
- What?

1559
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,900
(It'd be weird
if you lower the offering salary.)

1560
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:33,000
It'd be weird
if you lower the offering salary.

1561
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,270
- What?
- He lowered the offering salary?

1562
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,520
I got scared of her.

1563
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,090
- She's too scary.
- It's weird that you lowered it.

1564
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:39,170
Look at her.

1565
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:40,710
(Trainer Kook lowered her salary
by 20 dollars because she's scary.)

1566
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,500
- You lowered her salary?
- Look at her.

1567
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,980
- This won't do.
- Wait.

1568
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,630
(The deal is about to go off.)

1569
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:48,310
- Wait.
- Thank you.

1570
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:49,710
- Wait.
- Yes, Eun Jin.

1571
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,110
I will...

1572
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:54,210
give 30 dollars from my salary
to Se Chan...

1573
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:55,340
and take him with me.

1574
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,020
- We're all joining his team?
- Great.

1575
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,420
- You want to take him?
- Yes.

1576
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,980
I'll give up my salary for you.

1577
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,690
She's indeed amazing.

1578
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,520
She's the goddess!

1579
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,130
I'll give you my 30 dollars.

1580
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,020
- Great. She's giving it to me.
- I'll give you my 30 dollars.

1581
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:08,560
I'll be with her.

1582
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,360
- Then...
- Thank you.

1583
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,360
- Let's go!
- Thank you.

1584
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,840
- Yes! We're joining your team.
- This is great.

1585
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,130
- All right.
- Fine.

1586
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,340
- Fine!
- How dare you lower my salary?

1587
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,210
(How dare you lower my salary?)

1588
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:22,500
You dared to lower my salary?

1589
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,980
- You lowered my salary. No way.
- Locust Gym has four players now.

1590
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,540
- So Min, Yeon Koung,
- She's so scary.

1591
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,980
- Se Chan,
- She's scary.

1592
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,480
- and Eun Jin.
- This is great.

1593
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,110
Let's check out Group Three now.

1594
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:34,460
Ji Hyo, So Young, and Hye Jin.

1595
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,860
- Good luck!
- Excuse me, Ji Hyo.

1596
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,020
Ji Hyo is pretty strong.

1597
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,460
Could you show us
your jump in place?

1598
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,190
- What was that?
- She's funny.

1599
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:46,340
Ji Hyo.

1600
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:50,630
(She shows how unathletic she is
with weak jumps.)

1601
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:52,000
What was that?

1602
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,500
- What was that?
- She's funny.

1603
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,170
- She's funny.
- We should...

1604
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,610
- make her do slapstick.
- She is...

1605
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:58,610
She's funny these days.

1606
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,270
She is indeed.

1607
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:02,020
Which team do you want to join?

1608
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:03,840
I...

1609
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,810
I want to join a team
that appreciates my capabilities.

1610
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,190
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1611
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,460
She's after love? Got it.

1612
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,460
(She's after love? Got it.)

1613
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:11,860
You're saying
you're after love, right?

1614
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,400
What are some of your capabilities?

1615
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:15,960
You know.

1616
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,670
- "You know."
- A couple...

1617
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:18,730
- volleyball team!
- Volleyball team.

1618
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:21,460
- Is it okay to date in secret?
- That little...

1619
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:22,710
Here we go.

1620
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:23,710
(Player Song will appeal herself
with speed.)

1621
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,000
- She'll slap it down.
- Ji Hyo chose speed.

1622
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,310
- Let's go!
- Off you go.

1623
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,750
That's enough.

1624
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:34,710
(That's enough!)

1625
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:36,480
- We've seen enough.
- Next, please.

1626
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,480
- We've seen enough.
- That was hilarious.

1627
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,710
- It's okay. It was funny.
- That's enough.

1628
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:40,960
She couldn't catch up with the ball.

1629
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,360
Her slapstick
is hilarious these days.

1630
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,400
- You blew your chance.
- I'll give it a go.

1631
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,290
- It's over for you.
- Please give me another chance.

1632
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:47,830
- Please give me another chance.
- It's okay.

1633
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:49,830
- Please give me another chance.
- It needs to be fair.

1634
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:51,940
- Every player gets only one chance.
- It needs to be fair.

1635
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,040
- It's over for you.
- I'm sorry, but it's over.

1636
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,110
- Ji Hyo.
- That was hilarious.

1637
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,960
You didn't hit the ball,
so you can give it another go.

1638
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:00,500
It's okay.
You can give it another go.

1639
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,500
(Exclaiming)

1640
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,440
Love...

1641
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,880
- Power!
- Power!

1642
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,020
Thank you!

1643
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,610
- Kim Jong Kook!
- It's because...

1644
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:08,880
- Kim Jong Kook!
- She should hit it too.

1645
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,610
- Kim Jong Kook!
- She didn't get to hit it.

1646
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:12,210
For this draft,

1647
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:14,060
I'm going to withdraw
my draft rights to Ji Hyo.

1648
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:16,230
Why would you withdraw it?

1649
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,920
- We should see how good she is.
- She can go ahead.

1650
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,400
Let's see.

1651
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:23,130
All right.

1652
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,770
(A super-fast ground ball)

1653
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,960
- All right.
- That was...

1654
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,710
It was 28km per hour.

1655
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,110
- Listen.
- What is it?

1656
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,540
Trainer Kook is head over heels
for Ji Hyo.

1657
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,540
I know.
Look at the way he's smiling.

1658
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:35,500
- He can't stop smiling.
- Trainer Kook.

1659
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,340
- When the ball hit the ground,
- That's not it.

1660
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,710
- you were smiling so much.
- She tried her best.

1661
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:41,380
- You find her adorable.
- You're head over heels for her.

1662
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,110
- He can't help but smile.
- That's not it.

1663
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,310
She's giving him finger hearts.

1664
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:47,020
Who wants to go first?

1665
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,190
- Hye Jin is going first?
- Shin Min A!

1666
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:52,190
- Shin Min A!
- What?

1667
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:53,460
Will you choose ball control
You're choosing both?

1668
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,900
- Yes, I'll choose both.
- All right.

1669
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,290
(Amidst the players' cheer, she goes
for both ball control and speed.)

1670
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:58,560
She has chosen both.

1671
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:04,310
(She's famous for her dirty serves
which bounce off sharply.)

1672
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,000
Ahn Hye Jin is serving.

1673
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:11,520
(The dirty and strong serve
that flusters the opponents)

1674
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:15,650
(Shin Min A on the volleyball court
will show her dirty serve.)

1675
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,460
That was so fast.

1676
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,230
(Hye Jin's serve
sharply hits the target)

1677
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,560
- Well done.
- She did really well.

1678
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:27,560
(The trainers are amazed
by the dirty serve.)

1679
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,690
It was really sharp.

1680
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,830
- It was 66km per hour.
- Good job.

1681
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:32,540
- She's really good.
- It was 66km per hour?

1682
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,130
- That was incredible.
- She's amazing.

1683
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,210
She's known for her serves?

1684
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:40,130
Which one will you choose, So Young?

1685
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,670
- I'll go for both.
- Will you go for both?

1686
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,110
- Go ahead.
- She needs to come closer.

1687
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:45,110
Here we go.

1688
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,710
(The ball flew off the target.)

1689
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:51,560
- She slightly missed the ball.
- It was great. Good one.

1690
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,360
She gets only one chance regardless.

1691
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,560
It was 60km per hour.

1692
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,830
(So Young records 60km per hour.)

1693
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:58,230
But it wasn't accurate.

1694
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,020
It was powerful though.

1695
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:02,130
Since she hit the target...

1696
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:03,420
(How much will Ji Hyo, Hye Jin,
and So Young be offered?)

1697
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,540
- Their salary...
- They're taking quite long.

1698
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,860
I hope we'll meet with good results.

1699
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:10,540
All right now.
We'll reveal the salary.

1700
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,310
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1701
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:15,980
- I don't think he'd offer a lot.
- He offered 110 dollars.

1702
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,520
(The players burst into laughter
after seeing the amount.)

1703
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:21,980
(Song Ji Hyo will join
her boyfriend's team.)

1704
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,250
She's going to join her boyfriend?

1705
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,980
Ji Hyo will be joining
her boyfriend's team.

1706
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,090
- What is this?
- What?

1707
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:28,750
Don't corner us like that.

1708
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,360
You need to offer her a salary.

1709
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,830
I'm offering Ji Hyo the highest
among the players...

1710
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:34,330
- in the minor league.
- How much are you offering?

1711
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:35,630
But...

1712
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:37,360
But So Min was offered
only two dollars.

1713
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,130
- I was offered only two dollars.
- I know.

1714
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:40,400
I offered So Min 0.1 cents.

1715
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,000
But we don't have many positions...

1716
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,770
to recruit more players.

1717
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:46,270
You must have
some money left though.

1718
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:48,000
We know that your team
has more money than his.

1719
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,650
Can't you increase it a little more?

1720
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,710
- I showed a good performance.
- He has a lot of money.

1721
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,750
That's true, but...

1722
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:56,290
But this team is saving up too much.

1723
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:59,020
- You're saving up more than him.
- He's not spending a lot.

1724
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,750
You have more money than him.
Why aren't you spending more?

1725
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,520
That's not true, Min A.

1726
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,830
He has about 1,200 dollars,
and I have only 990 dollars.

1727
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:06,360
That's not true, Min A.

1728
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,360
You're saving up too much.

1729
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,130
- You're not spending a lot either.
- He should use it if he has money.

1730
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:11,340
You should spend more.
There are two more spots.

1731
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,040
- I...
- No, listen.

1732
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,170
- Here.
- Okay. Then we will...

1733
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:16,170
All right. That's great.

1734
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:19,080
I'd like to set a standard
among players...

1735
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,110
when deciding your salary.

1736
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,900
This is the salary I'm offering.

1737
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,340
I'm willing to offer you more,

1738
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,520
but I don't know what will happen
with the other players.

1739
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,190
But I offered them 110 dollars.

1740
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:31,920
Which team will you choose,
Hye Jin, So Young, and Ji Hyo?

1741
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,880
I'll join Trainer Kook.

1742
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,090
- Yes. That's the way it should go.
- Fine. Go ahead.

1743
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,630
- The amount...
- Go ahead.

1744
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:39,400
- What about So Young and Hye Jin?
- They'll choose Jong Kook for sure.

1745
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,920
- I'll join Jong Kook too.
- Okay.

1746
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,460
- Come join my team.
- I'll join Jae Suk.

1747
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:43,770
- For real?
- You're joining my team?

1748
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:45,440
(I'm joining Jae Suk's team.)

1749
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,960
(Hye Jin chose Trainer Yoo when he
offered less than Trainer Kook?)

1750
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,540
- How much did you offer?
- This is...

1751
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,440
You're joining his team
for 110 dollars?

1752
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,480
- But I increased your salary.
- It's lower than what he offered.

1753
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,500
It's okay with me. If I show...

1754
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,710
- Fine.
- a good performance later,

1755
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,710
- you can raise my salary.
- Of course.

1756
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,170
- Fine.
- Sit down.

1757
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:00,340
Fine.

1758
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,520
- Okay.
- How could you...

1759
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:03,020
I'm on your team!

1760
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,610
Hello!

1761
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:05,750
Look at them.

1762
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,920
We've been close friends
since we were young.

1763
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,330
I can join any team
if you offer me 30 dollars.

1764
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:12,830
- How much?
- That's too high.

1765
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:13,900
How much?

1766
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:15,920
It's because we're a package deal.

1767
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,460
- You must stick with each other?
- Yes.

1768
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,590
- With whom?
- The three of us.

1769
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:21,310
Wait. The three of you?

1770
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,340
The only team you can join...

1771
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,500
- is Tiger Gym.
- You need to ditch one.

1772
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,730
- I know.
- Only two can go together.

1773
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:27,900
(They need to split up
to negotiate their salary.)

1774
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,150
Really? In that case...

1775
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:31,770
(They desert Haha.)

1776
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:34,420
They decided to go separate ways.

1777
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,980
- That's good.
- That's the way to go.

1778
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,250
(Hee Jin shows a spike.)

1779
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,520
(She hit it!)

1780
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,670
(Even at a glance,
it's the fastest!)

1781
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:49,690
My goodness.

1782
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:50,900
(Even at a glance,
it's the fastest!)

1783
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,630
It was 70km per hour.

1784
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:55,210
(Kim Hee Jin, 70km per hour)

1785
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,080
It was so fast.
I could barely see the ball.

1786
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,000
They should select her
no matter what.

1787
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,500
(The trainers' hands move busily.)

1788
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,810
- Hold on.
- You need to use money.

1789
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:05,170
You need to use a lot of money.

1790
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:08,750
Hye Seon, what will you choose
between speed and ball control?

1791
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:10,190
Both.

1792
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:11,360
- Both?
- Yes.

1793
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,190
Which team do you want to join?

1794
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,380
I will have to consider the salary.

1795
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:17,090
I am sure both of them know about...

1796
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,650
the synergy I will create
in the team.

1797
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,400
- Is that so?
- I will see the offers first.

1798
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,520
Okay.

1799
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,630
The only thing you have shown is
your nickname, Yeum Cheater.

1800
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,360
- Let's go, Yeum Cheater.
- That's the talent you need...

1801
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,710
on this show.

1802
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:30,770
She doesn't disappoint.

1803
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:32,310
- She is bragging about herself.
- She learned well.

1804
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:34,210
(Hye Seon knows the importance
of being a cheater on the show.)

1805
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,150
That was fast.

1806
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,150
(That was fast!)

1807
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:42,920
- That was fast.
- Didn't she hit with her fist?

1808
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,060
- She hit with her fist.
- Didn't she hit with her fist?

1809
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,650
- She hit with her fist.
- Is that allowed?

1810
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,460
(She hit with her fast.)

1811
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:53,020
- She is a trickster.
- Really?

1812
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:54,460
One, two, three.

1813
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:55,920
I see 0.1 cents.

1814
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:57,690
Did he write 140 dollars?

1815
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:59,230
I will join this team.

1816
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:00,400
Hye Seon.

1817
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:02,000
We got Hye Seon.

1818
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:04,440
- We got Hye Seon.
- I will do my best in the team.

1819
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,130
- That's good.
- Hye Seon didn't disappoint.

1820
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:08,650
Hye Seon, congratulations on
joining the team.

1821
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:10,250
Welcome. Okay.

1822
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,040
- All right.
- Okay.

1823
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,440
- That's good.
- Congratulations.

1824
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:16,290
Are you joining my team?

1825
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,360
As for Suk Jin...

1826
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:19,920
His salary will be ten cents.

1827
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,060
Ten cents.

1828
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:24,060
(Thanks to Woo Young's draw,
Suk Jin's salary became ten cents.)

1829
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,020
(Suk Jin's salary is ten cents.)

1830
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:27,400
Which team is Suk Jin joining?

1831
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,730
- Your team.
- What?

1832
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:29,790
He automatically joined...

1833
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:31,460
Tiger Gym.

1834
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:32,630
Isn't that a penalty?

1835
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:33,630
(Suk Jin automatically joined
Tiger Gym.)

1836
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:35,960
It's okay. We don't know
which game we will be playing.

1837
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:37,710
Okay.

1838
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:39,940
- Locust Gym will go first.
- Locust Gym.

1839
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:42,610
- Shouldn't you look like a locust?
- Come this way.

1840
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:44,040
Let's say, "Let's go."

1841
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,340
One, two, three.

1842
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,380
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1843
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:47,440
Gosh.

1844
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,750
That's too normal.

1845
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,540
- Let's do this.
- That's too cliched.

1846
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:53,020
- The coach should be in the center.
- That's right.

1847
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,630
- Really?
- Come to the center.

1848
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:55,880
Okay.

1849
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:59,190
Put your hands on me.

1850
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,290
You love things like this.

1851
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:05,000
He loves being
the center of attention.

1852
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,190
- He wants to take the spotlight.
- What an old fart.

1853
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:08,460
The team owner
is stealing the spotlight.

1854
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:09,560
Seriously.

1855
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,670
- That's just wrong.
- That's great.

1856
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:13,540
- That's great.
- That's great.

1857
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:14,770
Locust!

1858
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:17,540
What an old fart.
The team owner stole the spotlight.

1859
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,520
Since we are Tiger Gym,
we should pose like tigers.

1860
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,840
Tigers.

1861
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,020
Let's go.

1862
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,440
- Let's go.
- Pose.

1863
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,590
- Okay.
- All right.

1864
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:25,750
- Suk Jin.
- Hold on.

1865
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:27,480
You called our pose childish,

1866
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:29,190
but you couldn't come up
with anything other than a roar.

1867
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:30,830
One, two, three.

1868
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,250
This is embarrassing.

1869
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:34,960
That's great. We have the spirit.

1870
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,230
They got 3 photos,
but we only got 1 photo.

1871
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:38,360
- It's okay.
- We posed more neatly.

1872
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,670
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1873
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:41,840
(It's time for a real competition.)

1874
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,340
I will look forward
to a passionate race.

1875
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:46,310
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1876
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:47,900
Thank you for your hard work.

1877
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:49,270
(The first match)

1878
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:51,310
- It must be foot volleyball.
- Foot volleyball.

1879
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:53,170
- The net is too low, right?
- It must be foot volleyball.

1880
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:55,290
- Are we playing foot volleyball?
- It seems that way.

1881
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:58,210
- The players have entered.
- All right.

1882
01:04:58,210 --> 01:04:59,750
Foot volleyball isn't half bad.

1883
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:01,560
- Okay. Let's go.
- I thought she was Kwang Soo.

1884
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,460
- Seriously.
- I thought she was Kwang Soo.

1885
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:05,830
Let's go.

1886
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,590
- Okay.
- Jae Suk, let's go.

1887
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:09,060
- We got this.
- All right.

1888
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:10,290
We will win.

1889
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:13,270
Come on out.
We don't have time to sit down.

1890
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:15,310
- We don't have time to sit down.
- Let's go, Locust Gym.

1891
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:16,840
We got this.

1892
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,580
Is it foot volleyball?

1893
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:20,310
We are set.

1894
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:22,400
- It's foot volleyball. We are set.
- Jae Suk.

1895
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:24,770
- Yeon Koung high fives too much.
- Seriously.

1896
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:26,650
- It's foot volleyball. We will win.
- She hits too hard.

1897
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:28,810
- She high fives too much.
- Hey.

1898
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:31,480
- She hits too hard.
- She is too strong.

1899
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,060
She pushes down from the above.

1900
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,480
My hands keep getting twisted.

1901
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,380
All right, everyone. Today,

1902
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:38,520
you will have
the Fierce Transfer Race.

1903
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,360
After each round,
the trainers will receive money...

1904
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,060
in accordance with the result.

1905
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:45,940
Use that money to negotiate salary
with the players in your team...

1906
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,190
and make payment.

1907
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:50,630
The remaining money
will go to the trainers.

1908
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,670
So today,

1909
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:55,440
the trainer who has more money...

1910
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,770
will win and receive the prize.

1911
01:05:57,770 --> 01:06:00,270
The trainer who has less money
will receive the penalty.

1912
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:02,840
Three players
with the most amount of money...

1913
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,750
will receive the special prize...

1914
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,310
and two players
with the least amount of money...

1915
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:08,690
will receive the penalty.

1916
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:11,520
They will pick
two additional people.

1917
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,460
- That won't do.
- Do they get to pick?

1918
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,060
- Do they get to pick?
- Don't pick your teammates.

1919
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:17,330
If you don't give me money,
I will pick you.

1920
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:19,190
They shouldn't get to pick.

1921
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,730
Today, there will be
a special system.

1922
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:24,230
Each gym will have
1st-string and 2nd-string players.

1923
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:27,210
The first-string teams
will go against each other...

1924
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:29,150
and the second-string teams
will go against each other.

1925
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:31,110
- Trainers can join any team.
- Okay.

1926
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:33,750
It's more advantageous
to have the first-string team win...

1927
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,150
for the overall result.

1928
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:36,310
(Additional points come
with the first-string match.)

1929
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:39,420
And only the first-string players
will have a salary negotiation.

1930
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:40,560
Really?

1931
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:44,150
The second-string players
will get the minimum salary.

1932
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:45,560
- Minimum salary?
- Minimum?

1933
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,790
So Min, you are
totally a first-string player.

1934
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:49,670
- A first-string player.
- Worry about your own team.

1935
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:51,670
- What are you saying?
- Worry about your own team.

1936
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:52,790
We won't lose.

1937
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:54,000
All right.

1938
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,440
(The rules of the day
got delivered!)

1939
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,860
Yeum Cheater thinks
we should do a cheer.

1940
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:00,210
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1941
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:01,540
We did that many times already.

1942
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:02,750
Let's do it one more time.

1943
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:04,310
What are you doing?

1944
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:05,480
- Yes!
- Yes!

1945
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,170
- All right.
- Let's go.

1946
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:10,520
- Tiger!
- Roar!

1947
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:11,610
- Go!
- Go!

1948
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:12,920
- Gosh.
- That was great.

1949
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,150
That was great.

1950
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:18,790
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

1951
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,090
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1952
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,900
They high five too many times.

1953
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,360
I mean...

1954
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,190
They high five too many times.

1955
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,060
They high five...

1956
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,730
- if you stretch out your hands.
- They do this endlessly.

1957
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,610
It's a habit.

1958
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,210
That wasn't what I had in mind.

1959
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:37,170
That wasn't what I had in mind.

1960
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:41,590
Jae Suk.

1961
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:43,520
Yeum Cheater
wants us to do another cheer.

1962
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,290
- Didn't we do that already?
- Let's do another cheer.

1963
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:46,710
This is the last one.

1964
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:48,460
- We did that already.
- Let's do another cheer.

1965
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,380
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

1966
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,590
- Let's do this.
- Gosh.

1967
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:54,090
I am so happy.

1968
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:56,590
I feel like I became
a professional volleyball player.

1969
01:07:56,590 --> 01:07:58,130
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

1970
01:07:58,130 --> 01:07:59,540
(So Min is happy to join
the national team members.)

1971
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:01,460
- Let's do it again.
- Tiger! Roar!

1972
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:02,630
One, two, three.

1973
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:05,940
- Tiger!
- Roar!

1974
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:08,380
Didn't someone say "Water deer"?

1975
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:10,170
- Water deer!
- Didn't someone say "Water deer"?

1976
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,810
- I heard "Water deer".
- You are ridiculous.

1977
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:13,270
It's "Tiger".

1978
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:14,940
- Water deer! Ah!
- Ah!

1979
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:16,650
- Water deer! Ah!
- Ah!

1980
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:18,650
Trainers, divide the players...

1981
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:20,880
into 1st-string and 2nd-string...

1982
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:22,830
and appoint the captain.

1983
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:23,890
The captain will receive
ten more dollars.

1984
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:25,000
- Ten more dollars?
- Really?

1985
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,100
All right.

1986
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:29,100
- The captain.
- It should be Ji Young.

1987
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,220
- No way.
- That sounds good.

1988
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:31,890
- She was the one on my mind.
- That's right.

1989
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:33,190
- The position comes with a perk.
- Really?

1990
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:34,970
- You get ten more dollars.
- All right then.

1991
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:37,800
- You told me before...
- You are a first-string player.

1992
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,900
that you aren't confident
with foot volleyball.

1993
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,380
- Hang on a second.
- Okay.

1994
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,270
- How about you?
- I am pretty good.

1995
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,550
To be honest, I have no confidence.

1996
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:45,850
You have no confidence?

1997
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,250
You need someone in the back...

1998
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:49,440
- who will receive the ball.
- You should do that.

1999
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,050
- Isn't it for the 2nd-string team?
- It's for the 2nd-string team.

2000
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:52,460
Come on.

2001
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:54,680
- Trainer Yoo, come on.
- All right.

2002
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:56,390
- Firstly,
- I am on the first-string team.

2003
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:57,520
So Min should be...

2004
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:00,130
I know that you are good.

2005
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:02,720
- Put it on.
- So Min, take a break.

2006
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,020
- Put it on for now.
- That's right.

2007
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,670
- Put it on for now.
- Okay.

2008
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:07,760
- I don't know.
- As for the captain,

2009
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,800
A player with a low salary
should be the captain.

2010
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,210
(So Min's salary is 2 dollars.)

2011
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,880
- Isn't it a good idea?
- It is.

2012
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:19,010
- You are the captain.
- Thank you.

2013
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:20,380
Captain.

2014
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:22,050
- Captain.
- Thank you.

2015
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,850
- All right.
- Jae Suk, you let me earn money.

2016
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:26,650
- Our captain.
- Let's go.

2017
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:27,920
Captain Jeon.

2018
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,760
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2019
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,100
(Both teams get ready
with the 7th cheer.)

2020
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,430
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

2021
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:34,890
(Tiger Gym: Trainer, Jong Kook)

2022
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:35,930
(1st-string, Haha,
Ji Young, and So Young)

2023
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:37,000
Captain Jeon.

2024
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,560
(2nd-string, Hee Jin,
Suk Jin, and Ji Hyo)

2025
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:41,060
We can do this. Let's go.

2026
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:42,230
All right.

2027
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,260
We let the ball bounce
on the floor once, right?

2028
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:45,510
Everyone.

2029
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:48,180
- There is an additional rule.
- What is it?

2030
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,880
(An additional rule?)

2031
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,350
In Round 1, the 1st-string team
and the trainer will have...

2032
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:53,510
a 4-on-4 match.

2033
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:57,310
The opposite team
will choose a libero.

2034
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,220
That player can use hands.

2035
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,480
(Can the opposite team choose
a libero?)

2036
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:02,930
Ji Young is a libero
who represents Korea.

2037
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:05,150
- She saved it.
- My goodness.

2038
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:07,500
She can take strong attacks.

2039
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:11,000
The libero can use the hands,
but he or she can't attack.

2040
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:12,430
I want to attack.

2041
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:14,360
She is determined to attack today.

2042
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,600
We get to choose, right?

2043
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,540
- The opposite team chooses.
- That's right.

2044
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:18,930
- Whom should we choose?
- Let me attack.

2045
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:20,800
Jong Kook can't use his feet.

2046
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,880
- We should frustrate them.
- That's right.

2047
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,100
It won't do
to make Jong Kook use his hands.

2048
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,510
He can't use his feet anyway.

2049
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,550
- Haha would be a better choice.
- Let's make him use his hands.

2050
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:29,180
Haha can use his feet,

2051
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,550
but Jong Kook can't.

2052
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:31,850
- Feet.
- Feet.

2053
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:33,960
- We will make Haha use his hands.
- Haha.

2054
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,180
- Okay.
- Jong Kook can't use his feet.

2055
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,930
- Okay. You are provoking us.
- Okay. We are provoking you.

2056
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,050
We will choose Yeon Koung.

2057
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:41,100
- Yeon Koung.
- Will you make me the libero?

2058
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,430
- Yeon Koung.
- Will you make me the libero?

2059
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:43,930
- Hold on.
- Isn't that bad for them?

2060
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,560
- Yeon Koung?
- I will get to use my hands.

2061
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,060
- That's good for us.
- Will you let her receive the ball?

2062
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,340
- Yeon Koung?
- Okay.

2063
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:49,340
(Was it a mistake?)

2064
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:50,970
- Shall we choose Se Chan?
- We will choose Se Chan.

2065
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:53,680
- Se Chan.
- You can't change it.

2066
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,270
- Se Chan.
- No.

2067
01:10:55,270 --> 01:10:59,440
- No.
- You can't change it.

2068
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,080
Gosh, they are ready
for a bench-clearing brawl.

2069
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:02,610
- Right away,
- You can't change it.

2070
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:04,090
- they came forward.
- Did you see that?

2071
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:05,720
- You can't change it.
- What are you doing?

2072
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:07,610
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2073
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:09,590
Are we doing another cheer?

2074
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:11,650
Are we doing another cheer?
One, two, three. Yes!

2075
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,720
They do so many cheers.

2076
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:15,020
Everyone.

2077
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,300
As you did
during the last week's game,

2078
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:18,360
you will have an option.

2079
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,690
- An option.
- Why are there so many things?

2080
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:20,730
It's the last one. The option...

2081
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:22,140
- for Round One is...
- It's complicated.

2082
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,560
not using the formal tone.

2083
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:26,180
- Right now...
- Use a casual tone.

2084
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:27,210
- Are we on a first-name basis?
- That's right.

2085
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:28,210
Jae Suk.

2086
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:29,400
- Yeon Koung.
- Jae Suk.

2087
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,850
- Hey.
- Jae Suk.

2088
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:32,610
- We are set.
- Hey.

2089
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:34,440
We can't use a formal tone.

2090
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,980
I love it!

2091
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,010
(The youngest member
who was born in 1999)

2092
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:38,220
- We are friends.
- No formal tone.

2093
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:39,920
- Really?
- Use a casual tone.

2094
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,980
Let's do well.

2095
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:42,980
Ji Hyo, do well.

2096
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:44,460
You had better do this right.

2097
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:47,760
Jae Suk, you are the one
who needs to get a grip.

2098
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:49,970
Jae Suk, get a grip.

2099
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:51,170
Let's go.

2100
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:52,690
- Let's do this.
- My goodness.

2101
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:55,210
- Jae Suk!
- Se Chan,

2102
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:56,900
- let's go.
- My goodness.

2103
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:58,710
They are excited.

2104
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:03,640
Yeon Koung, be quiet!
Kim Yeon Koung!

2105
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,380
- Be quiet!
- What is up with her?

2106
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:07,080
They are no joke.

2107
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,850
(Yeon Koung gets intimidated
for the first time.)

2108
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:12,290
- You lose a point if you mess up.
- All right.

2109
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:13,810
Yeon Koung, serve.

2110
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:15,350
What?

2111
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:17,430
Yeon Koung.

2112
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:19,550
(Her face hardens at times.)

2113
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:20,760
She is glaring at me.

2114
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,300
- Say something.
- She is glaring at me.

2115
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:25,040
Tell her to be quiet.

2116
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,390
Say, "Long Legs, be quiet."

2117
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:29,510
- Long Legs!
- Say, "Long Legs, be quiet."

2118
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:31,100
Long Legs, be quiet.

2119
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,510
- Okay.
- Let's go, our team!

2120
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:34,180
- Let's go.
- All right.

2121
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:36,080
- Let's go.
- Roar!

2122
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,580
(We refuse to lose.)

2123
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:39,850
Let's begin.

2124
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,310
Here.

2125
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,220
- Receive it.
- Okay.

2126
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,260
- Okay.
- Send it up. Come on.

2127
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,260
- That's good.
- Send it over.

2128
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,550
(So Young makes a good toss.)

2129
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:50,930
- Head the ball.
- The head.

2130
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:53,960
- What?
- What?

2131
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:54,960
- It's 1 to 0.
- Why?

2132
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,020
Didn't it touch her head?

2133
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,060
It didn't touch her head, did it?

2134
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:59,000
- It touched my head!
- She says it touched her head.

2135
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,170
- It didn't touch her head.
- It touched my head!

2136
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:02,210
(I can't believe her.)

2137
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:03,340
- She says it touched her head.
- No, it didn't.

2138
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:04,340
- It did.
- She says it did.

2139
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:05,710
- No, it didn't.
- Hey.

2140
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:06,840
- She says it did.
- No, it didn't.

2141
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,580
- Don't lie.
- It touched my head.

2142
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:09,940
- What are you saying?
- No, it didn't.

2143
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:11,350
- It didn't.
- It did.

2144
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:12,580
- It didn't.
- Hey.

2145
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:13,720
It didn't.

2146
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,440
- It touched my head.
- No, it didn't.

2147
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:17,010
I even heard a sound.

2148
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:18,650
It really touched my head.

2149
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:21,050
- It didn't touch.
- It's better for us if it did.

2150
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:22,550
- We win if it did.
- What is your problem?

2151
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:23,630
It touched.

2152
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:24,830
- It didn't touch.
- We win if it didn't touch.

2153
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:26,550
- We win if it didn't touch.
- Do we need to say it didn't touch?

2154
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:27,850
- I told you.
- We win if it didn't touch.

2155
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:30,360
It touched. Review the video.

2156
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,690
Shouldn't you review the video?

2157
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:34,040
- That's good. Head the ball.
- Send it over.

2158
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,170
(It didn't touch her head at all.)

2159
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:39,600
- She says it touched her head.
- It really did.

2160
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:40,640
It touched.

2161
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,940
Move up after you serve.

2162
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,210
- Okay.
- We hit it after a bounce, right?

2163
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,380
Yes. Okay.

2164
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:46,640
- Hey.
- Okay.

2165
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:47,750
Hye Seon.

2166
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,110
- Okay.
- Hye Seon.

2167
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:52,350
Let's do a cheer.

2168
01:13:52,350 --> 01:13:54,010
- Why are we doing a cheer?
- Seriously.

2169
01:13:54,110 --> 01:13:56,130
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

2170
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:57,790
- Hey.
- Hey.

2171
01:13:57,790 --> 01:13:59,020
Yeum Cheater.

2172
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:00,600
Why do you want to do a cheer
after messing up?

2173
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,670
- Good job.
- Yes.

2174
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:06,040
- Yes.
- All right.

2175
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,390
- Yes.
- Let's go.

2176
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:10,210
- Okay.
- Yes.

2177
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:14,270
A single point makes you
high five endlessly in volleyball.

2178
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,750
- Let's cheer up.
- Let's go.

2179
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:18,380
Here I go.

2180
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:19,770
We will receive it.

2181
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:21,180
- Mine.
- Okay.

2182
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:22,940
- All right.
- I got it.

2183
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:24,050
Yeum Cheater.

2184
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:25,610
People in the back, get ready.

2185
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:27,090
That's good.

2186
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:28,220
(He drove the ball to the ground.)

2187
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:30,930
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk.

2188
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:32,500
- Jae Suk.
- What was that?

2189
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,500
- Jae Suk, what was that?
- Jae Suk.

2190
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,100
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk.

2191
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:39,060
- Thank you. We won a point.
- Okay.

2192
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:40,300
Okay.

2193
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,760
Okay.

2194
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:43,430
- All right.
- Jae Suk.

2195
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:44,470
- I am sorry.
- Do you want to switch?

2196
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:45,640
- All right.
- Do you want to switch?

2197
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:48,770
- No.
- All right, Hye Jin.

2198
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:50,880
- We run whenever we score.
- This is driving me crazy.

2199
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,640
We will save up a lot of energy...

2200
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:53,850
- if we don't do that.
- Save up the energy.

2201
01:14:53,850 --> 01:14:55,610
Whenever I do something,
five people gang up on me.

2202
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:56,810
I am sweating after running
two rounds.

2203
01:14:56,810 --> 01:14:58,110
Jae Suk, let's do well.

2204
01:14:58,110 --> 01:14:59,180
Here I go.

2205
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:00,920
Yeon Koung, take this.

2206
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,150
- Mine.
- Okay.

2207
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:03,220
- That's good.
- Mine.

2208
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:04,290
Yeum Cheater.

2209
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,050
- Hey.
- Jae Suk.

2210
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:07,350
- I will send it over.
- There you go.

2211
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:09,860
- Receive it.
- Head.

2212
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,430
- Okay.
- Receive it.

2213
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:12,470
Head.

2214
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:13,640
That was great.

2215
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:14,760
- Okay.
- Head.

2216
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,210
- That was great.
- Good job.

2217
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:19,510
- Yeum Cheater.
- Head it, Jae Suk.

2218
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:20,640
Jae Suk.

2219
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,300
(Jae Suk sent it over the net!)

2220
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,210
Take it. Here.

2221
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:25,420
They are doing well.

2222
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:26,770
They are too good.

2223
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:27,770
Here.

2224
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:29,720
- Here it comes.
- They are too good.

2225
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:31,610
- Gosh.
- They are good.

2226
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:33,090
- Good.
- How are they so good?

2227
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:34,310
- Send it over.
- They are good.

2228
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:35,480
Yeum Cheater. There you go.

2229
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:36,650
Okay. Is it me again?

2230
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:37,850
It's okay. You are doing well.

2231
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:39,020
- Oh, no.
- It's okay.

2232
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:41,190
(The ball goes into the net.)

2233
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:42,470
- Oh, no.
- It's okay.

2234
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:45,760
It's okay.

2235
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:46,970
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

2236
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:48,360
It's okay.

2237
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,600
- Good job.
- There we go.

2238
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,770
(Locust Gym succeeded
to score a point.)

2239
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,270
(Gathering around)

2240
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:57,470
- What?
- Let's do a cheer.

2241
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,470
Let's do a cheer.

2242
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:00,510
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

2243
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:01,880
- Jae Suk.
- Hold on.

2244
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,890
You know, ceremonies are
more exhausting.

2245
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:05,680
Can the libero serve with hands?

2246
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:08,110
- She can serve with hands, right?
- Yes, she can.

2247
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:09,460
Okay.

2248
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:11,930
Kim Yeon Koung.

2249
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:16,560
Kim Yeon Koung scored 30 points
in a match against Japan.

2250
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:19,140
She scored with a serve.
That's good.

2251
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:21,300
(She is known for a strong serve
that resembles a spike.)

2252
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:22,470
Use a casual tone.

2253
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:23,900
Use a casual tone.

2254
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:25,640
- Let's go.
- Yeon Koung, send it to Jong Kook.

2255
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,230
- Jong Kook, let's go.
- Okay.

2256
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:30,080
Long Legs, serve all you want.

2257
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:31,580
- Jong Kook, let's go.
- Okay.

2258
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,950
Long Legs, serve all you want.

2259
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:37,410
- Jong Kook, let's go.
- Okay.

2260
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:39,580
(Gosh.)

2261
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:42,360
(He talked big.)

2262
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:46,830
(But he failed to defend.)

2263
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,200
(He made the ball fly off
with a cry.)

2264
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,290
It's okay.

2265
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:53,500
Don't be disheartened.

2266
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,760
(Queen Yeon Koung scored
with a serve.)

2267
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,400
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

2268
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,870
Jong Kook!

2269
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:01,330
- It's okay.
- Jong Kook is bad at this.

2270
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:03,740
Jong Kook,
you should stop exercising.

2271
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:06,110
He is like a tiger without teeth.

2272
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:07,170
That was cute.

2273
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:08,480
- Jong Kook,
- Hey.

2274
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,750
- you need to do better.
- Okay.

2275
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:10,950
It's okay.

2276
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:12,250
- Just score.
- There we go.

2277
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:14,080
Use a casual tone.

2278
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,490
Come on.

2279
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:16,990
- Head it.
- Okay.

2280
01:17:16,990 --> 01:17:18,490
- Send it over.
- Let it bounce.

2281
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:19,490
So Young.

2282
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:20,550
(The national team shows
a game of high quality.)

2283
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:22,090
- Okay.
- Head it.

2284
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:23,730
- That's good.
- Good.

2285
01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:25,120
- Hey.
- Send it over the net.

2286
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,260
- There you go.
- It will go out.

2287
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:27,370
No.

2288
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:28,960
- Okay. I got it.
- It's okay.

2289
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,200
- Spike.
- Okay.

2290
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,540
(Trainer Yoo's sudden spike)

2291
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:32,960
- Okay.
- There you go.

2292
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:36,240
That's it.

2293
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,540
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

2294
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:39,480
Sir, it's out
if your body part goes over the net.

2295
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,800
- No.
- No.

2296
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,480
- It's okay on Running Man.
- No.

2297
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,870
(Jong Kook said "Sir".)

2298
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,650
- All right.
- The ball went over.

2299
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:48,410
Jong Kook used a formal tone,
so Tiger Gym will lose a point.

2300
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:49,860
- Okay.
- It was directed at you.

2301
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:52,050
The last time, you said
we can use it with you.

2302
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:53,190
- You don't need to come.
- Okay.

2303
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:54,580
You said we can use it with you.

2304
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:55,730
Hey.

2305
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:59,030
Jong Kook might not be able
to negotiate the players' salaries.

2306
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,160
Long Legs, show me what you got.

2307
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,290
- The team is losing because of him.
- Long Legs.

2308
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:05,070
- Shouldn't they get a new trainer?
- Long Legs.

2309
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:06,760
- Hey.
- You need a good team.

2310
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:07,910
- Good job.
- You need a good team.

2311
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:09,170
Make sure you use a casual tone.

2312
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:10,940
- Use a casual tone.
- Long Legs, bring it on.

2313
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:12,800
- Let's go.
- We just need to win the game.

2314
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,710
- Suk Jin, move out of the way.
- Stop being flippant and sit down.

2315
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:17,540
- What?
- Stop being flippant.

2316
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:19,580
The 2nd-string players have no say.
Let's go, dear 1st-string team.

2317
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:21,990
(Oops)

2318
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:23,880
- You lose a point.
- Se Chan.

2319
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,730
Don't use a formal tone.

2320
01:18:26,730 --> 01:18:28,830
- Okay.
- Okay.

2321
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:29,950
(Tiger Gym becomes happy again.)

2322
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:31,090
We scored a point.

2323
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:32,590
Se Chan.

2324
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:35,000
I will tone it down. I am sorry.

2325
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,790
- Tone it down.
- I am sorry. I won't do it.

2326
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:38,630
- Okay.
- Here I go, punks.

2327
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:39,940
- Get a grip.
- Get a grip.

2328
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:41,570
- Get a grip.
- Don't call us punks.

2329
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:43,000
Send it up.

2330
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,410
- So Young is good.
- They are good.

2331
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,320
- All right.
- In.

2332
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,620
It was out.

2333
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:51,340
(After Ji Young's attack,
Yeon Koung received the ball.)

2334
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:52,820
- No.
- You didn't have to receive it.

2335
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:54,080
- Okay.
- Kick it.

2336
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,250
- Kick it.
- Gosh.

2337
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:56,490
(Gosh.)

2338
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:57,820
What was that?

2339
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:58,950
- Okay.
- Kick it.

2340
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:01,160
(Collapsing)

2341
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:02,200
- What was that?
- Hey!

2342
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,090
- You should have kicked it.
- Don't send the ball like that.

2343
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:05,230
Good job.

2344
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:06,620
We did it.

2345
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,460
- We did it.
- Let's tease them.

2346
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:10,070
Good job.

2347
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:12,300
- "Gosh."
- Good job.

2348
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:14,910
- You should have kicked it.
- It's okay.

2349
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:16,170
It's okay.

2350
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:17,670
You should have kept your body down.

2351
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,200
- Good job.
- You sent it backward.

2352
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,650
- You should have kept it down.
- You didn't need to do that.

2353
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:22,340
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

2354
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,840
- Good job.
- It's okay.

2355
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,340
- Tiger! Roar!
- It's okay.

2356
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:27,010
- Tiger!
- It's okay.

2357
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:28,550
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

2358
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:30,120
(Locust Gym does a cheer.)

2359
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,880
Jong Kook can't use his feet.

2360
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,380
- Good.
- Jong Kook can't use his feet.

2361
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:35,790
- Jong Kook.
- It's so funny to see...

2362
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:36,920
that Jong Kook can't use his feet.

2363
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,000
- We are doing well.
- It's okay.

2364
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,120
- It's still 3 to 1.
- Bring it on. I got the hang of it.

2365
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,370
I got the hang of it.

2366
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:42,590
Hey.

2367
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,200
Hey.

2368
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:46,000
- That's good.
- Good job.

2369
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,200
That's good. You are doing well.

2370
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,200
Mine.

2371
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,200
There you go.

2372
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,910
- Out.
- It was in.

2373
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:54,910
- It was in.
- It was in.

2374
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:56,170
- It really was in.
- It was in.

2375
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:57,370
- It was out.
- Out.

2376
01:19:57,370 --> 01:19:58,710
- Out.
- It was in.

2377
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:00,320
- It hit the line.
- Out.

2378
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,690
- It hit the line.
- It was out.

2379
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:03,710
- Bo Pil!
- It was out.

2380
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:05,190
- No.
- Bo Pil!

2381
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:06,490
- It was in.
- It hit the line.

2382
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:07,860
- It hit the line.
- It was in.

2383
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:09,530
Let's review the video.

2384
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:11,120
- Bo Pil!
- It was out.

2385
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,400
- It was out.
- Yeum Cheater.

2386
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,760
- I mean...
- It was out.

2387
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:17,940
(Even the audio director
gave up for a short while.)

2388
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,610
(They are saying things like
"It was in" and "It was out.")

2389
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:21,740
No.

2390
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:23,170
It hit the line, sir.

2391
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,870
She used a formal tone.

2392
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:26,450
- Hey! It was out!
- A formal tone.

2393
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:27,780
She used a formal tone.

2394
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:29,540
- It was out.
- It went out.

2395
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:31,480
- It was out.
- I'm telling you.

2396
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:32,690
- Hang on.
- All right.

2397
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:34,510
According to the assistant judge...

2398
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:37,580
It was out,
and she used the honorifics.

2399
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,620
(It was out,
and she used the honorifics.)

2400
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:40,660
(Locust Gym lost 2 points
in an instant.)

2401
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:41,660
No.

2402
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:43,860
It touched the line.

2403
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:46,230
How is it out?
The ball was right here.

2404
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:47,900
- It was out.
- It touched right here.

2405
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,460
No. It was deflected.

2406
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:50,460
Right here.

2407
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,330
- It was out.
- It was deflected here.

2408
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:55,170
Great. It's out.

2409
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:57,040
(It's obviously out.)

2410
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,950
- Hey, Long Legs.
- It was out.

2411
01:20:58,950 --> 01:20:59,950
Let's move on.

2412
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:01,500
Long Legs committed a foul.

2413
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:02,650
Long Legs, just move on.

2414
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:04,410
- Let's move on.
- I can't believe this.

2415
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:05,790
I'm sure it was deflected.

2416
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:08,250
- They don't know the rules.
- It was obviously in.

2417
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:09,860
- Stay focused.
- You're being unbelievable.

2418
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:11,160
It's out.

2419
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,990
- You think it's in?
- Let's continue.

2420
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:16,000
Gosh, this is really upsetting.

2421
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Kill them.

2422
01:21:17,450 --> 01:21:18,920
Don't use the honorifics.

2423
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,460
Yeon Koung, you can use your hands.

2424
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:21,620
It's okay.

2425
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:23,660
That was good.

2426
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:25,160
- Hey.
- Okay.

2427
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:26,700
- Send it over.
- Good.

2428
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:27,760
That's good.

2429
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:29,170
- Well done.
- It's good.

2430
01:21:29,170 --> 01:21:31,200
- They're good.
- So good.

2431
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,250
- That was good.
- They are really good.

2432
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,250
(So Young is the master
of foot volleyball.)

2433
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:37,450
- How could they be so good?
- Your head.

2434
01:21:38,450 --> 01:21:42,510
(The original libero Ji Young
has a chance to make an attack.)

2435
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:43,620
Mine.

2436
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:44,620
(Heading spike)

2437
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:45,880
Gosh, Hye Seon.

2438
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,360
(They follow the ball,
but it's too late.)

2439
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:50,000
(The original libero finally
won a score.)

2440
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,450
Well done!

2441
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:52,570
Yes!

2442
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,760
- She's really good.
- She's amazing.

2443
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,160
- I mean...
- They are really good.

2444
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,130
Yeon Koung, they are so good.

2445
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,570
What's with them?

2446
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,370
(Hilarious)

2447
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:03,740
My goodness.

2448
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:05,110
Hey.

2449
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:06,410
- Hey.
- My gosh.

2450
01:22:06,410 --> 01:22:08,080
- Let's do this.
- We can do it.

2451
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:10,910
- This is fun.
- Here you go, Yeon Koung.

2452
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:12,650
- Mine
- It's Yeon Koung.

2453
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:14,710
Good.

2454
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:15,860
- Jae Suk.
- Good.

2455
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:17,360
- Head, Jae Suk.
- Gosh.

2456
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,160
- Hey. You fool.
- Hey.

2457
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:21,450
- Jae Suk.
- Should we switch players?

2458
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:24,230
Jae Suk, you should send it over.

2459
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:26,420
(The serial laugher twins
make fun of them.)

2460
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:27,870
Put this on.

2461
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:29,130
Jae Suk, put this on.

2462
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:30,590
- Hey.
- You don't belong here.

2463
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:32,000
- Yeon Koung...
- Put this on.

2464
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,570
- You can't do this. Put this on.
- Hey.

2465
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:36,280
Hye Jin, give me
one more chance. Okay?

2466
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:37,910
- This is your last chance.
- Just one more chance.

2467
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,580
Gosh, Yeon Koung is...

2468
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:41,580
- Yeon Koung was like...
- I'll give you one last chance.

2469
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:42,670
Right.

2470
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:43,670
(She wanted
to switch players right away.)

2471
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:44,950
Don't you think you should switch?

2472
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:46,840
I know.
I'll just wait a little more.

2473
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,340
He wants to have one more chance.

2474
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:49,410
This is your last chance.

2475
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:50,410
- Okay.
- Hey.

2476
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:51,990
- Why aren't you talking?
- What?

2477
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:53,550
- Hey, just go on.
- Hurry and go on.

2478
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:54,950
- Won't you continue?
- Hurry.

2479
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:56,050
What?

2480
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:57,550
- Hey. Shin Min A.
- What?

2481
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:59,370
- What?
- Are you Shin Min A?

2482
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:01,370
She says she's Shin Min A.

2483
01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:03,290
- Hey, just stay still.
- Calm down.

2484
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:05,740
- Don't mind him.
- Talk down to him.

2485
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:07,440
- Don't fight.
- My gosh.

2486
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:08,740
(The little libero
keeps teasing her.)

2487
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:10,040
I'm so happy.

2488
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,580
- My gosh.
- Hey. This is no joke.

2489
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:13,870
Dong Hoon, move back.

2490
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:15,750
- Step back.
- There you go.

2491
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:16,750
- What is he doing?
- What?

2492
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:18,170
- Good.
- Mine.

2493
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:19,840
Send it over.

2494
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:21,250
Here.

2495
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:23,690
- Receive it.
- Ji Young.

2496
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:25,660
(The ball goes back to Ji Young.)

2497
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:26,730
Hey!

2498
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:28,360
- Here.
- Our team is so good.

2499
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,230
- We're really good.
- Jae Suk, send it over.

2500
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:31,530
- Again? An attack.
- Nice.

2501
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:32,900
- Jong Kook.
- Receive this.

2502
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:33,900
(Ji Young, receive this.)

2503
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:34,960
Good.

2504
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,070
(What?)

2505
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:40,440
- Hey.
- Receive this.

2506
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:42,670
(Why is she happy
when the ball touched the net?)

2507
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:43,940
I touched it.

2508
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:45,450
- I touched it.
- What?

2509
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:46,670
Why are you happy?

2510
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:47,780
What's so good?

2511
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:49,840
- Why are you happy?
- Ji Young, why are you excited?

2512
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,040
- My head touched it.
- Ji Young, I'm sorry,

2513
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,410
- It didn't.
- but you need to be punished.

2514
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:54,990
- It didn't go over the net.
- Why are you so excited?

2515
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:56,160
- It didn't go over the next.
- My head touched the ball.

2516
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,360
- It went over the net.
- No, it didn't.

2517
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,250
- It didn't?
- It's okay. We're winning.

2518
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:03,230
- No.
- They're the best female players...

2519
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:04,230
- I've ever seen.
- We lost.

2520
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:06,370
Jae Suk, they are
professional players.

2521
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:07,700
Good.

2522
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:09,130
(Oh, dear.)

2523
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,540
Guys, Se Chan used the honorifics.

2524
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,000
(Se Chan used the honorifics.)

2525
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,540
Se Chan used the honorifics.

2526
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:16,610
Hey!

2527
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:17,940
I can't believe this.

2528
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:19,480
- Why?
- Why did you use the honorifics?

2529
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,750
Why did you do that?

2530
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:21,980
I'm going to...

2531
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:24,150
- Why did you use the honorifics?
- Why?

2532
01:24:24,150 --> 01:24:25,990
- Jae Suk made me say it.
- Why would you do that?

2533
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:27,120
It was because of Jae Suk.

2534
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,750
I won't talk from now on.

2535
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:30,120
- Don't talk.
- Okay.

2536
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:31,790
- I won't.
- Why does he keep doing that?

2537
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:32,950
Guys, let's smile.

2538
01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:34,880
Why is the ignorant brat
being so polite?

2539
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,500
I know. He's just ignorant.

2540
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:37,750
An ignorant brat?

2541
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:39,700
- Let's do this.
- Here we go.

2542
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,090
- All right.
- Mine.

2543
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,400
- Good.
- Jae Suk.

2544
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:44,460
- Good.
- Again?

2545
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:45,540
- Okay.
- Okay.

2546
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,910
- You guys are so good.
- It's coming over.

2547
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:49,940
(Groaning)

2548
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:52,170
- It's coming over.
- Gosh.

2549
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:53,410
Jae Suk!

2550
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:54,410
(Rib blocking)

2551
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:56,480
(Jae Suk...)

2552
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,120
- Jae Suk.
- Hey.

2553
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,340
- Why are you here.
- Ji Young...

2554
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:00,750
- Why were you standing still?
- Move back.

2555
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:02,580
- Go back. You can't do this.
- Hey.

2556
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:04,880
(Se Chan and Jae Suk
are ruining the game.)

2557
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,860
- It's going so well.
- They are horrible.

2558
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:08,120
They are really bad.

2559
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:10,330
It's not like that.

2560
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:12,620
It's not my fault. Gosh.

2561
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:15,070
Why did you turn your back on them?

2562
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:17,500
- You should look at the ball.
- He's horrible.

2563
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:19,000
- Hey.
- My gosh.

2564
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,160
Now I know what you meant
about Yeon Koung.

2565
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,870
It's suffocating, isn't it?

2566
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:24,480
Gosh, Yeon Koung is unbelievable.

2567
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,950
Her face says everything.

2568
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:27,950
Why are you coming forward again?
Go backward.

2569
01:25:27,950 --> 01:25:30,870
- Gosh, Jae Suk.
- Okay. I'll do it right.

2570
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:32,690
- Let's do this.
- We can do this.

2571
01:25:32,690 --> 01:25:33,710
It's going well.

2572
01:25:33,710 --> 01:25:35,150
- Okay.
- I should've used my foot.

2573
01:25:35,150 --> 01:25:36,860
- Back.
- Good. Slow down.

2574
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:39,120
- Use your leg.
- Good.

2575
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:41,860
- Good.
- Yeum Cheater.

2576
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,530
- Send it over.
- Good, Yeum Cheater.

2577
01:25:43,530 --> 01:25:45,590
- Good.
- Use your leg.

2578
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:46,620
Jong Kook.

2579
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,120
- Okay!
- Yes!

2580
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,130
(You should come and take the ball.)

2581
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:50,370
In 1, 2, and 3.

2582
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:52,070
- Good.
- Well done.

2583
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,910
- Se Chan, watch your mouth.
- Okay. I will.

2584
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:55,000
- We can catch up.
- Be careful.

2585
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,200
Jong Kook.

2586
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,300
- We can do this.
- Jong Kook.

2587
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:00,750
Hey.

2588
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:02,510
It's okay.

2589
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:03,710
(Your turn to serve.)

2590
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:06,080
My gosh.

2591
01:26:06,450 --> 01:26:08,080
It only touched my lips.

2592
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:10,120
- How is that possible?
- It touched my lips.

2593
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,360
If it was someone else,
it would've been fine.

2594
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,360
It just touched my lips.

2595
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,450
It happened because it was you.

2596
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:15,950
The ball would've passed by
if it was someone else.

2597
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:16,950
It can only happen to you and me.

2598
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:18,360
It only touched my lips.

2599
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,870
That's funny. It grazed his lips.

2600
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,760
Long Legs. Okay, bring it on.

2601
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,260
Hey, Long Legs!

2602
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:28,740
Can't you do it with your legs?

2603
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:30,040
(What?)

2604
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:31,740
- Can't you do it with your legs?
- You can't, can you?

2605
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:33,040
You can't, can you?

2606
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,080
(How would Team Yeon Koung react
to the little libero's provocation?)

2607
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,080
(The option of this round is...)

2608
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,340
(not to lose your temper.)

2609
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:39,910
(Smiling)

2610
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:41,820
(They cannot help
but lose their temper...)

2611
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:44,250
(playing the games.)

2612
01:26:44,410 --> 01:26:45,750
- It's not here.
- It's not.

2613
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:49,000
(They even glare at their trainers.)

2614
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,290
- The score is 0 to 0.
- Yeon Koung should...

2615
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:51,550
(You should go
to the second-string team.)

2616
01:26:51,550 --> 01:26:53,330
(The Long Legs are
in danger of relegation.)

2617
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:55,630
(Overcoming the crisis)

2618
01:26:55,630 --> 01:26:57,130
(Let's do this!)

2619
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:58,130
It will break.

2620
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,460
(The rookies seem confident,)

2621
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:03,040
(but they aren't good enough.)

2622
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,000
(You're
the highest-paid player here.)

2623
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:08,040
(- How about 220 dollars?
- I want 230.)

2624
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,910
(Because of their dishonesty,)

2625
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:11,410
(the negotiation falters.)

2626
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:12,490
I'll go.

2627
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:14,450
(What will happen to the Long Legs
after the negotiation?)

2628
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:18,830
(Kwang Soo!)

2629
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:21,530
(Chil Deuk!)

2630
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:23,500
(Fierce Transfer Race 2:
Negotiation of Long Legs)
