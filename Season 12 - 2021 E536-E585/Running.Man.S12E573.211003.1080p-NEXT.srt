00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,770
- It's all right.
- It's not!

23
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,100
It's okay.

24
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,430

25
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,670

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't talk.

- Don't say a word.

32
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Stay quiet.

33
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,090
Drop the honorifics.

34
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,250
Good.

35
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,390
- Jong Kook.
- Okay.

36
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,560

43
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,560
(Yeum Cheater's deep offense)

44
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,500
- Good.
- One and two.

45
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,000
- That was two.
- Good.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,200
- Good.

47
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,510
It touched her head.

49
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,680

Good. Well done.

56
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,810
I'll defend.

57
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,260

58
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480

- Good.

60
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,620
- Okay.
- Great.

61
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,620
(Yeon Koung sends it up high.)

62
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,760
Jae Suk.

63
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,000
(Great)

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,030

66
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,670
(He poses...)

67
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,040
(and spins.)

68
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,600
Come here.

69
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,010
(The excellent rally
ends with Trainer Yoo's blunder.)

70
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,310
- Come on.
- In 1, 2, and 3.

71
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,570
There you go.

72
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,310
What's wrong with him?

73
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,650
I don't know.

74
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,470
- Jae Suk.
- What's with him?

75
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,810
That was a close call.

76
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,180
- What's with him?
- Yeon Koung did a good job.

77
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,250
How dare he try to look cool?

78
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,620
- How dare he?
- What's wrong with him?

79
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,120

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,430
- Drop the honorifics.
- All right.

82
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,800
We're doing a good job.

83
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,160
We can do this.

84
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,630

96
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,460

98
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,280
(He attacks safely.)

99
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,090

- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

104
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,030
What was that?

105
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,130
What was that? I don't get it.

106
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,500
What was that?

107
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,870
It was hard to receive.

108
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,930
That was a hard one.

109
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,180
You should've received it.

110
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,500

You should've done it better.

I'm sorry.

114
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,120
Those who're good
don't make excuses.

115
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,910
- You have to do something.
- All right.

I touched it, but why is no one
on our team taking my side?

177
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,230
(Her colleagues knew she was lying,
so they stayed quiet.)

178
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,600
- We need one point.
- I'll be sure to receive it.

179
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,800
Nice.

180
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,060
- Done.
- Okay.

181
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,100
- Done.
- Good.

182
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,330
- Well done.
- Do you want me to send it up high?

183
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,830
Okay.

184
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,110
(He sends a spike onto the line.)

185
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,270
- Okay.
- Well done.

186
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,330
- Hands.
- After a bounce.

187
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,870
Hands. Good.

188
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,350
All right. Head.

189
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,570
- Hey.
- Good.

190
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,350
(She gives a header spike again.)

191
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,290
- Don't make it too hard.
- Good.

192
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,580
- Good.
- It's okay.

193
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,510
- My gosh.
- Okay.

194
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,660
Okay!

195
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,930
(The ball touches the net,
so they score a lucky point.)

196
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,020
- Good.
- Well done.

197
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,760
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

198
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,690
- It's okay.
- They were lucky.

199
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,370
I think we're losing.

200
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,240
- I'm bleeding.
- Are you all right?

201
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,000
- What's wrong?
- Did you get hit?

202
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,910
No. I was so upset
that I bit my lips.

203
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,830
(No. I was so upset
that I bit my lips.)

204
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,140
(There's bloodshed at the bench.)

205
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,610
- Do it right.
- We will have a chance.

206
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,920
- Let's do this. It's okay.
- Do things right.

207
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,220
- It's okay. We will get a chance.
- Okay. Don't worry.

208
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,160
- It's us. Serve.
- Don't use the honorifics.

209
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,360
- Don't talk.
- Yeon Koung's service is good.

210
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,160
We have to receive
Yeon Koung's service.

211
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,880
Let Long Legs serve.

212
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,230
Let her do it.

213
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
- Good.
- Jong Kook.

214
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
That's a good one.

215
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,870
- Good.
- Jong Kook.

216
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,470
- Okay.
- Gosh.

217
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,970
- Let her do it.
- Ji Young.

218
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,670
Okay.

219
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,070
(Serve ace)

220
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,070
(Long Legs
and her friends are roaring.)

221
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,200
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

222
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,940
- It's okay.
- Well done.

223
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,770
Good. It was a hard one.

224
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,980
Jong Kook is out of his element.

225
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,490
Let's go.

226
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,290
- Good.
- It's okay.

227
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,120
With all his muscles.

228
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,680
- Let's go.
- We have only a few points left.

229
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,820
Long Legs, bring it on.

230
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,250
Hey, Long Legs.

231
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,500
Can't you do it with your feet?

232
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,600
(The kid provokes her
feeling afraid of her service.)

233
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,760
I guess she can't use her feet.

234
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,390
- Serve now.
- Can't you do it?

235
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,930
- You can't do it, can you?
- Serve now.

236
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,630
(She answers with a strong serve.)

237
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,410
- You can't do it, can you?
- Serve now.

238
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,000
Gosh.

239
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,200
- Ji Young.
- Here you go.

240
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,370
It's out.

241
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,940
- Okay.
- It's out.

242
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,290
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

243
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,990
- Good.
- We have to stay quiet.

244
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,360
Drop the honorifics.

245
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,380
We have to stay quiet.
Drop the honorifics.

246
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,160
(They throw a ball
at Se Chan's head.)

247
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,950
That was a mistake.

248
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,800
- We gave you the ball.
- This isn't right.

249
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,060
We just gave you the ball.

250
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,320
- Hey.
- We passed the ball.

251
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,600
- Why would you do that?
- It is bad manners.

252
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,830
It's your fault
that you turned against the next.

253
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,630
- Is it my fault?
- Hey.

254
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,980
Why did you turn against the next?

255
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,610
- It's your fault.
- Who'd turn...

256
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,110
- against the net on the court?
- It's your bad.

257
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,920
- I gave you the ball.
- I was startled.

258
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,050
I just passed the ball.

259
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,420
All right.

260
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,790
It's your fault...

261
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,810
- that you turned against the net.
- Let's move on.

262
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,990
We should continue.

263
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,220
Don't you dare turn around.

264
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,680
- We have to receive this.
- Okay.

265
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,790
We must win.

266
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,490
Here I go.

267
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,750
- You lose one point.
- She lost a point.

268
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,100
- One point.
- Okay.

269
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,390
- Yes!
- Why?

270
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,520
She used the honorifics.

271
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,670
Okay!

272
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,740
Did she use the honorifics?

273
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,130
(Thank you for giving us 1 point.)

274
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,870
- Are we winning?
- Okay.

275
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,000
Is it over?

276
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,610
- They lost one point.
- Don't open it.

277
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,500
(Groaning)

278
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,570
Yeon Koung.

279
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,410
(Unfortunately,
the same incident happened again.)

280
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,250
What was that?

281
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,580
- Yeon Koung, it's bad manners.
- What was that?

282
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,050
I just gave you the ball.

283
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,080
- What?
- Isn't she supposed to...

284
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,880
- throw the ball like this?
- It's bad manners.

285
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,990
She should be given a red card.

286
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,930
- Didn't you do it on purpose?
- No.

287
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,290
Hey!

288
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,820
Didn't you do it on purpose?

289
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,430
(He's caught using the honorifics.)

290
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,600
Let's do a cheer.

291
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,290
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes! Okay.

292
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,340
Don't talk at all.

293
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,530
- Keep talking to them.
- Jong Kook can't do this.

294
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,170
- Keep talking to them.
- Long Legs.

295
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,480
- Long Legs.
- Hey.

296
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,500
Long Legs. Okay, good.

297
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,170
Yeon Koung, why don't you
use your legs?

298
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,170
Stay focused.

299
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,320
Send it over.

300
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,320
(Yeon Koung's first foot serve)

301
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,640
My gosh.

302
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,460
That's strong.

303
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,220
(Foot Volleyball Comedian
manages to receive it.)

304
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,380
That was strong.

305
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,280
Yeon Koung is good.

306
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,920
- Mine.
- Good.

307
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,920
- Okay.
- Yeum Cheater.

308
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,970
- My gosh.
- Okay.

309
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,030
(Laughing)

310
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,570
(Depressed)

311
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,630
You can score one point.

312
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,270
- You can do this.
- We have to win.

313
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,500
Turn the game around.

314
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,800
- We have good teamwork.
- Good.

315
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,270
- Tiger.
- Yes.

316
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,080
- All right.
- I'm so excited.

317
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,510
Okay. Long Legs, receive this.

318
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,250
- Long Legs.
- Long Legs, come on and receive.

319
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,590
Long Legs, can you do this?

320
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,990
Okay.

321
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,280
Send it over.

322
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,650
- Okay.
- Good.

323
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,120
- Well done. Use your head.
- Good.

324
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,550
- Good.
- Done.

325
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,830
Hey, So Young.

326
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,330
- Good.
- So Young is good.

327
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,940
(The ace player is not distracted
by Trainer Yoo at all.)

328
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,290
- Good. Well done.
- Yeum Cheater.

329
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,570
- Okay.
- Nice.

330
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,160
- Jong Kook will miss it.
- Good.

331
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,480
- Pass.
- Serve.

332
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,630
- Jong Kook.
- Ji Young.

333
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,040
- Pass.
- Serve.

334
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,080
- Jong Kook.
- Ji Young.

335
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,040
(They score a point
with a diving header.)

336
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,540
Gosh, we did it!

337
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,450
Ji Young.

338
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,220
Ji Young, that was amazing.

339
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,720
- Hey!
- Amazing.

340
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,280
We did it.

341
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,230
(That was something
that we can't see on Running Man.)

342
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,190
- Ji Young.
- Well done.

343
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,700
Ji Young is really good.

344
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,330
Hey, how could you be so good?

345
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,790
I got goosebumps.

346
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,260
- Ji Young is unbelievable.
- I got goosebumps.

347
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,370
- They are so good.
- It couldn't be helped.

348
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,390
- Right.
- There was nothing we could do.

349
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,000
- It's okay.
- Don't worry.

350
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,080
- It's okay.
- This is just the beginning.

351
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,740
- Don't talk.
- Stop talking.

352
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,110
- Just smile.
- Are we 9 or 10?

353
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,640
- We're 10.
- We're 10.

354
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
- This is the last.
- One point.

355
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,370
- Stay focused.
- Set point.

356
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,510
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

357
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,950
- One more point.
- We can turn it around.

358
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,650
- I'll receive it no matter what.
- Okay.

359
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,320
I love you, guys.

360
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,550
I love you.

361
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,380
Set point.

362
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,830
- Done.
- Okay.

363
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,100
- Stay calm.
- Smile.

364
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,570
- I did it.
- Okay. Go.

365
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,390
There it goes.

366
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,070
It's coming. Do it.

367
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,390
It's coming over.

368
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,440
All right.

369
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,370
- What?
- Deduct one point.

370
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,270
(Trainer Kook charges
toward the net.)

371
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,370
- Deduct one point.
- No.

372
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,580
- Hey.
- He damaged the net.

373
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,770
- He damaged the net.
- He damaged the net.

374
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,250
He didn't touch the ball,
so they lose one point anyway.

375
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,090
- Okay!
- Well done.

376
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,360
- Let's do a cheer.
- Okay. We need one point.

377
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,780
We can do this. Se Chan.

378
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,750
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

379
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,420
- All right.
- Stay focused.

380
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,070
(The pony is excited
by the score of 10 to 9.)

381
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,390
Good.

382
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,630
Only one point.

383
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,970
- You can do this.
- We must win.

384
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,300
- We will win.
- Turn the game around.

385
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,530
- This is the last round.
- One point.

386
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,270
- Stay focused.
- Set point.

387
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,480
- Good luck.
- Let's do this.

388
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,940
Yeon Koung, make a serve.

389
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,610
Okay. Good.

390
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,140
Jong Kook gave us nine points.

391
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,450
Jong Kook, you're the best.

392
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,380
- No. It's Se Chan's turn to serve.
- It's Se Chan's turn.

393
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,540
It's Se Chan's serve.

394
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,490
- It's Se Chan's turn to serve.
- Right.

395
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,690
- Send it over.
- Long Legs.

396
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,690
Go ahead.

397
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,020
Hey, why won't you say anything?

398
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,730
Just score. Don't let him fool you.

399
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,290
- Se Chan, we just need one point.
- I said, speak.

400
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,890
- You should talk on a variety show.
- We need just one point.

401
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,920
- Here I go.
- Okay.

402
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,330
- You can do this.
- Hey, don't step on the line.

403
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,970
- Hye Seon, don't step on the line.
- Just go for it.

404
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,370
- Don't step on the line.
- Can you move back a little?

405
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,340
- Hey, don't step on the line.
- I said, don't step on the line.

406
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,370
Jong Kook is so bad at this.

407
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,030
- He keeps stepping on the line.
- Jong Kook is so bad at this.

408
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,080
- It's coming.
- Jong Kook is so bad at this.

409
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,130
Speak casually, everyone.

410
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,480
- Two.
- Send it over.

411
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,540
- Send it over.
- This is our chance.

412
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,040
- That's good.
- Just send it over, and we'll win.

413
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,640
- Send it over.
- Okay. Good.

414
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,510
Let's just play it safe.

415
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,380
We can win
if we just keep sending it over.

416
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,410
- We don't have to take a risk.
- Send it over.

417
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,190
(She kicks it lightly.)

418
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,120
Out.

419
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,020
- Out.
- In.

420
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,390
(Where did the ball land?)

421
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,100
- It's out.
- In!

422
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,340
- It was out.
- Yes!

423
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,160
- Oh, yes!
- In!

424
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,130
We won?

425
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,610
- We won!
- Yes!

426
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,800
- We won!
- Great job.

427
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,480
- We were amazing.
- It was in.

428
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,910
(It's sweeter than a victory
in the Olympic games.)

429
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,690
- We won.
- Go, Korea!

430
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,640
Hey, guys.

431
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,490
- You did well.
- Good job.

432
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,190
- It's okay. We can win next time.
- How about we complain?

433
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,120
- Should we complain? Can't we?
- That won't work.

434
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,150
- It was in for sure.
- Really?

435
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,390
- Let's do better next time.
- One, two, three. Yes!

436
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
- Great job.
- Yes!

437
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,070
(They cheer even though they lost.)

438
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,500
(Yes!)

439
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,260
- Tiger! Yes!
- Yes!

440
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,630
(Tiger Gym won Round 1.)

441
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,770
- That was good.
- That was amazing.

442
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,080
- We were incredible.
- I'm amazed.

443
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,170
My, we did incredibly well.

444
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,170
Good game.

445
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,250
- Good game.
- Gosh.

446
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,040
- My goodness. That was amazing.
- Why are you upset?

447
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,460
- Be quiet!
- Good game.

448
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,280
- All right.
- We should cheer for them.

449
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,520
The 2nd-string players of each team
will play in the 2nd round,

450
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
but 1 of the 1st-string players
can join the team.

451
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,020
Yeon Koung is good at attacking.

452
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,760
- Let's do this.
- Yes. Yeon Koung, join the game.

453
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,870
- Me?
- Let's pick Yeon Koung. Yes.

454
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,200
Then... You're not so good, right?

455
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,240
- Right.
- You go to the front.

456
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,740
- Which one should we choose?
- How about Ji Young?

457
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,130
- Ji Young, Yeon Koung is playing.
- To serve?

458
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,710
- Shall I join the game? I'll serve.
- Attack as much as you want.

459
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,670
- This is your chance.
- To be honest...

460
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,400
Okay. Let's cheer for them.
Go, Team!

461
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,640
(Tiger Gym: Captain Ji Young,
Suk Jin, Ji Hyo, Hee Jin)

462
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,620
(Locust Gym: Captain So Min,
Yeon Koung, Hye Jin, Eun Jin)

463
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,690
Choose the libero, please.

464
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,850
- Whom should we choose?
- Hey.

465
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,780
We choose So Min as the libero.

466
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,910
- All right. That's good for us.
- That's great.

467
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,020
- Why?
- I like that.

468
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,090
- Thank you.
- I like that.

469
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,120
- Hold on.
- Was I wrong?

470
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,790
- Was that a bad choice?
- You can't change it now.

471
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,230
- Wait. No. Why did you choose her?
- You can't change it.

472
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,570
- Hang on.
- You can't change it.

473
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,420
- Then can we...
- No. It's over.

474
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,160
- We should choose Suk Jin.
- Right.

475
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,390
- Is it okay?
- We choose Suk Jin.

476
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,970
- We choose Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin is the libero.

477
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,030
- Really?
- Okay. It's decided.

478
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,440
- Are we still speaking casually?
- It hurts when I laugh.

479
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,980
- Let's begin.
- That's over now.

480
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,000
- When did it end?
- Hey, go now.

481
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,350
He says we can speak formally now.

482
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,980
Why haven't you gotten used to it?

483
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,090
- Let's keep it that way for now.
- Let's do that.

484
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,120
(They'll continue speaking casually
regardless of the game.)

485
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,540
But I think it's over.

486
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,280
The option for this round is
smiling and not getting upset.

487
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,730
- I see. I like that.
- Okay.

488
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,700
Right. I know how that goes.

489
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,390
- Make sure not to lose your temper.
- I won't.

490
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,630
- Smile when you speak.
- Got it.

491
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,700
Keep filming Yeon Koung's face.

492
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,240
I'll keep my eyes on her
to see if she smiles or not.

493
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,710
- Hey, you made no contribution.
- What? Gosh.

494
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,370
(Ms. Bread bursts out in anger.)

495
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,640
- She just yelled.
- The game hasn't begun yet.

496
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,450
- She's getting upset. Look at her.
- Go ahead. The score is 0 to 0.

497
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,010
- Deduct a point.
- It's 0 to 0.

498
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,510
- See?
- It's 0 to 0.

499
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,960
- They should lose a point.
- Smile when you speak.

500
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,990
- Speak with a smile, okay?
- It's okay.

501
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,960
- Okay. I'll do that once we begin.
- Don't forget to smile.

502
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,230
Isn't she actually Kwang Soo?

503
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,730
- She's just like Kwang Soo.
- She acts just like he used to.

504
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,020
Hey, you're Kwang Soo, aren't you?

505
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,370
- Aren't you Kwang Soo?
- She's just like Kwang Soo.

506
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,760
- You didn't do anything.
- Let's do this.

507
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,530
- Stop talking like you did well.
- She acts like Kwang Soo used to.

508
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,940
(The assassin on the court is back.)

509
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,530
- You can practice now.
- Okay.

510
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,710
- You can do it!
- I'll receive it.

511
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,710
- You can do it.
- Let's go!

512
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,440
- Suk Jin, go to the front.
- Okay.

513
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,130
- Out.
- Out.

514
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,640
- It's just practice. It's okay.
- Okay. It's just practice.

515
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,040
It's just practice.
I got the hang of it.

516
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,140
It's just practice.

517
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,250
What are you talking about?

518
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,650
Hey, are you frowning?
I think you are.

519
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,550
- It's just practice, you know.
- The game begins now.

520
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,550
- It begins now.
- The game begins now.

521
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,780
(Smiling)

522
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,880
Yeon Koung, you should smile.

523
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,920
(As soon as she heard
that the game began,)

524
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,000
(Yeon Koung put on a silly smile.)

525
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,600
- Yeon Koung, you should smile.
- Okay.

526
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,830
- Smile, everyone.
- I'll smile from this moment on.

527
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,520
- It begins now. Okay.
- Smile.

528
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,600
Yeon Koung, you should smile.

529
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,000
- She's just like Kwang Soo.
- Exactly.

530
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
- Smile.
- Okay.

531
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,370
She behaves just like he used to.

532
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,400
- Let's go.
- Get ready.

533
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,540
I'll receive it.

534
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,080
- What's this? Is it out?
- Out.

535
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,640
- It's out. Yes.
- It's okay.

536
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,850
- What's this? Is it out?
- Out. It's out. Yes.

537
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,510
- Smile.
- It's okay.

538
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,620
(I think she just frowned.)

539
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,410
- I think she just frowned.
- Yeon Koung.

540
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,190
- How did that happen?
- I think she got upset.

541
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,490
- I think she lost her temper.
- I think so too.

542
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,420
- You hit it too hard.
- How did that happen?

543
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,390
- I don't understand.
- I think she lost her temper.

544
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,000
Hey, you fool.

545
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,100
I'm sorry.

546
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,440
I'm going to kill you.

547
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,760
- Get ready.
- You fool.

548
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,840
- She reminds me of Kwang Soo.
- Let's go.

549
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,900
She does, indeed.

550
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,270
- She's amazing.
- Head the ball.

551
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,440
- She's really amazing.
- Head it.

552
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,630
- Spike.
- I'll receive it.

553
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,080
- Will you?
- Yes, I'll receive it.

554
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
- Go ahead.
- Here.

555
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,400
- Head it.
- Head the ball.

556
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,540
- Send it over.
- Head it.

557
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,580
Head it.

558
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,010
- It didn't touch her head.
- Nice!

559
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,350
Head it.

560
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,690
(She missed the ball.)

561
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,150
- It didn't touch her head.
- No, it touched her head.

562
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,150
- Okay.
- I sent it over the net.

563
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,380
- It didn't touch your head.
- He's right.

564
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,150
- Did you see it?
- The ball didn't touch your head.

565
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,290
- Wait.
- She got upset.

566
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,420
- Yeon Koung didn't smile.
- I smiled.

567
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,870
- Speak with a smile.
- Smile.

568
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,000
- "The ball didn't touch your head."
- You saw that, didn't you?

569
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,230
- I smiled.
- She didn't smile.

570
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,440
- She didn't smile.
- Did it touch or not?

571
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,700
It didn't touch. Continue.

572
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,400
- Okay. I smiled.
- It didn't touch.

573
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,300
- I smiled like this.
- No, that's okay.

574
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,870
- Sorry?
- She's just like Kwang Soo.

575
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,030
She's just like him.

576
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,380
She's exactly the same as him.

577
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,410
(She's a world-class player
who behaves like Kwang Soo.)

578
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,340
- Are you sure?
- I smiled.

579
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,180
- Okay.
- Let's go.

580
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,080
Hey, Shin Min A,
I'll see how well you can do.

581
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,190
- You should smile.
- I'll keep my eyes on you.

582
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,510
- All right. Bring it on.
- Suk Jin, you're blocking my view.

583
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,750
I don't think you can do it.

584
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,530
- Oh, my. Great.
- My goodness.

585
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,500
- Oh, my. Great.
- My goodness.

586
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,630
- Min A.
- Min A.

587
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,840
- Smile.
- Min A, what was that?

588
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,580
Hey, Yeon Koung, isn't this fun?

589
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,400
- Min A, come over here.
- I told you before.

590
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,310
- Are you kidding me?
- Kwang Soo. Hold on.

591
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,410
- I told you I wasn't good at this.
- Hit it inside the lines, okay?

592
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,410
Why do you think I'm wearing this?

593
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,790
- I know.
- That was funny.

594
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,260
- Min A, get it together.
- I'm sorry, everyone.

595
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,490
Blow the whistle.

596
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,950
- Blow the whistle.
- You fool.

597
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,450
- All right. Let's go.
- Can I go now? Okay.

598
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,800
- It's coming.
- Don't worry.

599
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,890
- So Min, receive it. Move.
- Good job.

600
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,770
(So Min was zoning out.)

601
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,860
(And she hit the ball outside.)

602
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,870
(Libero Jeon is useless
even if she's allowed to use her hands.)

603
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,080
- It's okay.
- It's okay, So Min.

604
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,750
- Oh, yes.
- Great.

605
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,900
(She was like this.)

606
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,080
My gosh.

607
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,080
- So Min, it's okay.
- So Min.

608
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,490
- It's okay.
- So Min, you should focus.

609
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,380
(The daughter of a former athlete
causes the trainer grief.)

610
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,030
- So Min.
- Just replace her with a scarecrow.

611
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,150
- So Min, get it together.
- So Min, you've got this.

612
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,450
- Smile.
- Just replace her with a scarecrow.

613
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,570
Let's hit the ball toward So Min
whenever we serve.

614
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,000
Keep your eyes on the ball, okay?

615
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,630
At least the ball would bounce off
the scarecrow.

616
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,570
- So Min, move.
- Let's go.

617
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,740
Yeon Koung just told me
to move aside.

618
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,780
- No. I told you to stand here.
- Let's go.

619
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,050
The ball will fall here,
then hit it with your hands.

620
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,480
- It'll fall in the middle.
- Got it.

621
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,610
- Okay.
- I'm ready.

622
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,910
Here we go.

623
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,640
- What a powerful serve.
- Oh, my.

624
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,790
- Hey, leave it.
- Yes!

625
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:30,880
- What a powerful serve.
- Oh, my.

626
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,830
(She looked like she was dancing.)

627
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,800
(The world-class Long Legs
is humiliated...)

628
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,230
(after she tells So Min off.)

629
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,970
(Laughing)

630
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,690
(They start teasing her.)

631
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,390
That was so funny.

632
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,900
(Long Legs forces herself to smile
with her hair blown.)

633
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,480
- You did a good job.
- She couldn't receive it.

634
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,900
- That's right.
- Exactly.

635
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,050
- That's good.
- Like this.

636
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,440
She couldn't receive it.

637
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,220
- It's okay.
- Yeon Koung, it's okay.

638
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,440
Right. We can do this.

639
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,680
- Hey, stop it.
- It's okay.

640
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,650
- That was an amazing serve.
- Let's begin.

641
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,180
- What a great serve.
- Nice serve!

642
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,920
Here we go.

643
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,350
- Min A, smile.
- Okay.

644
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,060
- She's good at serving too.
- She's amazing.

645
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,000
- That's good.
- Go.

646
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,890
- Here.
- Oh, gosh.

647
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,570
(Oh, gosh.)

648
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,090
- Here.
- Oh, gosh.

649
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,430
(Flopping down)

650
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,240
<i>Go, Tiger, Tiger is the best</i>

651
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,940
- Good job.
<i>- Go, Tiger</i>

652
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,580
- What was that?
- That was funny.

653
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,600
(Hold on, Min A.)

654
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,320
- Min A.
- Hey.

655
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,480
- Get it together, will you?
- We'll win.

656
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,840
Min A.

657
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,680
- That was great.
- It was hard to receive.

658
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,490
- Min A, you should stay focused.
- Trust me.

659
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,990
(Proving that not every volleyball player
is good at this)

660
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,060
- Min A.
- Oh, my.

661
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,330
- This is so exciting.
- Oh, my.

662
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,420
- That was so funny.
- Goodness.

663
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,690
Shin Min A.

664
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,920
Guys, Yeon Koung seems upset.

665
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,160
- No, I'm not.
- I think she's upset.

666
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,730
- You're not upset, are you?
- I'm smiling.

667
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,660
- That was hilarious.
- Stay focused.

668
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,000
- I'm sorry.
- We should do better than this.

669
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,040
They sure are second-string players.

670
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,100
Suk Jin hasn't kicked the ball
until now. Not even once.

671
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,810
Hold on. Suk Jin, I'm sorry,

672
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,280
- but you win after doing nothing.
- True.

673
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,670
- Impressive. That's a great skill.
- Of course.

674
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,980
- This is nice.
- Hey.

675
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,910
- Someone else can serve...
- Just do it.

676
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,220
- Hurry up.
- if you ask.

677
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,490
- Do you want me to serve?
- Suk Jin, shut it and do your job.

678
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,680
- That's the plan.
- Go ahead. Just do your job.

679
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,060
(He got criticized
before he even touched the ball.)

680
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,350
- What did you say?
- Just do your job.

681
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,390
What did you say before that?

682
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,000
"Suk Jin, shut it and do your job."

683
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,160
(He practically asked
to be criticized.)

684
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,360
Do you want me to serve or not?

685
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,360
- Okay.
- You can do this.

686
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,340
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

687
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,470
- Jong Kook, you should smile.
- Suk Jin.

688
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,810
- Right. I'll do that. Go, Suk Jin.
- You should smile.

689
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,480
- Let's go.
- All right.

690
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,370
- Okay.
- Good job.

691
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,370
- Good. Now send it over.
- Send it over.

692
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,580
- That's good. Nice.
- That's good.

693
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,320
- Suk Jin.
- You should've received it.

694
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,840
- Send it over. That's good. Nice.
- That's good.

695
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,610
(The ball quickly passed by.)

696
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,020
- Why didn't you receive it?
- Oh, yes!

697
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,490
It came toward you.

698
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,150
He got upset.
Suk Jin lost his temper.

699
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,060
- Okay.
- Oh, it was me.

700
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,620
Tiger Gym will lose another point.

701
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,390
- Oh, yes!
- Why?

702
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,800
- Why?
- Suk Jin lost his temper.

703
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,090
- I...
- Suk Jin got upset.

704
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,540
- Let's go.
- Let's cheer.

705
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,070
- We can do this.
- Jae Suk, come.

706
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,870
- Oh, right. Yes.
- Let's cheer.

707
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,930
By the way, you'll keep speaking
casually to the end, right?

708
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,200
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

709
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,750
- I feel more comfortable this way.
- Right.

710
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,750
- Smile, everyone.
- Beep!

711
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,780
- Head it.
- Okay.

712
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,990
- Hit it toward So Min if you can.
- Got it.

713
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,340
- So Min, you can do it.
- I can do it.

714
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,950
- So Min, use your hands.
- That's good.

715
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,680
(Playing catch)

716
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,060
(So Min, use your hands.)

717
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,190
(Furious)

718
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,770
- So Min, great job.
- What was that?

719
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,270
So Min, you're not
playing dodgeball.

720
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,330
- It's okay.
- My gosh.

721
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,970
Listen, So Min.
You're not playing dodgeball.

722
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,000
(Her body malfunctions
whenever a ball comes near.)

723
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,430
Did I hit it too hard?

724
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,970
- I think...
- That was awesome.

725
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,540
- You hit it so accurately.
- Great job.

726
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,540
- I'm impressed.
- She's amazing.

727
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,280
So Min, are you kidding?

728
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,310
(He said it with a smile.)

729
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,720
So Min, you should stay focused.

730
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,440
- This is not dodgeball.
- I know.

731
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,820
- Okay?
- I was so startled.

732
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,910
- All right. You can use your hands.
- That startled me. Understood.

733
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,260
- Do better this time. Move back.
- I can do it.

734
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,290
Stop. Stand right there. Okay.

735
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,950
Make sure to receive the ball.
Use your hands, okay?

736
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,560
- Spread your legs.
- Got it.

737
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,570
- Spread your legs. That's good.
- Okay.

738
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,190
Yeon Koung talked to So Min
in an annoyed, commanding tone.

739
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,360
- No, I didn't.
- That's not true.

740
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,570
- Okay.
- That didn't make me upset.

741
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,270
- I was smiling.
- She still looks upset.

742
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,930
- She's getting upset.
- She's losing her temper.

743
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,930
- She's just taken aback.
- That's not true.

744
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,480
- She's taken aback, not upset.
- She has a droopy mouth.

745
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,170
- She has a droopy mouth.
- She's not upset.

746
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,550
- I'm not upset.
- Bo Pil.

747
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,750
She was focusing on the game.

748
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,640
- Exactly. She was focusing on it.
- Come on.

749
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,110
- Can we...
- Are you hungry?

750
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,560
- I didn't get upset.
- She didn't.

751
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,820
I'm too scared to continue.

752
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,060
- Look. He's frowning.
- They keep making an angry face.

753
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,760
- Your team will lose a point.
- Good.

754
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,950
- What did I do?
- Smile.

755
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,070
- Please smile.
- You should smile.

756
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,890
- Both teams lost a point.
- Okay.

757
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,190
- Don't forget to smile.
- Okay.

758
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,070
Min A,
you don't have to hit it hard.

759
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,070
Okay.

760
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,740
- That's good.
- Okay.

761
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,340
- Min A, you did a good job.
- Hey, that was awesome.

762
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,370
- Here.
- She's so amazing.

763
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,820
(Ji Young saved the ball.)

764
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,020
- She's really amazing.
- I'm sorry.

765
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,320
- Use your hands.
- Good.

766
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,250
- Oh, gosh. I was startled.
- Okay.

767
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,340
(However!)

768
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,790
(Long Legs made a mistake.)

769
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,150
- That was great.
- We're doing great.

770
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,150
- Okay. Good.
- Darn!

771
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,300
- You should smile.
- We're doing great.

772
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,270
(She got upset again.)

773
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,890
How did I do that?

774
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,010
- Great job.
- Keep going.

775
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,700
- Oh, my...
- It's okay.

776
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,700
- She's hilarious.
- Smile.

777
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,930
- She's so funny.
- Smile happily.

778
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,170
- Don't get upset.
- Yeon Koung, you're so funny.

779
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,080
- She's hilarious.
- She's the best.

780
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,580
- Yeon Koung is so funny.
- She reminds me of Kwang Soo.

781
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,940
- It's okay. Let's do this.
- Oh, gosh.

782
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,140
- She's likable and funny.
- She's so funny.

783
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,590
Let's go! You can do it!

784
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,230
- She's amazing.
- She's so accurate.

785
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,350
- That's good. Move forward.
- Good.

786
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,590
- Toss it.
- Don't rush.

787
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,090
- Nice.
- You should send it over.

788
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,620
- Send it over the net.
- Nice.

789
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,970
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

790
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,930
- Okay. You did well.
- Use your hands. Send it over.

791
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,470
- Good.
- Ji Hyo.

792
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,010
- Send it over. Okay.
- Oh, yes!

793
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,580
(Groaning)

794
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,370
(He groans while receiving it.)

795
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,370
(His team loses 1 point.)

796
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,170
- You should let it bounce.
- It's okay.

797
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,440
- Did we win?
- Yes!

798
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,340
- Great job.
- Yes!

799
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,910
- Suk Jin, come up to receive.
- I'll serve.

800
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,250
Stand in the front and wait.

801
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,150
- By the way... Hold on.
- That was close.

802
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,260
Suk Jin,
were you pulling out a sword?

803
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,450
- I'm so upset.
- Hey.

804
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,090
(The swordmaster)

805
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,150
- Come and stand here.
- Wait.

806
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,450
- Here we go.
- Don't rush.

807
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,270
Eun Jin, stay calm. Don't rush.

808
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,860
Hee Jin is bad at using legs too.

809
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,090
- I'm bad at this.
- That's great.

810
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,090
- Okay.
- Hee Jin.

811
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,860
- There's no one behind her.
- Oh, gosh.

812
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,700
- Scored!
- She failed. All right!

813
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,280
- You guys got the hang of it.
- Let's cheer.

814
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,580
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

815
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,080
- You got the hang of it.
- Do we have four points?

816
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,100
- What's our score?
- No.

817
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,750
Hee Jin is so bad at this.

818
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,520
That was great.

819
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,050
- Suk Jin, use your hands.
- Okay.

820
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,640
Why don't you do anything
when you can use your hands too?

821
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,680
Hey.

822
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,760
Jong Kook just got angry.

823
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,920
(They lost another point
as Jong Kook lost his temper.)

824
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,950
Hey.

825
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,890
- Oh, yes!
- Yes!

826
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,890
- Don't get upset.
- We won!

827
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,360
- Let them have one point.
- This is nice.

828
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,690
- There was no reason to get upset.
- We're going to win.

829
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,590
- So Min, you can serve.
- Okay.

830
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,740
- I'll hit it lightly.
- Go for it.

831
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,160
- Face forward.
- Where...

832
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,540
- But that's nonsense.
- Okay.

833
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,630
- Suk Jin.
- Good job.

834
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,630
- Score just one point.
- Get out of my way.

835
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,370
(Get out of my way.)

836
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,340
(They both miss.)

837
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,080
Get out of my way.

838
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,940
(Suk Jin knocks out two teammates
with his lousy toss.)

839
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,590
It was too far away.

840
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,610
(This is driving me nuts.)

841
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,150
Hey, do you think
he did that on purpose?

842
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,650
- It's okay.
- Suk Jin.

843
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,880
- Suk Jin.
- Calm down.

844
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,890
- They're getting upset.
- That was so funny.

845
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,860
- Did he lose his temper?
- You should've moved aside.

846
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,970
- I had no choice.
- Is that even possible?

847
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,860
- No.
- He got upset.

848
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,570
- You did it on purpose, right?
- Is that even possible?

849
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,930
- Wasn't it intentional?
- No.

850
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,430
- You did it to be funny, right?
- Gosh, no. I'd never do that.

851
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,430
- Really?
- Yes.

852
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,580
- That was funny.
- There's no deuce from now on.

853
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,170
- The 1st team to get 2 points wins.
- Okay.

854
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,100
- Got it.
- Just get two points.

855
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,370
- Let's score.
- No deuce.

856
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,640
- Two points.
- Just win two points.

857
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,090
(Determined to redeem himself,
Big Nose will serve.)

858
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,680
- Let's go.
- Please.

859
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,560
- Just send it over the net.
- Please.

860
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,850
Good.

861
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,260
- That's good.
- Send it over.

862
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,120
- Just send it over.
- I bet she can't do it.

863
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,000
- The lousy player.
- Send it up. Good.

864
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,450
- Use your hands.
- Don't kick it.

865
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,500
- Okay.
- He sent it over.

866
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,860
- That's nice.
- Send it over.

867
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,160
- Use your hands.
- Oh, my.

868
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Send it over.

869
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,930
(Eun Jin made a mistake.)

870
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,430
- Scored.
- I tossed it wrong.

871
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,860
- Oh, no.
- Okay.

872
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,430
- Hey, we scored.
- They scored.

873
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,930
- We scored.
- Why?

874
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,930
- We scored.
- The libero sent it over the net.

875
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,340
- Tiger Gym will lose a point.
- That's right. He's the libero.

876
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,910
(Locust Gym scored as the libero
sent the ball over the net.)

877
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,370
- Am I not allowed to do that?
- You're the libero.

878
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,410
- A libero can't attack.
- But I used my legs...

879
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,940
- Good. Use your hands.
- Don't kick it.

880
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,950
(He sent it over confidently.)

881
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,790
- Great job.
- I'm allowed to kick it.

882
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,830
- Can't he attack using legs either?
- No, he can't.

883
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,000
- Not even with legs?
- No.

884
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,650
A libero should never send the ball
over the net.

885
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,890
- If you serve well, we win.
- Really?

886
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,070
- Okay.
- Yeon Koung.

887
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,000
- Just receive it well.
- Show them what you got.

888
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,090
- We'll win if you score.
- You can receive it.

889
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,400
- We must receive it.
- See if it falls outside the lines.

890
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,930
(Locust Gym overcame obstacles
and turned the game around.)

891
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:42,280
(Will they be able to create
a miracle at the end?)

892
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,870
- We must receive it.
- I'll leave the back zone to you.

893
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,980
- Send it toward Hee Jin.
- Okay.

894
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,220
See if it falls outside the lines.

895
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
Okay.

896
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,350
- That's good.
- Oh, my.

897
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,850
- Which one of you will kick it?
- Okay.

898
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,330
- Stay calm.
- Kick it lightly.

899
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,620
- Good.
- You should send it over.

900
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,890
- Good.
- Okay.

901
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:57,920
- Good job.
- No one's there.

902
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,260
Gosh, I shouldn't send it over.

903
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,470
He said that while sending it over.
We won!

904
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,470
- No one's there.
- Gosh, I shouldn't send it over.

905
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,070
(He realized it too late.)

906
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,700
(We won!)

907
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,860
Gosh.

908
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,810
Why did he come up again?
I told him to stay in the back zone.

909
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,670
- Gosh.
- We won!

910
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,220
- We won!
- We won!

911
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,050
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

912
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,320
You fool.

913
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,350
He said he shouldn't send it over
while kicking the ball.

914
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,350
- I'm sorry.
- Suk Jin, you did a great job.

915
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,150
- I'm so happy.
- Thank you.

916
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,260
You're a spy, aren't you?

917
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,650
I shouldn't have sent it over.

918
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,690
- I shouldn't have done it.
- I'm so relieved.

919
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,160
He's just... Gosh.

920
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,160
- I'll cut his salary.
- You did a great job.

921
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,970
- The match...
- Good job.

922
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,200
between Tiger Gym and Locust Gym
has come to an end.

923
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,630
It's a shame.

924
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,280
And the score is 1 to 1.

925
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,080
- But as I said earlier,
- We lost the first round.

926
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,250
the first-string team gets
additional points.

927
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,750
Since they get 1.5 times more,
Tiger Gym wins.

928
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,680
- Okay.
- Yes!

929
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,820
- Great job.
- It's okay.

930
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,410
- It's okay.
- We did well.

931
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,820
- We did a great job.
- We played well.

932
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,530
- They were just amazing.
- We're all happy.

933
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,680
- We're all happy.
- They were the best.

934
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,190
- Great job.
- You all did great.

935
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,450
- I was impressed.
- Now, it's time...

936
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,690
- for salary negotiations.
- You were amazing.

937
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:07,860
Trainers,

938
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,930
reselect 3 members to be 1st-string
and get a salary negotiation.

939
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,470
- The first-string players?
- Three of them?

940
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,900
- Second-string can't negotiate.
- Hey.

941
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,740
- You see...
- You did great.

942
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,630
- You did well.
- I'm going to keep...

943
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,310
- Yes.
- the current first-string players.

944
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,020
- Yeon Koung, Hye Seon,
- Of course.

945
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,080
- and Se Chan.
- Yes.

946
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,940
- I'll negotiate your salaries.
- Understood.

947
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,990
- I want that.
- Okay.

948
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,880
Must the second-string players...

949
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,610
stay on the same team
without getting to negotiate?

950
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,950
No. They can switch teams
under mutual agreement.

951
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:34,950
- I see.
- We have a choice.

952
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,090
- Then...
- I get it.

953
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,620
- I choose the guests.
- Absolutely.

954
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,450
- You are second-strong players.
- Of course you should choose them.

955
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,890
- Well, we don't have to wear it.
- Okay.

956
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,090
The cast members are second-string.

957
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,690
Then we'll see you
at the negotiation site.

958
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,770
- Okay.
- Okay.

959
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,270
(They move to
the salary negotiation site.)

960
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:50,840
Based on the result
of the first round,

961
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,170
Trainer Kook got 400 dollars.

962
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,580
That's great. Thank you.

963
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,980
And Trainer Yoo got 200 dollars.

964
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,370
- Two hundred dollars?
- Yes.

965
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,110
That's not bad.

966
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,050
- I know. Of course.
- Please offer me a high salary.

967
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,410
- Trainer Yoo, I love you.
- All right.

968
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,950
- Do we have similar amounts now?
- Of course.

969
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:09,030
We'll begin
the salary negotiation now.

970
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,230
Each trainer must decide the order
of the players to negotiate with,

971
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,430
and the players will take turns
to negotiate the salary.

972
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,190
The trainers can offer any amount
within the money they have,

973
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,660
including the money you gained
from the game.

974
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,660
Okay.

975
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:26,900
Players, if you're not happy
with the salary offered to you,

976
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,200
you can negotiate with the trainer
of the other team.

977
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,750
- Great.
- However,

978
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,170
if both teams refuse to hire you,

979
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,410
you must stay on the same team
and get half the offered salary.

980
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,820
- I should just accept 10 dollars.
- I see.

981
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,790
- Would I get 50 if he offers 100?
- If both teams refuse to hire you.

982
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,920
Correct. Also,
the second-string players...

983
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,150
can decide to switch teams
under mutual agreement.

984
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,530
- Under agreement?
- Yes, they can switch teams...

985
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,830
- if they both agree to do it.
- Really?

986
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,070
- Won't we be paid?
- Sorry?

987
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,340
- Won't we be paid?
- We should get paid.

988
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,690
You will get the minimum salary.

989
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,840
Oh, I see.

990
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
(They can go to another team
and get the minimum salary.)

991
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,980
Also, Trainer Kook whose team won...

992
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,540
can trade 1 of his 2nd-string players
without consent.

993
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,080
- Without consent?
- I see.

994
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,200
- Really?
- Yes.

995
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,820
Trainer Kook can trade
1 of his 2nd-string players...

996
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,050
(He can fire a 2nd-string player
from his team.)

997
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,790
I can trade 1 of my 2nd-string players
without consent.

998
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,520
You can make your choice
after the negotiation.

999
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,990
Now, decide the order
of the players to negotiate with.

1000
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,850
I'm going to...

1001
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,000
start with Se Chan.

1002
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,970
That means you won't offer me
much money.

1003
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,470
You've got to be kidding me.

1004
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,590
(Jae Suk is planning on
giving him a bad deal.)

1005
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,470
- Fine, let's do this.
- Out of my first-string players?

1006
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,740
I'll go first.

1007
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,540
- We'll go by age.
- Then I'll go next.

1008
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,340
Can you at least mention me?

1009
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,010
(Can you at least mention me?)

1010
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,600
(Hush!)

1011
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,050
The trainer and first player
will begin negotiating.

1012
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,580
How much do I have left again?

1013
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,640
The money?

1014
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,990
I received more, didn't I?

1015
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,410
- All right.
- Hi, there.

1016
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,560
(The first athlete to negotiate
with Tiger Gym)

1017
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,350
- I hope it goes amicably.
- All right.

1018
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,450
Remember that I'm the captain.

1019
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,920
You're Oh Ji Young.

1020
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,030
My top player.

1021
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,830
- Your top player?
- I'm truly grateful.

1022
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,930
- You know...
- What did I tell you?

1023
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,130
- I said you wouldn't regret it.
- Exactly.

1024
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,900
I'm not kidding when I say I agree.

1025
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,580
So how much would you like?

1026
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,810
I'd like to hear your offer first.

1027
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,940
- No, you...
- How much?

1028
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,310
Here. Write down a number.

1029
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,250
Go ahead.

1030
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,910
Hold on a second.

1031
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,850
I understand
you're my top player, but...

1032
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,730
Hold on a second.

1033
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,090
(She asks for 500 dollars.)

1034
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,030
- I'm the captain.
- You're my top player.

1035
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,970
But asking for this much...

1036
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,030
This is my initial offer.

1037
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,970
You're asking for
a 500 percent raise.

1038
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,390
This is my initial offer,

1039
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,840
so please counter it.

1040
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,840
I was thinking about 200 dollars.

1041
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,580
- Right.
- Hold on a second.

1042
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,840
- Is it that absurd?
- Wait.

1043
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,050
- Can I cross my legs?
- Hold on.

1044
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,440
If that's the amount you want...

1045
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,940
I do have the others to think about.

1046
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,380
- Right.
- I need to sign the other three.

1047
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,840
So how about 200 dollars?

1048
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,180
If I pay the others the same amount,
that'll be 600 dollars.

1049
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,790
- I'll be left with nothing.
- Of course.

1050
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:51,950
- Right?
- Yes.

1051
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:55,990
So I'd appreciate it
if you agreed to 200 dollars.

1052
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,150
I received 400 dollars
after the previous game.

1053
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,590
Can you at least mention me?

1054
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,730
I received 400 dollars.

1055
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,730
(Haha draws a heart
so that she'd remember him.)

1056
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,420
- Then, how about this?
- So...

1057
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,240
I'll take 200 dollars.

1058
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,240
- Just so you know, I'm loyal.
- I see.

1059
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,810
- So 200 dollars.
- I'll take 200 dollars...

1060
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,040
if Haha is a package deal.

1061
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
- Haha?
- Yes, Haha.

1062
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,050
I want to stay with Haha.

1063
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,310
(She suggests 200 dollars
with Haha as a package deal.)

1064
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,140
(Haha uses sweet Ji Young
to secure a spot on the team.)

1065
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,290
- So you want me to sign Haha too?
- Yes.

1066
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,990
- The both of you for 200 dollars.
- Yes.

1067
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,590
- Loyalty.
- Yes, loyalty.

1068
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,990
- All right.
- Thank you.

1069
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,150
Thank you.
Can you sign the contract?

1070
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,850
Thank you.

1071
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,120
Thank you so much.

1072
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,420
Thank you.
I hope we keep getting along.

1073
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,620
We'll do a good job
in the next game as well.

1074
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,470
Negotiations should go amicably.

1075
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,470
(By promoting loyalty,)

1076
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,470
(Trainer Kook signs her at
40 percent of what she suggested.)

1077
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,740
I spent a lot on you two.

1078
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,070
- Hello, Trainer Yoo.
- It's good to see you.

1079
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,200
- Se Chan, come in.
- I did my best today.

1080
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,440
What's your current salary?

1081
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,900
The initial amount was 15 dollars,
but Yeon Koung...

1082
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,080
- added 30 dollars to it.
- She added 30 dollars?

1083
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,780
It's only 45 dollars.

1084
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,140
(Yang Se Chan:
current salary 45 dollars)

1085
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,520
You're probably aware of this,

1086
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,450
but if we had won the game...

1087
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,110
Not this again.

1088
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,730
Are you already making excuses?

1089
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,000
No, that's not it.

1090
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,060
If we had won,
I'd have been more generous.

1091
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,120
That would've been better,

1092
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,970
but you still won 200 dollars.

1093
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,340
Did you choose
to negotiate with me first...

1094
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,770
so that you could offer 10 dollars?

1095
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,430
I get what you're saying.

1096
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,670
My salary is 45 dollars
at the moment...

1097
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,200
and I don't expect a penny more.

1098
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,370
(He doesn't expect a penny more?)

1099
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,280
You received 200 dollars
after the game...

1100
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,440
which should result
in 50 dollars more for us all.

1101
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,750
But my conscience won't allow that.

1102
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,850
However, 30 dollars...

1103
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,450
(Only 30 dollars
when he has 980 dollars?)

1104
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,260
- At least 30 dollars...
- So 30 dollars.

1105
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,850
That much you should offer.

1106
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,500
Asking for 50 dollars
would make me a thief.

1107
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,000
(A mere salary of 30 dollars
puts a smile on his face.)

1108
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,540
This number would satisfy you.

1109
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,130
- Yes, of course.
- Aren't I right?

1110
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,010
Please sign the contract. See that?

1111
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,410
I'm glad you didn't argue with me
on this.

1112
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,200
As men both with protruding teeth.

1113
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,200
Don't you worry.

1114
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,600
- In the next game...
- Please do well.

1115
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,870
- I'll do my best to win!
- All right.

1116
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,140
Let's do a good job.

1117
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,680
Go, locust!

1118
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,590
- Next.
- I should take this with me.

1119
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,680
Goodness.

1120
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,010
- What was your number?
- He's more than generous.

1121
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,160
Did things go well?

1122
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,350
I guess it did.

1123
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,030
Negotiations went well for him.

1124
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,320
- Go, locust! Yes, things went well.
- You...

1125
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,490
- Really?
- Yes.

1126
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,820
- How much did you receive?
- How much was it?

1127
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,120
- I received a lot.
- Really?

1128
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,430
- He gladly offered it.
- Let me see.

1129
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,570
How much did you get?

1130
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,740
(The fool is just happy to have
a salary higher than expected.)

1131
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,970
We're a team, remember?

1132
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,340
(They request that he tell them
the generous salary he agreed to.)

1133
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,200
(He brags about his 30 dollars.)

1134
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,680
- How much is it?
- It's a lot, isn't it?

1135
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,950
- How much is that in total?
- Show me with your fingers.

1136
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,200
- We...
- Is that 80 dollars?

1137
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,970
He won 200 dollars, remember?

1138
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,890
So 30 dollars per person...

1139
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,450
There's the money he has left
from the previous round.

1140
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,160
- What?
- He saved some money earlier,

1141
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,280
so that has to be added too.

1142
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,160
- So 200 dollars and...
- That's right.

1143
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,280
Hold on a second.

1144
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,050
Isn't he negotiating with
the 200 dollars he won?

1145
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,760
That and the money
he saved from earlier.

1146
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,430
- What?
- The remaining money.

1147
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,030
He wasn't generous at all.

1148
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,200
- I need to...
- He has about 1,300 dollars.

1149
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,740
(The reason why Jae Suk
was so generous.)

1150
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,300
Hold on a second.

1151
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,180
- I made a mistake.
- I see.

1152
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,640
You have the 200 dollars you won...

1153
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,950
and the money
you have left from earlier,

1154
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,720
but like a thug,

1155
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,050
you quickly agreed
to the 30 dollars.

1156
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,390
But you already signed that.

1157
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,050
- Why didn't you tell me?
- We'll talk some other time.

1158
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,620
You should've told me
that you had more money.

1159
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,050
- So it's the total amount?
- I don't have that much.

1160
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,320
The money he earned
and the leftover money?

1161
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,490
(He can't take it back.)

1162
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,820
- He played me.
- He surely did.

1163
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,050
I thought he only had
200 dollars to offer.

1164
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,200
That's not the case.

1165
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,300
- Did he play you?
- How much did you get?

1166
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,700
Only 30 dollars.

1167
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,530
I'm only worth one cent.

1168
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,640
And I'm only worth 0.1 cents.

1169
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,340
You're upset when
you're worth 30 dollars?

1170
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,930
Can I give them some of my money?

1171
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,930
- Of course.
- Really?

1172
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,180
I won't accept it.

1173
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,410
But I will.

1174
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,010
I offer Haha...

1175
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,740
- I offer Haha five dollars.
- Thank you.

1176
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,850
Can I have at least ten cents?

1177
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,910
And five dollars goes to So Min.

1178
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,320
- Se Chan, my gosh.
- You still have a chance.

1179
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,720
Bend over...

1180
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,680
and crawl between my legs.

1181
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,490
(Darn you!)

1182
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,620
How dare you?

1183
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,530
- I won't accept it.
- Suk Jin.

1184
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,930
- I'll ask Yeon Koung instead.
- Suk Jin.

1185
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,120
- What?
- I'll give you a dollar.

1186
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,370
Why? What for?

1187
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,930
Bend over and...

1188
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,100
(It takes more than expected
to make Suk Jin give up his pride.)

1189
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,340
I'm a man of pride, you know.

1190
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,910
Suk Jin, 2.5 dollars.

1191
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,010
I'm a man of pride.

1192
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,970
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

1193
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,070
- Hi.
- Welcome.

1194
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,740
- With Ji Young...
- Yes?

1195
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,990
We came to an agreement
at 200 dollars.

1196
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,590
With you...

1197
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,490
- Will you cut my salary?
- What?

1198
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,490
Of course not.

1199
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,490
That's not how I roll.

1200
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,850
I'll offer you the same amount.

1201
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,050
- What do you say to 200 dollars?
- So 200 dollars.

1202
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,890
- Well...
- Then...

1203
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,800
- Then...
- Yes?

1204
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,140
(Will she ask for more?)

1205
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,890
I'll accept my current salary
of 170 dollars...

1206
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:35,030
if you agree to pay ten dollars each
to the second-string players.

1207
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,430
How can you be this generous?

1208
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,870
My gosh, I'm touched.

1209
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,340
- Give them a raise.
- Really?

1210
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,570
- Then I'll stay for 170 dollars.
- Seriously?

1211
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,740
- My gosh.
- Yes.

1212
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,620
- So Young, how about 170 dollars?
- Sure.

1213
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,510
- Yes, I'm happy with that.
- It's 170 dollars.

1214
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,780
- Make sure the others get more.
- Sure thing.

1215
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,990
They'll only get about
ten dollars more though.

1216
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,090
Throw in another five dollars.

1217
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,450
- I'd appreciate that.
- Got it.

1218
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,320
Hold on. Hee Jin, talk to me.

1219
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,390
Hee Jin.

1220
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,550
How much is your salary?

1221
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,890
I bet she got a lot.

1222
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,930
- Can we be open about it?
- Of course.

1223
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:04,430
- But...
- Of course you can tell me.

1224
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,240
But you could use
what we're being paid...

1225
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,470
to negotiate your salary.

1226
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,600
That won't be the case, Ji Young.

1227
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,030
Must you be tight?

1228
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,300
Truth be told...

1229
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,570
- I heard what she was offered.
- I received about...

1230
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,350
- She was given 220 dollars.
- Really?

1231
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,550
- Just this time around?
- That's right.

1232
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,390
- It's 220 dollars.
- Just this time around?

1233
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,850
I thought 30 dollars
was on the generous side.

1234
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,720
That hurts.

1235
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,280
She got 220 dollars
just this time around.

1236
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,490
- What?
- What?

1237
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,760
- For real?
- I've been scammed.

1238
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,930
- How's that possible?
- Locust Gym should shut down.

1239
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,660
Someone shut down Locust Gym.

1240
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,700
- Because...
- Yeon Koung.

1241
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,430
- I got 200 dollars.
- The locust...

1242
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,030
- You got 200 dollars?
- Just this time around?

1243
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,530
- I've been scammed.
- You got 200 dollars?

1244
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,870
- Yeon Koung.
- No way.

1245
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,340
- He's known to be stingy.
- How much did Hee Jin get?

1246
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:48,570
I once negotiated salaries with
professional baseball players...

1247
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,120
and learned that pay cuts
are a touchy subject.

1248
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,990
I don't want you
to see it that way though.

1249
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:56,010
Are you telling me
that you'll cut my pay?

1250
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,550
Well, you see...

1251
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,260
I'm not excited about...

1252
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,930
this negotiation
taking a heavy turn.

1253
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,950
So how much
are you willing to offer?

1254
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,390
Please don't think of this
as a pay cut.

1255
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,820
(He offers her 120 dollars,
which is 20 dollars less.)

1256
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,390
Sign it, Hye Seon.

1257
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,890
(What will be
Yeum Cheater's decision?)

1258
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,760
Rather than being a cheater,

1259
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,340
- I'll choose to be loyal.
- Sounds good. All right.

1260
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,340
So you got another 200 dollars?

1261
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,970
- What about you?
- It's 200 for me too.

1262
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,100
- But you barely did anything.
- Exactly. He's that generous.

1263
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,850
Our trainer is the sweetest.

1264
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,010
I got 220 dollars.

1265
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,510
(Kim Yeon Koung is sensitive...)

1266
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,740
(when it comes to
how players are treated.)

1267
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,010
- Is he kidding me?
- You should...

1268
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,720
at least ask for 300 dollars.

1269
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,720
- Exactly.
- Yes, you should get 300 dollars.

1270
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,260
- He'd better agree to it.
- This is why.

1271
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,430
We only perform
to the best of our ability...

1272
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,890
because our trainer has our backs.

1273
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,220
(The world-class rookie
hopes to stop Trainer Yoo's tyranny.)

1274
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:45,200
- Trainer Yoo!
- Goodness, Yeon Koung.

1275
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,910
Trainer Yoo, I hope...

1276
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,700
- things go smoothly.
- Don't worry and have a seat.

1277
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,930
- Did things go well?
- Of course.

1278
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,430
Then I hope things go smoothly.

1279
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,800
I don't know
what you'll think of this,

1280
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,240
but money is tight here at the gym.

1281
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,950
You know that, right?

1282
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,740
You're starting off
with the excuses.

1283
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,620
I would like to...

1284
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,660
We did our best,
but it doesn't change that we lost.

1285
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,590
- I can't say anything nice.
- But we won the second match.

1286
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,950
The second-string players
won it for us though.

1287
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,450
- It's not a win for the team.
- So what's my offer?

1288
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,760
- Come on.
- You sound slightly aggressive.

1289
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,320
- Hardly.
- Your tone...

1290
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,700
Trainer Yoo,

1291
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,430
- you need to be generous.
- Sorry?

1292
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,660
You need to be generous.

1293
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,660
Your first offer...

1294
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,100
must be generous.

1295
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,530
Because...

1296
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:30,010
I heard how the players
on the other team are being treated.

1297
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,620
But they won double the prize money.

1298
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,640
Don't forget
the initial amount you had.

1299
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:37,490
You started off with more.

1300
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,620
(Unlike someone he knows,
she didn't fall for it.)

1301
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,720
- Did you think I didn't know?
- Hold on.

1302
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,450
So how much?

1303
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,850
- Sorry?
- How much do you want?

1304
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,430
I'd like 300 dollars.

1305
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,660
(I'd like 300 dollars.)

1306
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,570
Yeon Koung, don't sign the contract.

1307
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:50,800
(After playing in both games,
she asks for the highest amount.)

1308
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,470
Are you kidding me?

1309
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,600
- Because...
- That's absurd.

1310
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,800
They received 300 dollars.

1311
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,340
- That's a lie.
- I saw it for myself.

1312
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,870
- You saw the number?
- Yes, I saw the number "300."

1313
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,740
- Don't you lie.
- It's the truth!

1314
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:04,010
You...

1315
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,370
- Are you Kwang Soo?
- What?

1316
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,640
- Are you Kwang Soo?
- What?

1317
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,120
(Her negotiation tactic
seems familiar.)

1318
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,820
That's not what this is.
You obviously have more money.

1319
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,850
Then, I'll offer you
a ten-dollar raise.

1320
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,030
- What does that get me?
- Well,

1321
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,800
- it'll be 140 dollars.
- Are you offering 310 dollars?

1322
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,620
No, 140 dollars.

1323
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,930
- Come on. I'll leave then.
- Let's talk this through.

1324
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:26,470
If Jong Kook
doesn't take you either,

1325
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,260
then your salary
will be cut in half.

1326
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,470
You think he won't take me?

1327
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,180
- That, I'm not sure of.
- He has a lot of money.

1328
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,180
(The frugal Trainer Yoo
met his match.)

1329
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,570
- Also, Trainer Kook...
- Listen.

1330
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,050
doesn't care about money.

1331
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,550
- He doesn't care about money?
- He doesn't.

1332
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,070
He does for sure.

1333
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,950
I'll take 300 dollars and tell them
that you gave me 200 dollars.

1334
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:45,950
- You'll say you took 200 dollars?
- Yes. I'll tell them I got 200.

1335
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,990
Save my face, will you?

1336
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,050
Why don't you save my face?

1337
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:53,200
I'll play hard in the next game
and bring victory.

1338
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,890
I can't afford 300 dollars.

1339
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:57,530
I'm offering you 200 dollars.
I can't give you 300 dollars!

1340
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,910
I can't give you 300 dollars!

1341
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,100
- They're fighting.
- Yeon Koung asked for 300 dollars.

1342
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,910
- Is he upset?
- Yeon Koung, move to Tiger Gym.

1343
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,280
(No one is willing to yield.)

1344
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,850
Ji Young got 320 dollars!

1345
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,680
She received that much,
so they'll compare her to me.

1346
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,450
Then how am I supposed to work hard?

1347
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:18,090
They'll do as much as they're paid
since they're paid 300, 320 dollars,

1348
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,890
so I'll only do enough
for 130 dollars.

1349
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,090
How do you think I'll play?

1350
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:24,800
I'll just hang about on the court.

1351
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:26,850
Then I'll just transfer
to the other team, to be blunt.

1352
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:27,930
I can do that, can't I?

1353
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,570
You're right, but...

1354
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,890
I want to give my best effort.

1355
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:33,970
I want to be fully immersed
in the games.

1356
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:35,370
If you pay me 300 dollars,

1357
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:37,180
- But 300 dollars is...
- I'll pay you back with my passion.

1358
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,140
Passion! I'll show you my passion.

1359
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:41,870
- Okay, then.
- Yes?

1360
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,320
Here!

1361
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,780
I'll pay you back
since you put trust in me.

1362
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,950
This is the best I can offer.

1363
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,010
(His final offer was 230 dollars,
and she gave in and signed it.)

1364
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,590
Great. Don't tell others.

1365
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,030
- Okay?
- Okay.

1366
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,550
Thank you. I'll work hard.

1367
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,260
- All right. Take this.
- I'll lead the team to victory.

1368
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,200
- Thank you.
- All right.

1369
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:00,700
My gosh.

1370
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,820
How much were you offered?

1371
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:05,160
The second-string players
don't get to negotiate.

1372
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,300
You'll all receive ten dollars...

1373
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,740
- and move on to the next round.
- Ten dollars?

1374
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:11,370
Trainer Kim, you can trade
one of your second-string players.

1375
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,100
Let's settle some things
before that.

1376
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,100
Second-string players...

1377
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,410
We don't know what you need
to settle with him.

1378
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,120
The first-string players are
supposed to pay some of theirs.

1379
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,570
It's an internal deal.

1380
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:20,390
- I'll sort it out for you.
- Okay.

1381
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:21,450
We signed a dual contract.

1382
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,890
Also... Stop talking about it.

1383
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,720
I'm starting to get attached,
so stop.

1384
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,180
(I'm starting to get attached,
so stop.)

1385
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,030
(He's preparing to detach himself
from his players.)

1386
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:31,850
- Wait a minute.
- I should tell them.

1387
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:34,260
- Well...
- I expected it,

1388
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,820
but why won't you meet my eyes?

1389
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,890
His tone changed.

1390
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:38,470
- Meet my eyes when you talk.
- His tone changed.

1391
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,840
Is there a member you want to keep?

1392
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,970
For our team...

1393
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:43,430
Guys, it needs to be fun too.

1394
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:47,070
Are you going to switch them?
You can't send away your players.

1395
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,050
- I know. I don't want to.
- You must've gotten close.

1396
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,370
They're so warmhearted.

1397
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,180
You can't just ditch
players you got attached to.

1398
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,620
He's old and sick!

1399
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,450
You can ditch me if you want.
Just ditch me.

1400
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:58,760
- I won't.
- What are you saying?

1401
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,590
What do you mean by that?

1402
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,890
- Make up your mind already.
- Should I take him or not?

1403
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:04,620
- Take him.
- Shall I?

1404
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,490
- Of course, you should take him.
- Okay, fine.

1405
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:10,930
I should listen to the opinions
of the first-string players.

1406
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,600
- He listens to the players a lot.
- Is he staying on your team?

1407
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,100
Yes, he's staying with us.

1408
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,930
- That's great.
- That was so cool.

1409
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,370
- Thank you.
- They're all so warmhearted.

1410
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:21,350
The players are all so warmhearted.

1411
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:24,240
Let's move to the next building
to have lunch.

1412
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,570
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1413
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,280
- Should I carry this?
- We should give this back, right?

1414
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,410
Just leave them anywhere.

1415
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:30,760
I don't want anyone to see it.

1416
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,280
- Gosh, they look so good.
- They look so good.

1417
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,660
- They look so good. I'm starving.
- What's happening? They look great.

1418
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,280
They prepared so many dishes today.

1419
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,800
- Because we have athletes...
- Because we have athletes...

1420
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,800
How come the dishes are different?

1421
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,390
The 1st and 2nd-string players
are having different dishes.

1422
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,930
- Oh, really?
- Really?

1423
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,070
I guess so.

1424
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,140
- I think so.
- Really?

1425
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,600
I thought so.

1426
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,340
Is there a specific dish you want?
Pay me five dollars.

1427
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:51,870
- No way. I won't eat it.
- Why do you sound so sad?

1428
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,800
Then the second-string players
can't have chicken.

1429
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,200
The second-string players
can't have chicken.

1430
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,800
Take a seat, guys.

1431
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,220
- They served nice dishes today.
- Come sit here.

1432
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,280
- Take a seat.
- The second-string players...

1433
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,550
are also served well.

1434
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,640
Let's try it.

1435
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,010
(The Running Man food team prepared
the 8-dish meal themselves.)

1436
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:06,120
- My gosh. Thank you.
- We have nice dishes. Goodness.

1437
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,350
- Take a seat.
- Can we eat them?

1438
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:10,720
Everyone, you can enjoy
every dish on your table.

1439
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,100
- Take a seat.
- This is...

1440
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,300
- This is so mean.
- This is...

1441
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,700
The dishes are so different.

1442
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,100
If the second-string players
want to eat...

1443
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,370
what the first-string players
are having,

1444
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:19,870
you can ask your trainer.

1445
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,970
Also, there are extra menus.

1446
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:25,010
- Really?
- We'll hand you out the menus.

1447
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,410
- Buy us more dishes, Trainer Yoo.
- He's right.

1448
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,410
Trainer Yoo.

1449
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:28,910
- Let's enjoy the meal together.
- Buy us more dishes.

1450
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:30,300
Let's do that.

1451
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,450
Our team isn't doing so well, but...

1452
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,280
At least he's treating us
to a nice meal.

1453
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,620
Let's treat them to nice meals.

1454
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,720
Something like chicken soup.

1455
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,990
There are cup noodles.

1456
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,660
- Trainer Yoo, we want tteokbokki.
- Wait a minute.

1457
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,660
We have to pay this much?

1458
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,950
They're way too expensive.

1459
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,300
- There's tteokbokki.
- This is...

1460
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,490
Oh, we need to pay for them.

1461
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,760
I'm sorry, but are we
in Cheongdam-dong?

1462
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:49,870
- Let's serve everyone cup noodles.
- There's japchae.

1463
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:50,870
Everyone needs soup.

1464
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:52,030
- Listen up, everyone.
- And let's have ice cream later.

1465
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,600
- What about tteokbokki?
- We should have that too.

1466
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,640
- Two tteokbokki.
- Trainer Yoo.

1467
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,660
Who wants to have ice cream?

1468
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,140
- Me!
- Buy ice cream for everyone.

1469
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,510
Who wants to have ice cream?

1470
00:47:58,510 --> 00:47:59,930
- Me!
- Buy ice cream for everyone.

1471
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:01,640
- One, two, three, four, five...
- Do you want tteokbokki too?

1472
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,950
- Who wants tteokbokki?
- I want tteokbokki!

1473
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:05,120
We'll order two tteokbokki
for each table.

1474
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,280
- Sounds good.
- How about cup noodles?

1475
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,490
- Order it for them.
- I want cup noodles too.

1476
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:09,320
Wait. Continue your meal.

1477
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:11,620
- What's wrong?
- Please order them now.

1478
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,550
- We're starving.
- Are you paying for this?

1479
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,590
- Are you paying for this?
- I know you're quite loaded.

1480
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,550
Since you're loaded,
buy us a nice meal.

1481
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:20,260
Well, then does everyone
want cup noodles?

1482
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,320
- Who wants cup noodles?
- Me.

1483
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,320
- I want tteokbokki.
- I want cup noodles.

1484
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,390
- Tteokbokki?
- Tteokbokki.

1485
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:25,200
Buy cup noodles for each of us
and tteokbokki for each table.

1486
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,240
And we'll all have ice cream.

1487
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,260
- Okay.
- That sounds good.

1488
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,870
Then he's going to spend 400 dollars
on food alone.

1489
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,280
Well...

1490
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,600
- Buy them for us.
- What?

1491
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,950
Hey, Jong Kook.

1492
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,350
Wait a minute.

1493
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:36,350
Buy them for us
using the team money.

1494
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,350
I could,

1495
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,510
but a source told me...

1496
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,410
that Jae Suk didn't spend much.

1497
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,740
I'll buy you one of these.
Do you want tteokbokki?

1498
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,550
- I want tteokbokki.
- I'll get it for you.

1499
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,680
All right. You're indeed amazing.

1500
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,260
Wait.

1501
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,620
Where is bulgogi?
Oh, we have it here.

1502
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,030
Wait a minute.

1503
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,120
- I get it, but...
- Can I have ice cream too?

1504
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,800
- I want ice cream.
- There's ice cream on the menu?

1505
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,470
- Yes.
- Are you having it too?

1506
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:58,870
Don't you want to have ice cream?

1507
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:02,340
I know that Ji Young is good
with games, but she eats a lot.

1508
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,660
- Wait a minute.
- I can eat more than this.

1509
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,070
Hold on.

1510
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,300
Then we'll have
a serving of tteokbokki.

1511
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:09,050
And I'll take ice cream as well.

1512
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,010
We're always abundant
when it comes to food.

1513
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:13,740
- This is amazing.
- Eat up!

1514
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,010
(Meanwhile, Locust Gym decides
to spend 340 dollars on food.)

1515
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:16,140
Trainer Yoo is indeed amazing.

1516
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,350
- Trainer Yoo is indeed amazing.
- Indeed.

1517
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:18,390
This is nice.

1518
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,760
- Enjoy your food.
- Enjoy.

1519
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,120
Enjoy, everyone.

1520
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:23,930
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

1521
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:24,930
I guess it's good.

1522
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:26,200
How come the rolled omelet
is so good?

1523
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:27,720
I was starving.

1524
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,490
You eat so well, Hye Seon.

1525
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,200
(After filling their stomach,
they arrived at Tanhyeon SBS.)

1526
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,370
Oh, it's this one.

1527
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,370
(The next mission
that makes them exclaim)

1528
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:35,470
It's scary.

1529
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,340
This one is scary.

1530
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,930
- It's that game.
- I'm not good at this.

1531
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,950
It's where we jump off, right?
Isn't it diving?

1532
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,870
- What is this?
- What is it?

1533
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,280
- It's that game.
- What is it?

1534
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,640
- It's where we need to crawl.
- We need to pick the medals.

1535
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,680
It's really scary.

1536
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,910
Gosh, we haven't played it
for a long time.

1537
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:57,850
(If you move a bit forward,
it'll break.)

1538
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:00,660
(Even the original Long Legs
was scared to death.)

1539
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:03,600
(The styrofoam breaks off completely
at an unexpected timing.)

1540
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,640
It's really high from up there.
It's scary.

1541
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,410
It's disadvantageous
for those who weigh more, right?

1542
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:09,660
- The ones who weigh more?
- It tests your guts.

1543
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,430
It's really scary.

1544
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:14,350
The players who've watched
our show must know this game.

1545
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,100
We played Put a Sticker
on the Edge of a Cliff before.

1546
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,100
It's really scary.

1547
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,220
In an upgraded set,
we're going to test...

1548
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,820
if you're maintaining the courage
you built then.

1549
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,820
We'll also test the courage
of the new players through this.

1550
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:28,490
- It's called I'm on the Next Cliff.
- I'm on the Next Cliff?

1551
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:34,030
This time, we'll have players from
each team play at the same time.

1552
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,490
However, among the seven medals,

1553
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,470
you can take one of them.

1554
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,530
We'll add the number to the total
length you put the sticker on.

1555
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:42,530
(Each player can acquire a medal.
The length will be added.)

1556
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:44,600
But you can't take two medals.

1557
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,600
You can only take one.

1558
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,470
So we're taking a medal each.

1559
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,350
But we'll multiply the length...

1560
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:51,180
the first-string players
advanced to by 1.5 times.

1561
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,410
You got it, right?

1562
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:55,640
We've picked the players
to go first.

1563
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,620
Suk Jin and Hye Seon will go first.

1564
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,910
Me?

1565
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:02,030
This is good. We won!

1566
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,490
- Who is Yeum Hye Seon?
- Me.

1567
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:04,490
"Who is Yeum Hye Seon?"

1568
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:06,050
That's so harsh of him.

1569
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:08,660
The safety gear and stickers
are ready.

1570
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,800
- All right.
- Good luck.

1571
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,600
If you go on your fours and crawl,
you can reach the end.

1572
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,660
Can you feel
when it's going to break?

1573
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,530
- It starts to crack from behind.
- Oh, you can feel it?

1574
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,010
- It's scary when you go up there.
- It's really scary.

1575
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,700
You can't go to the end
because it's scary.

1576
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,200
It's higher than I thought.

1577
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,300
It's no joke.

1578
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,550
It's scarier than you think.

1579
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,450
(The experienced player
walks up confidently.)

1580
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,590
(But he's scared nonetheless.)

1581
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:28,680
It's so scary.

1582
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,640
Gosh, it's higher than I thought.

1583
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,180
It must feel different up there.

1584
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,760
Right. It must be scary
when you're up there.

1585
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:35,120
You can do it!

1586
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,120
(Who will be the winner
of the first match?)

1587
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:40,120
(He's already scared.)

1588
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,260
It must be scary
when you're up there.

1589
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,870
You can do it!

1590
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:45,140
Should we go one by one
or at the same time?

1591
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,160
You'll go at the same time.

1592
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,660
It looks like a CEO of some company
is joining the retreat.

1593
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,030
CEO Ji, let's go!

1594
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,640
- CEO Ji!
- Yes!

1595
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,010
- We will...
- You can do it!

1596
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,570
Health, blessing, long life!

1597
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,100
You can do it, Chairman Ji.
He looks like a chairman.

1598
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,410
It looks like a CEO is setting
a good example...

1599
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:00,470
Should I take off my shoes?

1600
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:02,120
- He's setting a good example.
- That's right.

1601
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,280
Yeum Cheater.

1602
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,390
(CEO Ji's opponent
is a new employee, Yeum Cheater.)

1603
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:06,090
Hye Seon, move confidently.

1604
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,780
You must acquire one of the medals
on the way.

1605
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,680
They're pro athletes, so...

1606
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:11,620
Be careful!

1607
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:15,120
(She only stepped on it lightly,
but it starts shaking.)

1608
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,300
(CEO Ji confidently
takes his place.)

1609
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,660
Suk Jin, it's been
quite a while, right?

1610
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,660
Gosh, this is incredibly scary.

1611
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,870
If you're ready,

1612
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:27,280
- You must acquire the medal too.
- please start.

1613
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,850
- Let's go, Hye Seon.
- Let's go!

1614
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,640
- Let's go, Yeum Hye Seon!
- Let's go, Locust Gym!

1615
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,570
If you fall without sticking
the sticker, it'll be over.

1616
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,280
(Yeum Cheater advances
more than Suk Jin.)

1617
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,010
Go, Hye Seon!

1618
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:38,220
Grab the medal if you see one.

1619
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,450
Get a medal before the board breaks.

1620
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,120
- You need to acquire the medal.
- Get the medal.

1621
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,930
(Tilting)

1622
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,490
Oh, no. Hye Seon's board is bent.

1623
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:48,800
- Hye Seon.
- Hye Seon!

1624
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
- Get the medal first.
- Get the medal.

1625
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,200
Hye Seon, get the medal
that says 20 or 25.

1626
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,600
Get the medal!

1627
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,600
I want to get the one that says 30.

1628
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,600
No, you can't.
You'll end up with zero points.

1629
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,410
Hye Seon is going to fall.

1630
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,570
It's going to crack.

1631
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,680
I can hear the crack!
You must take one.

1632
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,410
Take one that says 25.

1633
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,320
Let's go, Yeum Cheater.
There you go.

1634
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,590
There you go.

1635
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,590
(She grabs a medal that says 25.)

1636
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:11,850
- There you go.
- Take it.

1637
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:12,990
- There you go.
- That's it.

1638
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,720
Suk Jin, she already took a medal!

1639
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,760
Look at him.

1640
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,090
What are you doing?

1641
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:18,220
(While Yeum Cheater
was acquiring a medal,)

1642
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,620
(CEO Ji couldn't advance at all.)

1643
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:22,600
This is really scary.

1644
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,100
He got the Pfizer shot,
so we shouldn't make him do this.

1645
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,910
Mister, if you're not going to play,
then get out!

1646
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:30,100
I'm trying to play here, you punk!

1647
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,930
- Get out if you're not playing.
- Who are you calling a punk?

1648
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,070
Suk Jin, grab a medal
with a high number.

1649
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,370
Hye Seon, stick the sticker
as far as possible.

1650
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:38,410
Take it easy, Hye Seon.

1651
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:39,850
It might crack any minute.

1652
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,010
- It might crack any minute.
- Take the medal!

1653
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,780
No, that won't do.

1654
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,850
Suk Jin, you can't reach
the medal that says 25.

1655
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,180
But I should take the one
that says 25.

1656
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,530
(Falling)

1657
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,800
(She already passed
the halfway point.)

1658
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,070
- No, Hye Seon!
- That's it!

1659
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:57,740
- Let's go, Yeum Hye Seon.
- You need to stick the sticker!

1660
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,100
(The board is about to break.)

1661
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,070
Stick it before the board breaks.

1662
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,840
- Hye Seon!
- Stop there, Hye Seon!

1663
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,570
- Hye Seon!
- Stick it!

1664
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,070
- Stick it!
- Hye Seon!

1665
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:10,800
(She slides down to the pool.)

1666
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,120
- She stuck the sticker!
- She stuck it.

1667
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,890
- She stuck it.
- She stuck it before she fell.

1668
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:18,990
(Frozen)

1669
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,720
- Are you okay?
- She stuck it.

1670
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,090
(She succeeded in sticking
the sticker at 3.9m.)

1671
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,950
- Well done, Hye Seon.
- Nice one.

1672
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:27,890
- It's 3.9m.
- Well done, Hye Seon.

1673
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,700
- Good job, Hye Seon.
- She stuck it before she fell.

1674
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,990
- Good job, Hye Seon.
- They're so focused.

1675
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:33,600
She stuck the sticker as she fell.

1676
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,760
We should do it as she did.

1677
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,010
- We should stick it as we fall.
- He took the medal.

1678
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,070
(CEO Ji acquires the medal
that says 25.)

1679
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,370
- Did you see him? Suk Jin!
- Isn't it scary?

1680
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:45,620
- Suk Jin, slide down!
- Lie down flat on the board.

1681
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,370
- Be quiet!
- Slide down with the board.

1682
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:49,620
You saw how Hye Seon did.

1683
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,620
(Trainer Kook becomes impatient
as Hye Seon did well.)

1684
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,280
- Is it because he's heavier?
- Slide down the board.

1685
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,430
That's it. Slide down.

1686
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,990
You can go further.

1687
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:57,930
Just slide down and stick it.

1688
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,890
- Be quiet.
- Slide down.

1689
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,720
His lips are pale.

1690
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,430
You don't know how scary
it is up there, do you?

1691
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:06,660
- Your lips are pale!
- Slide down the board!

1692
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,910
Give me a round of applause.

1693
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,600
- Health, long life...
- Blessing!

1694
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,910
That's it. You're almost there.
Stick it at 3m.

1695
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:15,100
Slide down the board.

1696
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,200
- Hey.
- Stick it at 3m.

1697
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,350
Hey, where did the cheating girl
stick hers?

1698
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:19,820
She's Yeum Cheater.

1699
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,180
- "Cheating girl"?
- Hers is at 3.9m.

1700
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,590
Just slide down the board.

1701
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:25,490
- I can't do it at my will.
- It's going to break.

1702
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:27,090
(The board is already bent a lot.)

1703
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,450
You need to go forward boldly!

1704
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,160
- It's going to break.
- You need to go forward!

1705
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,350
(Will the oldest 2nd-string player
show us a twist?)

1706
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:36,470
- It's going to break!
- Just stick it!

1707
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:37,970
(He fell helplessly.)

1708
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:41,530
He failed to stick the sticker.

1709
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:43,930
- He failed to stick the sticker.
- He failed to stick the sticker.

1710
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,010
(He stuck it after he fell.)

1711
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,850
(CEO Ji earned no points.)

1712
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:52,910
- All right!
- He failed to stick the sticker.

1713
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:54,620
- He failed to stick the sticker.
- He failed.

1714
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,740
My lips cracked.

1715
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:57,590
- His lips are bleeding for real.
- His lips cracked.

1716
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,550
- Are you okay?
- He's bleeding.

1717
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:00,990
- Gosh.
- Come and take a rest.

1718
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,720
Why did his lips crack?

1719
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:04,600
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

1720
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,800
- My lips cracked a lot.
- I saw.

1721
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,220
He must've bitten on them.

1722
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:11,200
Why did you become so weak
after getting the Pfizer shot?

1723
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:13,200
(The road to become Human Antibody
surely isn't easy.)

1724
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,340
I shouldn't be laughing, but I can't
help it. I'm sorry.

1725
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:17,300
Why did you become so weak
after getting the Pfizer shot?

1726
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,370
- Give him a wet wipe.
- Why is he...

1727
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:21,070
- He must've gotten weaker.
- Can you give me some tissue?

1728
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,200
The next player...

1729
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,070
Is anyone willing to go next?

1730
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:27,720
- They're scared.
- I'm scared.

1731
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,720
Oh Ji Young.

1732
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,780
- Oh Ji Young.
- I'm scared.

1733
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,260
Who is going next from your team?

1734
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,390
Shin Min A is going next.

1735
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:34,820
- Min A?
- It's Hye Jin.

1736
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:35,890
Min A!

1737
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:37,620
- Good luck.
- Min A.

1738
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:38,890
Shin Min A will go next.

1739
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,100
- I think she'll be good at it.
- Hye Jin is going next.

1740
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,200
It's fine as long as
I get high points, right?

1741
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,200
- That's right.
- I'll go get high points.

1742
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,490
Oh, no. What do I do? I'm scared.

1743
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,570
She has a fear of heights. We won.

1744
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,280
We're in trouble.
Hye Jin has a fear of heights.

1745
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,640
- Really?
- She's scared.

1746
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,700
You can do it, Hye Jin.

1747
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,950
It's higher than I thought.

1748
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,970
- Hye Jin, it's scary, right?
- It's higher than I thought.

1749
00:56:57,410 --> 00:57:00,240
It feels different
when you're up there.

1750
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,550
It's high. It's a lot higher
than I thought.

1751
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:03,620
You need to crawl forward.

1752
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,680
You'll never get a chance
to experience something like this.

1753
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,820
You can never experience it...

1754
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,430
- unless you're on a show.
- You can never experience it.

1755
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:09,890
You can't find it
in an amusement park either.

1756
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,990
You can consider it
as a Running Man experience.

1757
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:13,300
Let's go!

1758
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,100
- Min A!
- Min A!

1759
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,570
You can step on that part.

1760
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:17,970
- It won't break.
- It's safe there.

1761
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:20,470
- You should sit there first.
- Sit there comfortably. That's it.

1762
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,740
It might be better
to go on your fours and crawl.

1763
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,600
- Min A.
- She should get a medal with 20.

1764
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,700
Ji Young, you need to run from there
and stick it at the end.

1765
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,010
- I'm speaking from experience.
- Suk Jin, just stay quiet.

1766
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:34,720
(The player who got no points
gives her a tip.)

1767
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,820
I'm giving her a tip
because I failed.

1768
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,090
Look at him losing his temper.

1769
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:40,120
- That's...
- It must be the side effect...

1770
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,550
- of a Pfizer shot.
- What?

1771
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:43,220
He's losing his temper.

1772
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:45,620
- So what I'm saying is...
- It's the side effect.

1773
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:46,820
- He's losing his temper.
- Did he yell at you?

1774
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,570
He sounded like my father earlier.

1775
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:50,700
Ji Young, you need to acquire
a medal that says 30.

1776
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,700
Suk Jin. Are you okay?

1777
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,070
No, I'm not! Go and acquire...

1778
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:56,840
- Let's go!
- Why aren't you moving, Hye Jin?

1779
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,100
You need to stick the sticker on it.

1780
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,200
You can go forward, Hye Jin.

1781
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,300
You shouldn't run.

1782
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,700
- Go for it!
- Take a medal above you.

1783
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,740
Take a medal that says 15 at least.

1784
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,350
- I should take this at least.
- Ji Young might win at this rate.

1785
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,740
- Hye Jin, take the ten.
- Hye Jin, you need to take one...

1786
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,620
- in front of you.
- Take one in front of you at least.

1787
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:10,620
Ji Young might win fairly easily.

1788
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,350
Make sure to go slowly.
Go slowly at all costs.

1789
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:14,590
- She might win fairly easily.
- Wait.

1790
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:15,930
- Take the one that says 20.
- What I'm saying is...

1791
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:18,260
Is it okay to stick the sticker
when the board breaks?

1792
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,260
Yes, you can.

1793
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,890
(Just stick it before the board
touches the ground.)

1794
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:21,990
Just stick it before the board
touches the ground.

1795
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,070
She's going to run.

1796
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:24,390
- I'm going to give it a try.
- Is she going to run?

1797
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:26,430
(Is she going to run?)

1798
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:28,010
- You shouldn't run. It'll break.
- You shouldn't run!

1799
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:29,160
- You shouldn't run.
- Go slowly.

1800
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,640
- Just crawl...
- Don't run.

1801
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,430
- Ji Young is going to jump, and...
- You should run.

1802
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:36,700
Ji Young, take it slow.
Lie down flat on the board.

1803
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,280
- It's better to slide down.
- You want me to slide down?

1804
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,180
Ji Young, it won't go
the way you want.

1805
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:43,410
Ji Young, you can't slide down.
Just crawl.

1806
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:44,890
(Then why did you fail?)

1807
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:46,720
- Then why did you fail?
- Crawl like this.

1808
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,720
- Why did you fail?
- I realized it after I tried.

1809
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,720
I realized it after I tried.

1810
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,390
Ji Young,
if you stick it anywhere...

1811
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:52,800
No! Don't stick it there!

1812
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,720
Listen. Just...

1813
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:56,100
Trainer Kook, she's...

1814
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,340
- Hye Jin!
- Keep your manners.

1815
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:01,840
(The brave player has been
warming up for ten minutes.)

1816
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,200
Hye Jin.

1817
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,300
- What are you doing, Hye Jin?
- What are you doing?

1818
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,300
- Hye Jin.
- Just go!

1819
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,240
- It's so scary. What do I do?
- Hurry up.

1820
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:10,550
- Just crawl.
- Hurry up.

1821
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:11,570
Just crawl.

1822
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:13,570
- Gosh, what is she doing?
- I can only see her feet.

1823
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:15,220
- Hey, Min A.
- Just lie down flat.

1824
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,890
(Hey, Min A.
Yeon Koung is upset again.)

1825
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:18,760
Yeon Koung is upset again.

1826
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,620
- Get one that says 20!
- Hey!

1827
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,050
(The cowardly player finally starts
to move as Yeon Koung is upset.)

1828
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,620
- Min A.
- Don't run.

1829
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,530
- Min A!
- Get one that says 20!

1830
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,100
- Don't run. You're going to fall.
- What about one that says 25?

1831
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,890
- Hye Jin, grab the medal first.
- Hye Jin, get one that says 20.

1832
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:32,700
Get the medal that says 20.

1833
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:34,570
- It's okay.
- Get the medal that says 20.

1834
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,700
- The medal that says 20.
- No!

1835
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,600
- Go forward. Don't take it.
- Don't take that.

1836
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,700
That's it. Good job.

1837
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,070
(Hye Jin acquired a medal
that says 20.)

1838
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,280
- That's it. Good job.
- That was great.

1839
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,070
Just lie flat on the board.

1840
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:48,720
- No! No, you can't do that.
- No! Don't do that.

1841
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,220
The board will fall,
and you won't be able to stick it.

1842
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,410
- Ji Young is moving.
- Ji Young, lie on your stomach.

1843
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:55,590
You need to lie on your stomach.

1844
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,820
- Here I go!
- You need to lie on your stomach.

1845
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:00,100
- It's going to break for sure.
- It's going to break.

1846
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,530
It'll break
before you can even reach the end.

1847
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:03,700
- Ji Young, jump!
- I'm going to jump!

1848
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,740
- Watch your head.
- Hey!

1849
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,370
- You need to crawl.
- Don't jump!

1850
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,910
- You need to crawl!
- No!

1851
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:10,800
- No! Lie down!
- I'll jump now.

1852
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,800
She won't listen.

1853
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,700
- What is she going to do?
- Two...

1854
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:14,910
- Hey!
- My gosh.

1855
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:16,200
- Just lie down on the board!
- That's not going to work.

1856
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,570
- Watch your head, Ji Young!
- One...

1857
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,720
- One,
- What is she going to do?

1858
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,550
- two...
- Hey!

1859
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,090
Hold on. How am I supposed to stick
the sticker from here?

1860
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,550
Min A, don't mind her
and focus on yours.

1861
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:28,720
What is she doing?
Is she swimming up there?

1862
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:32,990
(Next to Min A, the bulldozer
is after one big success.)

1863
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,260
- Hey.
- Is she swimming up there?

1864
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:38,890
Oh, no.

1865
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:40,200
(She entered the pool
with her head first.)

1866
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,600
- Hey.
- She failed to stick the sticker.

1867
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,340
- She failed.
- You should've stuck the sticker!

1868
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,970
- She failed to stick the sticker.
- She failed to stick the sticker.

1869
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:50,570
(She talked big, but she ended up
earning no points.)

1870
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:53,050
Look at her.

1871
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,010
Hey! Can you breathe?

1872
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:57,240
- Is she laughing?
- She's laughing.

1873
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,510
She failed to stick the sticker.

1874
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:00,680
- Where is she?
- Are you okay, Ji Young?

1875
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:02,950
- She ended up jumping.
- You fell!

1876
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,260
She failed to stick the sticker.

1877
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,950
(Oh...)

1878
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:07,160
She says she's embarrassed.

1879
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,470
(Oh, she says she's embarrassed.)

1880
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:10,100
(She says she's embarrassed.)

1881
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,430
Oh, you must've been embarrassed.

1882
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:13,260
- Ji Young!
- Come out here.

1883
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,600
(Miserable end of a bulldozer who
wants to disappear into thin air)

1884
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:17,430
(Ji Young grabbed the medal,
but she couldn't stick the sticker,)

1885
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:19,410
(so she earned no points.)

1886
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:21,470
- Hye Jin! Go slowly.
- Hye Jin.

1887
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,640
Just stick it at 3m and come down.

1888
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,200
- Just stick it there.
- Hye Jin.

1889
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,180
Just stick it there, Hye Jin.

1890
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,490
Nice!

1891
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:32,620
(She stuck the sticker.)

1892
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,050
- I stuck it!
- She did it.

1893
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:35,620
- All right.
- She did it.

1894
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:37,390
- She did it.
- She did it.

1895
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:38,700
- All right.
- Well done.

1896
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,720
- It's really scary up there.
- Well done.

1897
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,800
This team is done for.

1898
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,530
Hye Jin stuck the sticker at 3.4m
and gained 20cm.

1899
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:45,640
In total, she gained 360 points.

1900
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,890
Well done.

1901
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:49,160
- Good job.
- All right.

1902
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,910
- Our ace player will go next.
- Who is it?

1903
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:53,740
- So Min is going next.
- Nice!

1904
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:57,100
Then we should pick someone
who will succeed this time.

1905
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,410
- Pick Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo. She's brave.

1906
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:01,280
I can't get the medal.

1907
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,090
- No, you can.
- I can't take the medal.

1908
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:06,280
- It's gotten even higher.
- That chicken.

1909
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,550
I'm serious. It's gotten higher.

1910
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:11,620
Don't be so weak.
Just take a medal that says 40.

1911
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:12,620
(So Min suddenly got scared
at the higher set.)

1912
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:15,570
- Are you ready?
- So Min, I think you can reach 40.

1913
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:17,300
I want to use the bathroom
all of a sudden.

1914
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:18,570
You said the same thing back then.

1915
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:20,070
I really need to use the bathroom.

1916
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,530
(When they first played
the same game in Episode 517...)

1917
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,100
(Actually,
I think I might pee in my pants.)

1918
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,070
(They can't air it
if I pee in my pants, right?)

1919
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:27,970
(She got scared and told everyone
that she might pee in her pants.)

1920
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:31,780
I can't pee in my pants because
I'm wearing gray pants today.

1921
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,450
You don't need to fall
even if it breaks.

1922
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,820
Get the medal that says 30.
You've done this before.

1923
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,640
- Don't get greedy.
- You can do it!

1924
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:40,590
Ji Hyo, it's safe there.
You can even lie there comfortably.

1925
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,260
I'm telling you, it's really safe.
It'll never break.

1926
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,890
- I'm really scared.
- You can do it, So Min!

1927
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:46,550
Hurry up a little, So Min!

1928
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,990
- That's it.
- Slide down.

1929
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:51,100
Hye Jin, do cheers for So Min.

1930
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,160
You can do it!

1931
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,930
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1932
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:56,030
She can't reach it. Poor her.

1933
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,200
- Her arm is too short for it.
- Her arm is too short.

1934
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,570
- It's too short!
- That's great, So Min.

1935
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:03,010
- Ji Hyo's arms are too short!
- All right!

1936
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:05,410
Ji Hyo, don't try to get the medal.
You don't have to.

1937
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,910
- So Min.
- How about one that says 15?

1938
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:10,780
We don't expect much from you,
so don't overdo it.

1939
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,280
- Don't go beyond your capability.
- He's right.

1940
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,720
Just grab the medal that says 15
and come back.

1941
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:16,490
- Keep crawling.
- There's one that says 15.

1942
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:18,550
- There's one that says 15.
- Stretch as much as you can.

1943
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:20,100
- I'm really scared.
- It's okay.

1944
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,870
- It's okay.
- We don't expect much from you.

1945
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,970
It's okay. Just go forward.

1946
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,970
- I can't go forward.
- You can do it.

1947
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,160
- Can she do it?
- I won't go forward.

1948
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,070
- Just put the sticker.
- Let's go.

1949
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:30,300
Just put the sticker on the floor.

1950
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:32,200
- You can do it.
- Let's go.

1951
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,470
You can do it.

1952
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:34,640
(She stretches her arm forward.)

1953
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,780
What am I going to do?

1954
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,780
- Here it comes.
- Ji Hyo is going to fall.

1955
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:39,350
Ji Hyo is going to fall.

1956
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:40,910
No. It's okay, Ji Hyo.

1957
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:42,910
It's okay. Just go slow.

1958
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:45,720
Ji Hyo, your styrofoam
began to crack.

1959
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,160
- That's not true.
- That's not true. Ignore him.

1960
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,930
- Ji Hyo.
- Your styrofoam began to crack.

1961
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:50,120
- That's not true.
- That's not true.

1962
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,530
- Ignore him.
- Not at all.

1963
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:53,050
- Ignore him. It's nonsense.
- You are going to fall soon.

1964
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:54,260
- Gosh.
- So Min, a bit more.

1965
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,760
(For So Min,
every moment is a crisis.)

1966
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,530
- So Min, a bit more.
- You are going to fall soon.

1967
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,470
Gosh, I can't go forward.

1968
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:04,260
- So Min, you need to grab a medal.
- Get 15.

1969
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,600
- So Min, you need to grab a medal.
- Can you go further?

1970
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,050
You don't need to go further.
Just put the sticker on the floor.

1971
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:14,120
You did it. Come back out.

1972
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,120
- Just put the sticker on the floor.
- So Min.

1973
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,390
So Min.

1974
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:19,320
So Min, where are you going?

1975
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:21,930
(So Min, where are you going?)

1976
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:23,850
- So Min, get 15.
- Take off 15.

1977
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:25,030
- Take off 15.
- Grab 15.

1978
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:27,450
- Take off 15. It's right above you.
- Grab 15.

1979
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:29,300
- Go slow.
- Back off and grab 15.

1980
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,600
Okay.

1981
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,030
- She put the sticker.
- There you go.

1982
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:34,660
So Min, we don't expect much.
Come back.

1983
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,700
(Hurried)

1984
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,070
- Nice play.
- Good job.

1985
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:40,240
- Nice play.
- Good job.

1986
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,010
Gosh, it was so scary.

1987
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:43,600
It was so scary.

1988
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:46,070
Ji Hyo, just put the sticker
on the floor.

1989
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:48,240
- Put the sticker and come back.
- That's right.

1990
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:51,660
No. It will break if you go further.

1991
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:52,720
(She keeps moving forward
without hesitation.)

1992
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,490
Put the sticker on the floor.

1993
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,390
- Aren't you scared?
- I am surprised it didn't break.

1994
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:57,490
There you go.

1995
01:04:57,490 --> 01:04:58,760
How do you have a smile
on your face?

1996
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,350
(She charges forward.)

1997
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:08,810
How do you have a smile
on your face?

1998
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:09,850
(Breaking)

1999
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,370
- That was insane.
- Good job.

2000
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,180
- That's it.
- She is good.

2001
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:17,620
Ji Hyo did much better
than I expected.

2002
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,890
Ji Hyo.

2003
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,560
Jong Kook is swooning over here.

2004
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,250
(Jong Kook is swooning over here.)

2005
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,250
I can't believe it.

2006
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:26,500
- I didn't say anything.
- Jong Kook, I did it.

2007
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,330
I didn't say anything.

2008
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:30,200
- He is swooning over here.
- Don't be ridiculous.

2009
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:32,390
Jong Kook is swooning over here.

2010
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:33,790
Nice, Ji Hyo.

2011
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:36,100
- Good job.
- Nice shot. You are the ace.

2012
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,870
- Good job.
- You did well.

2013
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:39,370
You did well.

2014
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:40,430
- I did my best.
- Eun Jin.

2015
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:42,370
- Eun Jin.
- Let's go.

2016
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:43,700
- Let's go.
- You can do this.

2017
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,140
- Let's go, Eun Jin.
- It was so scary.

2018
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,220
(Eun Jin and Hee Jin are up next.)

2019
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,180
When you were down here,

2020
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:50,350
you were like, "It's okay."

2021
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:51,680
"It's just a little bit bent."

2022
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:53,390
When you got up there...

2023
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:55,390
(Screaming)

2024
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:56,390
I usually cry.

2025
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:58,660
You ordered us around
when you were down here.

2026
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,430
- This is so scary.
- Hee Jin, is it scary?

2027
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,270
Eun Jin, we won't be able to do it.

2028
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,000
Are you scared? Get down.

2029
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,200
It will be less scary
if you get down.

2030
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,390
- Eun Jin, let's go.
- Come on.

2031
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:09,830
Hee Jin, it won't break
when you are there.

2032
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:11,410
- Hee Jin, get 15.
- You are at the safe area.

2033
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:12,640
It's bending too much.

2034
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,100
- You are at the safe area.
- It's scary, right?

2035
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:16,040
- Get down.
- I think it's bending already.

2036
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:18,810
- It's okay.
- You need to get down first.

2037
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,540
- Come on down.
- Get down.

2038
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,390
Hye Seon and Hye Jin,
cheer for them.

2039
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:23,790
- Let's go.
- Good luck.

2040
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:24,810
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2041
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:26,180
- Eun Jin, don't be too scared.
- Let's go.

2042
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:27,790
- You are doing well.
- Get down on your knees.

2043
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:29,350
- Try your best to go 3m.
- Get your hands on the floor.

2044
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:30,750
- There you go.
- Push forward.

2045
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,930
- Go slowly.
- Get 15.

2046
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,250
- Eun Jin, don't be too scared.
- Let's go.

2047
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,500
Eun Jin, you are fearless.

2048
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:37,700
You need to get down first.

2049
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,370
- Come on down.
- Get down.

2050
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:41,470
- I can't do this.
- Hye Seon and Hye Jin,

2051
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,640
- cheer for them.
- Let's go.

2052
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:44,970
- Let's go.
- Stay in the lane.

2053
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:46,580
Get down on your knees.

2054
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:48,100
Get your hands on the floor.

2055
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,180
- There you go.
- Get your hands on the floor.

2056
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:51,370
Hold on.

2057
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:52,720
- Hee Jin.
- Get 15.

2058
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,080
- Get 15.
- Eun Jin, are you going to get it?

2059
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,140
(Hee Jin can't get the medal
that is right in front of her.)

2060
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:57,250
Don't look at Eun Jin.

2061
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,120
- Hold on.
- It's okay.

2062
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,250
- It's okay.
- How did you get down?

2063
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,810
(How did you get down?)

2064
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,850
- Eun Jin.
- Eun Jin.

2065
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,520
If you go slowly, you will fall.

2066
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,500
You should go fast
and put the sticker on the floor.

2067
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,500
- It's bent already.
- It's bent already.

2068
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,230
- Eun Jin, it's quite bent.
- It's bent already.

2069
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:12,470
- Eun Jin.
- Just put the sticker.

2070
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,290
- Eun Jin, it's quite bent.
- It's bent already.

2071
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:15,370
- Eun Jin.
- Just put the sticker.

2072
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:17,540
(The styrofoam got bent
while she inched forward.)

2073
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,810
- Eun Jin.
- Just put the sticker.

2074
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:19,930
- Eun Jin, it's quite bent.
- Eun Jin.

2075
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:21,270
(She charges forward.)

2076
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:22,330
She did it.

2077
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:25,640
(Eun Jin dived.)

2078
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,750
- She put the sticker.
- She put the sticker.

2079
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:29,180
- Eun Jin, it's quite bent.
- Eun Jin.

2080
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,140
(She put the sticker
on the 3.4m mark...)

2081
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:33,560
(and fell!)

2082
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,730
- She put the sticker.
- She put the sticker.

2083
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:37,620
- It counts.
- She put the sticker.

2084
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,600
- Good job.
- She put the sticker.

2085
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,950
- Hurrah.
- Hurrah.

2086
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:42,350
Let's go.

2087
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:43,520
How was it?

2088
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,560
- Was it scary?
- Hee Jin, it was so scary.

2089
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:47,730
It was so scary.

2090
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,060
(Teddy Bear is having a crisis.)

2091
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,500
Hee Jin, hurry up and do something.

2092
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,270
Do something.
Put the sticker on the floor.

2093
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:54,830
Hee Jin, take off 15.

2094
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:56,640
- Put it on the 2m mark.
- Take off 15.

2095
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,980
First, take off 15.

2096
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,870
- It won't come off.
- Hey.

2097
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:01,080
- Hee Jin, are you okay?
- You have to do better than that.

2098
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,250
- There you go.
- You saw the others do it.

2099
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,890
It won't break
even if you advance halfway.

2100
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:06,720
- It won't break.
- We will tell you.

2101
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,310
- Hee Jin, there you go.
- Come on.

2102
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:09,520
- Go forward.
- Go as slow as you can.

2103
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,980
Don't do that!

2104
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,450
(Don't do that!)

2105
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:15,660
(Why did he say that
when she got down nicely?)

2106
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,830
Hold on. What is your problem?

2107
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:19,640
- Mister.
- Why are you angry?

2108
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,430
- I want my team to win.
- What is your problem?

2109
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,870
- It's the side effect of a vaccine.
- There you go.

2110
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:23,910
It's okay.

2111
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,470
Don't put your leg
over the threshold.

2112
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:26,980
(Hee Jin tries to go forward.)

2113
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:28,100
- It's okay.
- It's bending.

2114
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,350
It's okay.

2115
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,250
- Oh, no.
- It's okay.

2116
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,950
It's okay.

2117
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:34,910
(Locust Gym makes a fuss
when it shakes a little bit.)

2118
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,980
- Don't go further.
- You shouldn't go further.

2119
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,580
No. Just listen to us. It's fine.

2120
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:40,790
- It's fine.
- It's about to break.

2121
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:42,520
- Listen to us,
- It's game over.

2122
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,020
- You are going to fall.
- It's really bent.

2123
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:45,160
Hey.

2124
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,000
- Put the sticker on the floor.
- Do it now, Hee Jin.

2125
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,520
- Put the sticker.
- I am honestly scared.

2126
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,970
- It's fine.
- Hee Jin.

2127
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:53,000
I am saying this to you
with seriousness.

2128
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,000
- You are in danger.
- That's not true. Not at all.

2129
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,160
I spit on you!

2130
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:58,730
- You are in danger.
- That's not true. Not at all.

2131
01:08:58,730 --> 01:08:59,830
I spit on you!

2132
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:02,140
Good job.

2133
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:03,250
- What was that?
- Good job.

2134
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:04,850
Have you no manners?

2135
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:06,850
Hee Jin has no manners!

2136
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:08,220
Put the sticker on the floor.

2137
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,540
Put the sticker on the floor
and back off.

2138
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,040
- Reach further.
- You can go forward.

2139
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,310
Hee Jin, you are in danger.

2140
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:15,290
- You are safe.
- Hey, it's going to break.

2141
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,950
- Gosh.
- It's not true.

2142
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:19,560
My eardrums almost burst.

2143
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,830
- Come on.
- My eardrums almost burst.

2144
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,120
- Right now...
- You are in danger.

2145
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,930
You are totally safe.

2146
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:28,600
Hee Jin, you are totally safe.

2147
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,660
- No way. It's really bent.
- That's not true.

2148
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,060
- That's not true.
- It isn't bent.

2149
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,730
- Hee Jin, it isn't bent.
- You are fine.

2150
01:09:33,730 --> 01:09:35,310
Put the sticker on the floor.

2151
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,250
- It's okay.
- Put the sticker on the floor.

2152
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,180
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

2153
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:41,620
- It's okay.
- Stop there.

2154
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:42,680
- Put the sticker on the floor.
- Stop there.

2155
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,750
- It's okay.
- Stop there.

2156
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:46,410
- Put the sticker on the floor.
- Stop there.

2157
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,750
Put the sticker.

2158
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,230
Hee Jin, put the sticker.

2159
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:50,830
Put the sticker and go back.

2160
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:52,250
- Put the sticker.
- One, two, three.

2161
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,100
- Put the sticker.
- One, two, three.

2162
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:55,870
Put the sticker and go back.

2163
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:58,060
- You are going to fall.
- No, you are fine.

2164
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,790
- It's bent.
- It's going to break.

2165
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:02,810
- It's going to break.
- It's going to break.

2166
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:03,870
You are fine.

2167
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:05,810
- She didn't put the sticker.
- She did it.

2168
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:06,980
(Hee Jin picks up her courage
for the first time.)

2169
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:09,080
- She didn't put the sticker.
- She did it.

2170
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,870
(Did she fail to put the sticker?)

2171
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:13,250
- She didn't put the sticker.
- She did it.

2172
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,370
She did it.

2173
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:16,480
- She put it as she fell.
- I put it as I fell.

2174
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,350
- Review the video.
- Review the video.

2175
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:19,660
Come on.

2176
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:25,330
(She put it right before she fell.)

2177
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:26,520
She put it.

2178
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,330
- Okay.
- That's good.

2179
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:29,890
- Thank goodness.
- I put it.

2180
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:31,890
Good job, Hee Jin.

2181
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:33,140
- It was so scary.
- Good job.

2182
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:34,600
- Good job.
- What am I going to do?

2183
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:36,500
- Yeon Koung.
- Yeon Koung, let's go.

2184
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:37,730
- Seriously.
- Yeon Koung.

2185
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:38,970
- You need to do this.
- Let's go.

2186
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:40,680
- You need to do this.
- Let's go. You can do it.

2187
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,310
- It's your turn.
- You are cool.

2188
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:43,750
- Yeon Koung.
- Locust Gym.

2189
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:45,270
- Locust Gym.
- Let's go.

2190
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,140
(From Tiger Gym,
So Young will go next.)

2191
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:48,950
- It's so scary.
- Good job.

2192
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,850
- We got this.
- Get down.

2193
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:54,810
- Yeon Koung, let's go.
- Let's go.

2194
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:56,020
Let's go.

2195
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:58,480
Since I am tall,
I feel like I am up higher.

2196
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:01,560
- It's understandable.
- Yeon Koung, hit the 4m mark.

2197
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:06,190
(Yeon Koung suddenly takes off
the medal that says ten.)

2198
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:07,240
All right.

2199
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:09,610
- Yeon Koung, let's go.
- What are you doing?

2200
01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:10,700
- Yeon Koung.
- Did she take it off?

2201
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,640
Why did you get ten?

2202
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,830
Look over here.

2203
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,650
- You should have gotten 30.
- Yeon Koung.

2204
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:17,650
Why did you get ten?

2205
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,070
- Yeon Koung.
- You will go far, right?

2206
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:20,570
- It's so scary.
- You will go far, right?

2207
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:21,720
It's scary.

2208
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,080
- Shall I take it off?
- Get ten.

2209
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,850
- Just take it off.
- Get ten.

2210
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:25,890
Take it off.

2211
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:27,020
- Take it off.
- Shall I take it off?

2212
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,190
Take it off.

2213
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,360
- You know...
- Go forward.

2214
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:33,030
You know, I am heavier.

2215
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:35,290
- You can do it.
- Slide forward.

2216
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:36,600
- All right.
- Shall I go slowly?

2217
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:38,070
- Yes.
- Go slowly.

2218
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:39,990
It's so scary.

2219
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:41,660
Come on.

2220
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:42,660
(They set off carefully.)

2221
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:43,830
Let's go.

2222
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:46,310
- There you go, So Young.
- You are doing well, Yeon Koung.

2223
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:48,400
- Go slow.
- You are doing well.

2224
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:49,980
- You are doing well, Yeon Koung.
- Yeon Koung.

2225
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:51,850
You are doing well.

2226
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,070
- Get down.
- Yeon Koung, reach the 3m mark.

2227
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:55,520
- What?
- She is relaxed.

2228
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,280
You need to reach the 3m mark.

2229
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:01,860
(How am I supposed to do that?
Are you insane?)

2230
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,060
- Trainer Yoo.
- You got this.

2231
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,730
Why don't you come up here
and do it?

2232
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:07,430
- That's good.
- She is relaxed.

2233
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:08,430
(So Young goes forward
with a grin on her face.)

2234
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:09,770
That's a nice facial expression.

2235
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:11,360
- Go further.
- That's a nice facial expression.

2236
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:13,600
Stretch out your arms.

2237
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:15,600
- There you go.
- Then you can put it anytime.

2238
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:17,330
(Laughing)

2239
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:18,500
- So Young.
- That's good.

2240
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,870
(The strong-minded woman laughs
even when she's on a steep slope.)

2241
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,500
It's going to break.

2242
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,240
Oh, no.

2243
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,440
So Young.

2244
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,650
(The onlookers are
even more nervous.)

2245
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,410
It's going to break.

2246
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,820
- Oh, no.
- Push forward.

2247
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:32,860
It's going to break.

2248
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:34,190
(So Young goes forward.)

2249
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:35,320
She did it!

2250
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:37,060
It's going to break.

2251
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,730
(She put the sticker right away.)

2252
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,600
(The moment she began to fall,)

2253
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,030
(she put the sticker on the floor
with a smile.)

2254
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:46,770
(It was the perfect dive.)

2255
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:49,970
- Lee So Young!
- That was great.

2256
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:53,310
- Lee So Young!
- Lee So Young!

2257
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:55,310
- It was the best.
- You did an amazing job.

2258
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:56,540
You did it.

2259
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,540
She is so athletic.

2260
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,610
She is always relaxed.

2261
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:04,490
- Lee So Young!
- That was great.

2262
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:07,690
- Lee So Young!
- Lee So Young!

2263
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:09,320
- Yeon Koung, you can't lose.
- Hurry up.

2264
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,390
- Focus.
- Yeon Koung, you can't lose.

2265
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:13,150
I am heavier than her.

2266
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:16,660
- Let's give it a try.
- Yeon Koung.

2267
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:18,600
- Let's give it a try. We can do it.
- Let's give it a try.

2268
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,740
- Let's give it a try.
- Let's give it a try.

2269
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:20,900
Get down.

2270
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,600
(Here is why they are saying,
"Let's give it a try.")

2271
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,500
- Let's give it a try.
- Yes.

2272
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,110
(Let's give it a try.
Let's not leave any regrets.)

2273
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:29,900
- Yeon Koung.
- Let's give it a try.

2274
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,400
Go past the 3m mark.

2275
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,110
- Yeon Koung.
- Let's give it a try.

2276
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:34,350
- Go past the 3m mark.
- Hey.

2277
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:35,740
(Hold on!)

2278
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:38,150
- That's Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo's facial expression.

2279
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:42,860
(Kwang Soo's facial expression)

2280
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:44,280
Let's give it a try.

2281
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,490
- Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo.

2282
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:48,360
Kwang Soo, we missed you.

2283
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:50,270
You are nearly done.

2284
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:52,360
- It's shaking a lot.
- Kwang Soo.

2285
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:54,990
That's Kwang Soo's
facial expression.

2286
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:59,480
- Don't put your feet down.
- Hey.

2287
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,900
- Kwang Soo.
- Look at the Jimmy Jib.

2288
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:03,980
Kwang Soo.

2289
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:05,310
Yeon Koung.

2290
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:07,020
- Yeon Koung, come on.
- Kwang Soo.

2291
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,610
- Yeon Koung.
- Look at the Jimmy Jib.

2292
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,190
It's time to look at the Jimmy Jib.

2293
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:11,350
Go faster.

2294
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:13,650
Stretch out your hand.

2295
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:17,080
(The parallel universes
of the lanky people)

2296
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,950
Yeon Koung, don't move so much.

2297
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:20,190
Yeon Koung, move forward.

2298
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,230
Stretch out your hand.

2299
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:23,860
- You are going to fall.
- Stretch out your hand.

2300
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,360
- Let's give it a try.
- Yeon Koung.

2301
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,740
Let's give it a try.

2302
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,860
- Yeon Koung.
- For goodness' sake.

2303
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:28,990
Come on.

2304
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:31,160
You need to move forward.

2305
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,570
Hey.

2306
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:33,810
(Wriggling)

2307
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:35,810
- This is fun.
- Her feet are touching.

2308
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:37,400
- You need to move forward.
- Move forward.

2309
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,070
- You need to move forward.
- Who knew she was like this?

2310
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:40,980
- Come on. You can move forward.
- This is fun.

2311
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:42,110
(Yeon Koung hasn't even reached
the halfway point.)

2312
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,690
- All right. Let's give it a try.
- A bit more.

2313
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,580
Yeon Koung.

2314
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:47,690
- Let's give it a try.
- Come on.

2315
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:49,360
- Let's give it a try.
- Let's go.

2316
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,390
- Yeon Koung, throw your body.
- Throw your body.

2317
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:52,530
Throw your body.

2318
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:53,990
- Throw your body.
- Go.

2319
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:55,150
Come on.

2320
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:56,620
- What?
- Throw your body.

2321
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:58,530
- Come on.
- You can't jump.

2322
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:00,490
You can't jump.

2323
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:02,660
You talk big
because this doesn't concern you.

2324
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:04,160
- Hey.
- My goodness.

2325
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,280
- You little...
- This concerns all of us.

2326
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,180
- I will end you when I go down.
- This concerns all of us.

2327
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,540
- Cheer for her.
- She is angry.

2328
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,280
- Let's go.
- Just reach the halfway point.

2329
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,740
- Yeon Koung.
- Yeon Koung, let's go.

2330
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:15,070
Just reach the halfway point.

2331
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:17,190
- Yeon Koung, don't do that.
- Hey.

2332
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:18,650
(Yeon Koung, don't do that.)

2333
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:19,990
Yeon Koung.

2334
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,690
- Come on!
- She put the sticker.

2335
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:25,250
(The junior volleyball players
throw sponges at her.)

2336
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:26,600
Now...

2337
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:27,930
- Come on!
- She put the sticker.

2338
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:29,150
- For goodness' sake.
- She took it off.

2339
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,660
- Move forward.
- She took it off.

2340
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:32,100
- She took it off.
- She took it off.

2341
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,100
Go. Move forward.

2342
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,270
Move forward.

2343
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:36,500
Hurry up.

2344
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,070
Stretch out your hand.

2345
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:40,330
- Don't do that.
- Don't do that.

2346
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:42,070
- Don't do that.
- Move forward.

2347
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:43,180
- Hurry up.
- A bit more.

2348
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,000
- Throw your body.
- Push your body forward.

2349
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,320
Go a bit further.

2350
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,350
- You got this.
- Go.

2351
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:48,370
Throw your body.

2352
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:49,610
Throw your body and put the sticker.

2353
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:51,610
- You got this.
- Throw your body.

2354
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:53,080
Throw your body and put the sticker.

2355
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,190
Why do you keep telling me
to throw my body?

2356
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,580
I am not a bird that can fly, okay?

2357
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:01,120
- You are spouting nonsense.
- Let's go.

2358
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:02,990
She is exactly like Kwang Soo.

2359
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:04,320
(She is exactly like Kwang Soo
when she is annoyed.)

2360
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,240
- No.
- Yeon Koung, put the sticker.

2361
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,600
- Okay.
- You are doing well.

2362
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,160
- Now is the time.
- Hurry up and put the sticker.

2363
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,330
- No.
- Yeon Koung, put the sticker.

2364
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:12,400
- Put the sticker.
- No.

2365
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:14,900
(She needs to put the sticker now.)

2366
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,500
Yeon Koung, put the sticker.

2367
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:19,940
Yeon Koung, put the sticker.

2368
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:21,570
- She did it.
- She did it.

2369
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:22,570
(Thankfully, the sticker
stuck to the floor.)

2370
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:24,240
- Did she succeed?
- She fell after she put it.

2371
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,990
She put it after she fell.

2372
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:27,360
- She put it after she fell.
- She put it after she fell.

2373
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,910
Review the video.

2374
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:31,150
- Are you okay?
- She put it after she fell.

2375
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:32,620
Yeon Koung, are you okay?

2376
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:34,230
She is going to swear!

2377
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,490
Hey. I put it, you punk.

2378
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:37,970
Review the video.

2379
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:39,770
(Long Legs is angry.)

2380
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:41,830
Hey. It should count.

2381
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,160
You did it.

2382
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,640
I know how it feels now.

2383
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,970
Okay. Good job.

2384
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:47,370
- Good job.
- Seriously.

2385
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:48,810
- You did it.
- I want her on the show.

2386
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:52,980
I want her on the show.
Jae Suk, she is the best.

2387
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,850
- I want her on the show.
- I hope she joins the show.

2388
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:57,110
You know, I found a replacement
for Kwang Soo.

2389
01:16:57,990 --> 01:17:00,280
Nothing is amiss.

2390
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:02,280
Her height and everything else
are perfect.

2391
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,360
She is perfect.

2392
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,890
Everyone.
The scores are so far apart...

2393
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:07,860
that the last round
won't make a difference.

2394
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:09,250
- Okay.
- Yes.

2395
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:12,530
- It's over.
- Okay.

2396
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,400
- All right.
- Okay.

2397
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,900
- Why are you clapping?
- Didn't we win?

2398
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,740
- We lost.
- We did it.

2399
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:20,030
We lost.

2400
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:23,150
Please divide the members
into 1st-string and 2nd-string.

2401
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:24,870
- Hold on.
- I will be a second-string player.

2402
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:26,740
Yeon Koung should join
the second-string team.

2403
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:27,820
Why?

2404
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:31,190
- I worked hard.
- Yes you did, but in general...

2405
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:33,520
- Just this once.
- Switch places with Min A.

2406
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,720
- Min A.
- Okay.

2407
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,280
(Hye Jin and Yeon Koung
switch places.)

2408
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,860
- Switch places with Min A.
- I haven't done much either.

2409
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,290
Switch places. Hold on.

2410
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:42,530
- Switch places with Eun Jin.
- Really?

2411
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:44,290
- Eun Jin.
- Today...

2412
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:46,290
- Min A did a good job.
- Thank you.

2413
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,660
- She did a good job.
- I acknowledge that.

2414
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:48,940
(Meanwhile, Trainer Kook)

2415
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:50,660
One last game remains.

2416
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:51,970
They switched some players.

2417
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:53,700
Everything will be all right...

2418
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:56,370
if the players cut me some slack
during the salary negotiation.

2419
01:17:56,650 --> 01:18:00,070
Before the last game, we will have
the last salary negotiation.

2420
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:01,440
Let's resume after we clean up.

2421
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,940
- You get to negotiate, right?
- Yes.

2422
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:04,390
I am jealous.

2423
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:07,190
Trainer Yoo and Trainer Kook,
listen up.

2424
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,580
The difference
between the trainers' money is...

2425
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:11,580
less than 50 dollars.

2426
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:12,580
The two of us?

2427
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:13,620
(The difference is
about 50 dollars.)

2428
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:15,230
What? Really?

2429
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:18,100
- They need to save up money.
- It's less than 50 dollars.

2430
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:19,600
During the salary negotiation...

2431
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:21,160
They need to save up money.

2432
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,860
- Eun Jin, welcome.
- Hello.

2433
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:24,860
- Please sit down.
- Okay.

2434
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:28,110
It's good to have you here.

2435
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:30,570
Eun Jin, how much do you want?

2436
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:33,240
Please write down the number.

2437
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,070
(Despite the smiling face,
she isn't easy.)

2438
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:37,020
- How much do you want?
- Please write down the number.

2439
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:41,110
- Let me see the amount first.
- I am thinking about 50 dollars.

2440
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:42,560
(Did you say 50 dollars?)

2441
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,820
My first salary was 120 dollars.

2442
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,690
You cut it down
by more than 50 percent.

2443
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:50,160
Trainer Kook and I are
only 50 dollars apart.

2444
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,100
We spent too much on the meal.

2445
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,530
Still, 50 dollars is too much.

2446
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:55,830
- How about 60 dollars?
- How about 70 dollars?

2447
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:56,900
(How about 70 dollars?)

2448
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,110
(Sighing)

2449
01:18:58,110 --> 01:18:59,870
- Okay. 70 dollars.
- That's good enough for me.

2450
01:18:59,870 --> 01:19:02,180
You will pay
the second-string players, right?

2451
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:05,540
I can't do that
unless your salary is 50 dollars.

2452
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,720
Give me 60 dollars
and pay the 2nd-string players.

2453
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:09,540
- Okay.
- Okay.

2454
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:11,280
(Eun Jin agreed on 60 dollars.)

2455
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,110
Since we have 400 dollars... Okay.

2456
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:15,490
Are you done? That was quick.

2457
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:16,890
How much did you get?

2458
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:19,060
- Half.
- How much?

2459
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:20,900
- Min A, come on in.
- Did you get 60 dollars?

2460
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:22,820
She got 60 dollars.
That's so little.

2461
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:25,230
We agreed upon 70 dollars at 1st,

2462
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,690
but he said he wouldn't be able to
pay the second-string players then.

2463
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:29,900
- So I lowered the price.
- That's heartwarming.

2464
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:32,030
- How much did she get?
- He should be able to pay us.

2465
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:35,180
- She got 60 dollars.
- I learned what teamwork is today.

2466
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:39,310
Are the numbers
susceptible to change?

2467
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:41,610
How did you learn what teamwork is?

2468
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:45,020
- No one went to the other team.
- That's right.

2469
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:46,390
- We stayed together.
- That's right.

2470
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:47,990
You are right.

2471
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,730
It's the first time
I saw something like that here.

2472
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:52,620
So Min, you can't be sure yet.

2473
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:54,790
- You can't be sure yet.
- He is thinking about ditching me.

2474
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,970
That's not true.
It's up to Trainer Yoo.

2475
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:59,620
- Hello.
- Min A, welcome.

2476
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:02,570
Min A, what was your initial salary?

2477
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:03,660
- Me?
- Yes.

2478
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:06,310
- It was 110 dollars.
- It was 110 dollars, right?

2479
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:08,280
Then 20 dollars got added to it.

2480
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,110
You won't place last.

2481
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:11,310
- No.
- I am sure of it.

2482
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:14,180
So you want to give me
a small amount.

2483
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:15,820
(The players aren't as easy
as Trainer Yoo would like.)

2484
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:17,540
It's not like that.

2485
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:19,650
Let's make it 70 dollars.

2486
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:21,190
How about 80 dollars?

2487
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:24,620
Seven is my favorite number.

2488
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:26,320
So you should add 10
and make it 80 dollars.

2489
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,650
I have no greed.
I just want 80 dollars.

2490
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:30,730
- Okay. Let's make it 80 dollars.
- Okay.

2491
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:33,470
- Let's hurry up with the contract.
- Okay.

2492
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:35,190
- Let's hurry up.
- Okay.

2493
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:38,160
How much do you want?

2494
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:39,870
Please make an offer first.

2495
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:41,680
- You should tell me.
- Please make an offer first.

2496
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,740
- Shall I do that?
- Yes.

2497
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:44,850
The team always makes
an offer first.

2498
01:20:44,850 --> 01:20:48,870
Hold on. Please whisper it to me.
How much do I have right now?

2499
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:51,280
We are at the bottom.

2500
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:55,780
Why do I need to sacrifice myself
for the team?

2501
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:59,560
We ended up at the bottom
without a chance to do something.

2502
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:02,750
To be honest,
the talk of teamwork is all a ruse.

2503
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,490
The trainers take all the money,

2504
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:06,160
but we are forced to struggle
with them.

2505
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,360
(He begins to badmouth
the trainers.)

2506
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,990
- He just gave us tteokbokki.
- You are right.

2507
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:10,070
(Getting up)

2508
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:11,660
You have a point.

2509
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:13,980
- You worked so hard,
- Seriously.

2510
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:16,000
but the 3 1st-string players took
all the money.

2511
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,680
- It's ridiculous.
- If they have a conscience...

2512
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,650
They just say that we are a team.

2513
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:21,780
- You are right.
- The trainers are the bad ones.

2514
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:23,580
- There is a feud between them.
- They are the bad ones.

2515
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:26,150
Let's be honest.
How did the gym make money?

2516
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:27,860
We did all the menial work.

2517
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:29,110
You are right.

2518
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:30,890
How did the gym make money?

2519
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:33,360
Ji Hyo crawled
to put the sticker on the floor.

2520
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,620
Did you succeed?

2521
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,060
- Kwang Soo.
- She didn't succeed,

2522
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,570
- but Ji Hyo did.
- All right, Kwang Soo.

2523
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:39,470
- Ji Hyo succeeded.
- All right, Kwang Soo.

2524
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:40,770
- But Ji Hyo...
- Kwang Soo.

2525
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:42,240
- Ji Hyo is a second-string player.
- Kwang Soo.

2526
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:45,030
Kwang Soo.

2527
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:46,680
Kwang Soo, calm down.

2528
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:47,940
Kwang Soo.

2529
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:50,280
- I mean...
- Feeling! Say, "Intuition!"

2530
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,570
- Feeling! Cross!
- Intuition! Cross!

2531
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:55,040
(Feeling! Intuition! Cross!)

2532
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,370
My goodness.

2533
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:57,890
It's good to see you again,
Kwang Soo.

2534
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,520
Feeling! Intuition! Cross!

2535
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,950
- One more time. Feeling! Cross!
- Intuition! Cross!

2536
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:03,690
My goodness.

2537
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:05,150
- I am in tears.
- Kwang Soo came back this way.

2538
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:07,320
That's so funny.

2539
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,650
(While they have quality time
with Kwang Soo)

2540
01:22:08,650 --> 01:22:10,100
- So that will be the price.
- Yes.

2541
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,320
My goodness.

2542
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,820
- Good idea.
- As long as I avoid the bottom...

2543
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:14,160
- That's right.
- We can win the next game.

2544
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,270
That's right.

2545
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:17,830
- I am running out of money.
- I don't know about that.

2546
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:18,970
I made a sacrifice.

2547
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:22,310
How much are you getting?
You're getting a lot of money.

2548
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,350
Hye Seon, listen.

2549
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,940
I don't know how much money
they are getting, but...

2550
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:30,190
They all get at least 200 dollars.

2551
01:22:30,190 --> 01:22:31,650
(She lies by instinct.)

2552
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:34,410
To be honest, I regretted it before.

2553
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:36,990
You know my nickname
is Yeum Cheater.

2554
01:22:37,730 --> 01:22:39,560
I hesitated earlier.

2555
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:41,750
I'll give you 220 dollars. Good?

2556
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:42,790
I want 225.

2557
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,070
You want 225 dollars?

2558
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:46,070
(She's the first one
to ask for another 5 dollars.)

2559
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:47,470
- Let's make it 220.
- Make it 225.

2560
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,690
- It's 220.
- What about 223?

2561
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,870
(Embarrassed)

2562
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:55,740
(He gives up and signs
with her at 223 dollars.)

2563
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:56,810
- Feeling!
- Intuition!

2564
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:58,980
(Salary: 223 dollars)

2565
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:01,520
- My gosh.
- That's nice.

2566
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:04,240
All right. It's over. Since you won,

2567
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,040
you can trade
one second-string player.

2568
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,250
- But we... Have a seat.
- Okay.

2569
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,560
(He can trade one player he wants.)

2570
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,620
But...

2571
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:13,360
Earlier, I thought...

2572
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:17,430
it would be nice to keep
our team as it was.

2573
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:19,190
But one of you...

2574
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:21,140
went to Tiger Gym...

2575
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:23,500
and checked her salary there.

2576
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,900
- Her salary?
- Really?

2577
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:25,970
- Yes.
- Who?

2578
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:27,240
(Did one of the players go to
Tiger Gym and checked her salary?)

2579
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,310
Her salary?

2580
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:29,940
- I mean...
- It will just break...

2581
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:31,850
- our trust.
- Who was that?

2582
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:44,040
So Min.

2583
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,050
No.

2584
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:47,360
Why did you ask
about your salary there?

2585
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,550
- So Min.
- Did you really do that?

2586
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:51,660
It's not that I asked
about my salary there.

2587
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:55,570
I just checked to see if there was
anyone who wanted to join our team.

2588
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,890
(A little earlier)

2589
01:23:57,890 --> 01:24:00,330
(Sneaking)

2590
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:01,630
I paid them too much.

2591
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:03,330
Do you want to join? No?

2592
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,740
I need to get something from him.

2593
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,170
- Really?
- Why?

2594
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:07,280
Do you want to leave your team?

2595
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,800
No. I'm just asking.

2596
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:10,450
She's funny.

2597
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:12,820
She had one foot in the team.

2598
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:15,540
When she signed
with you earlier, she said...

2599
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,080
we had good teamwork.

2600
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:18,860
She said she realized
what it was like for the first time.

2601
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:20,510
But she was doing that
right before she said that.

2602
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:22,160
- Right. That's what I mean.
- She betrayed us.

2603
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,160
- I can't believe this.
- We all are betrayed.

2604
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,330
You guys know
what I've been through.

2605
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:27,700
I don't have much money,
but I even bought you...

2606
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:28,830
You bought us food.

2607
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:30,420
I even paid for the ice cream.

2608
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:32,870
But three of the ice cream bars
were left over!

2609
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,910
(Trainer Yoo has been
counting everything.)

2610
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:36,960
So Min, come on here.

2611
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,170
Don't remove her.
Don't you have loyalty?

2612
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:39,910
You can't do this.

2613
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,450
- But...
- He has no sense of loyalty.

2614
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:43,280
Just embrace them all.

2615
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,120
Jong Kook, think of this.

2616
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:48,250
This episode will be aired
for two weeks.

2617
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,790
And I've had her the whole time.

2618
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:51,420
(And I've had her the whole time.)

2619
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:54,320
He has good reason.

2620
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,050
- Don't you understand?
- I see.

2621
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,050
He's right.

2622
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,090
- You guys are unbelievable.
- Right.

2623
01:24:59,090 --> 01:25:01,370
Trainer Kook just said...

2624
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:03,700
- Trainer offered me...
- Don't say that.

2625
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:05,590
- Don't say anything.
- What did he say?

2626
01:25:05,790 --> 01:25:07,670
- I understand your point.
- He said he'd take So Min in.

2627
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,300
And he wants me to take Suk Jin.

2628
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:10,330
(He wants me to take Suk Jin in.)

2629
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:13,210
(Me?)

2630
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:15,170
- No.
- Hang on.

2631
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,040
Come here. Hey.

2632
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,250
- If I had to.
- How could you...

2633
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:19,640
If I had to...

2634
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,140
- He's right.
- You're so mean.

2635
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:22,750
Did you take that off?

2636
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,580
I have a pain relief patch
on my neck.

2637
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:26,050
- All right.
- If I had to...

2638
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:27,250
You used me.

2639
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:29,530
It looks like you're wearing
a turtleneck from the back.

2640
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,530
It looks like
you're wearing a turtleneck.

2641
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:34,200
- All right then. Let's do this.
- Do what?

2642
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,090
Send Suk Jin to me
and give me 100 dollars.

2643
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:37,370
(Send Suk Jin to me
and give me 100 dollars.)

2644
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:40,260
You jerks!

2645
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,870
(You jerks!)

2646
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:44,110
You ungrateful idiots!

2647
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:45,240
My goodness.

2648
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,800
- That's funny.
- Why?

2649
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,040
My salary is 0.01 dollars,
and you ask for 100 dollars?

2650
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,140
(My salary is 0.01 dollars,
and you ask for 100 dollars?)

2651
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:52,950
This is really upsetting.

2652
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:55,180
All right then. I have no choice.

2653
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:56,250
I'll go.

2654
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:58,320
- Yeon Koung, what are you doing?
- Why would you do that?

2655
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,050
Kwang Soo, don't be like that.

2656
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:01,720
- Kwang Soo is being weird.
- Hey.

2657
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,050
It's taking too long.

2658
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:04,790
Kwang Soo, think.

2659
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:06,660
- Just make up your mind.
- Kwang Soo.

2660
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,920
- Kwang Soo?
- You have to make up your mind.

2661
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,890
Kwang Soo, we are on the same page.

2662
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:11,890
- Feeling!
- Intuition!

2663
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:12,930
- Cross!
- Cross!

2664
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:14,040
(Again, feeling, intuition, cross.)

2665
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:16,570
- We're on the same page.
- You two are the same.

2666
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:18,300
- All right then.
- Okay.

2667
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:19,630
I'll trade her with Haha.

2668
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:21,450
- Okay.
- I'll trade her with Haha.

2669
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:22,970
(Locust Gym chose Haha
who is a good second-string player.)

2670
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:24,820
- Haha?
- Join us.

2671
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:27,080
- I have no other choice.
- Without a deal?

2672
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:29,680
It's a choice for my team.

2673
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,460
- All right.
- Good.

2674
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,550
(Tiger Gym tells Haha something
at the moment.)

2675
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:35,990
Hey, what are you doing?

2676
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:37,550
We will give you the money.

2677
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:39,250
- Make it even.
- Sixty dollars.

2678
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:40,330
Make it even.

2679
01:26:40,330 --> 01:26:42,170
- Twenty dollars from each.
- Okay.

2680
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:43,720
- You won't lose.
- You'll get 60 dollars.

2681
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,070
We will get you the money.

2682
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:46,130
I'll give him the money.

2683
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:47,290
I'll give you.

2684
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:49,710
Go. All right.

2685
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:51,170
Okay.

2686
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:52,910
- We have to win.
- We must win.

2687
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:54,470
Keep your energy level high.

2688
01:26:54,630 --> 01:26:56,340
- What is this?
- Is this possible?

2689
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:57,640
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

2690
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:58,920
Let's do this. No regrets.

2691
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,140
(Between victory and penalty,)

2692
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:03,540
(they get the last chance.)

2693
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:04,540
I looked like a fool.

2694
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:05,790
(The trainers will decide
the fate of their 3-week salaries.)

2695
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:09,750
(Who will be the loser
and get the humiliating penalty?)

2696
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:12,360
(And...)

2697
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:15,260
(Firenze, Italy)

2698
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:17,530
(What line of business are you in?)

2699
01:27:17,530 --> 01:27:20,390
(I import fashion products
from Italy.)

2700
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:21,670
(How is your diaper business going?)

2701
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:24,500
(It's a meeting of smugglers
who sell fake goods.)

2702
01:27:24,930 --> 01:27:26,710
(And they have
fancy Western dishes?)

2703
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:28,780
(But it's too much.)

2704
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:29,880
(Aren't we getting lunch today?)

2705
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:32,950
(No, you'll get a lot of food.)

2706
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:36,540
(They have to taste and experience
everything to be Italian.)

2707
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:39,960
(The hillbilly members with
rustic tastes are knocked out.)

2708
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:43,750
(The rustic ladies and gentlemen
try to become the bourgeoisie.)

2709
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:49,920
(Did you ever date a celebrity
whom you met on a variety show?)

2710
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:55,330
(I don't want to pay my membership
fee to Jong Kook's soccer club.)

2711
01:27:55,830 --> 01:28:00,430
(I think Running Man is
a long-run show because of me.)

2712
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:01,540
(He was like that at first.)

2713
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:02,800
(Just say that you made it happen.)

2714
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:05,840
(I must say I made it happen.)

2715
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,140
(To Become Italian Ladies and Gentlemen,
Elegant Road of Western Dishes)
