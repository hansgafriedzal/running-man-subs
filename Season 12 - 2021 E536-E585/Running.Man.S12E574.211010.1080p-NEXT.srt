1
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,330
Is it volleyball? That's high.

2
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,770
Why is it so high?

3
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,410
My goodness. It's so high.

4
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,910
- It's too high.
- Are we doing this on water?

5
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,000
On the water?

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Is it possible?

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,080
What is all this?

8
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,270
Can we even spike?

9
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,270
- What's all this?
- The net is too high.

10
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,470
The net is too high.

11
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,840
How would we do this?

12
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,020
That's the ball.

13
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,450
We can't even jump.
We're playing with that ball.

14
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,090
We just need
to send it over the net.

15
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,130
- It's a gym ball.
- With a gym ball?

16
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,130
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

17
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,930
Yeon Koung is known...

18
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,060
to be very spiteful
during the volleyball game.

19
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,830
So we prepared this game
to see her spitefulness today.

20
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,790
It's called Baking Bread on Water.

21
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,800
(The last game of Fierce Transfer Race,
Baking Bread on Water)

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,170
We have two huge mats
floating on the water.

23
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,830
You will play volleyball on them
with a big ball.

24
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,900
Just like the volleyball rules, you
can use your hands, feet, and head.

25
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,940
Drop the ball on your opponent's
side with a maximum of three hits.

26
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,940
Okay.

27
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,320
You may go into the water
to receive the ball.

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,550
- I see.
- We can go into the water.

29
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,750
But you can't wait in the water.

30
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,980
I get it.

31
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,900
- We can only receive it in there.
- Right.

32
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,500
Then we should send the ball
to the water.

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,870
The team that scores 11 points first
wins the game.

34
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,620
And there will be only two rounds.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,470
In Round One,

36
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,890
the first-string players
and the trainers will play.

37
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,900
Okay.

38
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,560
In Round Two, the second-string
players and plus one will play.

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,810
- Okay.
- Let's go.

40
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,930
Let's do this.

41
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,750
- All the first-string players.
- Yeon Koung can't play.

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,840
We have to win this round.
We might lose.

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,080
- We must win.
- Yeon Koung is the second-string.

44
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,980
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go.

45
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,260
- Yeon Koung will be in Round Two.
- We must win this round.

46
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,450
First-string players,
please get ready.

47
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,260
Let's go.

48
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,480
- Good luck.
- Let's do this.

49
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,650
- This is harder than I thought.
- This is hard.

50
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,670
It's hard.

51
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,870
My goodness.

52
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,890
Like this.

53
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,290
- Gosh.
- When the ball comes...

54
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,700
- We have to move.
- Don't fall into the water.

55
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,580
You have to dive into the water
to receive the ball, okay?

56
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,980
We have to win this round.

57
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,900
- We get 1.5 times more.
- We have to win.

58
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,480
We must win this round.

59
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480
Okay.

60
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,370
- Throw it?
- Let's practice.

61
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,080
- This is a practice.
- Practice.

62
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,180
This is not easy.

63
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,560
(With their powerful
passion and energy...)

64
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,620
(shown in Tokyo this summer,)

65
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,760
(the volleyball players
advanced to the semi-finals.)

66
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,890
they are showing
the perfect defense.

67
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,990
(With their amazing performance
recognized by the world,)

68
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,860
(they advanced to the semi-finals.)

69
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,080
(The national volleyball team
touched the people's hearts.)

70
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,670
(How will they play
the variety volleyball then?)

71
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,420
- It's not easy.
- My gosh.

72
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,380
- It's flying.
- No.

73
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,790
What?

74
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,480
- My gosh.
- No.

75
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,390
(She falls into the water.)

76
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,020
- It's done.
- Hye Seon, are you all right?

77
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,660
(Humiliated)

78
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,890
(The slapstick comedy starts
with the national setter.)

79
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,360
That's it. That's what we should do.

80
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,020
- Okay.
- This is difficult.

81
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,730
Toss the ball.

82
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,990
- Send it over.
- Good.

83
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,040
Receive the ball.

84
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,910
(What?)

85
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,940
Receive the ball.

86
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,980
- What was that?
- Gosh.

87
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,410
This is a mess.

88
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,740
- What was that?
- Isn't it that you're faking it?

89
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,350
This isn't easy.

90
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,390
What happened?

91
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,980
- What's wrong?
- My goodness.

92
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,260
Hye Seon, what happened?

93
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,860
Why did you fall down?

94
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,190
The first-string players
are different.

95
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,920
- They don't spare themselves.
- We just need to send it over.

96
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,550
Let's begin then.

97
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,890
Let's go.

98
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,890
Let's give it a try.

99
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,200
This is the beginning.

100
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,890
- But this is...
- Stay focused.

101
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,570
- This isn't easy.
- Let's do this.

102
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,860
- Go.
- I'll receive the ball.

103
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,960
(The game starts.)

104
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,540
- I'll receive the ball.
- I will.

105
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,380
- Slow down.
- It's behind you.

106
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,170
- Done.
- Slow down.

107
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,670
- Good.
- Send it over.

108
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,270
My goodness.

109
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,110
(Eun Jin falls into the water
trying to touch the ball.)

110
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,110
- Use one hand.
- Hey.

111
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,010
- Keep it low.
- It should be low.

112
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,980
- Just send it over.
- We should do that.

113
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,010
- This is slippery.
- Right.

114
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,480
Make sure to keep it low.

115
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,690
Make sure to use both hands.

116
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,360
- I just can't do this.
- Use both hands.

117
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,600
What's wrong with you guys?

118
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,860
- Yes.
- It's done.

119
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,130
- We did it.
- Well done.

120
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,460
Hey, we must win this match.

121
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,490
Here it goes.

122
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,990
(Air So Young's service)

123
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,230
- Well done.
- Nice.

124
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,230
Send it up high.

125
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,460
- Don't push it hard.
- Good.

126
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,110
- Mine.
- That was good.

127
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,110
- Good.
- One at a time.

128
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,240
- One at a time.
- Spike.

129
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,640
(The ball is coming to Ji Young.)

130
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,980
(Libero Oh Ji Young is number one
in the dig ranking.)

131
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,080
(She doesn't spare herself
when the ball comes toward her.)

132
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,080
- Spike. Oh no.
- Nice.

133
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,080
(She throws herself
to save the ball.)

134
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,150
Well done. You did a great job.

135
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,890
- Send it over.
- Well done.

136
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,500
Save the ball.

137
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,720
You have to send it over.

138
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,800
No. Send it over.

139
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,200
- Gosh.
- You lost.

140
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,940
- We won.
- Yes!

141
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,100
We lost?

142
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,570
We did it again.

143
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,900
It's not going over.

144
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,080
- They did a good job.
- It's okay.

145
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,810
What's wrong with you?

146
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,340
Min A, what are you doing?

147
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,180
- Hye Jin.
- Hey.

148
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,380
We should stay focused.

149
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,770
- Focus.
- Did I save the ball?

150
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,890
You did.

151
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,250
You even send it over the net.

152
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,890
- It's 2 to 0.
- It's 2 to 0.

153
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,280
- They're good.
- Good.

154
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,720
- That's great.
- Mine.

155
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,990
- Mine.
- It's coming.

156
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,090
Good. Send it over.

157
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,760
- Ji Young.
- Okay.

158
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,570
(Ji Young!)

159
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,500
(Ji Young falls into the water
without touching the ball.)

160
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,160
(Locust Gym finally
scores the first point.)

161
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,600
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

162
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,830
- Done.
- You guys are so bad.

163
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,400
- Well done.
- It's okay.

164
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,580
- Ji Young.
- It was so...

165
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,450
- Ji Young.
- It's okay.

166
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,840
- Switch places with me.
- Okay.

167
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,410
- Just send it over.
- You do it.

168
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,750
- Okay.
- We can do this.

169
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,250
- I keep falling into the water.
- Sorry.

170
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,650
- I'll begin.
- Focus.

171
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,780
Make it high.

172
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,150
Don't try too hard. My gosh.

173
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,690
All right. Send it over.

174
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,330
- Here it goes.
- Nice.

175
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,150
- Nice.
- It's short.

176
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,390
- Mine.
- It's over the net.

177
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,500
- It's done.
- It's over the net.

178
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,200
(Groaning)

179
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,960
- She fell.
- Hye Jin.

180
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,100
(Staggering)

181
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,810
(That's to Hye Jin's mistake,
they scored 1 point.)

182
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,770
We have to focus.

183
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,080
You should send it up high.

184
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,270
This is frustrating.

185
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,990
- I'll serve.
- All right.

186
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,550
- Okay.
- There it goes.

187
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,760
- Here.
- Send it over.

188
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,190
- Good.
- You can also pass the ball.

189
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,350
(They groan as they touch
the heavy ball.)

190
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,430
Pass.

191
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,450
- My gosh.
- Send it over.

192
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,870
- Receive the ball.
- Ji Young.

193
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,090
How would I do that?

194
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,760
(Splashing)

195
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,800
Ji Young.

196
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
How would I do that?

197
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,310
How would I receive it?

198
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,770
How...

199
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,140
Why do you keep
letting me do things like this?

200
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,880
I thought she'd do it.

201
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,310
(Teddy Bear keeps calling
Ji Young's name without moving.)

202
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,750
She doesn't want
to go into the water.

203
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,690
- Why do I have to do this?
- I'll stand at the back.

204
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,950
I'll be at the back.

205
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,010
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

206
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,890
Good.

207
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,190
- Good luck.
- All right.

208
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,220
You keep letting me
go into the water.

209
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,560
You're the star of the day.

210
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,960
- Here I go.
- Send it to Trainer Kook.

211
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,070
(Jae Suk serves as he hopes
to score one more point.)

212
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,300
- It's flying over.
- Good.

213
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,330
Get the ball.

214
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,500
Okay.

215
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,740
(Groaning)

216
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,200
(While Hee Jin hesitates,)

217
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,380
(our libero throws herself again.)

218
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,750
- Nice.
- One, two, three. Yes!

219
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,510
- Nice.
- Ji Young's slapstick comedy.

220
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,120
Hang on.

221
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,340
Why aren't you
getting into the water?

222
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,510
(Teddy Bear survived alone
on the mat again.)

223
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,950
- Why aren't you going into the water?
- Ji Young.

224
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,190
Look.

225
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,930
- She's all dry.
- She's not throwing herself.

226
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,350
- Is she dry?
- She's still dry.

227
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,960
- Dry
- Dry

228
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,700
- I'll go home dry today
- I'll go home dry today

229
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Why aren't you following the ball?

230
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,260
Let's do this.

231
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,010
I'll follow the ball this time.

232
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,160
Here it goes.

233
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,270
Good. Here comes Min A.

234
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,470
Min A, let's do this.

235
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,340
Get the ball.

236
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,880
- It's out.
- Out.

237
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,970
- Out.
- Out.

238
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,050
(Is the ball out?)

239
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,050
- It's out.
- Out.

240
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,580
- The ball is out.
- They touched the ball.

241
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,260
They touched the ball.

242
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,630
- They touched the ball.
- Touch.

243
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,520
- They didn't touch it.
- The ball wasn't touched.

244
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,300
It was. Didn't you touch the ball?

245
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,720
- We didn't.
- We didn't.

246
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,800
No one says they touched the ball.

247
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,590
- They always say no.
- They all are liars.

248
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,940
They lie every time.

249
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,330
Here it goes.

250
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,100
All right. Let's do this.
We must win.

251
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,310
Ji Young, jump.

252
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,100
- Ji Young.
- You should wait.

253
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,400
Now.

254
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,880
It's coming back.

255
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,140
I'll do it.

256
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,250
Mine.

257
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,710
Is it out?

258
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,970
(What?)

259
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,410
Mine.

260
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,120
(She sends the ball
to the water proudly.)

261
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,580
You should send it over the net.

262
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,130
You're doing this to me
on purpose, aren't you?

263
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,830
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

264
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,390
- Good.
- It's a foul.

265
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,090
- Good.
- Welcome

266
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,720
- to the locust world
- To the locust world

267
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,260
Welcome

268
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,000
- to the locust world
- To the locust world

269
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,260
(The ace player, Eun Jin's serve)

270
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,440
Good.

271
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,400
That was nice.

272
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,580
Send it over.

273
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,880
- Okay.
- You should wait.

274
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,310
- One and two.
- Gosh.

275
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,600
- Okay. It's done.
- Done.

276
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,080
Good.

277
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,520
It's out.

278
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,950
- No.
- Hurry.

279
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,320
Send it over.

280
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,380
No.

281
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,790
(What?)

282
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,320
No.

283
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,880
She did it on purpose.

284
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,430
- Nice.
- It's our ball.

285
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,090
(Yeum Cheater's jump
stopped their upturn.)

286
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,090
- Ji Young is really good.
- Give us the ball.

287
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,570
She's amazing.

288
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,990
It's short.

289
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,700
- Good.
- Well done.

290
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,810
Wait a little more.

291
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,410
- One.
- My gosh.

292
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,970
(So Young received the ball.)

293
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,500
- Toss it over the net.
- Send it over.

294
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,500
- Toss it over the net.
- Send it over.

295
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,240
- Send it over.
- You have to toss it over.

296
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,850
- My goodness.
- Gosh, Hye Seon.

297
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,520
You have to toss it over.

298
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,220
- My goodness.
- Gosh, Hye Seon.

299
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,330
- Gosh. Hye Seon.
- Hye Seon.

300
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,330
Yeum Cheater.

301
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,700
- We did it.
- We scored.

302
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,220
Yeum Cheater is strange.

303
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,040
She doesn't know the timing.

304
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,270
Hye Seon, stand at the back.

305
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,310
- Should I stand in the front?
- Yes, you should.

306
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,630
(They stand in a new formation.)

307
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,730
Hye Seon.

308
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,370
You shouldn't think of it
as a real volleyball game.

309
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,700
- You should wait.
- You give it a try.

310
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,340
(You give it a try.)

311
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,550
I'll play soon.

312
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,020
- Good luck.
- Okay.

313
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,550
Mine.

314
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,160
- Good.
- That was nice.

315
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,920
- Turn around.
- You do it.

316
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,350
Touch it gently. Done.

317
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,560
- Send it to the back.
- Toss it over.

318
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,250
- Okay.
- Hurry.

319
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,560
(The ball is over the net.)

320
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,850
Hurry.

321
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,030
- Hye Seon.
- Get the ball.

322
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,200
One and two.

323
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,800
(Determined)

324
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,730
(Gurgling)

325
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,040
Hye Seon.

326
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,470
Gosh, Hye Seon.

327
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,910
How many times was that?

328
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,450
- Gosh, Hye Seon is...
- Yeum Cheater.

329
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,610
Gosh, Yeum Cheater.

330
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,110
- Yeum Cheater.
- Hye Seon.

331
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,320
You're the highest-paid player here.

332
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,690
(She's ruining the game
after getting the highest salary.)

333
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,380
- The highest-paid player?
- We have to win no matter what.

334
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,220
We should never lose.

335
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,350
We must win.

336
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,250
Let's give it a try. Let's do this.

337
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,990
- I'll serve.
- All right.

338
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,700
Send it to Yeum Cheater.

339
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,700
- Focus.
- Score at once.

340
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,910
- You have two points left.
- You're doing a good job.

341
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,460
The ball is coming.

342
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,230
- Good
- Gosh.

343
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,240
(Trainer Yoo almost ruined it,
but Eun Jin saved the ball.)

344
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,650
Trainer Yoo, go to the back.

345
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,710
Trainer Yoo.

346
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,740
Mine.

347
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,520
- One more.
- Send it over.

348
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,610
Jump.

349
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,880
- You should wait.
- My gosh.

350
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,240
- Here it goes.
- You do it.

351
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,610
It's over the net.

352
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,060
- Mine.
- Jump.

353
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,480
Yes.

354
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,580
Jump.

355
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,330
(So Young falls into the water
without touching the ball.)

356
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,950
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

357
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,590
Good.

358
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,960
- Okay.
- So Young.

359
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,860
- Nice.
- Okay.

360
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,500
(Is she going to Locust Gym?)

361
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,940
This isn't your team.

362
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,200
(This isn't your team.)

363
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,700
This isn't your team.

364
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,780
(She goes to the wrong team
and gets kicked out.)

365
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,910
- This isn't your team.
- Come here, So Young.

366
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,710
- Come here.
- That's not your team.

367
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,110
Pull yourself together. It's here.

368
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,340
Come here.

369
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,080
- Well done.
- We have one point left.

370
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,210
Locust world!

371
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,980
Set point.

372
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,980
- I'll serve.
- Only one point.

373
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,450
- Let's do this.
- Score one more point.

374
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,300
Hey, we have to win.

375
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,560
- We need only one point.
- One point.

376
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,070
- Good luck.
- I'll serve.

377
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,530
It's one point.

378
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,170
(Eun Jin's stable serve)

379
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,570
Mine.

380
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,700
- Hey, you have to jump.
- Okay.

381
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,970
- Good.
- Get the ball.

382
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,470
- Eun Jin, come on up.
- Send it over.

383
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,730
- Hey.
- Mine.

384
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,240
- That was amazing.
- Good timing.

385
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,780
- Go to your place.
- Okay.

386
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,820
From the back.

387
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,520
- Okay. Good.
- Mine.

388
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,950
- One more time.
- Jump.

389
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,350
- Okay!
- Yes!

390
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,820
(Again...)

391
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,720
(Hee Jin tosses the ball.)

392
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,160
(She finishes the game
jumping into the water.)

393
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,030
- Okay!
- We won!

394
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,270
That was great.

395
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,570
- Yes!
- Well done.

396
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,310
Nice.

397
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,810
- Yes.
- Well done.

398
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,630
(In Round 2...)

399
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,970
- Get the ball.
- Mine.

400
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,810
Toss the ball, Suk Jin.

401
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,240
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

402
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,240
You should've jumped
toward the ball.

403
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,450
(They get excited
as the game goes well.)

404
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,580
This is so nice. I'm excited.

405
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,690
- Mine.
- Yeon Koung.

406
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,790
Good.

407
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,330
- Ji Hyo. Push the ball.
- Push it.

408
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,250
(Yeon Koung's receive
and Ji Hyo's mistake)

409
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,070
(They celebrate it
with silly dance moves.)

410
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,090
You have to go into the water.

411
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,670
Good.

412
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,310
Hey.

413
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,440
(Thanks to Jong Kook's mistake,
Team Locust wins Round 2.)

414
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,940
Trainer Yoo gets 700 dollars.

415
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,310
(700 dollars for Trainer Yoo)

416
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,810
And Trainer Kook gets 400 dollars.

417
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,550
The trainers can...

418
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,210
distribute the last salary...

419
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,880
- as they please.
- Okay.

420
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,240
Please write it down.

421
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,250
- Oh, dear.
- Gosh, this is...

422
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,610
This is difficult.

423
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,160
Don't worry. I know...

424
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,700
you guys tried hard.

425
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,120
- Okay. Don't worry.
- I'll make it fair.

426
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,330
Don't worry.

427
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,700
(How would the fierce
three-week-long race end?)

428
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,960
Okay.

429
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,170
So this will be aired
for four weeks?

430
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,360
(The volleyball players
made 3 episodes with 1 shoot.)

431
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,040
It feels like I've spent
three days with them.

432
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,000
- We've become close.
- I feel comfortable around them.

433
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll announce the prize
and penalty for today.

434
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

435
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,580
The prize is...

436
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,550
for the health
of our precious players.

437
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,020
It's a Korean beef set.

438
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,520
(The prize is a Korean beef set.)

439
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,080
- What about the penalty?
- The penalty is...

440
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,400
- Five of you will get the penalty.
- Yes.

441
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,900
The trainer with less money,

442
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,900
two players
with the least amount of money,

443
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,490
and another two players
picked by them.

444
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,540
(1 trainer, 2 players with the least
money, and another 2 picked by them)

445
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,680
- And two of them will survive.
- Okay.

446
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,000
The three people will be...

447
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,910
bombarded with whipped cream.

448
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,680
We haven't done it for a long time.

449
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,780
(They will have to shower
before going home.)

450
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,970
- Your face...
- It's been a long time.

451
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,210
will smell like cake all day.

452
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,580
- All day.
- It'd feel like your birthday.

453
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,250
That's too bad.

454
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,720
I'll announce the result
of the trainers first.

455
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,160
- Trainer Yoo has...
- He's our trainer.

456
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,360
Trainer Yoo has...

457
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,990
(How much money
does Trainer Yoo have?)

458
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,770
- 780 dollars.
- Gosh, that's a lot.

459
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,040
- It's unbelievable.
- I can't believe this.

460
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,170
- Is it 780 dollars?
- Hang on.

461
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,700
- He has 780 dollars?
- Is it that much?

462
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,730
- How could it be 780 dollars?
- That's a lot.

463
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,000
- What?
- He has 780 dollars?

464
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,370
- He has 780 dollars.
- Is it that much?

465
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,340
- He has 780 dollars?
- Is it that much?

466
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,550
Trainer Kook has 110 dollars.

467
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,150
- What?
- So he will get the penalty.

468
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,450
(Trainer Kook will get the penalty.)

469
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,210
- What?
- He has 780 dollars?

470
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,160
- How much does he have?
- He has only 110 dollars.

471
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,350
He'll get the penalty.

472
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,220
- Is it 780 dollars?
- That's unfair.

473
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,160
I didn't know I had that much money.

474
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,570
Why do I have so much money?

475
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,200
- The difference is 600 dollars.
- I guess he won first place.

476
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,670
He has 780 dollars.

477
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,860
That means you all can win.

478
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,460
One of you might win first place.

479
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,680
It's fine as long
as our team wins first place.

480
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,680
- Yeum Cheater.
- It's a shame.

481
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,310
This is real cheating.

482
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,970
- Stabbing someone in the back.
- I see.

483
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,550
The result came out.

484
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,610
Let's find out.

485
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,550
- Starting with the bottom place?
- Our team has a better chance.

486
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,650
Was it neck and neck?

487
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,880
Yes, it was neck and neck.

488
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,560
- I hope the winner is on our team.
- The winner?

489
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,720
- I'm sure it's our team member.
- Please.

490
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,980
- We'll start with 1st place.
- The 2nd place...

491
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,990
The person in first place...

492
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,990
(The winner will be revealed first.)

493
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,330
who will be exempt from the penalty
and receive the prize...

494
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,220
got 683 dollars.

495
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,430
- The winner is Yeum Hye Seon.
- Okay.

496
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,990
(The winner is Yeum Hye Seon.
who got 683 dollars.)

497
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,570
- Okay. That's great.
- Everyone, gather around.

498
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,200
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

499
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,440
- See? I told you so.
- Nice.

500
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,580
The person in second place...

501
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,810
who got 570 dollars is Kim Hee Jin.

502
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,020
(Kim Hee Jin with 570 dollars)

503
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,110
- I thought it'd be Yeon Koung.
- This is good.

504
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,610
- It's great.
- The second place is on our team.

505
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,710
- Good. We won the silver medal.
- Good job.

506
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,210
- Gosh, you.
- It's okay.

507
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,430
- Gosh. I'm sorry.
- I can't believe you took it all.

508
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,620
He took all the money.

509
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,720
- And there's...
- I'm sorry.

510
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,530
only a 20-dollar difference
between the 3rd and 4th places.

511
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,090
- Oh, my gosh.
- No way.

512
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,460
- It's you, Yeon Koung.
- If not, we'd be disappointed.

513
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,070
- I'm sure it's Yeon Koung.
- I really hope it's on our team.

514
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,200
- Please.
- I hope it's on our team.

515
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,230
- She has a chance too.
- Who is in third place?

516
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,330
- Let it be on our team.
- I hope so.

517
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,410
I wonder who is in third place.

518
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,270
The person in 3rd place
with 540 dollars...

519
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,540
- It must be Yeon Koung.
- who will get the prize...

520
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,630
It must be Yeon Koung.

521
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,810
and will be exempt
from the penalty...

522
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,610
is Lee So Young.

523
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,450
(Lee So Young with 540 dollars is
in 3rd place.)

524
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,650
- Good job.
- Lee So Young.

525
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,880
Don't be angry.

526
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,520
- You did great.
- I told you...

527
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,060
- You should've given her more.
- Great.

528
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,250
- I didn't know I had so much left.
- What's with your trainer?

529
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,490
- Trust me. I didn't know...
- You should complain to him.

530
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,800
- I didn't know I had so much left.
- This is the worst situation.

531
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,200
- You said you'd pay us well.
- I'm not lying...

532
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,270
- Come on, Yeon Koung.
- He's so greedy.

533
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,590
- Yeon Koung, trust me.
- I was wrong about you.

534
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,200
The person in 4th place
with 520 dollars is Kim Yeon Koung.

535
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,910
- That was close.
- Oh, boy.

536
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,810
Listen, Yeon Koung.
I gave you 200 dollars...

537
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,000
I came in fourth place again?

538
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,700
I'm in fourth place again?

539
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,970
Not again.

540
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:14,970
(Trainer Yoo reminded her of
the disappointment of the Olympics.)

541
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,020
- Everyone...
- The 2 people tied for 5th place...

542
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,970
are Oh Ji Young and Ahn Hye Jin.
They both got 490 dollars.

543
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,210
The person in 7th place
with 310 dollars is Park Eun Jin.

544
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,820
And Ji Hyo came in eighth place.

545
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,210
Suk Jin came in 9th place
with 230 dollars and 1 cent.

546
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,790
(The people in 11th and 12th places
will get the penalty.)

547
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,650
- See? I knew it.
- My gosh.

548
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,190
- I can't believe this.
- I guess it's me.

549
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,620
- No, I think it'll be me.
- Wait.

550
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,830
- I'm sure it's me.
- No, it's me.

551
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,500
- Those two will get the penalty.
- You crook!

552
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,690
- Never trust this crook.
- I told you...

553
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,740
- that 100 dollars wouldn't cut it.
- Exactly.

554
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,400
- I paid you equally as I promised.
- How much?

555
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,510
I gave you 200 dollars each
at the end.

556
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,600
- That's awesome.
- Oh, my.

557
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,170
- That was it for us.
- I said he'd pay more money.

558
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,280
The remaining players are
So Min, Haha, and Se Chan.

559
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,310
(The 3 remaining players are
So Min, Haha, and Se Chan.)

560
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,440
The one who came in 10th place
with only a 10-dollar difference...

561
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,490
- Who is it?
- Please.

562
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,580
- I think it's So Min.
- Please.

563
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,610
- We're in trouble.
- I bowed to him.

564
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,650
(Which of these 3 will survive?)

565
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,290
It's So Min who got
146 dollars and 99 cents.

566
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,800
(It's So Min!)

567
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,800
(The team members are happy
for So Min.)

568
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,160
- You're not in the bottom two.
- I'm so happy for you.

569
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,860
- I'm so excited.
- We won.

570
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,310
- We made it.
- Oh, yes.

571
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,510
It's So Min.

572
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,430
(Se Chan and Haha
will get the penalty.)

573
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,670
If I hadn't given them
five dollars...

574
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,940
- I mean...
- You thief!

575
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,520
- How could you?
- Come with me.

576
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,750
- Go ahead.
- Gosh, you.

577
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,140
- I'm disappointed.
- I'm sorry, guys.

578
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
- Throw him in the water.
- I apologize.

579
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,750
I'm sorry.

580
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,840
(He apologized too late.)

581
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,490
(Punished on the spot)

582
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,610
That darn...

583
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,180
Hey.

584
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,190
- That darn locust.
- I'm sorry.

585
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,230
I can't believe
I let that locust fool me.

586
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,230
(In 11th place, Haha, 135 dollars,
In 12th place, Se Chan, 127 dollars)

587
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,830
- What if I kept five dollars?
- He got 780 dollars.

588
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,630
That's the thing
about the world of professionals.

589
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,900
It's tough to survive
in the world of professionals.

590
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,930
(So Min avoided the penalty
thanks to the stingy Trainer Yoo.)

591
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,170
- Congratulations.
- She's safe now.

592
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,310
- We did a great job.
- Now...

593
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,110
The 2 of you can choose 2 players
to get the penalty...

594
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,020
except for the top three players
and Jae Suk.

595
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,750
- We can discuss and choose them?
- Yes.

596
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,060
You guys acted up when our rankings
were revealed, but you're quiet now.

597
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,180
(Everyone is standing politely
with their hands together.)

598
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,960
Choose two players
on the other team.

599
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,620
- We'll do that.
- By the way...

600
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,530
Didn't you promise
you'd give me 20 dollars?

601
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,620
You mean our team?

602
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,330
- You mean our team?
- But you left our team.

603
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,330
- True.
- It's not like I had a choice.

604
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,040
- You moved to that team gladly.
- You did your best to win.

605
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,810
- Really? Fine. Watch your tone.
- I mean you were so excited...

606
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,310
- It's okay. You can't choose them.
- We're safe.

607
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,430
- We don't care.
- They're okay.

608
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,900
- We don't care.
- Try all you want.

609
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,240
- They're in 2nd and 3rd place.
- Go ahead.

610
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,750
- We're in 2nd and 3rd place.
- Oh, I see.

611
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,370
- Oh, that's right.
- They're safe.

612
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,480
We can't choose them.

613
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,980
- You see, I...
- Go ahead.

614
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,250
I wish the 2nd and 3rd place were
on our team.

615
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,790
- I know.
- It's okay.

616
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,460
- Okay. We'll choose one first.
- Okay. Go ahead.

617
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,790
- We agreed to choose this person.
- Yes, we did.

618
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,530
- The first one is... One, two...
- Two, three.

619
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,070
- Kim Yeon Koung.
- Kim Yeon Koung.

620
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,380
Gosh, seriously.

621
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,810
- Here's why. The one to get...
- The one to get...

622
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,400
- a penalty is always Lee Kwang Soo.
- a penalty is always Lee Kwang Soo.

623
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,580
(The one to get a penalty is
always Lee Kwang Soo.)

624
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,580
- Feeling! Cross!
- Intuition! Cross!

625
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,980
- Oh, gosh. Not Yeon Koung.
- We chose Yeon Koung.

626
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,520
Why would you...
What's wrong with our team?

627
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,360
- I said I would move to that team.
- She's a second-string player.

628
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,560
- Exactly.
- She's a second-string player.

629
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,860
Kwang Soo, you're lucky...

630
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,650
- when it comes to a penalty.
- Why would you call me that?

631
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,600
- You're Kwang Soo.
- Oh, no. I feel bad for her.

632
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,220
Gosh. This is driving me nuts.

633
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,630
I think she did a good job.

634
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,100
- I'm on the same team as you.
- You should choose from that team.

635
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,960
- Right. I don't see Ji Young.
- Actually...

636
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,770
- Hide behind us.
- Where did Ji Young go?

637
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,700
- Ji Young, can you step forward?
- I don't see her.

638
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,580
- Ji Young.
- The amazing Ji Young.

639
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,700
- The amazing, awesome Ji Young.
- She left.

640
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,810
- She left early.
- Come out.

641
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,880
- She didn't feel well.
- She went home.

642
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,410
- Ji Young went home.
- Really? Shall we call her...

643
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,710
- to see if she comes out or not?
- Okay.

644
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,740
Let's try calling her.
If she left, she wouldn't come out.

645
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,910
- But if she's still here...
- You promised you'd help me out.

646
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,320
- She's here.
- Really?

647
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,790
- That's good.
- All right.

648
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,330
One, two, three.

649
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,890
- The amazing and awesome...
- The amazing and awesome...

650
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,490
- Oh Ji Young!
- Okay.

651
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,390
(Ji Young will get the penalty too.)

652
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,420
We're safe.

653
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,490
- I'm the only one on our team.
- There will be a draw.

654
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,840
But we'll draw lots
to choose who will be exempt.

655
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,340
- We'll give the winners the prizes.
- Why did you choose me?

656
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,870
You can pick the good one.

657
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,840
- If I don't get lucky...
- You can avoid it.

658
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,340
Let's all step forward now.

659
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,350
We'll give you 5 files.
Choose 1 without looking.

660
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,080
- Will you put them on the table?
- Yes.

661
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,550
- We'll put them on the table.
- That's unnecessary. Just pick one.

662
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,120
- Which one should I pick?
- Should we pick ourselves? Gosh.

663
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,390
- You should get a blank one.
- Just pick one.

664
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,090
It's going to be... I mean...

665
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,360
You shouldn't look inside.

666
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,620
Which one should I choose?

667
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,920
Don't look inside.

668
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,130
(Taking one)

669
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,450
- Each of you can take one.
- Pick something else.

670
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,600
- I pick number three.
- What should be in there?

671
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,690
What's wrong with you?

672
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,150
- Pick something else.
- I pick number three.

673
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,420
What's wrong with you?

674
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,370
- Let me have number three.
- What should I check?

675
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,960
- All right.
- It must've been written inside.

676
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,390
- Don't look just yet.
- Don't look.

677
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,140
- No, what's written inside?
- Does anyone want to trade with me?

678
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,610
- No, I won't trade with you.
- I don't know.

679
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,280
- "Penalty" is written in three.
- I won't trade with you.

680
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,350
- Let's start with Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook will go first.

681
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,880
One, two, three.

682
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,020
(What could be Trainer Kook's fate?)

683
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,060
One, two, three.

684
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,250
- "Penalty".
- You'll get a penalty.

685
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,790
- Nice.
- Okay.

686
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,860
Variety show deity.

687
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,330
(Jong Kook ended up going broke
and getting the penalty.)

688
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,450
- Please help me.
- Please.

689
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,030
- You have a chance.
- Yes, we do.

690
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,270
- Please help me just this once.
- I'm worried.

691
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,920
- Just this once.
- I hope I get lucky this time.

692
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,460
- You'll get a penalty.
- Okay.

693
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,140
(Ji Young will get a penalty.)

694
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,540
My gosh. Unbelievable.

695
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,780
(Variety show deity,
please help me!)

696
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,110
- The amazing and awesome Ji Young.
- Ji Young.

697
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,580
Our team made it.

698
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,940
- Our team won.
- Let's check them at the same time.

699
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,550
- Please.
- Only one of you will be chosen.

700
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,780
- Please.
- Just one.

701
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,210
- This is hard to believe.
- Only one of them.

702
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,210
- Don't look.
- Please.

703
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,150
- Two of you will avoid it.
- Please help me just this once.

704
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,750
It'd be the worst
if the two of you avoided it.

705
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,330
That would be the funniest.

706
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,360
- Please help me.
- One.

707
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,560
(Will the 2 guys avoid the penalty
when they're the bottom 2?)

708
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,690
Two.

709
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,860
(Will the 2 guys avoid the penalty
when they're the bottom 2?)

710
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,720
(Or will Long Legs get lucky
and avoid the penalty?)

711
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,830
- Three.
- Here.

712
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,140
(Yeon Koung will get the penalty.)

713
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,370
Oh, no.

714
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,270
(The variety show deity has spoken.)

715
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,000
- I really didn't know. I swear.
- Darn it.

716
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,550
I hate you.

717
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,780
- You took it from me.
- Shut it.

718
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,880
Leave me alone.

719
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,440
- What is this?
- I was so surprised.

720
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,850
- I really didn't know. I swear.
- You took it from me.

721
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,020
- I swear. I didn't know.
- This is ridiculous.

722
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,120
Hey, Yeon Koung sure is
just like Kwang Soo.

723
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,150
(She's even unlucky
just like Kwang Soo.)

724
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,620
- This is crazy.
- Hey, Yeon Koung.

725
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,030
- One, two, three. Yes!
- Yes!

726
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,150
- This is hilarious.
- One, two, three. Yes!

727
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,650
- See?
- This is unbelievable.

728
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,890
- I said our team would be safe.
- Oh, my. I'm so surprised.

729
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,490
- The volleyball players...
- Please stand in the middle.

730
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,730
- joined us on the show today.
- Yes.

731
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,730
We had a blast.
Let's give them a hand.

732
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,970
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

733
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,040
(Thank you for your appearance,
national volleyball team players.)

734
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,080
- I hope to see you all again...
- No matter what.

735
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,320
- after the season is over.
- Yes.

736
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,380
- All of you should come back.
- Yes.

737
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,140
It's time for the penalty now.

738
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,520
- Trainer Kook and...
- Gosh, I really don't like this.

739
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,020
Yeon Koung is glaring at us.

740
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,360
- Does it shoot the cream like this?
- Yes.

741
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,680
Is the blast strong?

742
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,150
- No, it's not that strong.
- I'm scared.

743
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,330
- It won't hurt. Trust me.
- Don't worry.

744
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,420
- It won't hurt at all.
- It's just cream.

745
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,450
Ready. One.

746
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,270
Two.

747
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,890
(The two oldest players wait
to get the penalty.)

748
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,960
Three.

749
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,870
She got hit properly.

750
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,160
(The other two didn't get hit
straight on their faces.)

751
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,840
- Ji Young got hit properly.
- That's how you all should look.

752
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,280
- That's perfect.
- My gosh.

753
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,110
Don't touch your face.

754
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,970
- Don't touch it.
- You'll get a close-up shot.

755
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,140
Who wants to take a picture
with her?

756
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,520
- Me.
- Ji Young.

757
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,480
- You look perfect. It's great.
- Take a picture with her.

758
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,140
Yeon Koung looks so cute.

759
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,020
- Yeon Koung looks so cute.
- One, two, three.

760
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,180
Nice.

761
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,220
(We thank the volleyball players
for giving us all a good laugh.)

762
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,330
- Good job, everyone.
- Thank you.

763
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,560
You look so cute.

764
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,390
(So the 3-week journey ended.)

765
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,690
(Firenze, Italy)

766
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,600
(The area still has the beautiful
atmosphere of the Renaissance.)

767
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,770
(Firenze, S restaurant
in Jamwon-dong near the Han River)

768
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,230
(An important business meeting
will be held here today.)

769
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,470
- Oh, my.
- It's European style.

770
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,280
- It's nice.
- Are we having a party today?

771
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,280
- I see Mount Nam and the Han River.
- It's pretty.

772
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,740
- You eat here all the time, right?
- This is really nice.

773
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,350
- Suk Jin is not wearing pants.
- By the way...

774
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,390
Why are you wearing your shorts
like that?

775
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,360
- Suk Jin, what are you wearing?
- What do you mean by that?

776
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,420
- Attack!
- Na Eun...

777
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,360
Na Eun looks like this
with her diapers under her shorts.

778
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,250
- She looks chubby like you do.
- It's the diaper look.

779
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,270
- Gosh. I don't know.
- The front part is bulging.

780
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,600
- What?
- Why is it bulging so much?

781
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,930
- It's bulging.
- Like I said,

782
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,270
that's how Na Eun looks
when she wears shorts...

783
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,270
- over her diaper.
- Did you put something in there?

784
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,460
- It's designed this way.
- Did you put something in there?

785
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,040
- Why did you add padding there?
- It's for next year's...

786
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,640
spring-summer season fashion week.

787
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,380
Then why do you seem so eager
to sit down?

788
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,400
Because this is my boat.

789
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,880
This is my boat.

790
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,140
He says it's his boat.

791
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,470
(Grabbing the air)

792
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,390
- Why didn't you fall for it?
- That's an old trick.

793
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,790
- It's such an old trick.
- What a shame.

794
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,590
- Here you go.
- By the way,

795
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,560
I have to tell you about So Min
before we begin.

796
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,650
- Exactly.
- What happened?

797
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,390
- I heard that she couldn't come.
- Actually,

798
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,490
She won't come today?

799
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,570
someone on the set
of her drama was diagnosed...

800
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,800
- with COVID-19 last week.
- Oh, no.

801
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,930
The epidemiological investigation
is being carried out.

802
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,930
- I see.
- She doesn't know...

803
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,840
if she has to go into quarantine...

804
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,730
- Or if she can come out?
- or if she's fine.

805
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,540
- At the moment, So Min is...
- She's on standby.

806
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,310
waiting for the result at home
while sighing.

807
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,620
- In fact, we all came here.
- By the way...

808
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,550
- But we're not in great condition.
- True.

809
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,020
Everyone besides me
is not feeling so well.

810
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,050
- We're enduring it.
- He...

811
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,950
- He got a shot.
- Se Chan...

812
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,320
- Grape juice.
- isn't feeling well...

813
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
Oh, right.

814
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,420
- He got his vaccine shot.
- That's right.

815
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,950
- I'm feeling hazy.
- Gosh, you're so weak.

816
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,390
Hey, Se Chan already chose
this seat.

817
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,960
- I called dibs on this seat.
- What is wrong with you?

818
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,070
That's ridiculous.

819
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,220
What's with your pronunciation?

820
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,890
I don't know.
It happens in the morning.

821
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,230
- I mean...
- It happens in the morning?

822
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,640
- You sit there, you punk.
- He says it happens in the morning.

823
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
- Sit here, Se Chan.
- Okay.

824
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,730
I'll let you sit there
in the morning.

825
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,280
I'm sorry,
but what do you do for a living?

826
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,740
- Pardon me?
- What is your profession?

827
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,780
I import fashion products...

828
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,410
- from Italy.
- I see.

829
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:12,140
I also export Korean products
to Italy.

830
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,120
So you're a peddler, aren't you?

831
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,250
Aren't you the one who got caught
selling fake designer goods?

832
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,590
- You earned a lot as a peddler.
- A peddler?

833
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,220
- Don't call me a peddler.
- He made money as a peddler.

834
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,590
- I sell a ton per month.
- Mr. Fake Goods.

835
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,130
- Haven't you been on the news?
- No.

836
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,220
I think I've seen you on the news.

837
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,870
- It wasn't like that.
- He was wearing the same clothes.

838
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,570
I was on the news
as a model taxpayer.

839
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,600
- A model taxpayer?
- Yes.

840
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,340
- But you don't earn that much.
- How much tax do you pay per year?

841
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,430
- Pardon me?
- How much tax do you pay per year?

842
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,230
Must I tell you that?

843
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,730
I mean...

844
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,850
- Must I tell you that?
- Seeing that you were on the news,

845
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,580
- you must pay a fortune for taxes.
- Absolutely.

846
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,470
- He must pay a lot.
- How much tax do you pay per year?

847
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,580
No comment.

848
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,590
- Pardon?
- No comment.

849
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,180
Don't you run your own business?

850
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,250
- We all do.
- Hey, is your business going well?

851
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,410
Yes, it's going well.

852
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,030
I'm sorry, but Ji Hyo isn't feeling
well either, so don't talk to her.

853
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,030
She has mild enteritis.

854
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,950
I can't talk to her
because she has enteritis...

855
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,220
or to him because he got vaccinated.
Then whom can I talk to?

856
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,330
You can talk to me.

857
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,570
(- Then whom can I talk to?
- You can talk to me.)

858
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,770
- I'm in good condition today.
- Should I talk to this glass?

859
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,230
- I feel like I can even fly.
- Hey, how are you feeling?

860
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,730
- I feel so energetic.
- My gosh.

861
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,170
Whom should I talk to?

862
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,240
- You can talk to me.
- Seriously.

863
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,940
- You have enteritis?
- Yes.

864
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,640
I'm suffering from
severe seasonal allergies.

865
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,240
Haha is suffering from
allergic reactions.

866
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,740
- And he...
- I can't take off my sunglasses.

867
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,850
Do you have a runny nose?

868
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,020
It'd be crazy.

869
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,210
By the way, when Haha is shooting
this show with us,

870
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,130
he often says he's not feeling well,

871
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,860
but he seemed so enthusiastic
on "How Do You Play?".

872
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,250
- I know, right?
- Hey.

873
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,220
- Right? You saw that too, right?
- Yes, I did.

874
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,960
- That's not true.
- Since he joined that show,

875
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,870
- I mean...
- he gives his all over there,

876
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,100
and then he's bedridden
for six days.

877
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,930
- Right? He seemed so enthusiastic.
- No, that's not true.

878
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,110
- Bo Pil must be upset.
- Don't think that way.

879
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,430
- It's all a misunderstanding.
- He really is enthusiastic.

880
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,540
He is, right?

881
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,380
- I'm not joking. He works so hard.
- He took me by surprise.

882
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,500
Jae Suk is complimenting him.

883
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,520
You know...

884
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,050
- that I rarely compliment him.
- He was so passionate.

885
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,140
- He works really hard on that show.
- Right?

886
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,590
- I'm so disappointed.
- I'm grateful to him.

887
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,150
Bo Pil, it's not true.
I work just as hard here.

888
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,590
- That's not true.
- He just acts arrogant here...

889
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,130
and tries to go home early
saying he's not feeling well.

890
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,130
- Seven to three?
- I think so.

891
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,220
He's been working hard
to become a regular on that show.

892
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,630
- That's not true. Believe me.
- I can see that.

893
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,490
We prepared
some special food for you.

894
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,230
Really? But why are you feeding us?

895
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,160
- I see. Sounds great.
- Oh, my.

896
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,640
Thank you, Nam Joong.

897
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,840
(Plenty of food is served
on a 3-tier tray.)

898
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,880
- Why are you giving us food?
- What's that?

899
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,850
- It's eggs benedict.
- Thanks.

900
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,850
- It looks good.
- What's this?

901
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,620
(From truffle cream sauce pasta...)

902
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,480
(to homemade hamburger
with a rich cheesy flavor)

903
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,790
- Oh, it's a souffle.
- This is injeolmi. What's that?

904
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,950
What is a souffle?

905
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,060
Don't you know what a souffle is?

906
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,630
- I should exercise hard after this.
- I think it's a souffle.

907
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,690
- I don't like it when they feed us.
- Nam Joong.

908
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,690
I'm not sure if we should
just enjoy the food.

909
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,630
- I love souffle pancakes.
- It looks so good.

910
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,800
- I think we should do this.
- It looks delicious.

911
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,370
- What are you doing?
- Everyone.

912
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,840
Are you the president of this group?
Why do you keep acting up?

913
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
- Haven't you watched any movies?
- I guess...

914
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,140
- I guess he watches TV a lot.
- Exactly.

915
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,930
- They tap a glass to give a toast.
- That's right.

916
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,140
- We have enough time.
- They tap a glass like that.

917
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,550
Let me make a toast.

918
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,550
- Did you just ring a bell?
- It's his treat.

919
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,710
No, that's not it.

920
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,740
By the way, this is so delicious.

921
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,050
- Oh, my.
- Is it? It looks good.

922
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,750
It tastes even better
as we're eating outside.

923
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,620
- It'd still be tasty indoors.
- I agree.

924
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,750
What's that? Is it pork rind?

925
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,950
What did you say? What's that?

926
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,690
What's that?

927
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,830
- What?
- What's going on?

928
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,890
Why are you giving us so much food?

929
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,660
What's going on?

930
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,270
Aren't we getting lunch today?

931
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,110
Hey, give me the lamb steak.

932
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,930
He's just unbelievable.

933
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,230
He never eats lamb
with his own money.

934
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,200
- He's ridiculous.
- He likes free food too much.

935
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,050
By the way, why are you giving us
so much food?

936
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,210
It's not lamb. It's Iberico pork.

937
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,940
- Is it not lamb?
- Oh, Iberico pork?

938
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,890
Pork is good for our health.

939
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,740
- Oh, my.
- Why are we getting so much food?

940
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,950
It's a good source of protein.

941
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,150
(They're gulping down the food,
putting their doubts aside.)

942
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,450
- Did we win an award or something?
- It's so good.

943
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,530
(They're gulping down the food,
putting their doubts aside.)

944
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,130
Or is one of us leaving the show?

945
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,560
Since Haha and some others
haven't been feeling well,

946
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,860
we prepared some healthy food.

947
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,390
- This one is really tasty.
- Indeed.

948
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,160
When Haha doesn't feel well,

949
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,340
you just have to bring a camera
from the "How Do You Play?" team.

950
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,340
(Just bring a camera
from the "How Do You Play?" team.)

951
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,840
- Haha is taken aback.
- He'd put on funny makeup...

952
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,430
- and everything.
- Hey.

953
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,380
You know what they do.

954
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,000
They will fully take advantage
of you.

955
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,940
You all know that it's true.

956
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,320
- He...
- He doesn't have to work so hard.

957
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,850
- I'm different because...
- It's pointless.

958
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,140
- He appears on the show regularly.
- I'm a cast member, not a guest.

959
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,680
- What?
- He's a cast member now.

960
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,890
You must be happy.

961
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,650
(You must be happy.)

962
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,060
Se Chan, what did you do
to make money in Italy?

963
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,370
I'm sure you don't speak Italian.

964
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,870
- Italian...
- I bet he hasn't been there.

965
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,890
Isn't "bonjour" Italian?

966
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,770
- "Bonjour" is French.
- That's French.

967
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,610
- They all make this gesture.
- It's "ciao" in Italian.

968
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,500
- "Buongiorno."
- Right. "Buongiorno."

969
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,930
I said, "Ciao."
"Ciao" means "hello".

970
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,440
I'm sorry,
but have you been to Italy before?

971
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,780
(I'm sorry,
but have you been to Italy before?)

972
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,520
You don't have to go to Italy
to do business.

973
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,620
What I meant was...

974
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,940
- Haven't you been there before?
- Haven't you?

975
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,440
Look here.
All my employees are over there.

976
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,150
- I just give them orders.
- What kind...

977
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,520
What kind of business is it, mister?

978
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,360
- I import fashion items.
- Exactly what items?

979
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,950
- What fashion items?
- What did you import recently?

980
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,390
- Pardon?
- What did you import recently?

981
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,420
I imported some suits recently.

982
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,890
- Did you just say "sperm"?
- Yes.

983
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,130
- "Sperm"?
- You imported sperm?

984
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,540
- Mister.
- "Sperm"?

985
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,930
- Gosh. That's too much.
- "Sperm"?

986
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,770
- Why would he say such a thing?
- Where do you get it, mister?

987
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,460
- Mister.
- Gosh, what's wrong with you?

988
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,610
Where do you get that?

989
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,540
There's something wrong
with his pronunciation.

990
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,240
- Where do you get it?
- Is it so hard to pronounce "suit"?

991
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,810
- It was unexpected. I'm baffled.
- So you sell "sperm"...

992
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,850
Hey, kid, what do you do?

993
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,320
- What do you do?
- Are you talking to me?

994
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,060
- Yes, you. What do you do?
- What?

995
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,410
Haha, you should at least talk
with more enthusiasm.

996
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,590
(You should at least talk
with more enthusiasm.)

997
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,560
I just improvised a joke.

998
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,630
- Why can't you be more passionate?
- He should've played along with me.

999
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,070
- He's unlucky to sit there.
- That was a bad one.

1000
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,960
Gosh. He's driving me crazy.

1001
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,610
- Seriously. I mean...
- Come up with one good joke...

1002
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,310
- at least.
- I can't believe you.

1003
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,200
- Make people laugh at least once.
- Keep going.

1004
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,670
- Haha, what are you doing?
- Make our viewers laugh.

1005
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,200
- Haha, what are you doing?
- You could do some funny acts.

1006
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,440
Gosh. You guys are making me
feel so uncomfortable.

1007
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,620
Haha, what are you doing?

1008
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,240
- You should admit it.
- Why did you choose that seat?

1009
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,640
- You should've come here.
- Go, Haha!

1010
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,210
- Haha, cheer up.
- Why didn't you come here?

1011
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,120
- You've got this.
- I'll keep an eye on you.

1012
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,130
Hey, what line of business
are you in?

1013
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,360
You're eating the food that I made.

1014
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,030
- I work in the restaurant industry.
- Oh, you're in the food industry.

1015
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,420
- Are you a chef?
- Yes.

1016
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,640
You see, you shouldn't run
a business with your boyfriend.

1017
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,140
(You see, you shouldn't run
a business with your boyfriend.)

1018
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,810
- What's with that comment?
- Hey.

1019
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,380
Gosh. You won't play along
with any of my jokes.

1020
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,550
- You should've said something!
- Go, Haha!

1021
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,850
- Haha, what are you doing?
- Haha, go for it.

1022
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,940
- What was that?
- You know...

1023
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,050
Pour all you have into the shoot
on Thursday.

1024
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,850
Today is Monday.
You have three days left.

1025
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,620
- Pour it all into Thursday's shoot.
- I mean...

1026
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,250
- Save it for Thursday's shoot.
- That kind of joke...

1027
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,060
He wouldn't make that kind of joke
on "How Do You Play?".

1028
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,950
- Save it for Thursday.
- Am I right?

1029
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,250
- We have class too.
- He's doing great.

1030
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,220
I'm surprised that Jong Kook saw him
on that show.

1031
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,420
You watched that show.

1032
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,660
It's not like that.

1033
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,690
I was so surprised. I found out
about it from a news article.

1034
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,930
Haha on "How Do You Play?".

1035
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,000
I think I should visit the set
to see Haha shooting the show.

1036
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,730
(He's planning to visit him
at his other workplace.)

1037
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,310
- Go to see him.
- He must feel suffocated.

1038
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,910
- That must be so scary.
- You'd make him feel threatened.

1039
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,320
The weather is so nice.

1040
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
- Cheer up.
- Thanks. The weather is so nice.

1041
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,020
(Exclaiming)

1042
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,950
- It must be too greasy for you.
- It's good.

1043
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,250
This boosts my appetite
so early in the morning.

1044
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,920
- This Iberico pork steak is tasty.
- It's so good.

1045
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,250
Are you all full?

1046
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,450
- Yes.
- I really enjoyed it.

1047
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,920
- Yes.
- You can listen to me while eating.

1048
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,430
Today,

1049
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,370
to celebrate the beginning of fall,

1050
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:13,070
the season of feeding our minds
and bodies,

1051
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,880
we prepared Elegant Western Road
to do just that.

1052
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,050
What is that?

1053
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,280
Are we going somewhere else
to eat more food?

1054
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,050
Obviously, we prepared food
for you for a reason.

1055
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,470
Today,

1056
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:27,680
you will be a lady and gentlemen
with dignity and manners...

1057
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,320
and visit famous Western food
restaurants all day long.

1058
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,060
I like Western food,
but I can't eat it all day long.

1059
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,330
- I'm already tired of it.
- It's too greasy already.

1060
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,800
- Listen.
- It's too much.

1061
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,660
I craved young radish kimchi
when I had my last bite.

1062
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,490
Since it's Elegant Western Road,

1063
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,270
you'll eat creamy, greasy,

1064
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,840
- soft, and sticky food...
- That'd be so oily.

1065
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,580
with lots of butter, cream,
and cheese in it.

1066
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,310
- Oh, gosh.
- "Soft and sticky"?

1067
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,140
When the tour ends,

1068
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,380
the one with the most prize badges
will win and get a prize.

1069
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,470
And one person chosen
by picking a penalty ball...

1070
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,850
- will get the penalty.
- Oh, gosh.

1071
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,980
I'll explain how you get
prize badges and penalty balls.

1072
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,520
At every restaurant you visit,

1073
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,360
a certain amount of food
will be prepared for you to taste.

1074
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,490
If you fail to finish the food,
you receive a penalty ball.

1075
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,770
- I see.
- How do we finish all the food?

1076
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,960
How do we eat Western food
for three meals straight?

1077
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,070
- Besides...
- Food made with flour.

1078
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:19,200
I just ate three pieces
of Iberico pork steak.

1079
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,610
I also ate some pasta and...

1080
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,470
- Iberico pork.
- Gosh. I ate three pieces.

1081
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,580
- But you have a chance.
- What chance?

1082
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,640
You will play a game
before eating food,

1083
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,380
and it will decide the number
of the badges you can get.

1084
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,980
Who wins the badges
will also be decided.

1085
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,560
Those who win the badges
may skip the meals...

1086
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,210
and enjoy any kind of dish...

1087
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,480
- that they requested beforehand.
- Any dish?

1088
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,650
It has to be ramyeon.

1089
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,960
And that's all you'll have to eat.

1090
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,120
- I wouldn't mind a spicy dish.
- Or something refreshing.

1091
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,600
What I'm craving the most
is kimchi stew.

1092
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,670
- Same here.
- I want naengmyeon.

1093
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,170
The winner of the games...

1094
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,640
will be able to save others
from eating heavy dishes.

1095
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,600
- Just one more person.
- That's right.

1096
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,980
At the next restaurant,

1097
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,540
you'll be enjoying
creamy and cheesy...

1098
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,080
doughnuts.

1099
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,390
- No way.
- Doughnuts?

1100
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,520
- Doughnuts with sugar?
- I hardly eat them.

1101
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,810
But right now, name the dish...

1102
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:13,560
you'd like to eat
should you win the game.

1103
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,330
It could be something spicy...

1104
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,750
- or something refreshing.
- What should I choose?

1105
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,330
Can cold kimchi noodles be served?

1106
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,870
- Cold kimchi noodles?
- Or something like that.

1107
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,020
- I'd like that too.
- What do you think?

1108
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,400
Cold kimchi noodles sound good.

1109
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,960
- Then that will be served.
- Nice.

1110
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,100
- Shall we get moving?
- Yes, let's go.

1111
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,310
My gosh.

1112
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,480
Hold on a second.

1113
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,580
- Aren't we wearing team shirts?
- You'll be wearing that all day.

1114
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,850
(You'll be wearing that all day.)

1115
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,440
- Wait. Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

1116
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,520
You should wear this at the waist.

1117
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,040
Would you like to tuck this in?

1118
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,890
Hold on.
I'm supposed to fasten my belt.

1119
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,520
- Yes, you have to.
- You don't have it fastened?

1120
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,790
But we're still parked.

1121
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,790
It doesn't matter.

1122
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,290
We need to stay focused today...

1123
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,080
since we're down a member.

1124
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,650
- How can I...
- And you should talk more.

1125
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,790
Ji Hyo looks lonely,
so go and sit next to her.

1126
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,920
Be chattier.

1127
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,600
I'm chatting right now.

1128
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,060
Why is the seat
next to Ji Hyo empty?

1129
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,730
- She looks lonely.
- She'd appreciate the space.

1130
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,770
Hold on.

1131
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,670
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

1132
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,940
Could I sit next to you?

1133
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,580
- Right. Sure thing.
- The seat's empty.

1134
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,520
- But Jae Suk never sits there.
- Why though?

1135
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,980
You're making her uncomfortable.

1136
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,350
- In what way?
- She was enjoying the space.

1137
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,310
She panicked just now.

1138
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,460
- But I...
- You made her uncomfortable.

1139
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,190
- But I've been her colleague...
- You took her by surprise.

1140
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,250
for ten years.

1141
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,850
- She was startled.
- We're close friends.

1142
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,250
He's not the Grim Reaper.

1143
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,750
- He's not the Grim Reaper.
- I like it here.

1144
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,370
- No.
- Get back here.

1145
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,400
Have us look balanced on camera.

1146
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,790
- Bo Pil.
- Do we have a blanket?

1147
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,830
Cover his legs
with a blanket, will you?

1148
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,500
They're too skinny.

1149
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,440
They're slender, not skinny.

1150
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,330
- Gosh.
- Is this for your bagpipes?

1151
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,080
Do you play the bagpipes?

1152
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,150
You actually gave me one.

1153
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,250
That's what I call good manners.

1154
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,650
- It wasn't easy on the eyes.
- Must I use this all day?

1155
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,940
Doesn't it look like
what they use in nursing homes?

1156
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,020
This is much better.

1157
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,690
He looks like an old Scottish man.

1158
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,460
- It wasn't nice.
- Yes, an old Scottish man.

1159
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,560
- So today...
- Since you're here, Jae Suk,

1160
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,790
I'll head to the back.

1161
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,290
Where are you off to?

1162
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,120
Ji Hyo, where are you going?

1163
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,770
- Are you battling over seats?
- Are we swapping seats?

1164
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,000
Haha, you should sit here.

1165
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,940
- No, don't.
- "How Do You Play?"...

1166
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,940
Hold on a second.

1167
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,710
There's no romance
on "How Do You Play?".

1168
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,640
Yes, keep that seat vacant
and we'll see.

1169
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,870
- I'll sit here.
- Seriously?

1170
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,080
Should this seat stay empty?

1171
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,870
- Yes, keep it empty.
- Why though?

1172
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:18,120
Ji Hyo, then I'll...

1173
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,210
- Stay in your seat!
- Let me head back there.

1174
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,210
Just don't. What on earth is this?

1175
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,310
There we go.

1176
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,290
- Good.
- This wasn't my intention,

1177
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,560
- but it ended up this way.
- This is much better.

1178
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,690
Is this it though?
Don't we have a guest today?

1179
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,120
Yes, we'll get going.

1180
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,520
Call anyone nearby who's free today.

1181
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,690
- At least one will be free.
- Why not?

1182
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,000
But what for?

1183
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,100
Nam Chang Hee will come over
in a heartbeat.

1184
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,440
Chang Hee sounds like a good idea.

1185
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,810
- He's only free until 4 p.m.
- I quite like him.

1186
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,870
- Only until 4 p.m.
- Really?

1187
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,370
- Why?
- He has a live radio show to host.

1188
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,580
Mr. Radio

1189
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,750
- What don't you tune into?
- Do you listen to that too?

1190
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,710
- Even radio shows?
- Mr. Radio

1191
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,250
He's unbelievable.

1192
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,390
I'm just as amazed.

1193
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,750
- That's not it.
- He knows about everything.

1194
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,580
Why on earth do you watch
home-shopping channels?

1195
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,960
- What about them?
- You have no idea.

1196
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,250
- Why?
- It's hard...

1197
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,000
- to associate him with them.
- They aren't for him.

1198
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,750
- You don't like to shop.
- But you're on the channel.

1199
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,850
He tunes in
when he stumbles onto one.

1200
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,100
I watch the shows that Haha is on.

1201
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,230
I didn't know you were selling
your budaejjigae...

1202
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,790
- on home-shopping channels.
- I do.

1203
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,140
Budaejjigae and pork cutlets.

1204
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,400
You should tune in as well...

1205
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,000
since he works hard
to make a living.

1206
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,210
My wife loves
the pork cutlet he launched,

1207
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,170
so she buys some every month.

1208
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,400
What's the brand?

1209
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,150
- It's his brand.
- What's its name?

1210
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,080
The name is in three syllables.

1211
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,120
Is it "Merry"?

1212
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,350
(Did he say "Merry"?)

1213
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,350
(Is it "Merry"?)

1214
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,710
Merry Pork Cutlet.

1215
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,190
How festive, right?

1216
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,460
Merry Pork Cutlet!

1217
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,020
Be merry!

1218
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,060
Eating it will bring you joy.

1219
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,600
Merry Pork Cutlet! It's not bad.

1220
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,560
- Merry Pork Cutlet.
- It's hilarious.

1221
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,270
Wait. What is this place?

1222
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,940
- It's beautiful.
- Go on in.

1223
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,060
I love the color scheme.

1224
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,940
I see doughnuts!

1225
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,770
(Colorful doughnuts
with cream fillings)

1226
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,650
You're at a doughnut shop.

1227
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,420
- Right.
- Hold on a second.

1228
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,250
- I feel sick already.
- I know.

1229
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,480
- I feel kind of sick.
- This place...

1230
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,580
Their doughnuts are delicious.

1231
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,810
- I've had a few before.
- Really?

1232
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,580
We should at least
get beverages with them.

1233
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:09,000
- We'll be giving out prize badges.
- Right.

1234
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,750
But first, you'll play a team game
to decide the number of them.

1235
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,400
- It's called Delivery.
- Delivery!

1236
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,600
- Delivery!
- I think we've done it before.

1237
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,000
- Do you see those boxes?
- Yes.

1238
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,940
Choose a box out of those...

1239
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,440
that are worth different points
depending on its size.

1240
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,080
You'll then have 30 seconds
to tear off the tape.

1241
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,100
- But that's easy.
- Do we get a box cutter?

1242
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,210
No. Just use your bare hands.

1243
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,670
- You'll have 30 seconds.
- It's not easy.

1244
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,870
- I can get it done.
- It's difficult.

1245
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,210
- I bite my nails!
- We can do it.

1246
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,650
We'll allow slight tearing
of the outer layer.

1247
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,390
- The outer layer?
- But tear the box in any way...

1248
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,150
and you'll have failed.

1249
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:44,250
- Get 18 points to win 6 badges.
- A total of 18 points?

1250
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,960
Getting 15 points
will give you 5 badges...

1251
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,460
while getting 12 points
will give you 4 badges.

1252
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,690
We'll have to go
with the bigger boxes.

1253
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,190
- We need 18 points.
- Go for 5 points each.

1254
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,210
Ripping off box tape...

1255
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,810
- frustrates me.
- I'm terrible at this.

1256
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:54,960
I normally use box cutters.

1257
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,830
Using box cutters
is how you keep it neat.

1258
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,080
I rip the box instead.

1259
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,900
- The box itself?
- Right?

1260
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,810
Jong Kook probably rips it apart.

1261
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,150
But that's scary.

1262
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,480
- This isn't what I do.
- It's frustrating.

1263
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,710
How well is it taped?

1264
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,390
- Let's see.
- It's completely doable.

1265
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,710
No, it won't be easy.

1266
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,690
Just so you know,

1267
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,620
the level of taping...

1268
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,920
- is on the slightly annoying side.
- See what I mean?

1269
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,690
- Unbelievable.
- There are two layers.

1270
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,790
- There are two layers.
- So what will it be?

1271
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,020
- Seok Sam, take your pick.
- This.

1272
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,100
- Old Scottish man will go first.
- Take a look at it first.

1273
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,370
- That's not it.
- Start from the side.

1274
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,100
Let me take a look. Oh, right here.

1275
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,100
- Exactly.
- Follow that line.

1276
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,230
- Ready...
- Hold on. Okay, now I'm ready.

1277
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,730
Get set, go!

1278
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:32,980
Hold on.

1279
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,980
(The diaper smuggler
is familiar with delivery boxes.)

1280
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,980
(Can his many years of experience
get him through the challenge?)

1281
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,290
- Hold on.
- It's already over.

1282
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,690
He's done for.
You can't rip the box.

1283
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,920
This much is allowed.

1284
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,250
(A big hole)

1285
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,730
- Seriously?
- What are you doing?

1286
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,400
That's not how you do it.

1287
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,230
Why? I'm getting it done.

1288
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,560
Sure, keep going.

1289
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,140
- You're doing great.
- Hold on.

1290
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,500
- This isn't what the game is.
- This much is allowed.

1291
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,270
- Suk Jin...
- Come on.

1292
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,330
This much is allowed.

1293
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,940
- This is fine.
- Seriously?

1294
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,980
- That's it. You got one side.
- Right.

1295
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,540
But your time is up.

1296
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,440
- This much is allowed.
- How can you be so weak?

1297
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,940
- Unbelievable.
- What's the time?

1298
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,810
- So...
- This isn't how it should be done.

1299
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,480
- But I got it done.
- You didn't get all of it.

1300
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,350
- He did it.
- You removed the tape,

1301
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,850
but you put a hole in the box.

1302
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,060
You ripped it.

1303
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,330
- This isn't allowed.
- That's what I said.

1304
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,560
You failed anyway
because of the remaining tape.

1305
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,020
- Was I supposed to remove this?
- Of course.

1306
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,900
- But I got it open.
- Isn't it obvious?

1307
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,830
Let me have a go at it.
Unbelievable.

1308
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,370
Jae Suk, go for four points.

1309
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,440
No, three points.

1310
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,560
The one with four points
will definitely be easier.

1311
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,730
- Really?
- Yes.

1312
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,960
How is this easier?

1313
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,770
I'll get us some points first.

1314
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:37,810
- Go ahead.
- Look.

1315
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:40,150
- Look at me juggling the box.
- Nicely done.

1316
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,310
- Are you seeing this?
- Nice.

1317
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,750
You'll hit yourself in the mouth.

1318
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,870
That's what he'll do again.

1319
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,020
- Look at this.
- Are you kidding me?

1320
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,290
Look at how he's enthusiastic...

1321
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,350
- both on Saturday and Sunday.
- Take a look.

1322
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,330
- Unbelievable.
- Are you seeing this?

1323
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,750
That's what you call a professional.

1324
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:57,460
All right.

1325
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,370
- Let me take a look first.
- Ready...

1326
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,790
- Wait.
- This isn't easy.

1327
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:01,960
Get set...

1328
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,290
You have enough time,
so don't rush it.

1329
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,170
There's no need
to use a lot of force.

1330
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:10,830
- No, use all the force you have.
- Put muscle into it.

1331
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,580
- He's ripping it.
- Pull with all your might.

1332
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,080
You annoying little box!

1333
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,150
You're already done for.

1334
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,270
Use your teeth.

1335
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,440
You're doomed.

1336
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,540
(The nation's top MC
shows his true nature.)

1337
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,690
He won't be able to do it.

1338
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:20,920
(Being desperate,
he uses his teeth.)

1339
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,080
You're done for.

1340
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:25,420
You need to do some shopping
to know how to remove packing tape.

1341
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,850
- Darn it.
- This is what you get...

1342
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,420
for showing off earlier.

1343
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:32,520
- It's over for you.
- He's frustrated.

1344
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,900
- It's over for you.
- What are you doing?

1345
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,870
- What is this?
- It's over, Jae Suk.

1346
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,190
It's still not coming off.

1347
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:42,210
- Darn it!
- Are you kidding me?

1348
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,670
Seriously?

1349
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,670
- Jae Suk.
- What...

1350
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,170
Let me try that once more.

1351
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,270
Give me another chance.

1352
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,580
You exhausted yourself
before the actual game.

1353
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,940
- Let me try that once more.
- This is insane.

1354
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,350
- It won't come off.
- Let me try it.

1355
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,520
Hold on. Se Chan,
aren't you good at this?

1356
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,620
I have longer nails,
so I'll go for five points.

1357
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,150
- I have faith in him.
- This is the one.

1358
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:02,690
I'm sorry.

1359
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,560
- Se Chan...
- It's super frustrating.

1360
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,100
Se Chan will try to win five points.

1361
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,520
- We need the five points.
- I'm mapping it out.

1362
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,170
Let me see
how I should go about this.

1363
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,500
How many seconds do I have?

1364
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,900
- Thirty seconds.
- Thirty?

1365
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,500
No head starts are allowed.

1366
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,440
- I was only checking.
- Don't be too uptight.

1367
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,480
(The Italian petty offender
uses his petty skills.)

1368
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,580
- Please get ready.
- Just a second.

1369
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,850
- Get set...
- Hold on.

1370
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:25,650
Okay, good. Nicely done.

1371
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,810
He used his teeth.

1372
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,850
(He used his teeth.)

1373
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,850
There you go. Use your teeth.

1374
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,120
What does he remind me of?

1375
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,920
Oh, yes. A vole.

1376
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,020
- He's a vole.
- Nice.

1377
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:42,060
- Is this animal kingdom?
- Use your teeth!

1378
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,400
There you go. Keep at it.

1379
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,640
- Use your teeth!
- We're watching a vole.

1380
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,140
Nice!

1381
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,830
Nice going with your teeth.

1382
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:52,580
Yes, keep using your teeth.

1383
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,350
- Yes, your teeth.
- No way.

1384
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,650
Open! I got it.

1385
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,980
It's open.

1386
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,250
- Look to the side.
- The side.

1387
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,420
- You're good.
- Unbelievable.

1388
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,080
- You did it.
- Nice!

1389
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,150
(The vole succeeded.)

1390
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,830
- Nicely done.
- That was great.

1391
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,350
Should my teeth be hurting?

1392
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,330
You can't get it done
unless you use your teeth.

1393
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:10,750
Try opening it
with just your strength.

1394
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,920
It can't be done.

1395
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,690
- No, it could be.
- You can open this...

1396
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:14,870
- and I'll open this.
- So Se Chan...

1397
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,640
- received five points.
- Five points?

1398
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,830
Yes, five points.

1399
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:19,210
- Jong Kook is next.
- Let me see.

1400
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,310
Is it my turn?

1401
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:22,140
- Cut it and then rip it off.
- Let me try again.

1402
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:24,080
They've been taped differently.
This doesn't start on the side.

1403
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,770
- Here you go.
- The top layer...

1404
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,100
Hold on a second.

1405
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,100
I was only giving him pointers.

1406
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,270
Jong Kook,
that's where you should start.

1407
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:30,370
- I should rip the side first?
- Right.

1408
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,870
- How am I supposed to open this?
- You look like...

1409
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:34,250
a boy who picks someone's pocket
at a dockside from some movie.

1410
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:37,020
Watch your pockets.

1411
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,620
From movies like "Titanic".

1412
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,790
Watch your pockets.

1413
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,330
- Ready.
- Hold on.

1414
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,100
Use your strength. I might get hurt
if I stay next to him.

1415
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,730
I might get hurt
if I stay next to you.

1416
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,170
You should use your strength.

1417
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,170
- That's good. Use your teeth!
- That's good.

1418
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,640
It seems too easy for him.

1419
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,290
- That's good.
- It looks so easy for him.

1420
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,810
- Use your hands. There you go.
- Goodness.

1421
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:54,370
He's just ripping it.

1422
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,670
(Halting)

1423
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,830
Hey, where is it? Darn it!

1424
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,000
Come out!

1425
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,920
- It's annoying, right?
- Hey, you punk!

1426
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,650
- Come out!
- Hit it with your fist.

1427
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,120
- You punk!
- You can't break it!

1428
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,810
(Smashed)

1429
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:11,580
That's good.

1430
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,560
(Trembling with fear)

1431
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,790
- He smashed it!
- That's good!

1432
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:15,850
That's good! Keep going!

1433
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,750
- Keep going!
- You got it!

1434
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,230
- The box is still in its shape.
- Punch it!

1435
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,420
You punk!

1436
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,270
- It's smashed.
- You punk!

1437
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:23,440
- That's good.
- You brat.

1438
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,870
- You're incredible.
- You're almost done.

1439
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,230
You punk!

1440
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,710
- That was close.
- You were almost done though.

1441
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:29,040
- This...
- You were almost done.

1442
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,600
- This comes out easily.
- You should've punched it...

1443
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,170
- from the beginning.
- It's funny.

1444
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:34,040
What do you mean it was close
when you crushed the box?

1445
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:35,600
It's totally crushed.

1446
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:38,580
I punched it too hard.

1447
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,520
How long has it been
since you last punched something?

1448
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,420
Wait a minute. This is...

1449
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,790
- Let's go, Haha!
- The man of Sunday.

1450
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,830
- What are you doing, Haha?
- Let's see how good you are!

1451
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:48,420
Show some good performance
on Running Man, Haha!

1452
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,460
I'm the man of Sunday!

1453
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:51,900
Let's go!

1454
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,560
From the "X-Man" days...

1455
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:55,830
to Running Man!

1456
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:58,190
Let's go!

1457
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,330
That's good!

1458
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,370
(He starts with determination.)

1459
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:02,810
That's good!

1460
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:05,670
- He's fast. Use your teeth.
- That's good.

1461
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,210
(Four points)

1462
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:08,540
He got it.

1463
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,870
- He got it.
- That's good.

1464
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,440
(Nimble moves of the man of Sunday)

1465
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,540
- He got it. He's almost done.
- He's good.

1466
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,810
- Just a little more!
- It's the last piece.

1467
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,710
- Just a bit more! The other side.
- The last piece.

1468
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,060
I think he's done.

1469
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,750
- I'm done.
- You forgot this part.

1470
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:22,390
- I'm done!
- All right.

1471
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,000
- Haha succeeded.
- All right!

1472
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,060
The man of Sunday!

1473
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:27,560
- He's the man of Sunday.
- I'm the man of Sunday.

1474
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,790
You know me, right?

1475
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:31,100
Hey, save your energy.

1476
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,710
There's another shoot in three days.

1477
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,100
Jae Suk told him
to save his energy.

1478
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:35,640
- Yes.
- Didn't I do well?

1479
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,170
You can do so well,
so why didn't you?

1480
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,600
Next is Ji Hyo.

1481
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,150
- You earned nine points so far.
- You punk.

1482
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:43,650
Ji Hyo, are you okay?
Is your stomach okay?

1483
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:44,670
I'm okay. I'll be okay...

1484
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:45,750
- if I don't tighten my stomach.
- Don't hold your stomach.

1485
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,440
Okay. I'll be okay as long as
I don't tighten my stomach.

1486
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,480
Ready.

1487
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,560
(How well will Ji Hyo
with enteritis open the box?)

1488
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,850
Hey, start from there.

1489
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,980
You're opening it so calmly.

1490
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,330
- Hey.
- You're opening it so calmly.

1491
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,750
You're pretty good.

1492
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,520
(Her delicate movements
are accurate.)

1493
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,520
(She's opening the box
with a kind smile.)

1494
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,560
She's too calm.

1495
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,600
Ji Hyo, it looks like you're opening
a parcel your boyfriend sent you.

1496
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:06,870
You're cherishing it so much.

1497
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,170
She's not going to make it.

1498
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,600
- She's actually unboxing it.
- What are you doing?

1499
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,100
She's actually unboxing a parcel.

1500
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,940
- No, I'm not.
- You're not playing a game!

1501
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,580
- You're just unboxing it.
- You're opening it too slowly.

1502
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,870
"What could be inside the box?"

1503
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,040
You don't have to rush.

1504
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,150
- What's going on?
- She's almost done though.

1505
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,020
Do you even know
how to play this game?

1506
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,250
Are you opening
a Christmas gift or something?

1507
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,520
You're not supposed to unbox it.

1508
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,330
- She won't make it.
- There you go.

1509
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:27,350
It was too...

1510
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,560
- You were almost playing with it.
- Well done. She's done anyway.

1511
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:31,830
Ji Hyo failed.

1512
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,190
Why are you so generous with Ji Hyo?

1513
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:34,960
You can't be okay with this.

1514
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,560
Why are you strict to me
but not to her?

1515
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,290
He finds you so adorable.

1516
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,730
Hey, she's different from you.
You are...

1517
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:42,400
Oh, right. She's different.
I agree with you.

1518
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,330
Thank you, Jong Kook.

1519
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,870
- She plays along with it.
- Thank you.

1520
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:49,920
You have nine points so far,

1521
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,850
but someone can play
in place of So Min.

1522
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:53,310
- Then...
- I'll do it.

1523
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:54,890
- No.
- You shouldn't play!

1524
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,120
Just stay still!

1525
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,580
- But...
- I'll be okay.

1526
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,890
- Se Chan, you should do it.
- We don't have that many points.

1527
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,350
Rat, I'll do it.

1528
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:02,520
Jae Suk, use your teeth too.

1529
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,790
Then we'll let you play
in place of So Min and Kwang Soo.

1530
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:07,560
- Kwang Soo too?
- In place of Kwang Soo too?

1531
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,330
Why would you do that?

1532
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,440
- Hey.
- I have a lot to say to him.

1533
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,600
- Why?
- What is it?

1534
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,040
I watched the movie
he was recently in, "Sinkhole",

1535
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,580
and it looked like he could've
made it out.

1536
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,870
He could've made it out of the cab.

1537
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,480
- That's right!
- But it's just a movie.

1538
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,250
- It was more important for him...
- I mean...

1539
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:27,520
"He could've made it out."

1540
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,710
I was really upset with him
when I saw it.

1541
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:31,350
It must've been upsetting.

1542
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:33,120
He just wanted more screen time.

1543
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,190
I haven't watched it though.

1544
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:35,290
He just stalled for time.

1545
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,690
Then...

1546
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:37,960
You can play two more times.

1547
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,060
Rat, you should play it.

1548
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,020
Big Rat is going to do it instead.

1549
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,100
- He's just a mouse.
- Is he?

1550
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,640
- Are you going to use your teeth?
- I'm just a mouse.

1551
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,690
If you're going to use them,
I'll let you play.

1552
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:47,230
- I'll use my teeth then.
- Okay. Use your teeth.

1553
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:49,140
- Okay.
- Let him play.

1554
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,230
Let's see how well he does.

1555
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,830
He's being playful again.

1556
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:52,870
- Keep tossing it.
- Seriously.

1557
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,480
Why would you waste your energy
before even starting?

1558
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,540
He looks like a magician.

1559
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,120
You'll be able to succeed
as long as you don't play with it.

1560
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,120
He's a magician.

1561
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,850
(He adds another character.)

1562
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:02,810
(Making a fuss)

1563
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,080
(He's number one when it comes to
wasting energy on useless things.)

1564
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,520
He reminds me of the old comedian.

1565
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:08,350
- Ready.
- Hold on.

1566
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:09,920
If you succeed,
you'll earn another badge.

1567
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,190
- Where is it?
- You need to check it first.

1568
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:12,670
- Take a look at it first.
- Start from here.

1569
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,340
(Mouse's second try)

1570
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:23,300
- That's good.
- Darn it.

1571
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,110
(What?)

1572
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,110
(He made a mistake again
as soon as he began.)

1573
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,550
Hold on.
I think he needs to start again.

1574
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:30,550
- Gosh, that mouse.
- This is...

1575
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:33,190
- No, this is... Hold on.
- Gosh, that mouse.

1576
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:35,320
- I told you to check it first.
- No, I was just flustered.

1577
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,780
Use your teeth!

1578
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,480
(He attacks it with his buck teeth,
his secret weapon.)

1579
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,630
That mouse. Wait, he opened it.

1580
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,420
That mouse.

1581
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,500
(He opened it at once?)

1582
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,530
- He opened it.
- I'm almost done opening it.

1583
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,070
You're not done.
Check the sides as well.

1584
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,760
- There's nothing more.
- Check it thoroughly.

1585
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,070
- There's nothing more.
- He's done?

1586
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,400
- Good job, Mouse.
- Nice!

1587
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,570
- Good job, Mouse.
- There's nothing more?

1588
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:54,570
- Did he succeed?
- Show it to us.

1589
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:55,670
Show us the other side.

1590
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:57,210
- Where?
- Where?

1591
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:58,210
Where is it?

1592
00:50:58,210 --> 00:50:59,670
(Where?)

1593
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:00,710
- No.
- There's nothing on it.

1594
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:02,840
- No.
- There's nothing more.

1595
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,610
- What's there?
- There's nothing more.

1596
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:07,050
- There's nothing more.
- Where?

1597
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:08,260
- There's nothing more.
- Where is he talking about?

1598
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,820
There's nothing more.

1599
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,150
- There's nothing more.
- There's nothing more.

1600
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,590
- You saw it wrong.
- There's nothing more.

1601
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:13,730
(The box vanished in the air
in no time.)

1602
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,360
- The box...
- There's nothing on it, seriously.

1603
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,420
- There's really nothing on it.
- He ripped it all.

1604
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,130
- Go for it.
- He's amazing.

1605
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:21,190
- He's amazing.
- I got it. I'm done.

1606
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:22,340
- I'm done.
- Good job.

1607
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:23,670
All right.

1608
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:25,030
(Rat gave it a try next,
and succeeded in earning 2 points.)

1609
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,440
- That was incredible.
- He finished it in 18 seconds.

1610
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,940
- He finished it in 18 seconds.
- In 18 seconds?

1611
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,750
- Wow, Rat.
- My mouth tastes like blood.

1612
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:36,150
You've earned a total of 14 points,

1613
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,280
and you've earned four badges.

1614
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,460
- All right.
- That's good.

1615
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,510
Well done, everyone.

1616
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:42,230
(The winner of the next mission
will take all 4 badges.)

1617
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:43,780
- Everyone.
- Yes?

1618
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,900
Last week,
on Running Man's official Instagram,

1619
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:49,670
we asked our followers to
write us questions...

1620
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,760
that the members of Running Man...

1621
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,170
will have a difficult time
answering.

1622
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:58,360
We got a lot of comments.
We had about 7,000 comments.

1623
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,710
- We got 7,000 comments?
- We selected a few from them...

1624
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,750
and picked out the questions
you'll find difficult to admit.

1625
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:05,980
- Really?
- This is...

1626
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,050
We can just admit to them.

1627
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:10,780
So those who admit
to the questions...

1628
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,780
will need to give
a short explanation.

1629
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:14,920
Oh, after admitting to the question?

1630
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,780
You need to tell us why
you're admitting to it.

1631
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,760
You can even make up
a reason to answer it.

1632
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,090
- I can just admit to them.
- We're really cool with anything.

1633
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:23,530
- Of course.
- But they must be on another level.

1634
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:25,190
This will be a team match.

1635
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,840
The team that admits
to more questions wins.

1636
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,610
- Is it better to admit to them?
- Is it better to admit to them?

1637
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,670
It's good for the team
if you admit to them.

1638
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,800
Shall we divide into two teams
according to how we're seated?

1639
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,940
Okay. Let's divide into teams
like this.

1640
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,650
- For those questions...
- Just admit to them.

1641
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,510
You should also tell us
why you admit to them.

1642
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:39,150
It'll be fine as long as
the reasons are reasonable, right?

1643
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,010
Is this supposed to be difficult?

1644
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:42,340
I'll admit to most of them.

1645
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,420
Okay.

1646
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,690
Let's start with Suk Jin.

1647
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:46,480
Me? Okay. I'll just admit to it.

1648
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:48,320
Our viewers gave us these questions.

1649
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:53,400
"I admit that I'm quite bad
with ad-libs as a comedian."

1650
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:54,650
- Could you repeat it?
- Just admit it.

1651
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,530
"I admit that I'm quite bad
with ad-libs as a comedian."

1652
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,590
- I can't admit this.
- How many years has it been?

1653
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,000
- I can't admit to this.
- He's been a comedian for 30 years.

1654
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,090
- I can't admit to this.
- And he got a question like that?

1655
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:03,110
You should admit to it.

1656
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:05,340
- I can't admit to this.
- Gosh, this is difficult.

1657
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,480
- You must admit to it.
- You should...

1658
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,170
- Suk Jin!
- We're questions like this?

1659
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:11,710
The questions are
from our viewers, right?

1660
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:13,210
He's too proud to admit to it.

1661
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:14,780
- I can't do it.
- But this is...

1662
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,840
I'm really good with ad-libs.

1663
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,380
- He's bad at them.
- No, I'm not.

1664
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,360
He can just admit to it.

1665
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,550
- Of course.
- I can't admit to it.

1666
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:24,030
- Why wouldn't you admit to it?
- This is how the public thinks.

1667
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,030
- You must admit to it.
- It's a bit strange...

1668
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:26,050
that you can't admit to it.

1669
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:28,000
How come? I can't admit to it.

1670
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,090
I've been leading my career
with ad-libs.

1671
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:31,420
It's clear that he's bad
with ad-libs...

1672
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,760
because whenever
we criticize his outfit,

1673
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,570
he goes,
"You don't know fashion at all."

1674
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:36,940
- What else can I say to that?
- He's been saying it for two years.

1675
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,780
- It's nothing new.
- He has no wit at all.

1676
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,940
(Whenever he was criticized
for wearing something weird...)

1677
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,210
It's all about challenging yourself.
Don't be afraid to try new outfits.

1678
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:47,570
(Big Nose didn't come up
with any witty ad-libs.)

1679
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:49,980
(He only told them that they
don't know what's fashionable.)

1680
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:54,210
(He's been using the same comment
for 2 years.)

1681
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,090
- Celebrities must dress like this.
- They're fluffy.

1682
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:57,150
- Suk Jin.
- Your shorts are fluffy.

1683
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,820
- His main strength is a monologue,
- Of course.

1684
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,650
so he's bad with ad-libs.

1685
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,420
Who doesn't use ad-libs
during a monologue?

1686
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,340
You can understand it as
ad-libs for variety shows.

1687
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:09,900
How can I do a monologue
without ad-libs?

1688
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,030
- Let me tell you what it is.
- What?

1689
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:12,710
- Ad-libs are all about being witty.
- Exactly.

1690
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:14,800
- It's all about wit.
- You're a good talker.

1691
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,300
- But you're not witty.
- No.

1692
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,900
Being a good talker
and being witty are different.

1693
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,380
- That's true.
- You punk.

1694
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:21,420
You see? He should've come up
with an ad-lib to refute.

1695
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,190
- Exactly.
- There's nothing...

1696
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,750
- There's nothing to refute.
- Of course, there is.

1697
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:25,880
When it comes to ad-libs...

1698
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,880
Those who think I'm bad
with ad-libs, raise your hands.

1699
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:30,690
- Raise your hands.
- He must admit to it.

1700
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:31,860
All his life...

1701
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,760
- He must admit to it.
- I can't admit to it.

1702
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,150
- Just admit to it!
- No, I won't.

1703
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:36,860
- You're a good talker.
- I won't admit to it.

1704
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:37,860
He didn't admit to it.

1705
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,340
Being a good talker
means I'm good with ad-libs.

1706
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,170
You won't earn any points
since he didn't admit to it.

1707
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:42,190
- All right.
- Okay.

1708
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:43,610
Next is Jong Kook.

1709
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:46,380
- I have a few in my head.
- Jong Kook.

1710
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,880
He'll get this question for sure.

1711
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,610
I'm 100 percent sure
that we'll hear that word.

1712
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:50,840
- It's guaranteed.
- I'm certain.

1713
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,110
I'll admit to it if I can.

1714
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,980
It's good for the team
if I admit to it.

1715
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,550
- Here's the first one.
- I'll admit to it if I can.

1716
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,460
- You'll get this question for sure.
- There's nothing hard about it.

1717
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,550
"I actually find..."

1718
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,880
"Ji Hyo really adorable."

1719
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,230
("I actually find
Ji Hyo really adorable.")

1720
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:08,590
- He finds her adorable even now.
- Gosh, you.

1721
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:11,070
- She's adorable.
- You need to give a reason too.

1722
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:13,730
She's adorable. Everyone is. Do you
find Suk Jin adorable or not?

1723
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:16,070
- He's adorable.
- You can admit to this.

1724
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,460
Jae Suk is adorable too.

1725
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,900
- Ji Hyo and Se Chan are adorable.
- Yes.

1726
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,280
I'm too. We're all adorable.

1727
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,730
He finds her especially adorable
these days.

1728
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:22,840
What's the question again?

1729
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:24,840
"I actually find
Ji Hyo really adorable."

1730
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,750
You find her really adorable.

1731
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:28,610
You even want to bite her
because she's so adorable.

1732
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,780
- She's just adorable.
- You want to hug her too.

1733
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,860
- Everyone is adorable.
- You even want to bite her.

1734
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:35,050
If you admit to it,
you need to state your reason too.

1735
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:36,780
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1736
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,260
- She is adorable.
- Of course.

1737
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,320
- Are you admitting to it? Lift it.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1738
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,820
- She's adorable.
- All right!

1739
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:45,230
Why do you find her adorable?

1740
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:48,730
She has plump cheeks,
so she's adorable.

1741
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:49,960
What about her behavior?

1742
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,960
Of course, she's cute.

1743
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,110
When she did the "Rollin'" dance,
I was really surprised.

1744
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:55,610
- You find her so adorable?
- Yes. She's really adorable.

1745
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:58,280
- Of course.
- She's become really cute.

1746
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,070
You're totally into me.

1747
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:01,840
He's deep in love with you.

1748
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,820
- She's really adorable.
- Honey.

1749
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,860
- "Honey"?
- There are times I find her cute.

1750
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,010
- "Honey".
- Honey.

1751
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,690
- You admitted the first question.
- Yes.

1752
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,880
All right.

1753
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,900
"I've dated a guest I met
on a show."

1754
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,260
Darn it. Hey!

1755
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,860
("I've dated a guest I met
on a show.")

1756
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,090
- I'm really curious though.
- You need to be honest.

1757
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:24,260
This isn't about my opinion.
It's saying a fact.

1758
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,380
- Jong Kook is incredible.
- You can tell us if it's true.

1759
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,380
If you don't admit to it...

1760
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,010
If it's not true,
then you don't have to admit to it.

1761
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,380
- You can just not admit to it.
- Stay still.

1762
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,920
- You can just not admit to it.
- But this is...

1763
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,610
- You should reduce the standard...
- They should ask me a question...

1764
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:39,260
- that needs my opinion.
- of dating.

1765
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,860
You've been on variety shows
for a long time.

1766
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,050
I have, but...

1767
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:44,360
- You can just not admit to it.
- But this is...

1768
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,090
It could've been just flirting.

1769
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:48,360
- Between Ji Hyo and you...
- No, it's dating.

1770
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,090
They practically dated each other.

1771
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:52,860
Are you talking about Eun Hye?

1772
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,360
Are you talking about Eun Hye?

1773
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,860
- Stop it!
- I mean...

1774
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,340
- There will be other questions.
- There will be?

1775
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,010
- There will be other questions.
- I'm just curious.

1776
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:02,110
- Let's wait a bit.
- Jong Kook.

1777
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:04,210
I only made it clearer.

1778
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,380
That's not it. This way,
I can't admit to it.

1779
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:07,510
Let's wait a bit.

1780
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:09,610
Goodness, this is frustrating.

1781
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,050
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Here.

1782
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,820
He didn't admit to it. It's okay.

1783
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:14,320
Your face is really red.

1784
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,320
What? It's hot in here.
Why is it so hot in here?

1785
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,050
This time, we'll ask Jae Suk
a question.

1786
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,230
- Me? All right.
- Great.

1787
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:22,050
- You can admit to all of them.
- Come on.

1788
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,070
Just admit to all of them.

1789
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:24,420
I can admit to all of them.

1790
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,690
You have everything. What's so hard
about admitting to them?

1791
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:27,530
- I'll admit to all five questions.
- You have everything.

1792
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:29,960
- Okay. Let's start.
- What's there not to admit?

1793
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,010
"I..."

1794
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,880
"admit to all secrets of my body..."

1795
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:36,670
"that were mentioned on shows."

1796
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:37,880
("I admit to all secrets of my body
that were mentioned on shows.")

1797
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:39,820
You should admit to them.

1798
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,650
- They're really adorable.
- Of course, he should admit to it.

1799
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:42,980
They're cute.

1800
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:44,750
It's true.

1801
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,550
- They're really cute.
- It's true.

1802
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,880
- Just admit to it.
- It's the mystery of the human body.

1803
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,460
- Just admit to them.
- His body is really mysterious.

1804
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,050
- Hey.
- I thought he was Dream.

1805
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,960
- He thought you were Dream.
- Ji Hyo.

1806
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,460
He thought you were Dream.

1807
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,900
Ha Dream. Dream?

1808
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,340
- Sit down.
- Hey!

1809
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,260
- Sit down.
- You want me to admit to it?

1810
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,360
- Just admit to it.
- Just admit to it.

1811
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,010
- I can't admit to it.
- You have everything!

1812
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:06,840
- Hey!
- What's wrong with it?

1813
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,110
- You want me to admit to it?
- Just admit to it.

1814
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,780
- Just admit to it.
- Ji Hyo.

1815
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,110
Don't try so hard to deny it.

1816
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:13,480
- I'm not trying to deny it.
- Don't try so hard to deny it.

1817
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,980
It's what So Min made up.

1818
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,610
That's right.
She called it a sweet potato.

1819
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:20,210
How can it be so exaggerated when
it's just a rumor that she started?

1820
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,420
Many of his body secrets
were revealed on shows.

1821
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,550
That's not all.

1822
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:25,050
- That's right.
- You're low-chested too.

1823
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:26,820
They're talking
about your low chest.

1824
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,960
I can admit to my low chest,

1825
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,090
but it's just not true!

1826
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,170
- No, that's...
- I won't admit to it.

1827
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,230
- Why not?
- I won't admit to it.

1828
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,570
- I won't admit to it.
- Just admit to it.

1829
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:38,630
I won't admit to it.
It's just not true.

1830
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:40,610
- Just admit to it.
- It's just not true.

1831
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:42,800
- You said you'd admit to it all.
- It's just not true.

1832
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,280
He didn't admit to it.
It's good for us.

1833
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,940
- My gosh.
- Oh, right. It's good for us.

1834
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,050
- It's good for us.
- It is.

1835
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:51,780
"Running Man lasted
for 11 long years,"

1836
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:54,210
"and it's all thanks to me."

1837
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:57,590
- The thing is... Listen.
- But this isn't right.

1838
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:59,760
But you understand
what this game is about, right?

1839
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,050
Don't get confused.
You can just admit to it.

1840
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,820
- Actually...
- He's going to admit to it.

1841
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,230
- I think he'll admit to it.
- You're going to admit to this?

1842
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:07,840
- What about us?
- He did everything.

1843
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,340
If he admits to this,

1844
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,670
just change the title
to Yoo Jae Suk's Running Man.

1845
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:14,010
You know how hard he worked
in the beginning.

1846
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:15,610
But I need to admit to this
for our team.

1847
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:16,880
- That's right.
- I must admit to it.

1848
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,880
- Of course.
- I must admit to it.

1849
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,710
- Even if you admit to it,
- If I don't admit to it...

1850
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:21,710
- many people will agree.
- You deserve to admit to it.

1851
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:23,340
- I admit to it!
- There you go.

1852
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,340
Yoo Jae Suk's...

1853
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,150
- Running Man!
- Running Man!

1854
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,710
(Yoo Jae Suk's Running Man)

1855
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:29,980
It sounds so smooth.

1856
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,590
Don't walk but run!

1857
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:33,320
Please tell us why
you think that way.

1858
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,920
- Right. You need to tell us why.
- Just tell them a reason.

1859
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,670
- We contributed nothing?
- It needs to be convincing.

1860
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:38,800
I guess we meant nothing to you.

1861
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,630
- We were just...
- I guess we were nothing.

1862
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:43,070
- Look at all these scars.
- We didn't contribute at all?

1863
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:46,480
I'm not saying that I did everything
on my own.

1864
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,780
That means
you're not admitting to it.

1865
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:50,550
- Then change your answer.
- You're not admitting to it.

1866
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:51,710
It's all thanks to you.

1867
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,440
How should I say it?

1868
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,690
You need to be brazen.
It can't be helped.

1869
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:00,050
- That's right.
- You can say that I did everything.

1870
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:01,090
(You can say that I did everything.)

1871
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:03,360
- Okay?
- Give us an example.

1872
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,320
- Like what?
- There are just too many.

1873
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:08,000
You can say that I did everything.

1874
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,260
- There you go!
- He's right.

1875
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:10,360
- That's all.
- Let's move on.

1876
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,590
All right, then.

1877
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,000
(Team Jae Suk earns a point
by admitting Jae Suk's hard work.)

1878
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:15,090
"I..."

1879
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,010
"admit from
the bottom of my heart..."

1880
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,570
"that I'm the ugliest member
of Running Man."

1881
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,120
You must admit to this.

1882
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,120
This is the easiest.

1883
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,490
- What's there to think?
- This isn't hard at all.

1884
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:30,320
- It's a simple question.
- This isn't hard at all.

1885
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,950
It's disadvantageous to us.

1886
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:34,320
But do you think you're uglier
than Se Chan?

1887
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:35,990
But that's a given. Haha.

1888
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:37,200
- You can't admit to that.
- Just admit to it.

1889
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,450
As long as you're okay with it,
it's fine.

1890
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,490
Jae Suk, take off your glasses
and see for yourself.

1891
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:42,100
I'm not so sure.

1892
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,100
Jae Suk, look who's sitting
next to you.

1893
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,390
Don't forget
that you have buck teeth.

1894
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:46,390
Look at him.

1895
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:48,030
At least my teeth are straight.

1896
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:49,240
Take off your hat.

1897
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,970
I know that we both have
protruding mouths.

1898
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,240
(The man who straightened his teeth
is bragging to buck teeth.)

1899
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:53,910
(What a sight.)

1900
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:56,050
- Jae Suk.
- You're going to admit to that?

1901
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:58,240
Your teeth are really straight.

1902
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,990
- Yes, they are.
- I think...

1903
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,410
- That's why I look better.
- Besides Se Chan,

1904
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:02,410
I think you're worse than me.

1905
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,510
It's baffling to see
how brazen you are.

1906
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:07,090
- What do you mean?
- It's baffling.

1907
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:08,090
Look at him.

1908
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:10,100
I find you baffling too.

1909
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,450
- Me?
- Yes, you.

1910
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:13,820
- He has guts.
- You're not that good-looking too.

1911
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:15,220
- Still, this is...
- He thinks he's good-looking.

1912
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:17,030
I can't admit to this.

1913
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:18,470
If I take it too seriously,

1914
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:21,300
if I don't admit to them,
we can't win.

1915
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,010
- Of course.
- That's that, but...

1916
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:24,430
You can just admit
that you're the ugliest.

1917
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:26,200
- Then he shouldn't admit to it.
- Admit that you're the ugliest.

1918
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,300
- I admit to it.
- He admitted to it.

1919
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,510
- Tell us why you think you're...
- If you admit to this,

1920
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:31,240
this will be on the record.

1921
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,970
- Of course.
- Tell us a reason.

1922
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:34,220
- He admitted to it.
- Tell us why you think...

1923
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,220
you're uglier than me.

1924
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,620
- Which part and why?
- He admitted to it.

1925
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:37,850
He admitted to it already.

1926
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:40,280
From today on, the ugliest member
of Running Man...

1927
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,280
- is Jae Suk.
- Yes. It became a fact.

1928
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,990
You're actually more handsome
than him, right?

1929
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:45,800
- Of course.
- You need to tell us...

1930
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,100
which parts of Suk Jin and Se Chan
are better looking than yours.

1931
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:48,300
- Tell us.
- That's right.

1932
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,140
- Darn it!
- Honestly,

1933
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,890
- I'm pretty decent looking.
- That's true.

1934
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:56,010
But this is... Do I have to
say it specifically?

1935
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:58,200
- Of course.
- You need to tell us a reason.

1936
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,780
Of course, since you admitted to it.

1937
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,800
(Tell us one good-looking part
of Se Chan.)

1938
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:03,410
Tell us one good-looking part
of Se Chan.

1939
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:04,410
Here.

1940
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:05,740
(Here.)

1941
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:08,140
Go ahead. Which part of me
do you find handsome?

1942
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:10,320
He just shut his eyes.

1943
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:11,510
Which part of me
do you find handsome?

1944
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:12,820
He needs to compliment
Suk Jin as well.

1945
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,850
He's not telling us the reason.
That means he didn't admit to it.

1946
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:16,600
This is the worst.

1947
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,300
Come on. Tell us.

1948
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:20,490
- Tell us.
- Your gums are really pink.

1949
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:21,820
Are they? Okay. Tell us.

1950
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:22,990
- Well...
- Parts that are better than yours.

1951
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,840
Well, you are...

1952
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,300
- Am I much better?
- Which part?

1953
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,370
You find me much better?

1954
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,600
- Which part do you find handsome?
- Are you jealous of me?

1955
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,680
(Catfish induces Jae Suk
to compliment him.)

1956
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,100
- Which part of him?
- I have something...

1957
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,100
that you don't have, right?

1958
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,450
I can't admit to this!

1959
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:38,620
- No!
- I can't admit to this!

1960
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:41,050
I can't do this! I can't find it!

1961
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,740
It looks like he really can't
admit to it.

1962
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,410
- I really can't do this!
- He couldn't say anything.

1963
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:46,120
No matter how hard I tried,

1964
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,990
I couldn't find a part
that's better than mine.

1965
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:49,220
- That's good.
- I can't admit to this!

1966
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,700
- This is good.
- Well done.

1967
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:51,930
I ended up provoking him.

1968
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:53,220
He didn't admit to it. Great.

1969
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,890
He didn't admit to it.

1970
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:56,760
- Let's move on to Ji Hyo.
- Me?

1971
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,700
- You can admit to all five of them.
- It was really hard.

1972
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,300
- Admit to all of them.
- You need to admit to all of them.

1973
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,100
- Okay.
- You need to admit...

1974
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,240
to at least three of them.

1975
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,240
All right.

1976
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,850
"I..."

1977
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,410
"can name the 12 months
of the year in English..."

1978
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:12,120
"since I set it as my wallpaper
on my phone."

1979
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:14,120
If you admit to it,
you have to name them all.

1980
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,490
She must name them.

1981
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:16,950
You must name them all
if you admit to it.

1982
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:18,990
- She knows. January, February...
- I won't ask you to spell them.

1983
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:20,030
You can just name them.

1984
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,760
January, Febury...
Just name them all.

1985
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,820
- "Febury"?
- I'm just saying it as an example.

1986
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:26,870
- "Febury"?
- It's just an example.

1987
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,970
- What do you mean by "Febury"?
- Just admit to it first.

1988
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,840
Just laugh about it.

1989
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,570
- You...
- No. We will check if it's true.

1990
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:33,760
I admit it.

1991
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,240
- She admits it.
- Go ahead.

1992
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,140
- It won't count if she fails.
- Try it.

1993
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:38,300
(They will check
the veracity of her words.)

1994
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,680
- The 1st month.
- Start with the 1st month.

1995
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,240
Don't do it.

1996
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,950
Don't tell her.

1997
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:45,070
Go ahead.

1998
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:46,220
Go ahead. January.

1999
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:48,240
(Will Ji Hyo be able
to say the 12 months in English?)

2000
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,410
- Ja.
- There you go.

2001
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:51,010
- You studied.
- Ja.

2002
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:52,950
- What comes next?
- January.

2003
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,180
- There you go.
- Okay.

2004
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,350
February.

2005
01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:57,850
- February.
- She knows.

2006
01:03:57,850 --> 01:03:59,350
- Ji Hyo studied.
- You memorized them.

2007
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:00,930
I deny it.

2008
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:02,260
(She suddenly denies it!)

2009
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:03,760
You memorized them.

2010
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,390
I deny it.

2011
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:06,840
(The English calendar stops
at February.)

2012
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,930
- She couldn't get past February.
- There we go.

2013
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:10,870
You memorized them.

2014
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,930
I just memorized the latter months.

2015
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:14,050
She is so cute.

2016
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,350
(This man finds her cute as well.)

2017
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:16,370
That was so funny.

2018
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:17,550
Next.

2019
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,280
"My ideal type of man
is Kim Jong Kook,"

2020
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,410
"and he makes my heart flutter."

2021
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:22,720
(My ideal type of man is Kim Jong Kook,
and he makes my heart flutter.)

2022
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,410
- Hey.
- Answer with seriousness.

2023
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:25,760
- This one is...
- Ji Hyo.

2024
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,720
- She isn't averse to it these days.
- It's okay.

2025
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,850
There hasn't been
an official question like this one.

2026
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:31,990
Just admit it. He is charming...

2027
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:33,100
- Admitting it...
- He said that you were charming.

2028
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,370
will put Jong Kook in a pickle.

2029
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,070
- It's Ji Hyo's one-sided love.
- Isn't that right?

2030
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:37,570
It's just how you feel.

2031
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:39,990
It's not like you will confess,
so it doesn't matter.

2032
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:41,430
Your heart should flutter even now.

2033
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:42,760
The statement says,
"He makes my heart flutter."

2034
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,410
- No.
- Suk Jin is right.

2035
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:46,180
- It's "He makes my heart flutter."
- Really?

2036
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:48,140
Then it can stop fluttering
tomorrow.

2037
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:50,280
- That's right.
- It will flutter just for today.

2038
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,470
That's impossible.

2039
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,720
Why is that possible?

2040
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,090
- It can stop fluttering tomorrow.
- Come on.

2041
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:55,590
- I don't know.
- That's ridiculous.

2042
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:57,090
It can stop fluttering tomorrow.

2043
01:04:58,010 --> 01:04:59,050
This is...

2044
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:01,180
- a matter of Ji Hyo's pride.
- That's right.

2045
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:03,820
- I foresee many articles.
- This isn't about the character.

2046
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,930
- I foresee many articles this week.
- That's right.

2047
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:07,430
- You need to reveal why...
- That's right.

2048
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:08,490
he makes your heart flutter.

2049
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:10,640
You need to reveal why
I am your ideal type.

2050
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,100
The moment will pass.

2051
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:14,370
Just say your heart flutters...

2052
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:15,970
when he smiles at you.

2053
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:17,430
- You need to reveal the details.
- Just say something like that.

2054
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:18,970
- Don't control her.
- What?

2055
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:20,640
- My goodness.
- "Don't control her."

2056
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,300
I didn't control her.

2057
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,680
I just gave her advice.

2058
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,070
Hold up the "I admit it" sign.

2059
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:26,550
- I admit it.
- Okay.

2060
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:28,010
(She admits it.)

2061
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:30,280
Okay. Reveal the details.

2062
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,410
(Okay. Reveal the details.)

2063
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:34,120
Reveal why I am your ideal type.

2064
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,030
- What do you like about him?
- Reveal it.

2065
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:37,550
Hold on.
Why are you telling her to do that?

2066
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:39,660
- She needs to give her reasons.
- Does he make your heart flutter?

2067
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,990
What is up with you?

2068
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:42,870
- Are you excited?
- She needs to give her reasons.

2069
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:44,930
- Why are you excited?
- She admitted it.

2070
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:46,840
- Why are you excited?
- She admitted it,

2071
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,530
- so she needs to give her reasons.
- Well...

2072
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,930
- Go on.
- Everything she says will be real.

2073
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:52,340
Reporters, take notes.

2074
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:53,950
He urged the reporters
to take notes.

2075
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:54,950
(The reasons why Jong Kook makes
Ji Hyo's heart flutter)

2076
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,600
- Just say it.
- He is dependable.

2077
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,950
- He is dependable.
- She likes dependable men.

2078
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:01,680
- He looks after me.
- He looks after you.

2079
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:03,010
He eats well.

2080
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:05,510
He drives a Mercedes-Benz G-class.

2081
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:07,160
He lives in Apgujeong-dong.

2082
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,760
Really?

2083
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,600
"He lives in Apgujeong-dong."

2084
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:12,990
- He has so many charms.
- Seriously.

2085
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:14,620
- That counts.
- That counts.

2086
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:16,660
Why do I make your heart flutter?

2087
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,530
- What?
- Tell him the reasons.

2088
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,200
(Why do I make your heart flutter?)

2089
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,840
- Tell him the reasons.
- What is up with him?

2090
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,300
- Tell him the reasons.
- Listen.

2091
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:26,910
- She needs to answer that too.
- Talk among yourselves.

2092
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:28,450
- Do you want to hear more?
- I mean...

2093
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:29,850
she should reveal
why I make her heart flutter.

2094
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,680
Call her if you want to hear more.

2095
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,680
- I will call you later.
- That's right.

2096
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,910
That counts. Haha is up next.

2097
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:38,390
I will admit it
no matter what the statement is.

2098
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:40,220
- Let's do that.
- This is getting boring.

2099
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:42,120
"I am 168cm tall."

2100
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:44,220
Hey, I am 171.5cm tall.

2101
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:45,430
Hey!

2102
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,870
(He denies it
in the speed of light.)

2103
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:48,890
- Hey!
- What?

2104
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:50,700
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey.

2105
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,870
- I am 171.5cm tall.
- Think about it.

2106
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:54,530
If I am in a good condition,
I am 172cm tall.

2107
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:55,840
Think about it.

2108
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,200
That's my actual height.

2109
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,470
There is no way you are 172cm tall.

2110
01:06:58,470 --> 01:06:59,640
- Seriously.
- I am 172cm tall.

2111
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,410
- I am 172cm tall.
- Yoon Jong Shin...

2112
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:03,450
and Jang Hang Jun admitted it.

2113
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:05,850
- I give hope to Shorry.
- Don't say anything.

2114
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:08,510
- Why won't he admit it?
- He denied it.

2115
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:09,640
I give hope to Shorry.

2116
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,760
I am the tallest
among the short ones.

2117
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,820
You should admit this one.

2118
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,620
Jong Kook, I can't do that.

2119
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,850
- There isn't much of a difference.
- Jong Kook.

2120
01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:18,160
I am the only celebrity...

2121
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,570
whose height is in the tenth digit
on the search engine profile.

2122
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:23,200
- It means a lot to me.
- Hey.

2123
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,340
What's your exact height?

2124
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,760
I am 171.5cm tall.

2125
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,300
- Haha, I am 172cm tall.
- If I am in a good condition...

2126
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,910
You are 177cm tall, you punk.

2127
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:31,100
No, I am not.

2128
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,300
I am 172cm tall.

2129
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,370
Let's measure his height.

2130
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:35,550
If I am in a good condition...

2131
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:37,050
- I am serious.
- So you deny it.

2132
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:38,180
I am serious.

2133
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,510
- The next team.
- You should think about the team.

2134
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:41,890
I would admit to anything
but this one.

2135
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:43,450
He doesn't think about the team.

2136
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:45,820
Anything but this one.

2137
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,090
(Haha is past
the statement about his height.)

2138
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:48,530
"My YouTube channel..."

2139
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:50,160
"isn't worth watching."

2140
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,930
- I deny it.
- Hey.

2141
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:53,120
Hey!

2142
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:54,990
I can't admit it.

2143
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,530
If I were to rank...

2144
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,760
the importance,

2145
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:58,990
this is the most important.

2146
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:02,240
- Haha PD is the most important.
- Hey.

2147
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:03,700
After that comes Running Man...

2148
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:04,970
and How Do You Play?.

2149
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:08,010
I put my life on my YouTube channel.

2150
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:09,780
Are you out of your mind?

2151
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:11,370
(He puts his life on anything.)

2152
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:12,910
I can't admit it.

2153
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:14,510
- Just admit it.
- I can't.

2154
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:15,720
- This is the most important.
- Hey.

2155
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,120
- This is the most important.
- Se Chan is the last one.

2156
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,720
- Se Chan.
- Jae Suk.

2157
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,450
This is meaningless to me.
I will admit five statements.

2158
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:21,720
They can't be that bad.

2159
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,320
- Go ahead.
- This is meaningless to me.

2160
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,450
All right.

2161
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,760
"After watching closely
for four years,"

2162
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,100
"I don't know why
Yoo Jae Suk is the national host."

2163
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:31,200
For goodness' sake.

2164
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,700
I don't know who came up
with that statement.

2165
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,530
- Admit it.
- I can't admit it.

2166
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,300
My colleagues and junior comedians
will watch this.

2167
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:41,280
- You are a great host.
- Admit it.

2168
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:42,410
That isn't important.

2169
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:44,120
If I admit it,
I won't have anything to say.

2170
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,410
Who raised you?

2171
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:47,280
You did well on your own,
but someone helped you.

2172
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,410
Just admit it.

2173
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:51,010
Is that what you really think?

2174
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:52,260
- That statement...
- I guess...

2175
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:54,180
comedians say that when they meet up
for "Comedy Big League".

2176
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:55,820
- Hey.
- You thought he was legendary.

2177
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:58,200
But after a few years,
you realized that he isn't so great.

2178
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,700
For attacking Jae Suk once,

2179
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,070
- Yes, I remember.
- I struggled for three years.

2180
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:03,620
- That's right.
- Three years.

2181
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:05,140
Just deny it.

2182
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,240
I deny it. I can't admit it.

2183
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,340
- Come on.
- I can't. I deny it.

2184
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,800
- I deny it.
- You deny it.

2185
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,410
- Okay.
- That's good.

2186
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:14,050
"I want..."

2187
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,120
"to quit Jong Kook's soccer club
because paying the fee is..."

2188
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,280
"a waste of money."

2189
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,370
(I want to quit
Jong Kook's soccer club...)

2190
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:20,490
(because paying the fee is
a waste of money.)

2191
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,120
(I am sure he will deny it.)

2192
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,320
I bet you think
it's a waste of money.

2193
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,620
- Hold on.
- I bet you do.

2194
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:27,350
You were a struggling comedian.

2195
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:28,850
I bet you think
it's a waste of money.

2196
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:30,260
- Se Chan.
- Is it 50 dollars...

2197
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,200
Is it 50 dollars
for people in their 30s?

2198
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,530
- Se Chan.
- It's 40 dollars.

2199
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:34,660
- It's 40 dollars.
- Se Chan.

2200
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:36,390
You pay 40 dollars
even though you don't go there.

2201
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:39,240
You play golf all the time
even though it's expensive.

2202
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:41,200
- You have to make up your mind.
- That's right.

2203
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,530
- Just admit it.
- Explain yourself then.

2204
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:45,370
- Explain yourself then.
- Say why you think it's a waste.

2205
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:47,240
You know how serious Jong Kook is
about soccer.

2206
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,850
I will make an announcement
in the group chat room.

2207
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:51,950
I will say
that Se Chan wants to quit.

2208
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,550
- You won't quit anyway.
- You won't quit anyway.

2209
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:56,190
- You pay the fee every month.
- Jong Kook is joking around.

2210
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:57,390
I don't know what to do.

2211
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,690
"Se Chan..."

2212
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:01,980
- "Se Chan wants to quit."
- He thinks it's a waste of money.

2213
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:03,120
I will do it.

2214
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,300
- You think it's a waste of money.
- Admit it.

2215
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,930
I don't think...

2216
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:08,520
I admit it.

2217
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:09,690
Okay.

2218
01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:11,030
I don't think it's a waste of money.

2219
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:12,360
- Okay.
- Please take his phone.

2220
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:13,770
We are filming.

2221
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:15,230
- We are filming.
- Hold on.

2222
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:16,640
- Listen.
- I will make an announcement.

2223
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,940
- I mean...
- "Se Chan..."

2224
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:20,230
Hold on. Don't go that far.

2225
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:21,510
Let go of me.

2226
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:22,900
- "Se Chan..."
- Jong Kook.

2227
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,150
- "will quit."
- Don't do that.

2228
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:25,220
Come on.

2229
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:27,720
- I did it to win a point.
- "He will quit."

2230
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:28,910
It's a good opportunity.

2231
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:30,090
- Don't be ridiculous.
- "Se Chan will quit."

2232
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:31,950
I sent the message
to the group chat room.

2233
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,390
"Se Chan will quit."

2234
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:35,980
- I sent the message.
- I did it to win a point.

2235
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:38,120
- To be honest...
- Give your reasons.

2236
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,470
- He doesn't want to quit.
- Give your reasons.

2237
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:41,600
That's right.

2238
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:43,690
(Chuckling)

2239
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:45,230
- Does the club embarrass you?
- Is it bothersome?

2240
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:47,400
- Does the club embarrass you?
- You like golf, but not soccer.

2241
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,200
You like golf, but...

2242
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,370
The thing is,

2243
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:52,680
I pay 40 dollars.

2244
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,740
I gave it some thought.

2245
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:57,350
Even when we didn't meet up
due to COVID-19,

2246
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:59,570
- we paid the fees.
- Of course.

2247
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:00,740
- Hey.
- Fees are like that.

2248
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:03,910
You pay 250 dollars at a time
to play golf.

2249
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:05,650
- Is 40 dollars too much?
- Hold on.

2250
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,480
Hold on.

2251
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,560
- Is 40 dollars a month too much?
- Hold on.

2252
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,280
- No. That's not what he is saying.
- How can you say that?

2253
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,490
Are you saying
Jong Kook stole the money?

2254
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:13,990
(Are you saying
Jong Kook stole the money?)

2255
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:15,360
Is that what you are saying?

2256
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,730
I can't believe it.

2257
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:17,730
That's what you are saying.

2258
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:18,860
How could you say that?

2259
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:20,270
Why did you kick the hornet's nest?

2260
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,560
That's what you are saying.

2261
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,340
- Me?
- That's what you are saying.

2262
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,440
- I didn't steal anything.
- You are saying...

2263
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:28,570
he stole 40 dollars from everyone...

2264
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:30,870
- and put it in his pocket.
- I pay 100 dollars.

2265
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:33,220
Hold on. I know that you pay
a lot of money.

2266
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:34,410
I will explain.

2267
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:36,280
To be honest,
I do like golf better these days.

2268
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:37,720
That's why...

2269
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:39,390
That's why...

2270
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:42,090
- Jong Kook.
- He is serious.

2271
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,760
- That's how he really feels.
- Hey.

2272
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,520
Sit down.

2273
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:48,190
This is annoying.

2274
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:49,820
(Laughing)

2275
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:51,600
- Please cover for me.
- Don't worry.

2276
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:54,060
You should cover for me,
not laugh about this.

2277
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,270
- I will cover for you. Don't worry.
- Please do that.

2278
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,440
- Jong Kook.
- How will you cover for him?

2279
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:00,030
What do you know about soccer?

2280
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:01,680
How will you cover for him?

2281
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,740
- How will you do that?
- Hurry up and cover for me.

2282
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:04,870
How will you do that?

2283
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:06,240
I will play soccer
in Se Chan's stead.

2284
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,190
(I will play soccer
in Se Chan's stead.)

2285
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,440
(He will be a substitute.)

2286
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,650
Will you play soccer in his stead?

2287
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:13,520
- That works.
- I will do that.

2288
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,650
- Really?
- I will play soccer.

2289
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:16,590
- That works.
- Okay.

2290
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:18,860
The fee is 70 dollars
for people in their 50s.

2291
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,560
- But...
- He should pay 100 dollars.

2292
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,190
- You should pay 100 dollars.
- I will pay 100 dollars.

2293
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:23,270
- Okay.
- I will pay 100 dollars.

2294
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:24,470
- Pay 100 dollars a day.
- That's so funny.

2295
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:25,900
The money will be used
to pay for beverages...

2296
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:27,360
and snacks.

2297
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,560
I admitted it for a point.

2298
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,810
I will bring a member.

2299
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:33,180
Here comes the next statement.

2300
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:34,810
The statements are intense.

2301
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:37,440
"To me, Suk Jin is
a great man and a role model."

2302
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:39,240
- Deny it.
- I totally deny it.

2303
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,940
(He doesn't hesitate.)

2304
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:44,090
A great man, my foot!
There is nothing to learn.

2305
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:45,980
(He can't admit
that Suk Jin is a great man.)

2306
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,110
There is nothing to learn.
I deny it.

2307
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:48,560
I don't need to say anything else.

2308
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:51,020
It's a waste of time.

2309
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:52,360
This is a statement we should skip.

2310
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,120
- A great man?
- He said, "A great man, my foot!"

2311
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,900
- "A great man, my foot!"
- "My foot"?

2312
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:58,360
He is just an old man.

2313
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,770
- He is just an old man.
- An old man.

2314
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:01,030
- An old man.
- An old man.

2315
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:02,560
- An old man.
- An old man.

2316
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:03,700
(They received
all of the statements.)

2317
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:04,980
As a result,

2318
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:07,550
- the score is 7 to 7.
- Is it a tie?

2319
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,050
- Really?
- Within the teams...

2320
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:10,740
- The winners are the ones...
- Three.

2321
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:13,480
who admitted three statements,
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.

2322
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:15,350
- Okay.
- Thank goodness.

2323
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:16,780
All right.

2324
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:18,950
Here comes the food.

2325
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:21,560
- We are okay so far.
- We are okay.

2326
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,860
This place has tasty doughnuts.

2327
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:26,260
(Here come the doughnuts.)

2328
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:28,730
The basic one is tasty.

2329
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:29,930
This one is tasty too.

2330
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:31,030
(There is sweetness
both inside and outside.)

2331
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:33,100
These are the doughnuts...

2332
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,860
you would see in a cartoon.

2333
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,530
(You can feel the sweetness
by looking at the doughnut set.)

2334
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:37,770
My goodness.

2335
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:39,370
I don't think I can eat them.

2336
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,480
Here come the cold kimchi noodles.

2337
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,150
(The cold kimchi noodles are served
for Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

2338
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:46,240
- All right.
- Give me some.

2339
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,720
I will eat a lot.

2340
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,050
(Penalty balls will be added
if they leave food behind!)

2341
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:51,110
Do we need to finish
the drinks as well?

2342
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:52,150
Yes.

2343
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,020
Why?

2344
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:55,430
(They eat diligently
to avoid the penalty badges.)

2345
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:56,730
- It's so sweet.
- It's really tasty.

2346
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:58,320
Eat this.

2347
01:13:58,650 --> 01:13:59,860
My goodness.

2348
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,490
(Ji Hyo and Jong Kook have
cold kimchi noodles.)

2349
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:03,520
This is really hard.

2350
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,970
I haven't had
something so sweet recently.

2351
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:07,230
Let's receive the penalty badge.
We can't finish them.

2352
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:09,700
These are too sweet for me.

2353
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,570
You can choose the next menu
in advance.

2354
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:14,770
Cold buckwheat noodles.
That would be a good dish.

2355
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:16,180
I want it.

2356
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,810
It reached his mouth right away.

2357
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,480
- Thank you for the food.
- Let's eat it.

2358
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:21,850
It's okay.

2359
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:22,980
(They clear the bowl easily.)

2360
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,190
Keep eating.

2361
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:25,950
It looks tasty.

2362
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:27,220
It's too rich for me.

2363
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:29,450
I am practically dying over here.

2364
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:31,100
It is quite rich.

2365
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,150
- You couldn't finish the food.
- No.

2366
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:35,400
The three of you will receive
an additional penalty ball.

2367
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,930
I like such dishes.

2368
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:38,160
(It's the last mission place,
C pizza place in Shinsa-dong.)

2369
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:41,030
It's the last step to become
ladies and gentlemen.

2370
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:43,970
It's the Empty Head
English Speed Game.

2371
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:45,010
(The Empty Head English Speed Game)

2372
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:47,900
- There is no hope.
- We need So Min for this.

2373
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:51,680
- So Min.
- She would have made me look good.

2374
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,680
- We need So Min for this.
- So Min.

2375
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,690
One member will give the question...

2376
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:56,690
and five members will answer.

2377
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:58,610
The member
who gets the correct answer...

2378
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:00,560
will pick the next person
to ask the question.

2379
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:02,590
Then that member
will ask the next question.

2380
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,100
Can you pick the same person?

2381
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,300
- It doesn't matter.
- I see.

2382
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:09,270
But we distributed the points
to match the English skills.

2383
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:12,300
If you answer Jong Kook's question,
you will only receive one point.

2384
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,440
(Jong Kook's question
is worth 1 point.)

2385
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,640
Jae Suk and Suk Jin's questions
are worth two points.

2386
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,400
If you answer their questions...

2387
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,770
- I should be in that group.
- They are good.

2388
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:20,810
(He is brazen.)

2389
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:23,180
- Haha.
- I am not in Se Chan's group.

2390
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:24,940
Haha, Ji Hyo, and Se Chan's
questions are worth three points.

2391
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:25,980
No way.

2392
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:28,690
(Haha is upset
that he is on Se Chan's level.)

2393
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,090
They divided up the members.

2394
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:31,110
I am not in his group.

2395
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:33,020
- Haha is slightly better.
- He is an ace player.

2396
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:35,450
Haha and Ji Hyo's questions
should be worth three points...

2397
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:37,060
and Se Chan's questions
should be worth five points.

2398
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:38,820
Seriously. My questions
should be worth five points.

2399
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:40,600
Okay. Let's do this.

2400
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:46,760
You will play the game
for five minutes.

2401
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,520
The number of badges
you receive will match...

2402
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,260
the number of questions
you answer correctly.

2403
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:52,320
So you can win up to five badges.

2404
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,970
After five minutes,
the winner will be decided.

2405
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:57,470
- Okay.
- Okay. We understand.

2406
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:59,610
Let's try to get
the three-point question right.

2407
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:00,870
- Okay.
- Ji Hyo's question.

2408
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:01,870
Ji Hyo's question.

2409
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:04,270
- Will Ji Hyo go first?
- I am on Ji Hyo's level,

2410
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:06,050
- so I can understand her better.
- Ji Hyo.

2411
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:07,820
- You can't use gestures.
- Make it easy.

2412
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:09,070
- Okay.
- Make it easy.

2413
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:10,610
- Ready.
- Tell us about the subject first.

2414
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:11,690
Set.

2415
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:13,220
Go.

2416
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:15,280
- What?
- Go.

2417
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:18,390
(Sighing)

2418
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,020
- What?
- Is it difficult?

2419
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,020
Is it difficult?

2420
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,320
Son.

2421
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,400
- Sun.
- Sun.

2422
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,470
- Son.
- Sun.

2423
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:26,430
Sun. A four-character idiom?

2424
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:27,490
- Land.
- You can't...

2425
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:29,570
- speak Korean.
- Rice cake.

2426
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:31,110
Rice cake?

2427
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:32,700
Patbingsu. Dessert.

2428
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,510
- Tteokguk?
- No.

2429
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:35,510
I guess it's tteokguk.

2430
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:36,730
- Food?
- Listen.

2431
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:38,010
(The answer is revealed.)

2432
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,110
- Food.
- Sun?

2433
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:40,150
Songpyeon.

2434
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:42,320
- Son.
- It's the sun.

2435
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:44,650
- Sun and rice?
- Rice cake.

2436
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:45,650
One more.

2437
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:47,390
- One more?
- I see.

2438
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:48,390
Sun and rice?

2439
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,910
- New year.
- Gosh, son!

2440
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:51,930
- What?
- "Gosh, sun?"

2441
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:53,820
You should give an answer.

2442
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:56,020
Are you saying S-O-N or S-U-N?

2443
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:57,770
- You mean a son?
- S-U-N.

2444
01:16:57,770 --> 01:17:00,230
- Sun?
- Oh, it's S-O-N.

2445
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:01,970
- I see. It's a son.
- I see.

2446
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:03,030
Son.

2447
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,100
Boy.

2448
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,270
- Boy.
- Boy bread?

2449
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:07,230
- Boy rice cake.
- Son rice cake.

2450
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:09,640
Son and daughter.

2451
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,700
It's no use raising
sons and daughters.

2452
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:12,700
(It's no use raising
sons and daughters.)

2453
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,270
Live happily
with sons and daughters.

2454
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,320
- Gosh.
- What about a son?

2455
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,850
- What?
- Say something.

2456
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:17,890
Is it a proverb?

2457
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:19,650
- It's a proverb.
- I get it.

2458
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:21,820
- Son and daughter.
- Birthday cake.

2459
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:23,020
You give an extra rice cake
to someone you hate.

2460
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:24,020
That's right.

2461
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,320
- Is that it?
- How could it be...

2462
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,560
- I don't get it.
- Hey, you should've said "hate".

2463
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,600
- You should say "hate".
- Let's move on.

2464
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,430
- Tell us who will go next.
- Move on.

2465
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:31,570
Hurry. We don't have time.

2466
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:32,660
- The one with the highest scores.
- Se Chan.

2467
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,770
- Okay.
- Rice cake? My gosh.

2468
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:37,140
- Here we go!
- What?

2469
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:38,400
(Here we go!)

2470
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:39,970
What?

2471
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,330
- Celebrity?
- Yes. Celebrity.

2472
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:43,330
- Celeb.
- Celeb.

2473
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:45,110
- An American celeb.
- An American celeb.

2474
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:48,180
Do you know... Coin?

2475
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:49,910
(Coin and an American celeb)

2476
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:51,910
- Yes.
- Bit Coin.

2477
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:53,110
- It is...
- Coin.

2478
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:54,280
- Bit Coin.
- Elon Musk.

2479
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,320
- Yes! Haha.
- It's Elon Musk.

2480
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,560
I knew you'd pick me.

2481
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:00,080
- I didn't recall his name.
- Elon Musk.

2482
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,860
- Let me start.
- A celebrity?

2483
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:03,100
(Haha who claims to be different
from Se Chan goes next.)

2484
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:04,730
Another celeb?

2485
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,020
(Corrupt official)

2486
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,030
(It's not easy to explain.)

2487
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:09,330
Difficult?

2488
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:11,730
- Difficult?
- It's a job.

2489
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:13,940
- Job?
- A job name.

2490
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:15,940
- Joseon.
- Joseon.

2491
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:17,180
- Joseon.
- Yes.

2492
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:18,870
- Undercover emissary.
- No.

2493
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,900
- A policeman?
- A four-syllable word.

2494
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,320
- Yes.
- A four-syllable word.

2495
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,720
- Duck.
- What?

2496
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,190
- Duck.
- Duck?

2497
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:26,740
- Duck?
- Let me answer.

2498
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:28,910
(Corrupt official!)

2499
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:30,650
- Corrupt official!
- Corrupt official!

2500
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,450
- Jae Suk was fast.
- I got it, right?

2501
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:35,490
- I said I'd answer.
- I was faster.

2502
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:36,930
That doesn't make sense.

2503
01:18:36,930 --> 01:18:38,820
You should give me
a chance to answer.

2504
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:40,730
- You're like a corrupt official.
- No.

2505
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:41,940
This is ridiculous.

2506
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:43,440
Stop it, Mr. Underpants.

2507
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,200
- Why are you being like this?
- I said I'd answer.

2508
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,940
I'll give both of you the point.

2509
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:47,980
Okay.

2510
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:50,510
All right. It's a celeb.

2511
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:53,310
- A celeb?
- Yes.

2512
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:56,850
(The celebrity of the century,
Einstein)

2513
01:18:57,070 --> 01:18:58,610
- Yes.
- No gestures.

2514
01:18:58,610 --> 01:18:59,820
- Okay.
- No moves.

2515
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:01,450
Helicobacter pylori?

2516
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:03,110
- What?
- Let me answer.

2517
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:04,650
- Pasteur.
- Let me answer.

2518
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:06,520
(Pasteur, Metchnikoff)

2519
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,400
- Pasteur.
- Pasteur.

2520
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,950
- It's almost the same.
- Same?

2521
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:13,190
- Something like that.
- Five syllables.

2522
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:15,470
- A five-syllable word.
- A five-syllable word.

2523
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,330
- The name is almost the same.
- Yes.

2524
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:19,160
- A Korean celeb.
- Okay.

2525
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:22,200
A member of MSG Wannabe.

2526
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,700
- KCM?
- No.

2527
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:25,810
No? Gosh.

2528
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:27,310
Let me answer. Einstein.

2529
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:28,410
- Yes.
- What?

2530
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,220
- What? Einstein?
- I was going to say that.

2531
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:31,610
How is it Einstein?

2532
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:33,610
What does Einstein have to do
with Helicobacter pylori?

2533
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:35,110
- It's math.
- It sounds similar.

2534
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:37,820
- Einstein.
- Okay. Well done. Thank you.

2535
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:39,930
- Who's next?
- Haha.

2536
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:41,020
- Okay.
- I hope it's a celebrity.

2537
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,100
I should've said Einstein.

2538
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:43,430
- A celeb.
- A celeb?

2539
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:45,490
No celeb? A celeb?

2540
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:46,730
(It's like a default question.)

2541
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:48,770
- A four-syllable word.
- Okay.

2542
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:50,600
I guess it's a four-character idiom.

2543
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,030
- The first word.
- Yes.

2544
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:54,330
Gold.

2545
01:19:54,330 --> 01:19:55,980
- Gold.
- Adding flowers to embroidery.

2546
01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:57,510
Gold.

2547
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:59,270
(- Gold.
- Adding flowers to embroidery.)

2548
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:01,110
Returning home in glory.

2549
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:02,270
(Returning home in glory)

2550
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:05,480
(The empty heads
understand each other.)

2551
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:06,690
Empty.

2552
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:08,820
- Empty.
- That's the only word I know.

2553
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,690
How did he know that?

2554
01:20:10,690 --> 01:20:11,690
(Next up is Jae Suk who is
tired of the silly explanations.)

2555
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:14,260
- Yes.
- Yes. A four-syllable word?

2556
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:15,450
A celeb?

2557
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:19,070
- This is fun.
- It's a proverb.

2558
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,020
- Okay. Yes.
- A proverb.

2559
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,230
- A proverb.
- Right.

2560
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:23,830
Eat eggs.

2561
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:25,310
Hitting a rock with an egg.

2562
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:26,310
Eat birds.

2563
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:28,810
- Birds.
- Eat birds, eat eggs.

2564
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:30,570
- Eat eggs.
- Birds that get up early...

2565
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:32,940
- Eat eggs, eat rocks.
- Let me answer.

2566
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,910
- Eating a pheasant and its eggs.
- That's right.

2567
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:37,550
(They can answer no matter
how lame the explanation is.)

2568
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:39,850
- Who?
- My gosh.

2569
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:41,610
All right. Se Chan.

2570
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:43,950
- Eating a pheasant and its eggs?
- How did you know that?

2571
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:45,190
- That was unbelievable.
- Let's go.

2572
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:46,320
(What about this time?)

2573
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,480
We're pretty good.

2574
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:49,860
- Bird.
- Bird.

2575
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:51,230
- Bird.
- Bird's foot.

2576
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:52,600
Bird.

2577
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,470
(Bird!)

2578
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:56,440
- Bird's foot?
- Blood in a bird's foot.

2579
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,470
Correct.

2580
01:20:58,030 --> 01:21:00,940
(They got it right
only with two words.)

2581
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:03,510
(He's even more surprised
by the answer.)

2582
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:07,570
(It is a good thing
that they don't know many words.)

2583
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:09,270
(This is so easy for them.)

2584
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:11,610
- Bird's foot?
- Bird's foot.

2585
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:14,110
- A bird's foot.
- Haha is next.

2586
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:15,910
- Okay.
- Blood in a bird's foot.

2587
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:17,720
- Bird's foot.
- Bird's foot.

2588
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,020
- Blood in a bird's foot.
- Haha, please begin.

2589
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:21,450
Oh my gosh.

2590
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:23,490
- Long?
- A celeb.

2591
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:25,120
- A celeb.
- Yes.

2592
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:28,330
- My sister, Ji Hyo.
- Yes.

2593
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:31,770
Favorite...

2594
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:33,700
- American.
- An American celeb?

2595
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:35,110
- Superstar.
- Superstar?

2596
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:36,510
- Michael Jackson?
- Yes.

2597
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:38,610
(An American superstar?)

2598
01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:40,680
(Madame Curie is
a French scientist.)

2599
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:43,220
- Why you...
- Married.

2600
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:44,850
- Married?
- Married.

2601
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:46,940
(The reason why Madame Curie
is Ji Hyo's favorite superstar...)

2602
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:51,230
(Episode 460,
what's your favorite book?)

2603
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,760
(Ji Hyo said "Madame Oat".)

2604
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,490
(Ji Hyo's favorite biography,
"Madame Oat")

2605
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,140
(Ji Hyo's favorite superstar)

2606
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:05,570
(Mrs. Curie)

2607
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:06,940
- Well...
- Beyonce.

2608
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:08,510
- No.
- Married?

2609
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:10,310
Very smart.

2610
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:11,510
Ji Hyo should know that.

2611
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,310
I get it. Madame Curie!

2612
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:14,310
Yes!

2613
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:16,820
(The empty heads' telepathy again)

2614
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:18,020
- Yes!
- How did he know that?

2615
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:20,080
It was a lucky guess.

2616
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,910
- Madame Curie.
- Madame Curie?

2617
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:23,450
Okay. Madame Curie.

2618
01:22:23,450 --> 01:22:25,690
- Ji Hyo...
- Madame Curie?

2619
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:27,320
- She said Madame Oat.
- Right. Ji Hyo likes her.

2620
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,300
It's Madame Oat.

2621
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:31,860
- My gosh. It's long.
- This is fun.

2622
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:34,020
- Long.
- It's a long word.

2623
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,140
- Four.
- A four-syllable word?

2624
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:37,970
- No, it's long.
- Long.

2625
01:22:37,970 --> 01:22:39,970
- Four?
- Four.

2626
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:41,940
Ball.

2627
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:43,680
- Four.
- Marbles.

2628
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,650
Let me answer.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.

2629
01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:47,200
- Nice.
- My gosh.

2630
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,070
This is working.

2631
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:50,610
How did he figure that out?

2632
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,410
- Four balls?
- Okay.

2633
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:53,740
He's good at this.

2634
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:54,890
Good.

2635
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:57,320
- My goodness.
- Why?

2636
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:01,300
- A very famous movie.
- Celeb?

2637
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:02,600
- Movie.
- It's a movie.

2638
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,600
A three-syllable word.

2639
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,820
- Three syllables.
- Yes.

2640
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:06,600
- Vegetarian.
- Let me answer.

2641
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,820
"Parasite".

2642
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:09,470
- No.
- Vegetarian?

2643
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:11,660
Yes. Vegetarian.

2644
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:13,230
"Minari".

2645
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:15,310
(Minari!)

2646
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:17,700
(How did he know that?)

2647
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,650
Yes! "Minari".

2648
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:21,820
I just can't do this.

2649
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:23,320
I know.

2650
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:24,570
(The game is over after
a series of surprising answers.)

2651
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,080
- Vegetarian?
- Vegetarian.

2652
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,580
- "Minari".
- "Minari".

2653
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:30,480
- I'll announce the results.
- I bet Jae Suk wins.

2654
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,520
No.

2655
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,020
- I think it's Jae Suk.
- Right.

2656
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:35,400
The winner is Jae Suk.

2657
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,930
(1st place Yoo Jae Suk)

2658
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,690
Jae Suk answered most
of the three-point questions.

2659
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:42,030
He answered all my questions.

2660
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:43,730
- Right. He did.
- I also answered many questions.

2661
01:23:43,730 --> 01:23:46,640
- We will bring in the last dish.
- Okay.

2662
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:48,680
(The last dish has
a lot of cheese on it.)

2663
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,680
- It looks delicious.
- Look at the cheese.

2664
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,570
- It has a lot of cheese.
- This is amazing.

2665
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:54,820
This is great for the first meal.

2666
01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:57,020
It would be nice to bring it home
and eat it with my family.

2667
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:58,580
That's a lot of cheese.

2668
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:00,520
Is that one piece?

2669
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,020
- It's big.
- It's like a whole pizza.

2670
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:05,520
- It's as big as a whole pizza.
- This can't be a piece.

2671
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,020
This is Italian pizza.

2672
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:09,450
The dough is focaccia.

2673
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:10,820
- Fucaccia?
- Focaccia.

2674
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:12,470
- Fuca what?
- It's Italian bread.

2675
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:14,230
- Focaccia.
- Celeb?

2676
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:17,400
- Focaccia?
- Celeb?

2677
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:21,200
(Jae Suk enjoys ramyeon and coffee
with Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

2678
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,200
This is good.

2679
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,200
- It's good.
- It's spicy though.

2680
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,650
(He finished ramyeon immediately
enjoying the taste of Korea.)

2681
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:27,180
It's spicy
because of Cheongyang chili.

2682
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:28,610
(He finished ramyeon immediately
enjoying the taste of Korea.)

2683
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:30,520
Do you have a hot sauce?

2684
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,440
(Se Chan, Suk Jin, and Haha
enjoy the huge pizza.)

2685
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:33,820
Gosh, Italy?

2686
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:34,910
Italy?

2687
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:36,520
This is so greasy.

2688
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,650
It's good though.

2689
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:39,580
It would've been nice
if this was my first meal.

2690
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:42,300
It is good, but I can't eat it.

2691
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:44,430
It is delicious,
but I can't eat it now.

2692
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:47,070
Let me answer the results
of today's race then.

2693
01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:48,230
Gosh, I'm so full.

2694
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:50,730
The two members with the most badges
won't get the penalty.

2695
01:24:50,730 --> 01:24:53,640
What matters is
who will get the penalty.

2696
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:56,640
The member with the most badges
is Yoo Jae Suk.

2697
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:57,900
(Yoo Jae Suk wins 1st place.)

2698
01:24:58,610 --> 01:25:01,910
And the second place will
receive the same benefit.

2699
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:03,680
- Is it Ji Hyo?
- It's Song Ji Hyo.

2700
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:04,820
(The 2nd place is Song Ji Hyo.)

2701
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:06,550
Right. He won first place earlier.

2702
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:09,690
The prize is the Italian
food ingredient set for you...

2703
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:13,320
to enjoy the Italian dishes you
didn't get to eat during the race.

2704
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,950
That sounds great.

2705
01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:17,190
That's a lot.

2706
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:19,600
My children like to make
dishes like this these days.

2707
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,730
- It will be fun to cook with them.
- Right.

2708
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:23,100
The penalty is...

2709
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:26,400
a water slap that will
help you digest.

2710
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:28,700
You will pick a penalty ball.

2711
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:31,810
The first person to be picked
will get water slaps.

2712
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:34,550
The next two people
will give water slaps.

2713
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:37,220
Jong Kook has two penalty balls.

2714
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:39,020
Suk Jin has four.

2715
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:42,320
Haha has 3, and Se Chan has 3.

2716
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,820
Even if I have only one ball,
I can still get picked.

2717
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:48,190
- I hope it's not me.
- Please.

2718
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:49,230
I picked one.

2719
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:51,190
- Please.
- I have a hunch that it's me.

2720
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:52,990
- You do it then.
- It's probably me.

2721
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,300
It's me, right?

2722
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:56,160
- All right.
- I bet it's me.

2723
01:25:56,330 --> 01:25:58,830
- The person to get a penalty...
- It feels strange.

2724
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:00,270
- I guess it's me.
- No way.

2725
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,680
Is it Seok Sam?

2726
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:03,370
- It must be me.
- Or me?

2727
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:04,570
The person to get a penalty...

2728
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:05,680
It's me, right?

2729
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:06,900
is Haha.

2730
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:09,720
(Haha will be given the water slap.)

2731
01:26:11,610 --> 01:26:13,580
Weren't you confident earlier?

2732
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:15,260
Are you receiving the penalty?

2733
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:16,520
- The celebrity.
- You're a celebrity.

2734
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:17,650
And you'll be receiving the penalty.

2735
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:18,980
Are you receiving the penalty?

2736
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:20,360
Is Haha receiving the penalty?

2737
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,650
- Who will be splashing the water?
- Here we go.

2738
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:22,930
- Okay.
- It's Suk Jin.

2739
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:24,060
(Se Chan and Suk Jin
will spray the water.)

2740
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:25,360
Would you like
to check the temperature?

2741
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,360
Check the temperature.

2742
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,160
- All right. That's good.
- Good?

2743
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:31,830
- Okay.
- Yes, all right.

2744
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:33,330
- You made a good duo today.
- Look at Suk Jin.

2745
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:34,900
You and I...

2746
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:36,700
look like we're here
for this purpose only.

2747
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:38,610
- As professionals in the field.
- Right.

2748
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,940
(Body scrubbers from Italy)

2749
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:42,520
It can be Gangnam or anywhere else.
We'll be there.

2750
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:44,550
We serve you for just five dollars.

2751
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:46,050
Do you need
to relieve yourself of stress?

2752
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:47,480
Stress?

2753
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:49,890
Do you need to blow off some steam?

2754
01:26:50,190 --> 01:26:51,280
Our water slap...

2755
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,120

01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,360

- Go.
- Let's go.

2759
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:00,690
There you go.

2760
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:01,830
- That was right on his face.
- Let's go.

2761
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:04,970
(The cold water slap
pushes down all the heavy cheese.)

2762
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:06,270
- Okay!
- That was right on his face.

2763
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:07,640
Good job, everyone.

2764
01:27:07,770 --> 01:27:08,900
What now?

2765
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:10,370
My gosh!

2766
01:27:13,050 --> 01:27:14,200
"It's your last chance..."

2767
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,570
"to turn your life around
by winning a big cash prize."

2768
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:17,240
"Will you participate
in the Webfoot Octopus Game?"

2769
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,410
Webfoot Octopus Game?

2770
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:19,550
(Webfoot Octopus Game)

2771
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:22,060
What's going on?

2772
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:25,020
- That startled me.
- Welcome to the Webfoot Octopus Game.

2773
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:26,260
It's the Webfoot Octopus Game.

2774
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:28,060
- What on earth?
- What is this?

2775
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:30,650
Why? I'm Han Mi Nyeo.

2776
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:32,020
- There.
- Are you the captain?

2777
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:33,020
- He's Il Nam.
- Hey.

2778
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:35,940
- Hey!
- What do you mean?

2779
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:37,160
- Let go of me!
- Wait.

2780
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,810
- You can't take everything.
- Let go of me!

2781
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:39,970
I was robbed.

2782
01:27:39,970 --> 01:27:41,330
- What's going on?
- Why do I need to die?

2783
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:43,110
- Wait.
- I'll get rid of it if I can.

2784
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:44,110
(Playing for chump change)

2785
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:45,200
- Move.
- Just do it.

2786
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:46,510
Haha, you've been eliminated.

2787
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:47,610
- How much is this?
- Three million dollars.

2788
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:48,770
Did you say 3,000 dollars?

2789
01:27:48,850 --> 01:27:51,050
- Look how it has no limbs.
- No way.

2790
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:52,910
Yang Se Chan,
you've been eliminated.

2791
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:54,280
(A hunt for laughter)

2792
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,390
It must indicate...

2793
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:57,520
- each of our lives.
- So Min, you've been eliminated.

2794
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,650
(A hunt for laughter begins.)

2795
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:00,150
I'm taking your life today.

2796
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:01,560
We'll all end up dead at this rate.

2797
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:02,620
(Webfoot Octopus Game)
