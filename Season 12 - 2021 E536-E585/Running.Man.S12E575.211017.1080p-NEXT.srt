1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,640
(A brisk fall day
when the heat has subsided)

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,630
(Jae Suk is the first one
to show up at the studio.)

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,680
What's this?

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,180
Good morning.

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,180
(Good morning.)

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,480
It's been a while, right?

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,940
(So Min is back
after 5 days of self-quarantine.)

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,480
I'm back.

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,780
Hello.

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,750
Why did you tell me
to come to the underground parking?

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,660
When we film the opening
separately like this,

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,100
we always get to choose something
and betray each other.

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,320
- Hello.
- What are we doing?

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,390
Hello. What do we do today?

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,500
Director?

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,500
This is...

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,710
(At the moment...)

18
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,750
What's going on?

19
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,780
(What's going on?)

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,750
Gosh, I'm startled.

21
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,680
(A mysterious agent...)

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,180
(shows up suddenly.)

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,390
Gosh, he scared me.

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,680
My goodness.

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,750
What do we do?

26
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,630
My goodness.

27
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,630
(Agents in a familiar mask
are showing up.)

28
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,650
What are you doing? You startled me.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,400
What's this? Is it "Squid Game"?

30
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,870
What's going on? This is terrifying.

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,500
This is...

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,560
Seriously?

33
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,610
Gosh, this is
what we're doing today.

34
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,560
Really? Are we really
playing "Squid Game"?

35
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,730
It's squid.

36
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,810
(It's squid.)

37
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,870
It's squid.

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,780
(She greets
the familiar agent politely.)

39
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,980
Hello.

40
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,840
Gosh, hang on.

41
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,390
(The agents from the screen
are standing in front of them.)

42
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,450
Is this...

43
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,010
"Squid Game"?

44
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,060
It's a square.

45
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,230
(They've suddenly
come into reality.)

46
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,150
A square means a high-ranking post.

47
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,730
(What is it they want?)

48
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,370
Isn't this "Squid Game"?

49
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,500
(He keeps a safe distance anyway.)

50
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,540
Who is that?

51
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,260
Is a squid in there?

52
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,870
Are you a squid?

53
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,170
(But the agents remain silent
about their identity.)

54
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,370
What's going on?

55
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,340
Sir, would you like
to play a game with me?

56
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,610
What?

57
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,710
What game?

58
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,090
I know what this is.
Am I going to die?

59
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,150
This is...

60
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,060
Let's do it. What game?

61
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,420
What game?

62
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,860
Sir, have you played
a game of slap-match before?

63
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,790
Actually, I'm good at it.

64
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,200
You'll play a game
of slap-match with me.

65
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,540
Every time you win,

66
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,200
you get my ttakji and ten dollars.

67
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
Your ttakji and ten dollars?

68
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,440
(They are offered ten dollars
for winning a game of slap-match.)

69
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,980
Gosh, this is fun.

70
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,380
And if I win,

71
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,610
I will take your ttakji.

72
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,110
Okay.

73
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,390
What? Seriously?

74
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,950
Once one of us runs out of ttakji,

75
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,890
the game is over.

76
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,760
When I watched the drama,

77
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,660
I thought...

78
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,790
I would...

79
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,760
win at least 1,000 dollars.

80
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,490
You don't want to mess
with the members of Running Man.

81
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,760
You can be the first to play.

82
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,410
Okay. I get two?

83
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,170
(Each member gets
two pieces of blue ttakji.)

84
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,510
Okay. Let me warm up first.

85
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,200
(The first player
warms up his shoulders.)

86
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,480
Do you want me to go first?

87
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,450
I excel at this.

88
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,950
What are you going to do?

89
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,260
I'm really good at this.

90
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,390
I was the king
of the game of slap-match.

91
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,860
I won't go easy on you.
Are you okay with that?

92
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,990
(The king fails to flip over
the agent's ttakji.)

93
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,200
You're bad at this.

94
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,200
(Fortunately,
he gets one more chance.)

95
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,200
Gosh, this is...

96
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,880
Do you know advantageous for me
when it's upside down?

97
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,950
Okay.

98
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,240
(Okay.)

99
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,540
(He flips over the agent's ttakji.)

100
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,950
- Okay.
- You flipped over my ttakji.

101
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,610
- Yes.
- You get ten dollars...

102
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,920
- and a piece of ttakji.
- All right.

103
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,760
My goodness.

104
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,920
This is the last one.

105
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,100
If I win again, the game is over.

106
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,920
I'm not like Lee Jung Jae.

107
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,730
I'm good at this.

108
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,290
I'm the king of this game.

109
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,510
Go easy on me, mister.

110
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,800
Mr. Squid.

111
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,040
I'll go first.

112
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,570
(Groaning)

113
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,720
(The agent flips over
Se Chan's ttakji right away.)

114
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,110
What? Why?

115
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,220
What?

116
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,860
(Thump)

117
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,730
(The agent suddenly hits Se Chan
on top of his head.)

118
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,790
What was that?

119
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,060
You didn't say you'd hit me.

120
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,670
Every time you lose your ttakji,

121
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,630
you'll get hit with a toy hammer.

122
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,270
Then I will take one of your ttakji.

123
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,280
Why did you not tell me that?

124
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,410
(They get ten dollars if they win,
and they get hit when they lose.)

125
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,440
I'm in trouble.

126
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,580
What if he flips it over?

127
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,020
(Thump)

128
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,680
(The player gets hit
on top of his head.)

129
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,180
You're wearing Crocs.

130
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,610
Okay. I get it.

131
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,360
This is what I'm good at.

132
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,790
(Jae Suk is playing
what he's good at.)

133
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,830
All right.

134
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,830
Gosh, I did it wrong.
It was a mistake.

135
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,790
Gosh, I did it wrong.

136
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,190
(It didn't even touch the ttakji.)

137
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,190
It was a mistake.

138
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,670
I...

139
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,840
That's because it was so sudden.

140
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,210
Gosh, this is crazy.

141
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,580
(Jae Suk's blue ttakji
is flipped over right away.)

142
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,940
Every time you lose your ttakji,

143
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,150
you'll get hit with a toy hammer.

144
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,920
Place it again.

145
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,680
(Flattening)

146
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,730
Hey. Excuse me.

147
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,170
(The game of slap-match
is getting more serious.)

148
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,560
Gosh, I missed it again.

149
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,470
(Flattening)

150
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,980
(But Jae Suk's ttakji
gets flipped over again.)

151
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,580
(Squeaking)

152
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,170
(While Jae Suk gets hit...)

153
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,810
You're not good at this.

154
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,220
You're bad.

155
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,610
Why are you so bad
at the game of slap-match?

156
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,920
Hang on.

157
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,290
(The wiry player strikes
a strange pose.)

158
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,860
Yes! I get ten dollars.

159
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,400
(She flips it over.)

160
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,990
Mr. Squid isn't good at this game.

161
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,790
I mean...

162
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,790
(Flustered)

163
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,100
You're terrible at this.

164
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,710
Okay!

165
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,610
This is amazing.

166
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,110
I didn't know I was good at this.

167
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,630
(So Min wins 2 games in a row
and gets 20 dollars.)

168
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,980
All right. Thank you.

169
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,300
He's surprised that I'm good.

170
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,940
Actually, I'm not good at this.

171
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,150
(While So Min puts on air
after winning the game,)

172
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,720
(Ji Hyo is getting hit pretty hard.)

173
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,880
Let's play one more time.

174
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,620
Just one more round.
I wasn't warmed up enough.

175
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,360
(As the game continues,)

176
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,460
Hey.

177
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,060
(the self-proclaimed kings
start to mess things up.)

178
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,100
(The agents never go easy
on the members.)

179
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,540
That was really hard.

180
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,970
Go.

181
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,770
(They thought they'd be good at this
since they have some experience.)

182
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,000
That was offensive. Okay.

183
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,080
(Distracting)

184
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,370
(Except So Min,
all the members lost their ttakji.)

185
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,520
Let me play one more round.

186
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,940
Can you give me one more chance?

187
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,240
Let's play one more round.

188
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,250
I'll give you ten dollars.
Will you play one more time?

189
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,610
(The members forget about the pain
and ask for one more chance.)

190
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,550
Is it over?

191
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,290
I didn't get much money.

192
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,400
(They are disappointed
that they didn't make much money.)

193
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,530
Sir.

194
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,270
There's a place where you can
make easy money like this.

195
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,560
(The original soundtrack
of "Squid Game")

196
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,560
(They get a mysterious card
from the agents.)

197
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,780
"Will you join the game
with big prize money to change your life?"

198
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,930
Webfoot Octopus Game?

199
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,870
(Will you join the game
with big prize money to change your life?)

200
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,020
It's a webfoot octopus, not squid.

201
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,610
It's Webfoot Octopus Game.

202
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,150
Webfoot Octopus...

203
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,290
(The 7 members are
invited to the game.)

204
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,360
Webfoot Octopus Game?

205
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,050
"Will you join the game?"

206
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,460
What? Are you inviting me?

207
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,090
Hey, Squid.

208
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,830
Webfoot Octopus Game.

209
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,360
I'll join.

210
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,100
I'll join the game.

211
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,230
Webfoot Octopus Game?

212
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:08,410
(Webfoot Octopus Game)

213
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,540
(This is Webfoot Octopus Game
which is cheaper than squid.)

214
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,310
(Squid: 7.5 dollars,
Webfoot octopus: 3 dollars)

215
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,680
(This was filmed
with the consent of "Squid Game".)

216
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,790
(The sound of bed wheels sliding)

217
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,830
(The sound of number 2 snoring)

218
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:30,670
(The 7 members have decided to
take part in Webfoot Octopus Game.)

219
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,930
(Agent 1 stomping)

220
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:40,240
(The agents leave quickly
after bringing in the members.)

221
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,960
(Upbeat music plays.)

222
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,250
- Can I take off the sleep shade?
- What?

223
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,880
- What's all this?
- My gosh.

224
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,960
- Gosh.
- What is this?

225
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,020
What is this?

226
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,660
- This is...
- What is this?

227
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,470
This is huge.

228
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,660
What?

229
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,630
What's all this?

230
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,270
It's so intense.

231
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,440
Il Nam.

232
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,180
I'm not Il Nam.

233
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,370
I'm scared.

234
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,480
- I didn't know this was so huge.
- What is this?

235
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,140
- This is...
- It's a large scale.

236
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,320
- You're the representative squid.
- Gosh, this is huge.

237
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,090
They all are in pink.
They are pink men.

238
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,320
- Even the cameramen.
- What's going on?

239
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,480
What's all this?

240
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,930
What's going on?

241
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,260
- What's going on?
- Suk Jin.

242
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,900
This is like an indoor playground.

243
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,270
No. This is Webfoot Octopus Game.

244
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,370
- It's an indoor playground.
- This is Webfoot Octopus Game.

245
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,870
It's lovely.
It looks like a dog cafe.

246
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,240
We should take a lot of photos here.

247
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,410
I guess we will be stars.

248
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,280
- You look good here.
- What?

249
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,510
- Okay?
- What do you mean?

250
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,650
- You're perfect for "Squid Game".
- Why?

251
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,650
You're a squid.

252
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,880
Suk Jin.

253
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,960
You should be good today. Because...

254
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,600
this might go viral
around the world.

255
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,830
You should be...

256
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,520
Why is Suk Jin number two?

257
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,200
- It's not about age.
- He's Il Nam.

258
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,700
(Oh Il Nam)

259
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,890
You're Il Nam.

260
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,890
- You're Il Nam.
- No, I'm...

261
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,070
He's Il Nam.

262
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,260
You're Il Nam.

263
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,680
- You're Il Nam,
- No, I'm Jung Jae.

264
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
Il Nam and I Nam.

265
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,310
- Why are you Jung Jae?
- I'm Jung Jae.

266
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,770
Who else would be Jung Jae then?

267
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,270
You can't always be the protagonist.

268
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,010
- It's okay.
- It could be Se Chan.

269
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,640
- In this game...
- And he is Hae Soo.

270
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,220
This is Park Hae Soo.

271
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,240
Right.

272
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,110
- And she's Mi Nyeo.
- Mi Nyeo.

273
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,780
- Right.
- She's her.

274
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,930
Who's the captain here?

275
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,960
Who's the captain here?

276
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,650
- She's good.
- She looks just like Mi Nyeo.

277
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,160
She's good at things like this.

278
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,700
And he's the guy from abroad.

279
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,700
- Am I the foreigner?
- Ali.

280
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,130
- It's Ali.
- You're Ali.

281
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,210
- He's Ali.
- You're Ali, okay?

282
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,680
- I'm Kang Sae Byeok.
- He's Ali.

283
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,350
- What did you say?
- I'm Kang Sae Byeok.

284
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,480
- No.
- Sae Byeok?

285
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,610
- You're the gangster.
- Heo Sung Tae?

286
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,240
- Heo Sung Tae.
- Heo Sung Tae?

287
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,850
Deok Su.

288
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,190
- Move over.
- Are you the captain here?

289
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,190
I'm the doctor.

290
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,480
Don't call me that.

291
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,230
- Ji Hyo watched it.
- What?

292
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,480
- I did.
- "Squid Game".

293
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,800
- Really?
- That's unbelievable.

294
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,460
Are you a subscriber?

295
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,120
Yes, I'm a subscriber.

296
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,260
- Don't you use one with knobs?
- She keeps up with trends.

297
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,440
- I watch YouTube videos now too.
- Really?

298
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,730
- Impressive.
- She's a trendy person now.

299
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,030
But Ji Hyo, why are you...

300
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,530
- trying to come out of your cave?
- Exactly. What's the reason?

301
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,810
Are you trying to change your image
or what?

302
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:24,900
Why did you come out of your cave?

303
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,500
Well, I thought it was about time.

304
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,610
(Cavewoman Ji Hyo began looking into
what the world pays attention to.)

305
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,610
What's going on?

306
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,720
- Even the music is the same.
- They're playing the same music.

307
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,180
Wasn't this music played
in this scene?

308
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,640
People start to die
when this music is played.

309
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,720
- It means the game will begin.
- The game will begin now.

310
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,720
- Welcome...
- It's the same voice.

311
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,960
- to Webfoot Octopus Game.
- Oh, my.

312
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,330
- I think he's the same voice actor.
- Is he the same voice actor?

313
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,330
- Today, you will play the games...
- He sounds the same as the drama.

314
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,800
- that we prepared,
- Gosh, I'm scared.

315
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,070
trying to survive
until the last game ends.

316
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,470
(Try to survive
until the last game ends.)

317
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,300
The participant who survives
to the end...

318
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,710
will receive a big cash prize.

319
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,570
(The final survivor will receive
a big cash prize.)

320
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,840
Each participant...

321
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,980
- will be given five lives.
- Five lives?

322
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,950
And every time you lose one life,

323
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,410
one part of your body
will be severed.

324
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,720
- A body part?
- A body part?

325
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,960
- This is a brutal game.
- If you lose all five lives,

326
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,860
- You should've told us sooner...
- you won't be able to...

327
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,930
- join the game again.
- so I could call my mom.

328
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,700
- Are you serious?
- Hey.

329
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,960
- Our body parts will be cut off?
- This is ridiculous.

330
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,730
The cash you earned
through the game of slap-match...

331
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,840
can be used to purchase 5 marbles
for 10 dollars.

332
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,200
Oh, man. I only won ten dollars.

333
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,570
- Darn.
- Hey, hold on a second.

334
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,340
If you turn in ten marbles,

335
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,340
you can eliminate 1 life
of 1 person of your choice.

336
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,900
- Oh, we can eliminate a life?
- Someone else's life?

337
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,870
You will receive three extra marbles
once every hour.

338
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,380
You can also earn more marbles
at the betting room...

339
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,010
- any time you want.
- Got it.

340
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,480
I have no marbles.

341
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,610
But...

342
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,150
Now, we'll reveal
the amount of the cash prize.

343
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,200
- How much is it?
- Hey, guys.

344
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,230
- Look up there.
- It's coming out.

345
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,520
(At that moment...)

346
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,700
- Oh, my.
- They even made that too.

347
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,600
(Everyone is impressed.)

348
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,730
Did they make that too?

349
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,400
(A giant, glowing sphere
came down from the ceiling.)

350
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,000
- Oh, my. That's huge.
- What's that?

351
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,000
- They did a good job making this.
- What's that?

352
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,240
It looks just like the one
in the drama.

353
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,610
(It looks similar to the one
in "Squid Game".)

354
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,870
- They made the same one.
- What is it?

355
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,010
- They did a good job making it.
- I'm impressed.

356
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,140
(A golden light
brightens the inside of the sphere.)

357
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,180
Will cash fall into it?

358
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,880
(A golden light
brightens the inside of the sphere.)

359
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,050
Will cash fall into it?

360
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,190
- What's happening?
- Oh, I remember the scene.

361
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,620
(Cash bundles start falling
into the sphere.)

362
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,730
(Cheers and applause)

363
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,990
- That's a lot.
- How much is that? It's real money.

364
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,200
They prepared all those bills.

365
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,160
I see a bill with Jae Suk's photo
on it.

366
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,860
- It has my face on it.
- That's Jae Suk's face.

367
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,860
How much is that?

368
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,230
- That's Jae Suk.
- Why does it have my face on it?

369
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,210
(The bills are falling
and piling up in the sphere.)

370
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,510
- Oh, my.
- That's a lot.

371
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,610
(The bills are falling
and piling up in the sphere.)

372
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,380
- They keep coming.
- That's a lot.

373
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,480
- Okay.
- Oh, my.

374
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,750
- How much is it?
- How much is it?

375
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,330
The prize money that
the final survivor will receive...

376
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,060
is 3,000 dollars.

377
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,430
(Number of Players: 7,
Cash Prize: 3,000 dollars)

378
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,990
(The prize money is 3,000 dollars.)

379
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,230
- It says 3,000 dollars.
- We can win 3,000 dollars?

380
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,360
Three thousand dollars?

381
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,610
- Three thousand dollars?
- It's a big prize.

382
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,360
Then we will begin...

383
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,130
the first game shortly.

384
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,870
Oh, my. This is amazing.

385
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,180
Jong Kook, let's be kkanbu later.

386
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,320
I'd love that.

387
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,350
- Hey.
- Be kkanbu with me too.

388
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,880
- Make kkanbu with me too.
- Come on.

389
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,450
- Let's make kkanbu.
- You'll need that.

390
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:27,650
Then until the first game begins,
enjoy your free time.

391
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,300
(Betting Room)

392
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,660
(They can exchange the cash they won
for marbles at the betting room.)

393
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,300
(They can also
earn more marbles here.)

394
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,230
- any time you want.
- Hold on a second.

395
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,900
My stylist has the money I won.

396
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,260
I mean...

397
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,030
- I changed my clothes.
- Your stylist can't help you now.

398
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,530
- You don't have a chance.
- Il Nam.

399
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,640
- You're looking for your stylist?
- That's so funny.

400
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,270
- I mean...
- I can't believe him.

401
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,080
- My stylist...
- He doesn't understand the rules.

402
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,240
- I put it in my back pocket.
- Does he think this is a joke?

403
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,410
I earned 20 dollars.

404
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,880
We should exchange the money
for marbles now.

405
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,330
(So Min came to the betting room
to exchange her money for marbles.)

406
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,560
Shouldn't we exchange all our money
for marbles?

407
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,880
Should we?

408
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,930
- I spent all I had.
- How much did you have?

409
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,430
How much did you win?

410
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,570
- How many do we get for 10 dollars?
- You get 5 marbles.

411
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,070
- Okay.
- That's cool.

412
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,360
- What should I do without marbles?
- My gosh. These marbles...

413
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,970
I should earn some later.

414
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,660
- Fifteen marbles, right?
- "Would you like to..."

415
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,230
- "play a game with me?"
- Twenty dollars...

416
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,730
"Do you want to make kkanbu
with me?"

417
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,000
You see, to survive in this game,

418
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,010
- we need to eliminate the others.
- That's right.

419
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,240
We should eliminate the others.

420
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,980
- Exactly.
- If we pair up as kkanbu,

421
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,140
- we'll be invincible.
- At least we have five lives.

422
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,380
I have ten marbles.
Don't forget that.

423
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,560
- I have ten marbles too.
- Okay.

424
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,330
Well, I'm just going to
take a selfie.

425
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,700
(Posing behind him)

426
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,330
Hey, move aside.

427
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,020
They're being lovey-dovey again.

428
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,630
- They're taking a couple's selfie.
- That's just crazy.

429
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,970
- Gosh. Why are they doing it here?
- I'm taking selfies.

430
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,530
- You two are posing together.
- That's just crazy.

431
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,000
I didn't ask her to pose behind me.

432
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,530
Why are you taking
a couple's selfie here?

433
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,730
It wasn't like that.

434
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,480
I was taking selfies alone!

435
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,850
But she was in that photo too.

436
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,140
- She was just passing by.
- Jae Suk.

437
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,550
- They're a couple, you know.
- Right.

438
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,720
Gosh, seriously.

439
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
(After sending away
the disruptive people,)

440
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,090
(he takes a selfie
from a different angle.)

441
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,220
Stop it.

442
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,320
- I'm going to play a game.
- Me too.

443
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,620
Really?

444
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,090
(Haha and So Min came
to earn more marbles.)

445
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,150
- Do we play odd or even?
- Welcome to the betting room.

446
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,200
Please choose...

447
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,700
one of the three games
that we have prepared.

448
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,660
The first game is Odd or Even.

449
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,530
You have to guess...

450
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,270
whether I have an odd or even number
of marbles in my hand.

451
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,480
If you guess it right,
you win twice your bet.

452
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,180
The second game is Roulette.

453
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,780
There are four colors on the wheel
which are red, blue,

454
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,690
yellow, and green.

455
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,480
If the wheel stops
on the color you bet on,

456
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,330
you will receive four times
as many as the marbles you bet.

457
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,560
- Let's play Odd or Even. It's...
- Odd or Even?

458
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,730
- They played it in the drama.
- Okay.

459
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,970
- Odd or Even it is.
- It's the signature game.

460
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,730
- Should we bet separately or not?
- Let's bet on the same thing.

461
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,390
- That'd be cool.
- Of course.

462
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,030
- We are kkanbu.
- Okay. We're kkanbu.

463
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,000
Han Mi Nyeo and I are kkanbu.

464
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,470
(They formed kkanbu on the spot
to make themselves look cool.)

465
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,730
First,

466
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,370
decide on the number of marbles
you want to bet.

467
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,710
The number of marbles to bet?

468
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,480
(While the 2 of them
are thinking...)

469
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,870
We can play a game between us.

470
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,140
- Hey, play a game with me.
- Me?

471
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,910
If we play a game there,
we may lose some marbles.

472
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,490
But if we play here,
our marbles will move among us.

473
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,090
- By the way,
- But we need to earn more.

474
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,060
- violence is allowed here.
- Correct.

475
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,680
Gosh.

476
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,190
- Violence is allowed here.
- Hang on.

477
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,300
Can't we kill each other
when the lights are off?

478
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,000
- That's true.
- Let's count our marbles first.

479
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,930
Two, four, six, eight.

480
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,540
I haven't played this game
in such a long time.

481
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,860
(Oh Il Nam's Do-it-yourself version
of the odd or even game)

482
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,040
- Odd or even.
- Here.

483
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,740
- I've never played this game.
- I bet two on the odd number.

484
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,170
(- Here!
- I bet 2 on the odd number.)

485
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,750
- I bet two on the odd number.
- Wrong. Give them to me.

486
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,350
Give me those.

487
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,470
Okay.

488
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,210
- I'll give you one.
- Really?

489
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,020
- Yes. In return, help me out...
- I won't forget...

490
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,110
- Help me out once later.
- Of course, I'll do that.

491
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,360
- Okay. Make it count.
- Thank you.

492
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,610
(One marble feels very valuable
to Jong Kook who had none.)

493
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,180
- I gave you one. Don't forget.
- Yes, thanks.

494
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,950
But how should I earn more
with just one?

495
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,100
- Figure something out.
- It's always an odd number.

496
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,600
Right, Suk Jin?

497
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,120
- You should give me at least two.
- I won his marbles.

498
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,420
I bet four on "odd".

499
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,500
- Four on "odd"?
- Yes.

500
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,100
(I bet 4 on "odd".)

501
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,310
"Even". Those are mine.

502
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,270
- Wait.
- It's "even". Give me those now.

503
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,200
- Il Nam is so good at this game.
- Must I give him my marbles?

504
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,370
- Must I give him my marbles?
- Of course, you must.

505
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,870
- It's up to you.
- Oh, I don't have to?

506
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,680
- Then I won't give them to him.
- Jong Kook, take four from him,

507
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,590
- and I'll give you one.
- Ali, come back here.

508
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,820
- Give me those marbles.
- Ali, come here.

509
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,290
- Jong Kook, we're kkanbu.
- Hey, play fair.

510
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,710
- I'll give you two if you help me.
- How many will you give me?

511
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,920
- Two.
- Deal.

512
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,830
- Thanks.
- I'll give you three.

513
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,830
- Hey. Darn it.
- I kept my marbles.

514
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,920
(Number 3 and Number 7 made
an agreement at once.)

515
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,950
Good job.

516
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,160
Hey, I was just trying to...

517
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,330
(The weak players are trying to
make kkanbu with the strong ones.)

518
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,430
Okay.

519
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,930
Come on. I lost some marbles.

520
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,900
I can play the odd or even game now.

521
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:33,960
Gosh.

522
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,840
I won four marbles in the game,

523
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,470
but I only got 1 of them
whereas Jong Kook got 2.

524
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,080
That's so strange.
Why did you let that happen?

525
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,370
He wouldn't give me the marbles.

526
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,640
(Haha is playing the official game.)

527
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,080
- I only got one.
- I'll bet two.

528
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,610
- Will you bet all of them?
- Yes.

529
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,260
- I bet 8 marbles.
- You bet 8 marbles?

530
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,860
Guys, So Min just bet eight marbles.

531
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,090
(So Min bet 8 marbles.)

532
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,830
Really?

533
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,120
- It's a big game.
- I guess...

534
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,950
- What game is she playing?
- Odd or Even.

535
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,030
I don't know about this game.
How many did you bet?

536
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,360
Jong Kook,
I can't get myself to leave.

537
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,570
- It's addictive.
- Really?

538
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,070
- Even.
- I couldn't see it.

539
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,570
- It's "even". Trust me.
- How many?

540
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,740
- Isn't it "odd"?
- It's definitely "even".

541
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,160
(Haha is sure that it's "even".)

542
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,840
- Are you sure?
- Trust your game partner.

543
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,970
- Even.
- Even.

544
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,580
- I'm sure of it.
- The correct answer is...

545
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,020
- "even".
- Yes!

546
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,170
See? I was right, wasn't I?

547
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,210
(The correct answer is "even".)

548
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,990
(So Min earned twice her bet.)

549
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,210
You should give me one marble.

550
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,950
Give me one marble.

551
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,560
- How many did you bet?
- I bet eight marbles.

552
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,420
- Give me just one. You know...
- Gosh.

553
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,450
- that I saved you. Okay.
- Okay. Here.

554
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,600
- Let me play a game.
- That was awesome.

555
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,390
(Big Nose quits the unofficial game
and joins the betting room.)

556
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,340
That was amazing.

557
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,740
(But then...)

558
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,430
- What's going on?
- I guess the break time is over.

559
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,050
(Player number 2 is surprised
and joins the others.)

560
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,780
- I guess the break time is over.
- Suk Jin just sat down.

561
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,110
I didn't even start the game.

562
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,580
- He didn't get to play a game.
- Han Mi Nyeo.

563
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,050
- Someone came in.
- What's going on?

564
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,760
(An agent suddenly approaches
the players.)

565
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,990
- Who is this?
- What is it?

566
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,150
What? He must've been eliminated.

567
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,330
- What is it?
- What are you doing?

568
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,500
- His body part will be cut off.
- Suk Jin, you've been eliminated.

569
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,570
(Number 2 Ji Suk Jin is out.)

570
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,630
- Someone must've eliminated you.
- Wait for now.

571
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,340
- Let go of me.
- Someone must've eliminated you.

572
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,770
- Wait for now.
- Did someone...

573
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,400
- What is going on?
- What is it?

574
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,700
His body part will be cut off.

575
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,170
- Someone must've eliminated you.
- Wait for now.

576
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,640
Why is this happening already?

577
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,700
(Suk Jin who lost 1 life
loses 1 body part.)

578
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,810
Who eliminated me?

579
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,080
- We don't know.
- Who did it?

580
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,580
- I was playing a game.
- Me too. It wasn't me.

581
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,470
(Earlier on)

582
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,730
- How many marbles do you have?
- I have five.

583
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,040
How about I give you 5
so we can eliminate 1 person?

584
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,970
- Let's eliminate one of Suk Jin's.
- How many?

585
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,130
- Shall we?
- Let's do that. We're kkanbu.

586
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,200
- What do you say? Here.
- "Even".

587
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,670
(Se Chan plotted with Jae Suk
after losing marbles to Suk Jin.)

588
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,670
Go ahead.

589
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,670
Put your marbles in here.

590
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,410
I want to eliminate Suk Jin.
I mean, Il Nam.

591
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,480
Player number two.

592
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,250
(He collected 10 marbles
and took 1 of Suk Jin's lives.)

593
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,840
You know that I don't have
enough marbles to do that.

594
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,520
- Who killed me?
- My gosh. Who did that?

595
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,380
But why would anyone want to
kill Il Nam already?

596
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,730
- Why me...
- "Who was it..."

597
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,830
- "Who was it that killed me?"
- "that killed me?"

598
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,470
You do look pitiful, Suk Jin.

599
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,830
- That's the worst.
- My gosh.

600
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,300
"Who was it..."

601
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,500
- It wasn't me. I don't have enough.
- What?

602
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
But...

603
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,200
- You need ten marbles to do that.
- That's true.

604
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,040
(Suk Jin has only 4 lives now.)

605
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,340
(An elegant song is played.)

606
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,600
This is the theme song
of "Janghak Quiz".

607
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,140
The first game will begin shortly.

608
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,140
- I'm getting a little nervous.
- Right.

609
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,940
Please gather around.

610
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,380
- Got it. We're all here.
- It's scary.

611
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,680
(What will be the 1st game
to decide the final survivor?)

612
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,490
Tell us about the first game.

613
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,490
(What will be the 1st game
to decide the final survivor?)

614
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,760
Isn't it scary? I'm scared.

615
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,180
I guess
we're going to eat dalgona too.

616
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,230
Right. We'll eat dalgona too.

617
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,000
- Will we play the dalgona game too?
- I think we will.

618
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,090
(What is the 1st game
that awaits the players?)

619
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,360
The music slowed down.

620
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,270
Welcome to the first game.

621
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,310
Thanks.

622
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,740
The first game is...

623
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,870
Losing Yootnori.

624
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,400
- What?
- We're going to play yutnori?

625
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,010
As the name of the game implies,

626
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,780
you lose your life if you complete
the race before the others do.

627
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,780
- Oh, so we need to lose.
- We should avoid winning.

628
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,440
- Each player has one piece.
- We should lose.

629
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:05,120
The 1st 3 players to complete
the race will lose a body part.

630
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

631
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,000
(The 1st 3 players to complete
the race will lose their lives.)

632
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,950
- Three players?
- I'm worried.

633
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,030
We need to lose in this game.

634
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,120
- You know, I'm a little scared.
- Me too.

635
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,160
- Honestly, I...
- It feels so realistic.

636
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,390
I'm scared too.

637
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,590
I'm starting to get immersed in it.

638
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,970
- What if it's actually cut off?
- I hope I'll get lucky.

639
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,970
The basic rules are the same
as the regular game.

640
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,840
If you catch the player
ahead of you,

641
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,080
that player goes back
to the starting point.

642
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,980
The player who caught someone else
will be hit with a toy hammer...

643
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,220
and should roll the yut once again.

644
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,790
There is back gae
as well as back do.

645
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,590
- Back gae?
- If you roll back gae,

646
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,180
you can move your piece
two steps back.

647
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,190
It's a good thing, right?

648
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,920
But if you roll back gae
on the starting point...

649
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,860
When your piece lands on a fork,

650
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,500
you can choose the direction
to move your piece in.

651
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,840
And you're not out even when
the yut falls outside the lines.

652
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,070
- There's no rule of being out.
- I see.

653
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,770
- It causes fights in many cases.
- Indeed.

654
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,780
- Can I throw again if I catch one?
- Yes.

655
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,670
- Catching them is a bad thing.
- The first player has an advantage.

656
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,340
- The first player to start.
- Catching others isn't good.

657
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,480
That's right.
That increases your chance to win.

658
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,220
- If I get caught...
- You would keep moving forward.

659
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,870
- Oh, right. I understand.
- This won't be easy.

660
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,220
- It'll be difficult.
- It makes sense.

661
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,720
It's not easy to lose.

662
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,220
Being ranked in the middle
is the best.

663
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,490
The later you start, the better.

664
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,060
Losing Yootnori. My gosh.

665
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,150
Whether you go first or later.

666
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,120
Once you go in, you can't get out.

667
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,470
I will never die.

668
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,360
Let me be in first place
for a change.

669
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,930
Right, So Min.
I have a feeling that you'll win.

670
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,930
I'll win 3,000 dollars.

671
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,500
This is even crueler
than "Squid Game".

672
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,860
My goodness. I'm worried.

673
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,600
Now, Number Two,
the player with the least lives,

674
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,580
please decide the order
for throwing the yut sticks.

675
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,980
- All right.
- Gosh.

676
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,980
- I don't like this.
- You can finish up at once.

677
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,340
Those punks. Being the first to go
is a good thing, right?

678
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,250
- The last one... No. You're right.
- You know...

679
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,410
(Unhappy)

680
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,260
You go first,
and let me go after you.

681
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,820
- Kkanbu?
- Yes, we're kkanbu.

682
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,230
It's kkanbu, not kkanbo.

683
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,490
It's too soon to make kkanbu.

684
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,090
- All right.
- What?

685
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,450
- It's too soon?
- You should make kkanbu later.

686
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,590
It's too soon?

687
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,090
- It's a mere order of players.
- What?

688
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,270
- And he's acting like a king.
- Go ahead.

689
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,470
- Go ahead and pick me.
- That was rude.

690
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,200
- Pick me. I don't care.
- Hey.

691
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,740
- What did you say?
- What was your plan for me?

692
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,980
You go last.

693
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,980
Okay. I'll go last.
That's not a problem.

694
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,170
You'll likely lose...
Did you just laugh?

695
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,280
- Yes, I laughed.
- You go right before him.

696
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,370
(He gives the ones who annoyed him
bad positions.)

697
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,750
You're the sixth player to go.

698
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,940
- What position do you want?
- I want to be the second to go.

699
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,140
- Then I'll go first.
- Sure.

700
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,790
- I'll go first, then you go.
- Okay.

701
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,410
- If we could avoid...
- And then...

702
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,790
Hey, are you the toughest one here?

703
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,850
- No, he's the weakest.
- If you give me one marble...

704
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,230
- She's Jeon Mi Nyeo.
- If you give me one marble,

705
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,660
- I'll put you...
- He'll go first anyway.

706
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,530
Give me one marble. Then I'll...

707
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,840
- No. That's okay.
- I'll put you...

708
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,270
- Really? That's annoying.
- Yes.

709
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,300
What? Why?

710
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,660
- This is not that important.
- You're the fifth one to go.

711
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,600
- Okay.
- The 5th, 6th, and 7th.

712
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,240
- Don't point your finger at me!
- Don't point your finger at me!

713
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,340
Are you two twins or something?

714
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,340
Don't do that.

715
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,580
- Hey, Mister.
- I meant no disrespect.

716
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,340
- Don't point your finger at me.
- I'm just deciding the order.

717
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,370
- Don't point your finger at us.
- How dare you?

718
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,910
You guys are the 5th, 6th, and 7th.

719
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,590
- Gosh, seriously.
- You're the 5th, 6th, and 7th.

720
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,760
- We're the 1st and 2nd.
- Right.

721
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,760
You two decide on your own.

722
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,380
- They're the 3rd and 4th.
- You decide on your own.

723
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,530
I'll let you two decide. My gosh.

724
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,800
- Gosh. He's acting so arrogant.
- Exactly.

725
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,690
Now, we're going to begin...

726
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,360
the first game, Losing Yootnori.

727
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,070
The fewer steps I get, the better.

728
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,360
(Suk Jin goes first
feeling at ease.)

729
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,360
I hope you roll a mo.

730
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,360
I hope it's a yut.

731
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,470
- It's back gae.
- It's back gae.

732
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,840
- Then what should I do?
- You can't start yet.

733
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,480
- I can't start yet?
- That's really great.

734
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,780
I wish his piece had been
on the board.

735
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,580
- I wish he'd won.
- Gosh.

736
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,720
If I get a do and then a back gae,
I complete the race.

737
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,780
Then it's over.

738
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,410
- That's the worst-case scenario.
- Gosh.

739
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,840
There are "X" marks
on two of the yut sticks.

740
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,520
- That's a back gae.
- One with those marks is a back do.

741
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,320
- It's geol.
- It's geol.

742
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,880
- It's easy to get caught there.
- It's geol.

743
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,950
Move forward.

744
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,180
- Do, gae, geol.
- I'll stay here and do it for you.

745
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,120
- Mi Nyeo, it's your turn.
- Ms. Jeon Mi Nyeo.

746
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,860
- I hope she gets a geol.
- What? It's mo.

747
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,360
- No, it's do.
- It's do.

748
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,500
If you roll a back gae next time,
it's over.

749
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
- Then you'll be the winner.
- That'd be nice.

750
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,160
- If you roll a back gae.
- Did you say it'd be nice?

751
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,660
If you roll a back gae,
you'll lose your life.

752
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,860
- That'd be the end.
- Oh, right.

753
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,870
Three of us will be eliminated.

754
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,310
You'll be eliminated, ma'am.

755
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,080
- I hope you get a gae.
- Sir, here we go.

756
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,480
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Sir, here we go.

757
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,670
- Yes. Go ahead. Of course.
- You're sure about this, right?

758
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,490
(Ali Se Chan)

759
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,050
- It's gae.
- Yes, it's gae.

760
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,180
- We're in the 1st 3 places.
- That's dangerous.

761
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,090
- It's like a minefield.
- Do, gae, geol.

762
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,990
- They'll likely get caught.
- Getting caught is a good thing.

763
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,590
- I'll give it a try.
- It's Ji Hyo's turn.

764
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,300
If she gets a mo,
she'll be finished.

765
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
- It's yut.
- It's yut.

766
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,660
- What?
- You should throw them again.

767
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,300
(As expected of the lucky one,
she rolls a yut from the start.)

768
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,970
- It's yut.
- This is exciting.

769
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,360
- Being lucky is not an advantage.
- One more time.

770
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,600
- She's so lucky.
- It's funny.

771
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,340
- Should she throw them again?
- It doesn't help in this game.

772
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,940
- One more time.
- Keep moving forward.

773
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,480
To avoid catching them... Oh, gosh.

774
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,320
- She got another yut... Oh, no.
- It's geol. Catch that one.

775
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,380
- It's geol.
- She can catch that one.

776
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,940
I need to roll a yut.

777
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,090
All right. Not moving at all is
the best-case scenario.

778
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,680
Please roll a gae.

779
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
- Gae?
- You'll most likely catch one.

780
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,880
- Roll do, gae, or geol.
- I don't want to catch any of them.

781
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,390
- It's your turn. Come and sit here.
- I shouldn't catch any of them.

782
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,500
I'm sure you'll catch one of them.

783
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,360
- I have to avoid catching them.
- I hope you catch one.

784
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,570
- All right.
- I hope you catch one.

785
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,660
- Catch 1 of them.
- You'll definitely catch 1 of them.

786
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,860
- Okay.
- It's geol.

787
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,660
- It's geol.
- It's geol. He caught me.

788
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,840
(He caught Haha.)

789
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,430
- That was great.
- I can hit him, right?

790
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,310
- Oh, my. That was great.
- Gosh, seriously.

791
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,310
Hit him as hard as you can.

792
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,700
- Oh, boy.
- Good job.

793
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,370
Catch one more!

794
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,220
(He should throw them again
since he caught someone.)

795
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,880
- This is driving me nuts.
- Roll a back gae this time.

796
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,140
- Back gae.
- A back gae will be better.

797
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,590
- Or back do. He'll catch one more.
- Back do.

798
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,320
That'd be better
since I can move back.

799
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,950
I can get another back do
after catching someone.

800
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,090
Just go for it. That's life.

801
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,420
- It's do.
- It's do. Catch him.

802
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,560
- Okay. That's good. Nice.
- Oh, right.

803
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,660
That's nice.

804
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,190
You shouldn't try to calculate
the odds when you play this game.

805
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,970
- Just go for it.
- All right.

806
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,470
- If you are to die, you die.
- We heard you.

807
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,770
- I mean, we have five lives.
- Where is your piece?

808
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,770
- Okay.
- Sir.

809
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,370
- I wonder what he'll get?
- Here.

810
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,870
- It's back do. My gosh.
- It's back do.

811
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,480
- See? You must clear your mind.
- It's rare to get a back do.

812
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,600
Okay. I'll clear my mind too.

813
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,550
I hope you roll a yut and catch me.

814
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,340
- It's not easy to roll a yut.
- I want him to get a yut.

815
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,380
That won't happen.

816
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,440
It's yut.

817
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,290
- It's gae.
- Oh, it's gae.

818
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,530
- He caught one piece with a gae.
- He caught me.

819
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,950
(Suk Jin caught Se Chan's piece.)

820
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,390
- Darn it.
- He didn't realize it.

821
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,760
- One more time.
- Shouldn't he get hit?

822
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,730
- One more time.
- Okay.

823
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,230
- What? Why did he hit me?
- Did he punch him with a fist?

824
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,570
- You caught him.
- Oh, right. I did the same.

825
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,070
You'll get another gae.

826
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,070
(If he rolls another gae,
he'll catch Jae Suk's piece.)

827
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,660
- Another gae.
- Another gae.

828
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,480
- Another gae.
- That won't happen.

829
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,040
- You'll roll another gae
- Gae

830
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,040
- It's gae!
- It's gae.

831
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,310
- You'll roll another gae
- It's gae!

832
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,870
(He caught my piece too!)

833
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,980
You'll roll another gae

834
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,520
(Seok Sam keeps moving forward.)

835
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,880
- My gosh.
- Another gae

836
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,990
- Get a gae again.
- Another gae

837
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,260
Avoid getting a geol.

838
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,590
Here we go. I'm so happy

839
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,090
- Swing it like a golf club, sir.
- Sir.

840
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,920
- Nice shot!
- Nice shot!

841
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,030
- Nice shot, sir.
- Nice shot!

842
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,160
(Grumbling)

843
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,830
(Jae Suk hit him in the head
as if it was a golf ball.)

844
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,970
- You little...
- Why?

845
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,860
- Why did you hit me like that?
- There's no rule about that.

846
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,360
- Fine. Wait until you catch me.
- He's right.

847
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,930
- That's not against the rules.
- It'd be funny if he gets a geol.

848
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,670
- That'd be hilarious.
- You'll roll a geol.

849
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,670
Geol.

850
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,480
- Geol.
- Geol.

851
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,200
- You will roll a geol
- I hope he rolls a geol.

852
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,280
- Back gae or back do, please.
- You will roll a geol

853
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,320
- I won't roll a geol.
- Geol.

854
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,990
(Will he be able to finish his turn
this time?)

855
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,110
- It's geol.
- It's geol.

856
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,490
(He caught another piece!)

857
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,760
(Seok Sam caught 3 pieces in a row
in only 1 turn.)

858
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,390
- He caught three pieces.
- He was acting so arrogant

859
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,840
- He was acting so arrogant
- And he caught another piece

860
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,590
- He won't stop moving
- It's still his turn.

861
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,130
One more time.

862
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,900
- My goodness.
- One more time.

863
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,740
I hope he gets a yut this time.

864
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,480
- I'm dumbfounded.
- It'll be yut this time.

865
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,080
- I hope he gets a mo
- He's unlucky today

866
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,340
- I hope he gets a mo
- What are the odds?

867
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,580
- I mean...
- Yootnori Master

868
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,940
(He beat the odds.)

869
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,590
- Yootnori Master
- Yes!

870
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,590
- He's the Yootnori Master
- I mean how could this happen?

871
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,950
What are the chances...

872
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,490
- Yootnori Master!
- I threw them three times.

873
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,180
- He caught three pieces.
- He's Yootnori Master

874
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,590
- My gosh.
- You're unnecessarily lucky.

875
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,000
What's important is that the one
behind you can't catch you

876
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,970
He's gone too far

877
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,770
- He's gone too far
- You can get a back do.

878
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,970
But I can get a back do

879
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,360
- A hundred times
- No, you can't

880
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,930
- It's mo.
- Back do.

881
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:35,930
- It's gae.
- It's gae.

882
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,130
- It's gae. My gosh.
- He rolled gae.

883
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,780
One, two, he rolled gae

884
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,400
- He rolled gae
- I caught three pieces.

885
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,110
- You're so good at yutnori.
- I caught them with gae and geol.

886
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,520
- He's so good at yutnori.
- If this were a regular game,

887
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,180
- I can't believe this.
- he would never have done so well.

888
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,490
- It would never have happened.
- Exactly.

889
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,790
He's the Yoot King.

890
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,420
- Gosh. Darn it. Catch me, please.
- Suk Jin is so funny.

891
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,530
I hope she gets a mo.

892
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,590
(After a few rounds,
it's Ji Hyo's turn now.)

893
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,850
- It's geol.
- It's geol.

894
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,560
- Catch up with me.
- It'd be funny if he gets caught.

895
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,760
- That'd be great.
- Nice. There's no piece...

896
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,030
- on the 1st five steps.
- It's empty.

897
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,730
- It's empty now.
- Nice.

898
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,040
- It's empty
- How exciting

899
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,200
Now, here we go

900
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,040
- I hope he gets a yut.
- Two yuts.

901
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
- Yoot.
- Two yuts.

902
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,170
- Two yuts. If you roll a yut now...
- Two yuts?

903
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,340
That would make you a genius

904
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,980
- Let it be yut!
- A genius rolling yut.

905
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,370
- It's geol.
- It was almost yut.

906
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,480
- That's too bad.
- It's geol.

907
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,110
- Go, Gym Jong Kook
- Geol or yut.

908
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,290
- Gym Jong Kook, here I go
- How about geol?

909
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,850
- Geol or...
- It has to be geol.

910
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,490
It's geol, what a day

911
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,920
What a day

912
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,800
Eat your way along the board

913
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,330
It's geol

914
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,420
You'll be hit with the hammer

915
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,470
A single hit with the hammer

916
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,860
- How refreshing
- There you go

917
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,770
- Just a second
- How refreshing

918
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,740
Talk about discrimination

919
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,200
You whipped Suk Jin's head

920
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,580
But tapped Jong Kook's

921
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,600
(A full swing)

922
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
(A gentle tap)

923
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,750
- I...
- Are you scared of him?

924
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,910
- He's not stupid.
- No, hear me out.

925
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,140
I could take a swing at Suk Jin
because I'm right-handed.

926
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,550
I can't do it from this side.

927
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,590
- You can stand on the other side
- Why not stand on the other side?

928
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,610
- Then the camera
- I'll be blocking the camera

929
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,650
- Don't you agree?
- We have this camera up here

930
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,880
I wouldn't be that stupid

931
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,760
You could take a swing from here

932
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,300
- And still be on "camara"
- Did he say "camara"?

933
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,330
(Being on camera alone
put Seok Sam's tongue in a knot.)

934
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,800
- Right here.
- Where would I...

935
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,890
Then you could take a swing like so

936
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,040
It's doable

937
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,810
I could accidentally
hit his ear though

938
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,310
My ear is what you struck earlier

939
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,640
(He finally tells Jae Suk
that he was hit in the ear.)

940
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,050
- In the ear?
- Sorry about that

941
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,440
I'll keep that in mind

942
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,610
- Please be careful in the future
- I won't do that again

943
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
- I bet it's yut.
- It'll be nothing

944
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,030
- It's gae.
- Gae is what I rolled

945
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,030
- He has to take the shortcut.
- No, I don't.

946
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,060
- He can go the other way.
- I get to choose

947
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,390
If he goes this way,
he might catch the others.

948
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,860
But this way
shortens the overall journey.

949
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,500
I bet Suk Jin will roll a big one.

950
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,660
Seok Sam, roll mo for us

951
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,840
- Mo is something I never roll.
- Mo!

952
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,040
Mo!

953
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,600
- It's mo
- Mo!

954
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,750
- He rolled mo
- Seriously?

955
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,870
(He rolled a mo!)

956
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,290
He rolled a mo

957
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,990
- He rolled mo
- A mo

958
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,110
- Mo!
- He rolled a mo.

959
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,730
- Are you kidding me?
- A mo.

960
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,030
It's a mo!

961
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,150
He rolled a mo

962
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,830
- It's a mo
- How is this possible?

963
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,770
- A mo.
- As always

964
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,040
Suk Jin will be the first to die

965
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:19,270
This time around
A yut is what you'll roll

966
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,970
- A yut...
- You.

967
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,100
Shut it, will you?
I keep rolling what you want.

968
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,370
Back gae!

969
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,200
- A yut!
- A yut.

970
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,550
Back do.

971
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,480
(After rounds
of catching each other,)

972
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,820
(Se Chan takes the lead.)

973
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,640
- It's a yut.
- A yut.

974
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,320
It's a yut

975
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,490
Back gae is what he rolled

976
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,030
- A back gae
- It was a back gae

977
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,590
- Even do would be nice
- Back gae

978
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,330
- Do would be nice
- No, end it with back gae.

979
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,920
- Back do
- No, back gae.

980
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,590
- Back do
- It'll be gae.

981
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,230
- Back gae.
- Not back gae, but gae.

982
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,860
- Give me a gae!
- No, a back gae.

983
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,040
- Back gae.
- That would be hilarious.

984
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,930
- It's a yut.
- A yut!

985
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,270
- A yut.
- You've caught one.

986
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,510
- No, I haven't.
- It was a yut.

987
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,980
- You roll again.
- Gae!

988
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,550
- Gae!
- Roll again.

989
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,700
- Roll again.
- Please roll a gae.

990
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,910
- I'm seeing hope again.
- Please give me a back do.

991
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,520
- He's giving me hope.
- I need a back do.

992
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,750
- A back do.
- Let it be gae!

993
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,260
- It's a mo.
- Give me a back do!

994
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,720
- Do!
- He caught someone.

995
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,060
(He rolls a do
and catches Jong Kook.)

996
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,180
A do.

997
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,490
I can't believe he rolled a do.

998
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,150
No way!

999
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,000
He rolled a do.

1000
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,120
(Jong Kook expressed his joy
by running.)

1001
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,160
Gosh, he's fast.

1002
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,430
Look at him run.

1003
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,340
He rolled a do.

1004
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,360
(If he rolls a yut,
he'll catch Suk Jin.)

1005
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,240
- Roll a yut.
- Let's see.

1006
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,600
- Nice.
- A yut!

1007
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,740
- It's a geol.
- He's at my tail.

1008
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,480
- Nice.
- Do, gae, geol.

1009
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,910
You know, Suk Jin...

1010
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,140
- might roll a back do.
- I'm in a dangerous position.

1011
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,320
It's me again.

1012
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,290
I have to start from
the beginning again.

1013
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,150
- Haha could catch me.
- Please roll a do.

1014
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,790
It'll be a back do or back gae.

1015
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,760
- Back do or back gae.
- Let it be a do.

1016
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,290
- A yut.
- It's a yut.

1017
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,150
- Is it yut?
- Yes, a yut.

1018
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,350
- Nice!
- A yut.

1019
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,350
Roll again.

1020
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,120
- Roll again.
- Roll again!

1021
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,300
It'll be a back do or back gae.

1022
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,070
- Please let it be either.
- Another yut would be nice.

1023
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,340
- Another yut.
- A second yut.

1024
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,010
- A back do or back gae.
- Let it be a yut.

1025
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,310
- It's a geol.
- I thought I'd get lucky.

1026
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,580
Do, gae, geol.

1027
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,580
- You're back where you were.
- Darn it!

1028
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,050
That's where you were earlier.

1029
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,480
- That's actually impressive.
- Why did I even bother?

1030
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,780
Why did I bother throwing the yut?

1031
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,440
- He's good at this.
- You make a fast recovery.

1032
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,490
- Mr. Gae.
- Back do!

1033
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,090
- Back gae.
- No, back do.

1034
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,720
- Back gae.
- Back do.

1035
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,120
- Back do.
- Give me a back gae!

1036
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,160
(He'll catch Se Chan
if he rolls a gae.)

1037
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,050
Gae!

1038
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,030
(He catches Se Chan
who was in front of him.)

1039
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,220
He caught me.

1040
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,660
- No way.
- Gosh.

1041
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,340
- Why am I so good at this?
- Thank you so much.

1042
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,700
- I'm always terrible at games.
- Please have a seat

1043
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,260
Please have a seat

1044
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,600
Let him take a swing at your head

1045
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,140
Thank you so much

1046
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,970
Who knew Suk Jin
was this good at yutnori?

1047
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,510
He's like the Yootnori Master.

1048
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,320
- Unbelievable.
- The Yootnori Master.

1049
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,450
- The Yootnori Master.
- How about a mo?

1050
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,740
- A mo.
- It'll be a mo.

1051
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:51,120
- A yut.
- Yes, it's a yut!

1052
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:54,720
- Rejoice!
- It's a yut.

1053
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,850
- A yut.
- It's a yut.

1054
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,760
Let's rejoice!

1055
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,990
He rolled a yut.

1056
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,370
(Suk Jin brings joy to everyone
by dominating the game.)

1057
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,600
- Suk Jin...
- Unbelievable.

1058
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,030
All you need is a geol.

1059
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,300
If he rolls a geol, it'll be over.

1060
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,570
- A geol and it's over.
- How is this possible?

1061
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,740
If he rolls a geol, it'll be over.

1062
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,240
How is this possible?

1063
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,640
It's still warm,

1064
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,070
so cut another sleeve off.

1065
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,620
Roll a geol or a yut.

1066
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,220
- Please give me a back gae.
- Just roll a yut.

1067
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,320
- Back gae.
- No, a yut.

1068
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,490
- Yoot.
- It's a geol.

1069
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,680
(He manages to stop
at the edge of the cliff.)

1070
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,180
- So Min...
- Get him with a back do.

1071
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,930
You'll be shattered
if you catch him with a back do.

1072
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,260
That'll be hilarious.

1073
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,870
- That's my only hope.
- If you roll a back do...

1074
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,320
- No way.
- But what if...

1075
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,260
- Haha.
- Oh, it's my turn.

1076
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,890
- Haha, roll a back do.
- Haha.

1077
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,030
- Come on.
- Roll a gae.

1078
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,530
- It'll be a gae.
- Do or gae.

1079
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,300
- Do or gae.
- Unbelievable.

1080
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,030
- Roll a gae.
- Why am I good at this game?

1081
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,510
- Roll a gae.
- No, roll a back do.

1082
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,780
A gae!

1083
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,370
It's me who he caught

1084
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,470
- He caught you
- Why wasn't it a back do?

1085
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,780
I'm glad to have
a distance between us.

1086
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,890
- Right?
- Okay.

1087
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:58,260
Haha, channel the Yootnori Master
and roll a yut or a mo

1088
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,890
- At least a geol
- How about a mo?

1089
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,220
- A yut!
- He rolled a yut

1090
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,930
- Gosh.
- It's a yut

1091
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,220
- Seriously?
- He rolled a yut

1092
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,340
(Haha's road to death
is just getting started.)

1093
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,840
- It's a yut
- Let's see for now.

1094
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,140
(Suk Jin and Haha's gameplay has
the Grand Award buddies dancing.)

1095
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,570
What a joy this is.

1096
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,910
I couldn't be happier.

1097
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,240
Kkanbu.

1098
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,470
I can't believe
you're in the mud too.

1099
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,550
This is hilarious.

1100
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,700
Count me out.

1101
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,050
(Haha follows Suk Jin
who's in the lead.)

1102
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,550
- Roll a mo.
- There's no point in trying hard.

1103
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,850
- Roll a mo.
- Let it be a mo.

1104
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:29,050
- It's a gae.
- He rolled a gae.

1105
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,010
Good. That's a relief.

1106
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,090
Things are looking great.

1107
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,780
Hold on a second.
Will three lose a life in this game?

1108
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,390
- Will we lose a life?
- Unbelievable.

1109
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,850
- But...
- Seriously?

1110
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,950
Why am I so good at this?

1111
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,970
- I shouldn't be this good.
- Here.

1112
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,930
- Right. Here comes the fun part.
- Good.

1113
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,430
He's close to dying.

1114
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,760
He's in the best position.

1115
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,510
- He's headed to death.
- Get going already.

1116
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:50,010
- Goodbye, Suk Jin.
- Will he live to see another day?

1117
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,340
A back do or a back gae.

1118
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,680
Suk Jin, that's disgusting.

1119
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,740
How is it disgusting?

1120
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,970
I should be the one
grossed out instead.

1121
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,140
Did you hear his tone just now?

1122
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,950
- "How is it disgusting?"
- Right.

1123
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,780
- Give me some space.
- "How is it disgusting?"

1124
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,410
Give me some space
since this is an important moment.

1125
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,990
- Bye!
- Bye, Suk Jin.

1126
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,680
- Goodbye.
- So long.

1127
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,780
Suk Jin, throw them up high.

1128
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,930
- Bye.
- You did well today.

1129
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:08,990
(Will he miraculously roll
a back do or back gae?)

1130
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,320
- Goodbye.
- Hey!

1131
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,890
(Jae Suk touched one of the yuts.)

1132
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:13,970
Back do!

1133
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,430
Is it a back do?
What's the last one?

1134
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,600
Is it a back do?

1135
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,070
- Back do!
- Hold on a second.

1136
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,010
- A second ago...
- I touched one of them.

1137
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,470
- Back do!
- Hold on a second.

1138
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,800
I touched one of them.

1139
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,280
Jae Suk grabbed it,
so you must roll again.

1140
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,570
- Right.
- No way.

1141
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,200
- It's true.
- No, it's as is.

1142
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,850
- But Jae Suk grabbed one.
- Here we go.

1143
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,140
- We're sorry.
- Yes, I'm sorry.

1144
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,240
He'll roll that one again.

1145
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,590
- Why?
- You'll roll this one again.

1146
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,450
- Of course.
- Why should I?

1147
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,910
- You said there were no outs.
- Suk Jin.

1148
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,820
- I'm really sorry.
- Why must I roll it again?

1149
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,350
Even if it rolled that way,
it still counts.

1150
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,100
He said he's sorry,
and this is supposed to be fun.

1151
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,760
- You should accept it.
- He bowed down to you.

1152
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,470
Suk Jin, that's enough.

1153
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,930
(He agrees to roll just one again.)

1154
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,570
- All right.
- This will be it.

1155
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,240
- This will be it.
- You can get the back do.

1156
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,600
Please let it be on its back.

1157
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,140
If he rolls a back do...

1158
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,910
(He fails to roll a back do!)

1159
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,030
Bye, Suk Jin.

1160
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,680
(He arrives in the afterlife.)

1161
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,200
- Bye!
- You're out.

1162
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,320
Goodbye.

1163
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,620
(In the end,
Il Nam managed to win the race.)

1164
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,120
- Oh, no.
- Bye.

1165
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,120
I'm sorry.

1166
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,120
- Use scissors.
- Cut it out here...

1167
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,850
so that it's enjoyable.

1168
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:12,890
- Darn.
- There you go.

1169
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,160
They completely got rid of
his left side.

1170
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,890
- This is annoying, you know.
- You have five lives.

1171
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,160
I like how you look wilder.

1172
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,120
- Suk Jin, you seem stronger.
- You look different.

1173
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,100
You're like Bruce Banner
before he transforms into Hulk.

1174
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,570
- Suk Jin.
- Check out his thin leg.

1175
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,910
That's hilarious.

1176
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,470
You're wearing a cute leg warmer.

1177
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,870
It's a cute leg warmer.

1178
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,140
- He looks so fragile.
- It's like a bird's leg.

1179
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,510
But this...

1180
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,240
- Bye.
- You did good, Haha.

1181
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,120
(Haha follows Suk Jin
and goes to the land beyond.)

1182
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,550
He loves doing that, doesn't he?

1183
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,550
It's either Se Chan...

1184
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,780
- No, it could be Jae Suk.
- Se Chan's closer.

1185
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,120
Jae Suk and Ji Hyo...

1186
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,820
- could roll a back do or back gae.
- That's right.

1187
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,430
You never know.

1188
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,600
- Se Chan.
- I'll roll a gae first.

1189
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,820
- Just roll a mo.
- Roll mo and end the game.

1190
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,620
- Yes, a mo.
- Let it be a back gae.

1191
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,490
- Geol.
- It's a geol.

1192
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,840
Okay, you rolled a geol.

1193
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,140
You're right at the end.

1194
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,800
I have Jae Suk
and Ji Hyo to lean on.

1195
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,030
- Ji Hyo, you're up.
- If she rolls a back gae...

1196
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,530
If she does,
she'll be right at the end.

1197
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,140
Ji Hyo, roll a do.

1198
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,570
(She's fine as long as
she doesn't roll a back do.)

1199
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,740
- No way.
- It's a mo.

1200
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,470
- She rolled a mo.
- That's out of the blue.

1201
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,240
- But this...
- It's meaningless.

1202
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,910
It'll be the worst
if I roll a back gae.

1203
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,720
You never know what he'll roll.

1204
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,720
- You never know.
- All right.

1205
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,850
Please let it be a back gae.

1206
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,760
- What if I roll a back gae?
- Jong Kook...

1207
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,450
- could come and catch me.
- It'll be a jackpot for me.

1208
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,300
I mean it. If I roll a back gae,

1209
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,390
all cameras will be on me.

1210
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,800
The Deity of Variety Shows!

1211
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,300
What we want is a back gae.

1212
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,240
Your rolling back gae
is something I want to see as well.

1213
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,140
- Jae Suk...
- If I roll a back gae,

1214
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,430
- Suk Jin will...
- Then you can roll a mo.

1215
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,570
Yes, it'll be a blast.

1216
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,640
- It'll give me huge joy.
- Exactly.

1217
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,240
- I wonder how it'll feel.
- Roll a back gae.

1218
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,640
- Please.
- Let it be a back gae.

1219
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,180
- All right!
- Let it be a back gae.

1220
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,490
(Jae Suk is safe unless
he rolls a back do or gae.)

1221
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,680
(Let it be a back gae.)

1222
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,910
- All right!
- Let it be a back gae.

1223
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,090
Let it be a back gae.

1224
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,590
- Back do.
- It's a back do.

1225
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,820
(A back do?)

1226
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,950
- What on earth?
- A back do.

1227
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,570
(A back do?)

1228
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,660
- Wait.
- Then at this round...

1229
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,200
- Back do...
- If we survive this round...

1230
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,800
- Hold on.
- Jae Suk will be eliminated.

1231
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,300
- A back do?
- Jae Suk will be eliminated next.

1232
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,600
I can't believe he rolled a back do.

1233
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,070
If he gets another one,
he'll end up losing.

1234
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,570
(Jae Suk instantly became
the first one to be eliminated.)

1235
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,300
- He got back do.
- I wish I could get that too.

1236
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,050
You need to get back do.

1237
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,320
- You must get back do.
- I must get back do?

1238
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,620
- Yes, you must.
- Either back do or back gae?

1239
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,590
- Yes, because...
- You have no hope otherwise.

1240
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,680
Please.

1241
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,890
Once Se Chan is done,
it'll be over, right?

1242
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,390
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1243
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,350
How did I get back do?

1244
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:31,200
I need to get either back do
or back gae.

1245
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,930
- Right. You need to get either one.
- Se Chan should be eliminated.

1246
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,300
Otherwise, I'll be eliminated.

1247
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,430
- Se Chan.
- Please.

1248
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,700
- Please, Se Chan.
- Please end it here.

1249
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,890
- No, don't go for that.
- Please.

1250
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,660
- How did I get back do?
- Let's do this, Se Chan.

1251
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,800
- Right?
- Go for it, Se Chan.

1252
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,910
You should get their energy.
Take a lap.

1253
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,600
Touch them with your nose.

1254
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,370
Kwang Soo!

1255
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,450
- No, you shouldn't ask Kwang Soo.
- Why not?

1256
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,180
- I need his energy for this.
- Kwang Soo's energy is needed.

1257
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,410
You should ask Yeon Koung.

1258
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,050
- Yeong Koung?
- Please.

1259
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,180
Please. Just catch me
and advance on.

1260
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,910
(Will Se Chan get
the two Long Legs' unlucky energy?)

1261
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,030
Please. Just catch me
and advance on.

1262
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:04,120
(Who will be the last victim?)

1263
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,890
(Yang, Yoo)

1264
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,390
Please. Just catch me
and advance on.

1265
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,530
- It's mo.
- It's mo?

1266
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,010
- What was that?
- What was that?

1267
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,530
(He's the last person
to be eliminated.)

1268
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,840
- What was that?
- What...

1269
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,030
- was that?
- What was that?

1270
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,180
- What was that?
- What was that?

1271
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,570
- What was that?
- That was very neat.

1272
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:21,850
What was that?

1273
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,070
(It wasn't even close.
He immediately got eliminated.)

1274
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,410
You got more than enough.

1275
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,450
- What was that?
- I'm so relieved.

1276
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,450
- What was that?
- What was that?

1277
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,050
You got more than enough.

1278
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,280
Why did I get mo?

1279
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,450
It's my first time surviving
in a game like this.

1280
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,350
The four players who survived...

1281
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,820
will be given three marbles each.

1282
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,100
The winners get three marbles each?

1283
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,200
(The 4 survivors will be given
3 marbles each.)

1284
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,640
He worked so hard to survive,

1285
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,570
but he got mo.

1286
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,300
I'm going to kill you all.

1287
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,300
- Go ahead.
- I'll kill you all.

1288
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,700
- If you don't like them...
- Those who passed the first game,

1289
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,680
- congratulations.
- Thank you!

1290
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,010
I don't get why I died
in the first round.

1291
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,850
Enjoy your free time...

1292
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,740
until the next game.

1293
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,160
- Thank you.
- Three for me, please.

1294
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,780
- I'll do the betting.
- Thank you.

1295
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,120
- You can go ahead.
- Let's do it.

1296
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,820
You can play in groups of two.

1297
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,260
- He said we could play together.
- Okay. Take a seat.

1298
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,700
He said we could play together.

1299
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,890
- Let's bet 3.
- I'm betting 3.

1300
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,160
(He bets all the marbles
he just earned on Odd or Even.)

1301
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,720
We, the Pouty Mouth duo,
will show you.

1302
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,970
Let's do this.

1303
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,660
You can just guess
based on the sound.

1304
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,600
There are only so many
that he can grab.

1305
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:25,140
Is the number of marbles I'm holding
odd or even?

1306
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,850
- Let's go for even. Even.
- Even.

1307
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,280
The answer is odd.

1308
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,220
(The answer is odd.)

1309
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,870
I knew it.

1310
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,850
(He was on a high horse, but his
marbles disappeared in a second.)

1311
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,120
- Hey, Se Chan.
- Jae Suk. Wait a second.

1312
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:39,930
- Se Chan.
- I'm sorry.

1313
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,320
Gosh, that was all for nothing.

1314
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,550
Let's play Odd or Even.

1315
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,890
- With you?
- Yes.

1316
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,620
- Bring it on.
- In "Squid Game", they...

1317
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,200
- Okay. Bring it on.
- All right. Let's play.

1318
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,490
Let's play.

1319
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,160
I used to play this a lot...

1320
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,300
near an alley entrance.

1321
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,510
You're betting only one, right?

1322
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,600
(Right then, Jeon Mi Nyeo
provokes Suk Jin.)

1323
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,780
All right. Are we playing now?

1324
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,950
Odd. It's odd.

1325
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,550
- You got it.
- Give them to me. Three marbles.

1326
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,620
- All right.
- I lost.

1327
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,740
(Big Nose won 3 marbles.)

1328
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,160
So Min, did you lose?

1329
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,850
(Jeon Mi Nyeo hopelessly
lost her marbles on a side game.)

1330
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,530
You're totally caught up
in his game.

1331
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,680
- You lost?
- Let me play with you.

1332
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,260
Let me give it a try.

1333
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,800
The old man...

1334
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:22,200
- Sir, let me play with you.
- That was hilarious.

1335
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,700
I should play the game.

1336
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,240
I should play it now.

1337
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,700
I should place a bet
to double the marbles I have.

1338
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,970
(A siren goes off all of a sudden.)

1339
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,140
Number two, Ji Suk Jin, out.

1340
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,450
- How come?
- Why is he out?

1341
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:34,600
- He lost...
- He lost...

1342
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,140
He lost another life.

1343
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,680
(Il Nam who only played Odd or Even
lost his life again?)

1344
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,910
What did you say?

1345
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,510
- Suk Jin.
- At least tell me the reason.

1346
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,220
Maybe it's because you played
a game here.

1347
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,760
- What did I do?
- You shouldn't act up.

1348
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,010
I only played a game.

1349
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,180
So Min, you're a kkanbu, right?

1350
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,220
Who should I kill?

1351
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,030
- I'll kill them for you.
- Okay.

1352
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,100
Suk Jin.

1353
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,800
How many lives does he have?

1354
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,970
He lost his arm and leg.

1355
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,870
Let's cut off his other arm.

1356
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,260
This is for Suk Jin.

1357
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,030
(Resenting Suk Jin for taking
her marbles,)

1358
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,780
(So Min took away his life.)

1359
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,010
What's the reason?
Why did they take my life?

1360
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,550
- Because you kept playing...
- Why did you act up?

1361
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:09,870
You kept playing a game
to win marbles.

1362
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:12,140
It's because you acted up
and played a game to win marbles.

1363
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:13,890
Hey, at least tell me the reason.

1364
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:15,050
(The agent steps in.)

1365
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,510
I get what you're trying to do,
but why did they take my life?

1366
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,760
Who did this?

1367
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,050
- Was it you, Jae Suk?
- I don't even have any marbles.

1368
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,950
- Was it you, Jong Kook?
- I don't have marbles.

1369
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,450
- I don't have any marbles.
- Was it you, Jeon Mi Nyeo?

1370
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,530
- No, I have all of my marbles here.
- I don't have any marbles.

1371
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,370
- Ji Hyo, was it...
- I don't have any.

1372
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,530
Who did this to me?

1373
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,890
I'm really curious, that's what.

1374
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,470
Why are you so sloppy at this?

1375
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,200
- Wait a minute.
- Why can't you cut it at once?

1376
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,100
- Why would you snap at him?
- Why are you mad at him?

1377
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,740
- Just deal with it at once.
- Why would you snap at him?

1378
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,640
- It's painful.
- You are...

1379
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,120
Just finish it at once.

1380
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,470
- You have a nasty temper.
- If you're going to be like this,

1381
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,850
- give out two marbles each.
- Why should I?

1382
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,720
Otherwise, they'll collect
marbles again and attack you.

1383
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,850
- That's right.
- You don't have that many...

1384
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,280
So you collected the marbles.

1385
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,780
- So give us two marbles each.
- Don't snap at people.

1386
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,220
- I'd rather kill someone...
- Be nice, and...

1387
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,620
than give out marbles.

1388
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,320
This won't do.

1389
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,370
Is that so?

1390
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,870
I can't die alone.

1391
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:04,640
And he's coming down.

1392
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:07,740
I can't die alone.

1393
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,410
And he's coming down.

1394
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:14,740
(Il Nam's creative way
of using the stairs.)

1395
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:17,010
Here's 7. You need 3 more, right?

1396
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:19,280
Why did he...

1397
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,680
Why did he go up only to come down?

1398
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,620
Why did you go that way?

1399
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,820
Why did he go up only to come down?

1400
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,050
You should come back the same way.

1401
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,760
- He didn't need to go up.
- Come back, Suk Jin.

1402
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,160
Come back.

1403
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,320
He's making full use
of the props on set.

1404
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,430
He's so cool.

1405
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:32,550
(After submitting 10 marbles...)

1406
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:34,300
I'll eliminate Jae Suk.

1407
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,490
- I'll eliminate Jae Suk.
- But it wasn't me.

1408
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:37,600
He's coming back the same way.

1409
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,160
Gosh, I'm so upset.
I can't die alone.

1410
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,430
Get rid of Jae Suk's life.

1411
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:43,070
- Get rid of his life.
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1412
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,530
(Jae Suk lost his life
because of Suk Jin.)

1413
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:45,700
He vented on an innocent person.

1414
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,200
(A siren goes off.)

1415
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,700
- This is infuriating.
- Number one.

1416
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,450
- Yoo Jae Suk, out.
- But it wasn't me.

1417
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:51,720
Why did you attack me?

1418
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,870
Because it was so upsetting.

1419
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:54,590
- All right.
- My gosh.

1420
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,280
This won't do.
I'm going to kill them all.

1421
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,890
Are you out too?

1422
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,780
That's can't be
what I think it is, right?

1423
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:02,820
My gosh.

1424
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,260
(Right then, a familiar set enters.)

1425
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,450
- Is it dalgona?
- Dalgona?

1426
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,930
Gosh, this is...

1427
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,600
- I want to choose the umbrella.
- Me too.

1428
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,800
- I'll choose the circle.
- I'll choose the triangle.

1429
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,970
Soon,

1430
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:18,180
you'll have to select
1 of the 4 shapes in front of you.

1431
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,870
- I shouldn't pick the umbrella.
- You shouldn't. It'll be over.

1432
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,640
But I bet there's a twist.

1433
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,350
All right. Mi Nyeo, go ahead.

1434
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,280
Which one should I pick?

1435
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,410
(What do these shapes stand for?)

1436
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:29,850
I like stars.

1437
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:31,180
I think it'll be the opposite
of "Squid Game".

1438
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,220
I'll choose the circle.

1439
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,450
The umbrella must have
a twist, don't you think?

1440
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,350
But I can't help but feel anxious.

1441
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,120
How come so many people chose
the triangle?

1442
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,700
I think he'll go for the umbrella.

1443
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,200
I'll choose the umbrella.

1444
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,470
I like rain.

1445
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,660
Please enter the room one by one.

1446
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,160
- Is that so?
- We should enter in order?

1447
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,030
- Should I just go in?
- We're going in one by one?

1448
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,240
What's this?

1449
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,050
(There's an actual dalgona case
in the room?)

1450
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,410
It's the same as the one
from the drama.

1451
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,050
Is this dalgona? For real?

1452
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,180
What's this?

1453
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,160
I think it's really dalgona.
This must be dalgona.

1454
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,820
- No, you never know.
- I'm not very good at this.

1455
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:10,030
Now, open the case
and check what's inside.

1456
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,450
- What's this?
- What's this?

1457
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:12,530
What's this?

1458
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:15,120
"The lunch menu you earned
by choosing the circle..."

1459
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,430
"is rice and fried egg."

1460
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,260
- What did you get?
- It's our lunch.

1461
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:19,600
- Right?
- What did you get?

1462
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,030
I got udon
and bibimbap with wild vegetables.

1463
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,370
- I got the product placement.
- You got udon and bibimbap?

1464
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:24,640
It was to choose your lunch menu.

1465
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,070
I got the product placement.

1466
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,950
The player who chose the triangle...

1467
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:29,850
will get a triangle gimbap.

1468
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:30,970
I'm getting triangle gimbap.

1469
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:32,870
The player who chose the circle...

1470
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,180
- will get rice and fried egg.
- Oh, I'm getting rice too.

1471
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,410
I had triangle gimbap for breakfast.

1472
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,910
The player who chose the star...

1473
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:41,280
will get the product placement
that only stars get to eat,

1474
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,350
and you'll get braised chicken.

1475
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,820
- You're getting braised chicken.
- That makes sense.

1476
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,350
The player who chose the umbrella...

1477
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,370
will get udon and bibimbap
with wild vegetables...

1478
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:51,740
whose initials start with
"U" and "B".

1479
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:55,570
- Everyone, I hope...
- What did you get?

1480
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:57,410
- you'll have a nice lunch.
- Suk Jin's is the best one.

1481
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:59,070
I know. I was the last to pick.

1482
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,570
- There was a twist.
- It was for our lunch.

1483
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:01,950
Darn it.

1484
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,350
It's braised chicken.

1485
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,070
- You got product placement, So Min.
- But I'm not good at it.

1486
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,820
Suk Jin got the best one.

1487
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,090
Gosh, this looks good.
Udon and bibimbap.

1488
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,320
- That's the best menu.
- Mine is the worst.

1489
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,890
- But it's tuna flavored.
- There's only egg and rice.

1490
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:17,050
This looks delicious.

1491
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,100
I wanted to pick the umbrella
for some reason.

1492
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,120
- You should've picked it.
- Right?

1493
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,240
They gave me
plenty of braised chicken,

1494
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:26,760
so anyone who pays up three marbles
can join me.

1495
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,100
- You can put it on credit too.
- Okay, So Min.

1496
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,160
I'm in.

1497
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,370
You're in? You're putting them
on credit. Eat with me.

1498
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,570
- You can't put them on credit.
- Of course, I can.

1499
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:35,640
It's because...

1500
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,370
we have a special connection.

1501
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,120
- What?
- What is she talking about?

1502
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,120
We have a special connection.

1503
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:43,760
- What?
- What is she talking about?

1504
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,120
When she said that,

1505
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,590
I almost threw up.

1506
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,760
- She was so immersed in it.
- I almost got choked.

1507
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,320
I almost threw up.

1508
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,160
- I'm supposed to be Ali.
- She came over, and...

1509
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,030
- I almost threw up.
- I was really surprised.

1510
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:57,760
Gosh, what's wrong with her?

1511
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,740
I'm supposed to be Ali.

1512
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,760
(The only star,
Jeon Mi Nyeo's lunch is here.)

1513
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,910
It looks so good.

1514
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,910
Gosh, look at that.

1515
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,370
Goodness, it smells so nice.

1516
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:06,530
(Spicy braised chicken
and creamy braised chicken)

1517
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,350
I can smell truffle oil.

1518
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,570
- This has truffle oil.
- Gosh, this is...

1519
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,410
Goodness.

1520
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,350
- What's this?
- Let's go look at it.

1521
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,510
This is the best menu so far.

1522
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:16,550
(The hungry webfoot octopuses
gather around So Min.)

1523
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:17,850
Goodness, it smells so nice.

1524
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:19,260
(Se Chan promises to pay 3 marbles
and joins So Min.)

1525
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,760
Mi Nyeo, can I have this?

1526
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,120
- You need to pay three marbles.
- Sorry?

1527
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,220
- If we pay three marbles,
- Okay.

1528
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,260
can we join you?

1529
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,430
Of course.

1530
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,660
You need to pay me
three marbles later.

1531
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,260
There's too much
for her to eat on her own.

1532
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,260
(Ali's eyes go wide.)

1533
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,260
I can still smell the truffle oil.

1534
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,410
I can smell the truffle oil
for real.

1535
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:38,240
- The truffle oil smells so good.
- This is delicious.

1536
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,410
It's good.

1537
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:43,680
Players, please gather.

1538
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,870
We must be playing that.

1539
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:46,910
(After filling their stomachs,
they play the second game.)

1540
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:48,410
What's that?

1541
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,010
The second mission...

1542
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,450
is a game where your decision
determines your fate.

1543
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,820
It's called War of Kkanbu.

1544
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,220
- We need to become kkanbu.
- War of Kkanbu...

1545
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:00,530
consists of four games.

1546
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:03,100
You get to pick new teammates...

1547
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,600
in each game.

1548
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:09,570
The games won't be revealed.

1549
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,930
Without knowing the type of game,

1550
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:16,240
you'll choose
either square or triangle.

1551
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,820
The players who choose
the same shape will become a team.

1552
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,050
In each game,

1553
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,680
the members of the winning team
will earn a point.

1554
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,950
After playing all the games,

1555
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:32,930
the players with the lowest scores
will lose their lives.

1556
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,160
My gosh.

1557
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,930
It's a majority versus minority.

1558
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,200
But being a part of a majority
must be better most of the time.

1559
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,260
Before the first game starts,

1560
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:45,140
I'll give you a minute
for you to look for your teammate.

1561
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,470
You'll gather after a minute.

1562
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,410
- After a minute?
- Yes.

1563
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,320
Then I should drop by
the betting room.

1564
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,620
- Me too.
- Hold on. I'll go to...

1565
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,010
- the betting room.
- Wait. Jae Suk.

1566
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,320
- Yes?
- Try the Roulette.

1567
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,320
- Come here.
- Okay.

1568
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,450
The Roulette has higher chances.

1569
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:59,320
- Let me play a round too.
- No, we won't be playing that.

1570
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,620
You had the braised chicken earlier.

1571
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,450
- We're playing together.
- Let me have it a go.

1572
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:03,600
We need to play it.

1573
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,760
- No.
- I'll play the Roulette this time.

1574
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,850
You should play the Roulette.

1575
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:07,620
That way you can earn more marbles.

1576
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:09,220
Why don't you bet four each?

1577
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,430
- Bet on the red one.
- Now,

1578
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:12,840
- bet on the color of your choice.
- The Roulette has higher chances.

1579
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,840
Are you betting everything you have?

1580
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,930
I should.
I'll bet everything on red.

1581
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,240
- On red?
- No one's gotten red so far though.

1582
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,510
Should I go for red too?

1583
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,200
- Go for it.
- Just go for red.

1584
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,720
- Let's do this, Se Chan.
- Now,

1585
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,470
I'll spin the Roulette.

1586
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:26,740
- Go for red.
- I think they'll get yellow.

1587
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,490
- Red.
- I don't think you'll get it.

1588
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:29,720
- Red.
- Red.

1589
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,990
Red.

1590
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:33,820
Please.

1591
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,490
(What's the fate
of the pushover brothers?)

1592
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,680
Red.

1593
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,300
It's red.

1594
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,600
It's red!

1595
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,470
(They finally hit the jackpot!)

1596
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:43,840
Did you win?

1597
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,870
(The pushover brothers
finally hit the jackpot.)

1598
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:46,910
They hit the jackpot.

1599
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:48,600
- They got 16 in total.
- We'll get 4 each.

1600
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,140
I'll give you the marbles.

1601
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:53,510
- I can't believe this happened!
- Yes!

1602
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,510
I've been betting on red too.

1603
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:57,720
- We're getting 16.
- What's this?

1604
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,220
- The lights are off.
- We're getting 16.

1605
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,620
(A sudden blackout)

1606
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,120
- What's going on?
- Darn it.

1607
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,720
What's happening?

1608
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:10,260
(Player number 3 waited
for the blackout more than anyone.)

1609
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:15,200
(The lights went off
just as he wished.)

1610
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,070
What's going on?

1611
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,600
(A surprise attack)

1612
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,140
- Hey!
- Hey!

1613
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:22,910
- Hey!
- Hey, are you serious?

1614
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:24,470
- Let go of me!
- Let go!

1615
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,600
- Hey! Song Ji Hyo, that punk.
- Hey!

1616
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,280
This isn't right!

1617
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,070
(Laughing)

1618
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:33,910
Wait, Jong Kook!

1619
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:35,350
(A nightmare where everything
is allowed in the darkness)

1620
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:36,410
He took everything.

1621
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:37,890
Jong Kook! You can't take them all!

1622
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:40,350
No! You can't take them all!

1623
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,120
- Jong Kook.
- Come here.

1624
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,180
(The lights are back on.)

1625
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,660
Come here.

1626
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,490
(Il Nam was being bullied
in the corner.)

1627
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,470
- Why are you so...
- You can't take everything.

1628
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:50,300
- Jong Kook.
- Come here.

1629
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,740
- You can't take everything.
- Come here.

1630
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,100
- Okay. Come here.
- Why did you turn off the lights?

1631
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,530
- Why did you turn off the lights?
- Gosh.

1632
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:56,570
- My gosh.
- Wait a minute.

1633
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:58,570
- Now...
- He took everything.

1634
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,450
This isn't right.

1635
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,200
The marbles in the betting room
are gone too.

1636
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,280
My gosh. Song Ji Hyo, you little...

1637
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,280
- Did she steal yours?
- She put her hand...

1638
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:07,550
You didn't get stolen, did you?

1639
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:09,410
I didn't have many, that's why.

1640
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:11,890
Everyone became savage
when the lights went off.

1641
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:13,350
Just give me enough to make a bet.

1642
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:15,030
The marbles in the betting room
are gone too.

1643
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:17,200
Haha, he took everything I had.

1644
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:19,550
- I can't get back on my feet.
- Hold on.

1645
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:21,260
- He took everything.
- You...

1646
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,470
He threatened to punch me
and took away everything.

1647
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,870
(Right then, Haha and So Min
gather marbles and submit them.)

1648
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:26,930
What are they doing?

1649
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,740
What are they up to?

1650
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,240
(Feigning innocence)

1651
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,100
- Did they pay five each?
- Who are you trying to kill?

1652
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,740
I don't think that's how it works.

1653
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,970
I don't think they went that far.

1654
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,620
(Wailing)

1655
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,820
- Gosh, that scared me.
- That startled me.

1656
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,990
(With the siren,
the agent appeared.)

1657
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:44,320
- Who is out this time?
- Who is it?

1658
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,350
- No way.
- It's Jae Suk.

1659
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,820
- Number one, Yoo Jae Suk, out.
- Gosh. Sir.

1660
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,180
(Number 1, Yoo Jae Suk, out)

1661
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,200
- Hey.
- It wasn't me.

1662
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,890
A while ago, So Min and Haha...

1663
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:56,720
Gosh, these punks.

1664
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,740
That scared me.

1665
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,070
(A cold-blooded world of
Webfoot Octopus Game)

1666
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,240
- That scared me.
- Let's go for it again now.

1667
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,640
Come with me.

1668
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,700
But I don't have any.

1669
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,070
- How many do you have?
- I don't have that many.

1670
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:07,800
- How many do you have?
- I don't have any.

1671
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,600
- Give me five marbles.
- You should give him some.

1672
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,620
Give me five marbles.

1673
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,620
- Give me five marbles.
- So Min and Haha...

1674
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,550
- I only need five.
- When I saw the light...

1675
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:15,720
- in the darkness, I was so scared.
- Who do you want to kill?

1676
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,850
Should I give you one?

1677
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,390
- Go ahead.
- I'll give you one.

1678
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:19,620
Make it balanced.

1679
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,930
You mean So Min, right?
She hasn't been killed, right?

1680
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:23,590
It wasn't me.
You're going to kill me?

1681
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,720
I'll give you one too.

1682
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,720
I gave you a lot.

1683
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,700
- How many do you have?
- Wait. You'll have extra.

1684
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,030
It's not that.

1685
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,800
I'm the one who's paying the most.

1686
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,890
Are you sure? I paid the most.

1687
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,510
- I gave you five marbles.
- I lost a life already.

1688
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:37,600
(Whom will Haha kill?)

1689
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:39,410
You lost just one life, right?

1690
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,970
(Wailing)

1691
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:44,640
I'm eliminating Jae Suk.

1692
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,950
Jae Suk has many lives.

1693
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,680
- Haha.
- Number three.

1694
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,510
- Kim Jong Kook, out.
- Darn it.

1695
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:52,760
- Did you eliminate me?
- No, it was her.

1696
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,180
(Jong Kook is eliminated
all of a sudden?)

1697
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,530
(Did you eliminate me?)

1698
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,120
Wait. He's a complete lunatic.

1699
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,600
Hold on.

1700
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,700
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

1701
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,990
Haha got the marbles from Jong Kook,
but he eliminated him.

1702
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:05,700
That jerk!
He took five marbles from me.

1703
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,930
That's crazy.

1704
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:11,070
No, I eliminated Jae Suk.

1705
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:14,010
- It was Jae Suk.
- You...

1706
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,640
You'd better watch out
when the lights go off next time.

1707
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,640
(You'd better watch out
when the lights go off next time.)

1708
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,320
I'll eliminate Haha.

1709
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:20,720
(In the meantime,
Jae Suk retaliates immediately.)

1710
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,550
- You know me, right?
- Of course.

1711
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,850
You know me, right?

1712
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:26,120
- Is it me again?
- It's Jae Suk.

1713
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,890
- It's Haha.
- It's me?

1714
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:30,180
Number four, Haha, out.

1715
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,530
Give me three marbles.

1716
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:32,550
Haha has only one life left.

1717
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:33,550
- Just three marbles.
- Why?

1718
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:34,990
- Hurry. I can eliminate one.
- Who are you trying to eliminate?

1719
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:37,160
- Hurry! I just need 3 more.
- He's holding 7 marbles.

1720
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,370
- All players, please gather.
- Gosh, I was about to give you.

1721
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:43,200
No. I have only two lives now.

1722
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,280
- Now, you will select your team...
- I'm going to destroy Haha.

1723
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,970
for the first game.

1724
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,870
- All right. Let's do this.
- Choose either square...

1725
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:51,740
- or triangle.
- In one,

1726
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,050
- two, three.
- Two, three.

1727
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:55,010
All right! This is great.

1728
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:56,640
- This is great. It's not bad.
- Four people on Team Square...

1729
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,010
- Come here.
- and three on Team Triangle.

1730
00:55:58,010 --> 00:55:59,760
- I told you to choose square.
- What?

1731
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,990
I told So Min to choose square.

1732
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:03,430
The first game...

1733
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:06,160
is a tug of war,
which requires a lot of strength.

1734
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,890
(It's a tug of war.)

1735
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,530
- We have four people.
- We can beat them.

1736
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:13,910
No. This is...

1737
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,600
- They have more people.
- We're in trouble.

1738
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,530
Jong Kook, it's okay.
I'll pull it like crazy.

1739
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:21,140
You know the rule, right? You need
to hold out for ten seconds first.

1740
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,640
Shall we use the method
from "Squid Game"?

1741
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,640
- Let's do it exactly the same.
- Let's use the same method.

1742
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,180
- Let's try that.
- We'll hang on the rope first?

1743
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,550
- Shall we try that?
- That's how it should be played.

1744
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,720
- It was in "Squid Game".
- Don't pull. We should hold out.

1745
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,350
We shouldn't pull but hold out.

1746
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:34,660
The ones that weigh more
should hold out.

1747
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,090
- We should pull?
- You should pull.

1748
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:38,120
We must win this
because our lives are at stake.

1749
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,600
Our lives are at stake.
We must win this.

1750
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,120
- All right.
- We must...

1751
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,620
Put it under your armpit.

1752
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:44,870
(The players on Team Triangle
are desperate as well.)

1753
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:46,470
- I'm going to destroy them.
- Let it go.

1754
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,870
- I'm going to destroy them.
- Let's do this!

1755
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,010
- Can you pull it a little?
- I learned it from the drama.

1756
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,510
- Ready.
- Wait.

1757
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:56,600
- Get set.
- Lean backward.

1758
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,510
(If you lose, you'll die.)

1759
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,410
Lean backward.

1760
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,860
(As soon as the game starts, both
teams put in their best efforts.)

1761
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:19,260
(Although they have lesser people,)

1762
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,930
(the two men
show superhuman strength.)

1763
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,570
(However...)

1764
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:25,300
(Jeon Mi Nyeo
gets dragged helplessly.)

1765
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,840
(Team Square wins in the end.)

1766
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,950
- Yes!
- It was impossible.

1767
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:30,180
We won!

1768
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:31,680
We have lesser people,
so it was impossible.

1769
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,970
It was too slippery.

1770
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:33,990
(Even the two strong men
couldn't save their team.)

1771
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:35,680
- It was impossible.
- It went okay at the beginning.

1772
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,490
We'll give the four of you
a point each.

1773
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:38,680
- Yes!
- Yes!

1774
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,760
You'll choose your team
for the next game after a minute.

1775
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,760
- All right.
- All right.

1776
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,160
It's important
to be on the right team.

1777
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,200
It's so nerve-racking.

1778
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,760
Imagine if your life depended on it.

1779
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,200
- That's what I was thinking too.
- It'd drive you crazy.

1780
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,660
I have only two lives.

1781
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,160
Don't you have any marbles?

1782
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,010
- I have five.
- We pulled them instantly.

1783
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:57,180
I have one.

1784
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,380
I'll destroy Haha.

1785
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:00,880
I have one.

1786
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:03,470
- How many do you need?
- Can you give me three marbles?

1787
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:04,740
- What?
- Can you give me three marbles?

1788
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,010
- What?
- Three marbles.

1789
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:09,090
We need to take down Jong Kook.

1790
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,590
Why don't we pitch in
one marble each?

1791
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,050
- He gathered enough marbles.
- No.

1792
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,720
He's going to eliminate Haha.

1793
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:15,590
He's going to eliminate me?

1794
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:16,950
- I have only 1 life.
- You have only 1.

1795
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,400
- Is it two?
- Are you going to attack him?

1796
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:22,800
- Here.
- Jae Suk, pitch in more.

1797
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,860
- I don't have any!
- I saw you winning them earlier.

1798
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,570
- I got them stolen.
- Who stole them?

1799
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:27,610
Why you...

1800
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,470
They're coming after you.

1801
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:30,740
Is it me? It can't be.

1802
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,510
Hurry up. Give me two more.

1803
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:35,200
- You need 2?
- Number 4, Haha, out.

1804
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,470
What's this? Two...
Hold on. Two, four...

1805
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:38,970
(He collected enough marbles.)

1806
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:40,340
Hold on. Why don't you
cut it off up there?

1807
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,950
Now I have a reason...

1808
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:43,380
(Now I have a reason
to collect marbles.)

1809
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,380
to collect marbles.

1810
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,360
I'll eliminate Jong Kook.

1811
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,720
- I need to collect more.
- He's cutting it strangely.

1812
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,990
Number three, Kim Jong Kook, out.

1813
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,360
All right. Bring it on.

1814
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,760
- They're on fire!
- All right.

1815
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,030
- Give me one more.
- Things are heated.

1816
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:01,300
- I have one.
- Give me just one marble.

1817
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,360
I'll give you mine.

1818
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,470
I don't need yours. Be quiet.

1819
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:04,470
- Forget it.
- I'll give you one.

1820
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:06,030
I'll be done
if you eliminate me again.

1821
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:08,650
All right. I'll eliminate you
in the next round then.

1822
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,450
Let's kill him.

1823
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:13,340
- Jong Kook.
- Do your best to get screen time.

1824
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:14,740
It's best to stay quiet.

1825
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,910
It's best to stay in the back.

1826
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:18,360
You are done for.

1827
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,590
- He has one life left.
- Talk a lot this time.

1828
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,530
(Haha has one life left.)

1829
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:23,590
All right.

1830
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:27,360
(The current survival status)

1831
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,660
Let's begin
the second selection of teams.

1832
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,760
I will choose randomly.

1833
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,900
I will choose without looking.

1834
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,570
Me too.
I will choose without looking.

1835
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:37,530
- I will flip it and catch it.
- One, two,

1836
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,610
- three.
- This is my choice.

1837
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:42,470
- All right.
- My goodness.

1838
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:44,220
- It's Team Men versus Team Women.
- We are set.

1839
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,050
- We are set.
- Okay.

1840
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,950
- We will beat them.
- I can't believe it happened.

1841
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:50,240
- We will beat them.
- I can't believe it happened.

1842
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,360
- My goodness.
- I apologize.

1843
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,510
- How did this happen?
- Don't apologize.

1844
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:54,880
- Do your best. You are done for.
- Let's do this.

1845
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,260
- You are done for.
- Okay.

1846
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,490
- I apologize.
- It's over.

1847
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:00,530
In the second game,

1848
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,400
(What will the second game be?)

1849
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,800
- a big team has a disadvantage.
- They are so annoying.

1850
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,970
Game of Wits. One.

1851
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,400
Game of Wits. One.

1852
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:08,740
- Two.
- Three.

1853
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,910
- He said one.
- Four.

1854
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:10,930
- Five.
- Six.

1855
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:12,030
- Seven.
- Eight.

1856
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,150
(He was in a daze.)

1857
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:17,240
- Seven.
- Eight.

1858
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,550
(He is out.)

1859
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,720
We survived!

1860
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,820
(Against all odds,
Team Women survived.)

1861
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,220
- Hey.
- Did we lose?

1862
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,050
You should have gone faster.
Why didn't you focus?

1863
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:26,680
- Did we lose?
- You have no wits.

1864
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,820
Did we lose?

1865
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,680
- We lost.
- I mean...

1866
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,490
They are so annoying.

1867
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:32,590
For goodness' sake.

1868
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:34,490
It would have been better
to overlap.

1869
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:36,130
For goodness' sake.

1870
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,300
- Okay.
- Had people overlapped...

1871
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,300
(He sets off with "Okay"
right after the game.)

1872
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,510
- I am sorry, Jong Kook.
- Don't be.

1873
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:42,660
- Please don't eliminate me now.
- Forget it.

1874
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,680
- Please let me play another game.
- You have played enough games.

1875
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,570
Jong Kook,
let him play another game.

1876
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:47,910
I will do my best.

1877
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,010
Play another game then.

1878
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:50,450
I see that he will be eliminated
if he loses another life.

1879
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:52,410
- Make sure you enjoy it.
- I will give you ten marbles.

1880
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:53,680
Forget it. Be quiet.

1881
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,740
- I will give you ten marbles.
- No. I will take you out.

1882
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,010
I wouldn't have minded
if he had simply eliminated my life.

1883
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:00,630
But he eliminated my life
when I had given him five marbles.

1884
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:03,090
I can't let that pass.

1885
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:04,450
- I am sorry.
- Don't be.

1886
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:06,260
- Please. I have three children.
- Forget it.

1887
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,030
- Forget it. Be quiet.
- Jong Kook.

1888
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,700
Where did you get so many marbles?

1889
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:10,930
He took marbles from me.

1890
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:13,200
He took 20 marbles from me.

1891
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,530
He is Park Hae Soo.

1892
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:16,130
- He is totally Park Hae Soo.
- Seriously.

1893
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,800
- That's so funny.
- All right.

1894
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,300
Let's begin
the third selection of teams.

1895
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,740
(It's time
for the third selection of teams.)

1896
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:22,840
Three.

1897
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:24,510
I got square again.

1898
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:25,950
The three of us are a team.

1899
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:28,510
- I will work hard.
- It's okay. It doesn't matter.

1900
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:30,320
- I will give you ten marbles.
- It doesn't matter.

1901
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,380
(It could be Haha's last match.)

1902
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:32,450
It's over.

1903
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:34,260
Move out of the way.

1904
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:35,760
How did we become a team?

1905
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,160
How did this happen?

1906
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,160
(Team Square has
the weakest members.)

1907
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,900
- I don't know about this.
- Why are you smiling?

1908
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,320
- We can do it. It's okay.
- I don't know about this.

1909
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:43,260
- The third game...
- What is it?

1910
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:45,700
requires a burst of strength
and accuracy.

1911
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,110
- It's the Cap Flicking Game.
- Okay.

1912
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:52,010
The team wins if it has the cap
that is closest to the finish line.

1913
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:53,340
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

1914
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,680
Having four members gives us
an advantage.

1915
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:58,150
- I like games like this one.
- It's unrelated to strength.

1916
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:00,150
Imagine that your life is
on the line.

1917
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,590
You would go insane.

1918
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,280
- Jong Kook.
- No.

1919
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,610
Do you have three marbles?
Give them to me.

1920
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:07,930
- You are going to die anyway.
- Share them before you die.

1921
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:09,380
You are going to die anyway,
so give them to me.

1922
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,900
Give them to me.

1923
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:12,260
Give me three marbles, okay?

1924
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,430
I won't die just yet.

1925
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,360
- I won't die just yet. I can do it.
- Haha.

1926
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,470
You are done for.

1927
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:17,990
Who will go first?

1928
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:19,090
(The team wins if one of its caps is
closest to the finish line!)

1929
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:20,430
We just need one winner.

1930
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,840
- We just need 1 winner.
- I will go 1st.

1931
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,430
- Okay.
- It's because...

1932
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,880
Flick it hard.

1933
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,950
(The first cap will block the path.)

1934
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,470
(What will happen
to Jeon Mi Nyeo's cap?)

1935
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:33,410
- Out.
- Out.

1936
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:34,650
(It goes out.)

1937
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:36,740
Put your heart into the game!

1938
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,380
- Suk Jin.
- Your life depends on it!

1939
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,110
- Jeon Mi Nyeo!
- So Min, each failure...

1940
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:41,550
will cost a life!

1941
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:43,490
Why are you playing games
so half-heartedly?

1942
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:45,320
- I did my best.
- I am scared.

1943
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,430
- I am scared.
- Go.

1944
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,590
I did my best.

1945
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:51,490
I did as I practiced earlier.
Why did it slip?

1946
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:52,590
Had this been "Squid Game",

1947
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:54,360
- you would have died.
- Seriously.

1948
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,570
She would have died a while ago.

1949
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,470
- It's past the line.
- Hey.

1950
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:58,630
- Hey.
- Put it behind the line.

1951
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,530
- Listen.
- Do something.

1952
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:02,610
- If this were "Squid Game",
- Hurry up and do something,

1953
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:03,740
you would die
halfway through the show.

1954
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:04,840
Really?

1955
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,840
- You are that kind of character.
- I would have died a while ago.

1956
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:07,990
You would have died
when the light went out.

1957
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:09,820
I got all of my marbles robbed
when the light went out.

1958
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,050
Why don't I flick it this hard?

1959
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,550
- That looks bad.
- Good.

1960
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:18,130
- Good. Zero your aimpoint.
- It will go out.

1961
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:19,490
See? It isn't easy.

1962
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:21,030
- Why did you do it half-heartedly?
- Come on, Ji Hyo.

1963
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,660
- I will go next.
- Ali.

1964
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:23,970
- Ji Hyo.
- I flicked it too hard.

1965
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:24,990
- I think...
- Don't be too ambitious.

1966
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:26,930
If you flick the bottom...

1967
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:28,570
- Flick it.
- You know,

1968
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:30,160
you need to flick it hard.

1969
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,430
Flick it hard.

1970
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,070
(Flicking)

1971
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:40,380
- A meaningless shot.
- I am sorry.

1972
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,840
(Laughing)

1973
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,320
A meaningless shot.

1974
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:46,590
A meaningless shot.

1975
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:48,360
Do it right!

1976
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,160
We glared at you too much.

1977
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:52,800
She deserves to be glared at.

1978
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,530
- Our lives are on the line.
- Stop it.

1979
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,860
Suk Jin, I might end up winning.
Just you wait.

1980
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:59,240
- That won't happen.
- Here I go.

1981
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,800
If everyone's cap goes out...

1982
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,070
Nice.

1983
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:04,610
(It doesn't go far.)

1984
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:05,800
Jong Kook.

1985
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,030
- Hey.
- Jong Kook, it's okay.

1986
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:08,800
- Suk Jin.
- Be quiet.

1987
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,470
- Suk Jin, you need to do this.
- You can do it. Relax your fingers.

1988
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:15,590
(Will Il Nam be able
to seize this opportunity?)

1989
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:17,660
- Suk Jin, you need to do this.
- Relax your fingers.

1990
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,180
- Gosh.
- Why did you do it half-heartedly?

1991
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:23,590
(After all that talk about lives,
he sent the cap flying.)

1992
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:25,320
- Gosh.
- Our lives are on the line.

1993
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,030
- Are you out of your mind?
- You should understand.

1994
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,630
- Suk Jin.
- They don't have many lives left.

1995
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:30,130
Only one person remains per team.

1996
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:31,930
- I should have hit more gently.
- Aim for my cap.

1997
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:33,070
Aim for my cap.

1998
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,630
Then your cap will go that far.
You know what I mean, right?

1999
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,010
Jae Suk, you are our only hope.

2000
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:38,280
This is driving me crazy.

2001
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,840
It will be interesting
if Haha hits one of the caps.

2002
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:42,470
Hit my cap and send it forward.

2003
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,320
- Practice.
- You can't practice.

2004
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,880
- That flick would be too strong.
- Let's go.

2005
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:49,220
Do it gently.
That flick would be too strong.

2006
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:50,610
- All right.
- Do it gently.

2007
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,180
- Aim for my cap.
- That flick would be too strong.

2008
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:54,260
- Okay. You just need to go past it.
- Jae Suk.

2009
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,380
(The cap didn't go far.)

2010
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:57,450
- Okay. You just need to go past it.
- Jae Suk.

2011
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:59,490
- You...
- What was that?

2012
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:01,930
(Team Square received
a golden opportunity.)

2013
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:03,400
- You will win if his cap goes out.
- Just get it this far.

2014
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,900
- His cap will go out.
- It doesn't need to go far.

2015
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,200
- Just get it this far.
- Jae Suk.

2016
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,970
- You can do it.
- Our lives are on the line.

2017
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:12,240
- Relax your fingers.
- Our lives are on the line, okay?

2018
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:13,610
- Flick it gently.
- Hey.

2019
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,450
It just needs to go past this cap.

2020
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:16,700
If you fail, you won't be able...

2021
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,150
to see Ji Ho and your daughter.

2022
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,570
I am sorry. I forgot her name.

2023
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,650
And your daughter.

2024
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:23,720
(He forgot his daughter's name.)

2025
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,220
- I am sorry.
- Na Eun.

2026
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:26,610
- Na Eun.
- Na Eun.

2027
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:27,680
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

2028
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,630
- Na Yeon?
- Na Yeon?

2029
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,360
- Who is Na Yeon?
- All right.

2030
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:32,760
You won't be able
to see Ji Ho and Na Yeon.

2031
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,630
- It's Na Eun.
- Na Eun.

2032
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:38,090
I am sorry. I forgot for a second.

2033
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:40,430
- It's a matter of life and death.
- I know your family members' names.

2034
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:42,110
- How would you know that?
- Your father is Mr. Ji Chang Gyun.

2035
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:44,110
You don't need to know that.
That's not what's important.

2036
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,300
Just get it past this cap, okay?

2037
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:48,510
- Think of Ji Ho and...
- Don't be nervous. Get it this far.

2038
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:50,200
- Jae Suk will win.
- Get it this far.

2039
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,550
- Jae Suk will win.
- Your life is on the line.

2040
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:53,220
- No.
- It's hard. It isn't easy.

2041
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:56,090
(Everyone's life
depends on Jae Suk's shot!)

2042
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:57,110
- Jae Suk will win.
- Your life is on the line.

2043
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,110
No.

2044
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,990
- Okay.
- Yes!

2045
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:05,400
(He turned the tables.)

2046
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,090
Jae Suk.

2047
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,360
Jae Suk, that was incredible.

2048
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:10,840
Jae Suk, that was incredible.

2049
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,240
We did it.

2050
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,030
- We did it.
- There goes Jong Kook.

2051
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,030
- He will take Haha out.
- Please let me play another game.

2052
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:18,110
Please. I will be loyal.

2053
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:19,240
- Jong Kook.
- Move out of the way.

2054
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,380
- I will be loyal.
- Your moves are too erratic.

2055
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:23,180
- Move out of the way.
- Please let me off this once.

2056
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,950
- Move out of the way.
- Please.

2057
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,570
- Haha.
- Please.

2058
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:28,380
- Just one more game.
- No.

2059
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,510
- Just one more game.
- Your moves are too erratic.

2060
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:31,720
- Is Haha out?
- No.

2061
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,860
- No.
- Is he out?

2062
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:34,090
Your moves are too erratic.

2063
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:36,220
(The siren blares.)

2064
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:39,930
I can't believe Jong Kook.

2065
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:41,360
- He took Haha out.
- Of course.

2066
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:42,660
Of course.

2067
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:45,590
Number four, Haha is out.

2068
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:46,970
- Today,
- Haha.

2069
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:49,300
- he really motivated me.
- Haha.

2070
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,700
Which body part will be cut off now?

2071
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:51,970
Oh, no.

2072
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,880
(He runs away.)

2073
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,970
They will show us.

2074
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,300
Ouch! Gosh.

2075
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,780
(The guard fires off
the webfoot octopus bullets.)

2076
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:01,840
That hurts.

2077
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,320
He shot at Haha since he ran away.

2078
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,860
He shot at Haha since he ran away.

2079
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,110
(A firm action is used
for those who try to run.)

2080
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,260
That was cute.

2081
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,550
He shot at Haha.

2082
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:10,590
(Haha gets dragged away
with a gunshot wound on his arm.)

2083
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:11,720
- What will happen to him?
- Bye.

2084
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,260
The guard actually shot him.

2085
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,030
Bye. We will take care
of your three siblings.

2086
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:24,240
(Number of players: 6)

2087
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:27,740
Let's now begin
the last selection of teams.

2088
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,340
- Good.
- It will be six.

2089
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:31,550
(Jong Kook and Se Chan versus
Jae Suk, Suk Jin, Ji Hyo, So Min)

2090
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:32,650
Two.

2091
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:34,050
- Come on.
- She is strong.

2092
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,150
One.

2093
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:37,450
- Three.
- Okay.

2094
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:38,760
(Jong Kook and Se Chan win
a point each.)

2095
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:39,950
- Thank goodness.
- Okay.

2096
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,320
- All right.
- Okay.

2097
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,880
- We needed a smaller number.
- Hold on.

2098
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,050
Who is that man?

2099
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,300
Who is that man?

2100
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,300
- What is going on?
- What is going on?

2101
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,570
- Triangle.
- He really is a squid.

2102
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:50,800
He looks cute.

2103
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,530
- He really is a squid.
- He really is a squid.

2104
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:55,130
- A fresh squid.
- He came back as a squid.

2105
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:59,700
Your final points will be revealed
in the sketchbook.

2106
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:03,010
(Jong Kook, Se Chan, So Min,
Suk Jin, Ji Hyo, Jae Suk)

2107
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:06,240
(Se Chan is at the bottom.)

2108
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:10,050
(The squid will get to work soon.)

2109
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:12,220
- Haha.
- Squid.

2110
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,680
- That was so funny.
- Seriously.

2111
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,030
- That was so funny.
- I feel dizzy.

2112
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:17,220
- He looks cut.
- Don't cut haphazardly.

2113
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:19,450
Where are you trying to cut?
Don't cut my hair. It's here.

2114
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,930
Cut the bottom.

2115
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:23,800
(He unleashes his remaining anger.)

2116
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:29,610
(He wordlessly fires off
the webfoot octopus bullets.)

2117
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:31,630
He won't talk.

2118
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:32,800
I guess he can't talk.

2119
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:35,470
- Guards aren't supposed to talk.
- That's right.

2120
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:38,510
- Are you making hot pants?
- Why are you making it so short?

2121
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:39,750
Why are you making it so short?

2122
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:41,820
It looks like
you are slicing a fruit.

2123
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:43,010
I can't see the seamline.

2124
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:44,550
- Hey.
- It's not an apple.

2125
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:45,960
Stop it.

2126
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:46,990
Hey.

2127
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,160
Be careful.

2128
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,960
Gosh, it keeps going up.

2129
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:52,660
- Enjoy some free time...
- It looks nice.

2130
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,700
before the next game begins.

2131
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,000
It's free time.

2132
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,870
This won't do.

2133
01:08:57,870 --> 01:08:59,870
- I am too nervous.
- Seriously.

2134
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:03,610
All participants, gather around.

2135
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:07,040
It's time for the third mission.

2136
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:09,040
Many participants
could be eliminated...

2137
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,340
as a result of this mission.

2138
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:13,580
It's the Hide-and-Seek of Despair.

2139
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,650
(Hide-and-Seek of Despair)

2140
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:17,040
In a given time,

2141
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,210
correctly guess the number
of the items in order to pass.

2142
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:21,380
- What?
- Hide-and-Seek?

2143
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:22,420
- What are the rules?
- Do we play in the open?

2144
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:24,120
- But we will allow...
- Do we play in the open?

2145
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,420
the error range that corresponds
with the number...

2146
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:29,000
you get on the dice
before the game begins.

2147
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,040
My goodness.

2148
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,540
If your answer is wrong,

2149
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:35,460
your body part
will be severed immediately.

2150
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:37,630
- Gosh.
- Immediately.

2151
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:39,040
Many people will get eliminated.

2152
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,110
People will get weeded out.

2153
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:41,280
What is that?

2154
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:46,780
(A big object enters.)

2155
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:50,380
As you heard, you will see things
that are hard to count.

2156
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:52,790
- There will be three stages.
- Okay.

2157
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,680
- Will the penalty come right away?
- Can three body parts be severed?

2158
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,380
- No matter what...
- Gosh.

2159
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:58,030
No matter what, I have to do well.

2160
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,700
I have one life left.

2161
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,170
This could take people out at once.

2162
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:03,400
- Just...
- I don't know. Let's see.

2163
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,590
Don't worry about winning.
Ji Hyo or So Min will win.

2164
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:07,800
You will have 30 seconds
to count the 1st object.

2165
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,910
One, two, three.

2166
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:11,470
- What?
- My goodness.

2167
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:13,870
- What are those?
- This is Webfoot Octopus Game.

2168
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:17,040
(Count long-legged octopuses.)

2169
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:21,580
(Count them in 30 seconds
to save your life.)

2170
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:22,750
One, two, three.

2171
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,210
- Do we count them?
- What?

2172
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:25,920
- My goodness.
- What are those?

2173
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:26,920
- This is Webfoot Octopus Game.
- Do we count them?

2174
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:27,920
Now?

2175
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:32,620
(They will lose a life
if they fail.)

2176
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:36,260
- Do we count them now?
- How am I supposed to...

2177
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:38,040
How am I supposed to count them?

2178
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:41,630
- Gosh.
- One, two...

2179
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,710
- Hold on.
- They are moving. What should I do?

2180
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:45,870
How am I supposed to count them?

2181
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:48,670
(They move and huddle close.)

2182
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:51,920
(Long-legged octopuses
even have eight legs.)

2183
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,420
Hold on. This one keeps moving.
Where does it end?

2184
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:57,010
(They count long-legged octopuses
to save their lives.)

2185
01:10:57,650 --> 01:10:59,920
Hold on. This one keeps moving.
Where does it end?

2186
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:01,580
Ten seconds remain.

2187
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:02,660
Ten.

2188
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:05,120
I have no idea.
How am I supposed to count them?

2189
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,120
How many are there?

2190
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,030
I will need to take a wild guess.
I can't count them.

2191
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:11,930
Our lives are on the line.

2192
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,760
They keep moving. One, two, three...

2193
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,830
Cover the sink.

2194
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:17,630
I don't know how many are inside.

2195
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:19,130
How am I supposed to know?

2196
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:21,300
You can set the error range.

2197
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,870
- The error range.
- Is it chosen at random?

2198
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:25,370
- Bigger numbers give an advantage.
- That's right.

2199
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:26,370
(Roll a die
that has numbers from 1 to 3.)

2200
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:28,920
(Bigger numbers will increase
their chances of success.)

2201
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,380
- Is three the biggest number?
- Yes.

2202
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:32,380
(Suk Jin, the man with 2 lives,
goes 1st.)

2203
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:36,120
- Two. That's not too bad.
- Your error range is two.

2204
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,000
- Okay.
- That's not half bad.

2205
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,400
It's my turn.

2206
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,670
Everyone will lose a body part. One.

2207
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,620
- He will lose a body part.
- Give me three.

2208
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:44,670
I will lose a body part.

2209
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:47,370
- Two.
- It bounced.

2210
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:48,760
That's too bad.

2211
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:50,910
- One.
- One.

2212
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:52,110
Everyone will lose a body part.

2213
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,110
It's bound to happen.

2214
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:55,450
- One.
- Gosh.

2215
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:57,780
It was three
before the dice bounced.

2216
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,080
- Three.
- I am jealous.

2217
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,320
Take turns and guess
the number of long-legged octopuses.

2218
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,880
I don't know the answer.

2219
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,420
- Can our answers overlap?
- Yes.

2220
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,030
My answer is 45.

2221
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,530
Your answer is 45.

2222
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,530
- I think 50 would be too big.
- My answer is 39.

2223
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:14,330
- Your answer is 39.
- There are more than that.

2224
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,330
I know.

2225
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:16,530
Don't say that.

2226
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:17,670
(Jae Suk)

2227
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:19,290
- My answer is 49.
- Your answer is 49.

2228
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:20,370
That's a good one.

2229
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:22,330
My answer is 47.

2230
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:24,460
Your answer is 47. Suk Jin.

2231
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:25,630
My answer is 51.

2232
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:27,280
Are there that many?

2233
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,000
Jong Kook.

2234
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,210
(Jong Kook)

2235
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:31,210
My answer is 46.

2236
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:32,870
(Jong Kook: 45 to 47)

2237
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:35,510
- My answer is 46.
- I should have gotten 3.

2238
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:38,660
(Se Chan, So Min, Jae Suk,
Ji Hyo, Suk Jin, Jong Kook)

2239
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:40,210
The answer will be revealed.

2240
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:41,420
(Se Chan, So Min, Jae Suk,
Ji Hyo, Suk Jin, Jong Kook)

2241
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:42,880
- Three people survived.
- What?

2242
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,050
Three people? I must be wrong.

2243
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:46,050
The answer...

2244
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:47,920
(Se Chan, So Min, Jae Suk,
Ji Hyo, Suk Jin, Jong Kook)

2245
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,920
is 50.

2246
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,030
Gosh.

2247
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:51,430
Jae Suk, Suk Jin,
and Ji Hyo survived.

2248
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:52,460
I survived.

2249
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:54,430
I knew 50 would be the answer.

2250
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:55,830
- Were there that many?
- Were there that many?

2251
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:57,500
- We lose a body part, right?
- I had a feeling...

2252
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,870
that there were 50.

2253
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:00,280
- It's okay to lose a body part.
- Number three,

2254
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,670
Jong Kook is out.

2255
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:03,300
- It's okay.
- I am out. I have one life left.

2256
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,280
- Are you out?
- I am out.

2257
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:08,580
Number seven, Se Chan is out.

2258
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:10,120
Gosh, I survived somehow.

2259
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:12,880
- Number 6, So Min is out.
- I knew it would be 50.

2260
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,490
I felt like 50 would be
the right answer.

2261
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:15,660
Were there 50 long-legged octopuses?

2262
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:17,050
I was going to say 50.

2263
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:18,500
(Hide-and-Seek of Despair
took out 3 people.)

2264
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:19,790
What is that?

2265
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:21,530
What is that?

2266
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:22,760
(The next object enters.)

2267
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,500
Maybe it's a mountain of doughnuts.

2268
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,240
The cloth will be removed
on the count of three.

2269
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:30,370
One, two, three.

2270
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,040
(Screaming)

2271
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:35,210
Gosh, there are too many.

2272
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,870
How will we count them?

2273
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:38,920
Can we touch them?

2274
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,340
You can't touch them.

2275
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:42,490
We can't touch them.

2276
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,150
Roughly...

2277
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:47,380
- My rough guess is 30.
- My rough guess is 40.

2278
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:48,680
Somewhere between 30 and 40.

2279
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,680
My guess is 40.

2280
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,290
(Completely focused)

2281
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,400
(How many are there?)

2282
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:58,540
- It's impossible to count them.
- I am so annoyed.

2283
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:01,710
They keep moving. Hold on.

2284
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
(The little webfoot octopus
acts out.)

2285
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
How many are there?

2286
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,330
- Count with them.
- Hey, get lost.

2287
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:07,740
Get lost.

2288
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,210
- This is really hard.
- This is driving me crazy.

2289
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:12,470
Counting 30, 40...

2290
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,650
- Counting 40...
- I can't count them.

2291
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:15,790
It's impossible to count them.

2292
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:16,950
There are about 30.

2293
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:18,920
- Gosh.
- I will go with 30.

2294
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,530
I think 40 would be too big.
I will go with 30 or 35.

2295
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:24,490
Right now...

2296
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:26,220
All right. Cover the sink.

2297
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:27,900
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

2298
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,830
- Seriously.
- I can't count loaches.

2299
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:32,430
- Let's decide on the error range.
- Okay.

2300
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:33,930
I will throw it first.

2301
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,260
Okay. I did it.

2302
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,830
- Let's get three.
- That's not too bad.

2303
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:40,080
I am dead.

2304
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:42,780
- My answer is 40.
- My answer is 37.

2305
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,670
My answer is 38.

2306
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:46,650
(Jae Suk: 36 to 40)

2307
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:48,150
My answer is 37.

2308
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,150
(Ji Hyo: 35 to 39)

2309
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:50,180
My answer is 35.

2310
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:51,710
My answer is 35.

2311
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:52,920
(Jong Kook: 34 to 36)

2312
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,330
- I will lose a body part.
- I will die if it isn't 35.

2313
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:57,030
- All right. This is interesting.
- Did anyone survive?

2314
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:58,200
Why? Did anyone survive?

2315
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,920
Half of the members survived.

2316
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,030
This is driving me crazy.

2317
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:03,030
- I guess I am not one of them.
- It must be them again.

2318
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:04,120
I think I survived.

2319
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,170
The answer...

2320
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:07,200
(Jong Kook, Se Chan, and Suk Jin
are out if their answers are wrong.)

2321
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:09,040
(So Min, Se Chan, Jae Suk,
Ji Hyo, Suk Jin, Jong Kook)

2322
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,630
is 40.

2323
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:11,930
- I survived.
- I survived.

2324
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:13,610
- You jerk!
- I survived.

2325
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:15,580
I said that there were 40.

2326
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:16,910
- I survived.
- I survived, right?

2327
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:17,910
I survived.

2328
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:19,040
(Jae Suk, Se Chan,
and So Min survived.)

2329
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:20,510
- I survived.
- I survived, right?

2330
01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:22,120
I survived. My answer was 38.

2331
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,920
I should have picked 39.

2332
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,120
I said that there were 40.
For goodness' sake.

2333
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,290
- Are you out?
- I am done for.

2334
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:29,550
Me too.

2335
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,330
- Number two, Suk Jin is out.
- Okay.

2336
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:34,160
Number three, Jong Kook is out.

2337
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,700
- I said that there were 40.
- I will follow you. I am done for.

2338
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,570
If you survive this round,

2339
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:42,000
only the final remains.

2340
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,760
Hurry up and change.

2341
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,300
- Does that mean I have a chance?
- Yes.

2342
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:49,750
(Ali has survived for a long time
despite having one life left.)

2343
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,470
Hurry up.

2344
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,710
I will join you soon.

2345
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:58,660
All right.
Here comes the last question.

2346
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,510
(Will they become webfoot octopuses
or move on to the final?)

2347
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:01,530
Remove...

2348
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:02,530
(It's the last round
of Hide-and-Seek of Despair.)

2349
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:03,990
the cloth.

2350
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:06,220
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2351
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:07,400
What?

2352
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,030
(Gosh.)

2353
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:10,500
You have 30 seconds.

2354
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,590
Isn't it a painting?

2355
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:12,760
(The last stage involves carps.)

2356
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,630
- What should I do?
- I thought it was a painting.

2357
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:17,760
(Jae Suk counts them as a group.)

2358
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:19,910
- They are moving too much.
- Ten seconds remain.

2359
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:24,780
In 10, 9, 8, 7,

2360
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,120
- six, five,
- What should I do?

2361
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,150
four, three, two, one.

2362
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,880
Time's up. Come on.

2363
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,120
- All right.
- I mean...

2364
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,830
No way.

2365
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:38,920
Go away.

2366
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:41,120
(The little one is absorbed
in his role.)

2367
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:42,900
I am dead.

2368
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:46,040
All right. Let's roll the dice.

2369
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,040
Roll the dice.

2370
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:48,910
Rolling the dice is important.

2371
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,630
My answer is 35.

2372
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:52,670
- Your answer is 35.
- The number is smaller than that.

2373
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:54,870
My error range is two, right?

2374
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,300
My answer is 32.

2375
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,650
- I am safe if it's 30, right?
- Yes.

2376
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:00,040
Okay. My answer is 32.

2377
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:01,580
- My answer...
- It won't be a round number.

2378
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:03,420
is 30. No, 31.

2379
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,650
- Your answer is 31.
- Yes.

2380
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:06,050
(Ji Hyo: 29 to 33)

2381
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:07,490
There must be more than 25.

2382
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:10,030
- There must be more than 25.
- Hurry over here.

2383
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:11,790
- I think so.
- My answer is 30.

2384
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:12,900
- Okay.
- There can't be 30.

2385
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:14,920
- Our answers are about the same.
- If the answers...

2386
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,420
are 50, 40, and 30,
I would be disappointed.

2387
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:19,330
You never know.
Maybe they used it against them.

2388
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,630
The answer...

2389
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:23,410
(So Min, Se Chan, Ji Hyo, Jae Suk)

2390
01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:24,570
is 34.

2391
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:27,500
(So Min, Se Chan)

2392
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,000
- I survived.
- I was off by one, right?

2393
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,750
- I survived.
- Me too.

2394
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,420
(Se Chan and So Min survived.)

2395
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:34,510
(This one passed all 3 questions
with a single life.)

2396
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:37,450
- Let's move on to the final!
- Number one, Jae Suk is out.

2397
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:39,680
Number five, Ji Hyo is out.

2398
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,250
- Who is out?
- I survived.

2399
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,580
Come here, Ji Hyo.

2400
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:44,220
(Only the last stage remains.)

2401
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:45,920
I will use the money well.

2402
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:48,530
I will buy presents.

2403
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,220
Let's go racing with the money.

2404
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:51,220
Yes.

2405
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:55,710
Final survivors, gather around.

2406
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,110
All right.

2407
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:59,370
I am moving on

2408
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:01,300
To the final

2409
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:03,840
With one life left

2410
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:04,950
He dodged.

2411
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,970
- He dodged my bullets.
- I am moving on

2412
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:08,820
To the final

2413
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:11,990
With one life left

2414
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:15,720
(The siren blares.)

2415
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,590
(Why is the siren blaring
at this point?)

2416
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:22,260
(Who died?)

2417
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:23,400
Who died?

2418
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:25,540
Se Chan is out.

2419
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:27,930
Number seven, Se Chan is out.

2420
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:28,930
Hold on.

2421
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:31,610
- Why did you behave flippantly?
- Hey.

2422
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:32,930
- Hold on.
- Why did you behave flippantly?

2423
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:34,500
- Hey.
- I am moving on

2424
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,280
- You behaved flippantly.
- To the final

2425
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,580
- Hey. This is too much.
- I am moving on

2426
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:41,950
- Why did you behave flippantly?
- Please take him out.

2427
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,010
(Why did Se Chan get eliminated?)

2428
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:44,880
- I survived.
- Me too.

2429
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,420
(It was the work of the member
who sent through a lot with him.)

2430
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,720
- Let's move on to the final!
- We need to take Se Chan out.

2431
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:52,720
We need to take Se Chan out.

2432
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,830
I am moving on

2433
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,120
- To the final
- Se Chan.

2434
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:59,040
(His song became a funeral march.)

2435
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,630
Please take him out.

2436
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:03,930
(They feel refreshed
after taking him out.)

2437
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:05,630
- Go and change.
- Gosh.

2438
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:07,410
- It ended so fruitlessly.
- Listen.

2439
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:08,500
- One of the three will win.
- Hey.

2440
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,250
We can't go all together.

2441
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:13,280
Okay? Don't even think about it.

2442
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,820
Number seven, Se Chan is out.

2443
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:18,660
(Number of Players: 4
Cash Prize: 3,000 dollars)

2444
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:21,880
(Number of Players: 3
Cash Prize: 3,000 dollars)

2445
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:25,290
(The final game)

2446
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:30,500
My heartiest congratulations
to the final survivors.

2447
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:34,870
The final game is
Jackstones on the Cliff.

2448
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:35,870
(The final game,
Jackstones on the Cliff)

2449
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:37,610
- Jackstones?
- You will place...

2450
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:40,500
five jackstones on the back
of your hand.

2451
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:44,040
If you catch all five stones,
you will win the prize money.

2452
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:45,920
- I'm really bad at this.
- But if you fail,

2453
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,370
you will lose your life.

2454
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:48,710
I'm good at playing jackstones.

2455
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:52,920
If you have lives left,
you can try it again.

2456
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:56,880
Those who succeed
will be co-champions.

2457
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:58,900
We catch the jackstones?

2458
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,590
I'm really good at this.

2459
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:02,000
No, you're not.

2460
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,090
- I really am.
- What are you talking about?

2461
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:05,900
We just catch the five jackstones?

2462
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:07,400
- Yes.
- That's it?

2463
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,870
- That's it.
- It's so easy.

2464
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:10,870
They just need to catch the stones.

2465
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:13,430
Gosh, I can catch only four stones.

2466
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,610
- Gosh.
- This is...

2467
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:17,370
You should spread
your fingers like this.

2468
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:19,780
- This is crazy. I can't do this.
- My hand is too small.

2469
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:22,540
So Min, you might become
the single winner.

2470
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:23,580
So Min.

2471
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:25,290
(Catching all the stones)

2472
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:26,820
So Min is good.

2473
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:31,080
Look at her.
So Min will definitely win.

2474
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:32,420
All right.

2475
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,530
- This is a death match.
- For 3,000 dollars.

2476
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:36,790
You'll do it in turn.

2477
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:38,330
It's a death match
for 3,000 dollars.

2478
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:39,590
So Min, you do it.

2479
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:40,930
All right.

2480
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:41,930
(Each member has two chances.)

2481
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:42,960
This is fun.

2482
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,610
Then you're out.

2483
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:50,000
Let's begin. Okay. Let's go.

2484
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,670
This is the final game
for the prize money.

2485
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,250
It begins now.

2486
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:57,650
(It begins now.)

2487
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,580
All right. So Min goes first,
and Ji Hyo goes next.

2488
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:01,990
- Start.
- Do I get to practice it?

2489
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:03,380
- No, you don't.
- I'll try then.

2490
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:04,880
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

2491
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:10,400
(She puts all the 5 stones
on her hand and throws them.)

2492
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:14,260
Oh no.

2493
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:16,500
- Cut it off.
- Jeon So Min is out.

2494
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,610
- Oh no.
- She's out.

2495
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:21,410
(Jeon Mi Nyeo's first attempt
ends up in failure.)

2496
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,450
- Let me take care of it.
- I have only one life left.

2497
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:24,670
Cut it.

2498
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:26,150
Who's next?

2499
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:27,870
I just can't catch them.

2500
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:30,080
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo, are you ready?

2501
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,160
- I had them on my hand.
- Yes.

2502
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,320
- Let me try.
- I bet she will drop them.

2503
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:35,680
She has small hands.

2504
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:40,500
- Gosh.
- That was too high.

2505
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,370
(Dropping the stones)

2506
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:44,000
- All right.
- Ji Hyo...

2507
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,260
What did you play
when you were little?

2508
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:47,500
- That's because my hands are small.
- Song Ji Hyo is out.

2509
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,670
You all have only one life left.

2510
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:49,800
- Please cut it.
- Should I cut it?

2511
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,800
Cut it.

2512
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,580
What if Jae Suk wins?

2513
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:53,710
Hang on.

2514
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:56,410
- This is driving me crazy.
- So Min is more likely to win.

2515
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:57,970
Jae Suk must feel nervous.

2516
01:21:57,970 --> 01:22:00,780
- I'm feeling nervous.
- That's what always happens.

2517
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:03,490
Just take it easy.

2518
01:22:03,490 --> 01:22:04,920
- I will...
- He'll be overwhelmed by tension.

2519
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,490
I did mess up
the game of slap-match.

2520
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:09,290
When he feels nervous...

2521
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:10,880
- I even failed to touch the ttakji.
- Seriously?

2522
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,420
- I knew it.
- Because I was nervous.

2523
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:14,000
- That's what he does.
- Because everyone was watching.

2524
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,500
You don't have to throw them high.

2525
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:17,290
- He's really...
- Can I try it now?

2526
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:18,430
- Yes.
- Take it easy.

2527
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,710
(He placed the stones on his hand.)

2528
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,630
I don't think he can do it.
He did it.

2529
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,040
It's done. Take your time.

2530
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:29,500
(Groaning)

2531
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:30,500
Take your time.

2532
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,170
(He threw the stones away.)

2533
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:33,170
It was so close.

2534
01:22:33,170 --> 01:22:35,790
- Number one, Jae Suk is out.
- Why is it so hard?

2535
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:37,920
- Go ahead and cut it.
- Where?

2536
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,620
Now you all have only one life left.

2537
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:40,620
Let me cut it for you.

2538
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:42,180
If they fail, will they be out?

2539
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,680
If you succeed, you'll survive.

2540
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,360
If you fail, you'll be out.

2541
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,420
My heart is pounding so fast.
I'm in trouble.

2542
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:49,260
This is driving me crazy.

2543
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,090
If all of you fail,
no one will win the prize money.

2544
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:52,430
My goodness.

2545
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:54,630
No one will get the money
after we go through all this?

2546
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:56,910
I hope all three of you will fail.

2547
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:58,780
- All right.
- That's better.

2548
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,410
- I like that.
- Then it's only fair.

2549
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:02,910
Will So Min become
the single winner...

2550
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:04,170
for the first time?

2551
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:05,870
- It will be my first time.
- Seriously?

2552
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:07,150
- Yes.
- Really?

2553
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:08,250
- Try your best.
- You should win.

2554
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:10,250
But I'm feeling so nervous.
What do I do?

2555
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:11,290
You were good earlier.

2556
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:13,820
She's good. So Min,
pull yourself together.

2557
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:15,550
I can't focus.

2558
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,050
This is all about mental strength.

2559
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:18,460
You were doing just fine.

2560
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:22,090
(Will she catch the stones
as she did while practicing?)

2561
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:23,900
- This is all about mental strength.
- You were doing just fine.

2562
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,290
(Rolling)

2563
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:27,540
(Sighing)

2564
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:28,540
She failed.

2565
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:29,800
Oh dear.

2566
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:31,170
Bye.

2567
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:32,910
So Min was...

2568
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:34,240
- She did a good job earlier.
- She was good.

2569
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:35,250
Hey.

2570
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:37,970
Number six, So Min is out.

2571
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:39,540
- I was nervous.
- You should catch it right away.

2572
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:41,010
- I was too nervous.
- The thing is,

2573
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:43,620
they feel nervous
because it's for 3,000 dollars.

2574
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:45,040
You should just catch it right away.

2575
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,660
There's no way Ji Hyo can do this.

2576
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:47,920
- I can't do this.
- Give it a try.

2577
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,160
I'll try anyway.

2578
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,180
Don't spread your fingers like that.

2579
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:51,900
You throw them too hard.

2580
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,900
- She doesn't seem good.
- I have small hands.

2581
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:56,830
That's not why. It's just
that you throw them too high.

2582
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:58,790
- Okay.
- All right.

2583
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:00,500
- Just leave her be.
- This is for 3,000 dollars.

2584
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:01,500
- So she feels nervous.
- I hope she will make it.

2585
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:02,760
- Make it low?
- Yes.

2586
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,670
- It should be kept low.
- This is for 3,000 dollars.

2587
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:06,080
Good luck.

2588
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:08,910
Good luck.

2589
01:24:11,450 --> 01:24:12,620
(Dropping)

2590
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:13,780
Can she really do this?

2591
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:14,970
- Gosh.
- I knew it.

2592
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:16,420
(Song Ji Hyo failed.)

2593
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:17,450
All right.

2594
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,250
Number five, Ji Hyo is out.

2595
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:22,880
Jae Suk, you should win.

2596
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:24,860
Let's not say anything.

2597
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,830
Go, Jae Suk.

2598
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,290
Jae Suk, you should do this.

2599
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:31,570
- Jae Suk, take the money.
- If no one wins,

2600
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:33,260
- all our efforts will end in vain.
- You should take it.

2601
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:34,590
You can't make it this way.
It's too high.

2602
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:37,240
You should keep it
as low as possible.

2603
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,800
- If Jae Suk fails, is it over?
- It's too high.

2604
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,170
Jae Suk, don't try to throw them.

2605
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:44,500
Try to keep the stones as they are
while you flip your hand.

2606
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:45,750
It's still too high.

2607
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,920
I just can't do things right
at a time like this.

2608
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:49,920
(I just can't do things right
at a time like this.)

2609
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,540
- Because you feel nervous.
- Because I'm under pressure.

2610
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:52,660
You're a dad.

2611
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:53,880
Just give it a go.

2612
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,180
- Why are you shaking your hands?
- Just do it.

2613
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:57,990
Don't get carried away.

2614
01:24:57,990 --> 01:24:59,720
- It's a close-up shot syndrome.
- Why is it so hard?

2615
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,400
This is about 3,000 dollars.

2616
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,700
But why are you shaking so hard?

2617
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,170
- I'll give it a try.
- Okay.

2618
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,200
He's doing it.

2619
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:11,630
He did it. Catch them.

2620
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:14,080
It's done. All you need to do
is catch them.

2621
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,280
(He managed to place
the stones on his hand.)

2622
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,040
- Put them together.
- Do it gently.

2623
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,280
- It's almost done.
- It's 3,000 dollars.

2624
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:20,650
It's done.

2625
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:21,870
(He threw them!)

2626
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:27,360
(They've played Webfoot Octopus Game
all day since early morning.)

2627
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:32,700
(This is the finish
of the long game.)

2628
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:34,920
- It's almost done.
- It's 3,000 dollars.

2629
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,200
It's done.

2630
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:40,260
(He caught them.)

2631
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,960
(Unbelievable)

2632
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:42,960
He did it?

2633
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:44,910
- Did he nail it?
- He did.

2634
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:47,630
- He did it.
- Number one is the final winner.

2635
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:49,340
- He looked like Lee Jung Jae.
- My gosh.

2636
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:51,450
- Share the money with us.
- Congratulations.

2637
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:52,780
- He won?
- Congratulations.

2638
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:53,840
Congratulations.

2639
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:55,920
I made it to the finals
for the first time.

2640
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,790
Was it your first time?
I think you did it before.

2641
01:25:58,490 --> 01:26:00,360
All the games are over.

2642
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,680
Gosh, you did it.

2643
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,080
My heartiest congratulations...

2644
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,400
to the final survivor.

2645
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,400
(My heartiest congratulations
to the final survivor.)

2646
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,530
The money is coming down.

2647
01:26:10,590 --> 01:26:11,590
(Surprised)

2648
01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:12,700
The money is coming down.

2649
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,430
It is a total of 3,000 dollars.

2650
01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:16,110
- Really?
- Are you serious?

2651
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:18,370
- Congratulations.
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

2652
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:20,080
Congratulations.

2653
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,910
- Thank you.
- Okay.

2654
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:25,650
- No one knew I'd be the winner.
- Right.

2655
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:27,670
But I survived to the end.

2656
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:30,420
That's me!

2657
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:32,460
(That's me!)

2658
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:34,210
All right!

2659
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:36,290
(Number of Players: 2
Cash Prize: 3,000 dollars)

2660
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:37,880
(Number of Players: 1
Cash Prize: 3,000 dollars)

2661
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,790
(We will die if we fall.)

2662
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:42,000
- Il Nam.
- Three, two, one.

2663
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:43,900
(MC Minzy: This is
the last thing I want to do.)

2664
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,960
(Yeji: I'm horrible
at making a guess.)

2665
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,500
(Luda: This is so scary.)

2666
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:48,910
Here's the hero of our team.

2667
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:50,630
- Gosh, be careful.
- Watch out.

2668
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:52,500
(BIBI: She's fearless.)

2669
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,800
He disappeared.

2670
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,040
(A few hours ago,
they decided who would go first.)

2671
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:59,150
(They have to pick larger numbers
no matter what.)

2672
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:03,010
(He gives up his big face
to get a larger number.)

2673
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,120
(I'll go.)

2674
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:06,360
(But they are acting mean.)

2675
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:08,120
(We don't know it yet.)

2676
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:09,550
(I might be your future wife.)

2677
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:12,590
(They give up their future
out of fear.)

2678
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,220
(How will their attempt to get
a larger number end up?)

2679
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:16,590
- Who was that?
- I say woo
