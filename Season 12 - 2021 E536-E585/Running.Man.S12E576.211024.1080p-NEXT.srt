1
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:12,410
(It's fall when you want to walk
listening to a sad ballad song.)

2
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,770
(The members have gathered again
on a breezy fall day.)

3
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,810
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,150
Hello.

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,900
It's been a while
since we came here.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,220
This is where we shoot
the opening with many guests.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,810
And the guests come down the stairs.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,220
- Right. Back then, Dong Geun...
- Cha Tae Hyun.

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,860
- Dong Geun was here.
- And Mi Joo.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,220
- Mi Joo.
- Right. Mi Joo was here.

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,290
- And...
- How do you remember all that?

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,950
- What?
- How do you remember that?

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,130
- Of course, he does.
- I remember.

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,120
I guess we're having guests today.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,830
This is unique. It's good
for a vaccine injection.

16
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,570
Right. This is for vaccination.

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,930
It's called the vaccination look.

18
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,290
- Is this the vaccination look?
- Yes. I got the second shot.

19
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,860
She got the second shot,
but she's just fine.

20
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,300
I was sick after the first shot.

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,680
- Hi, Jong Kook.
- Hey.

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,900
Hello.

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,780
(Another vaccinated member is here.)

24
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,400
Are you feeling all right
after getting the vaccine?

25
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,780
- I'm fine.
- Are you okay now?

26
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,610
- He's finally survived.
- This is what I thought.

27
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,750
I worked hard
after getting the shot.

28
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,820
- Then I fell sick.
- Right.

29
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,120
I feel like a superhero.

30
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,530
They suffer in pain
after getting a shot.

31
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,020
He thinks he's a superhero.

32
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,400
- Are you a superhero?
- After they overcome it,

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,130
they become stronger.

34
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,440
- You're aroused.
- I feel stronger now.

35
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,660
- Hey.
- Even stronger?

36
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,830
Yes. I feel great.

37
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,330
Aren't you just a bodybuilder?

38
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,940
Why are you a superhero?

39
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,940
I overcame the vaccination...

40
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,380
- and became stronger.
- Come closer.

41
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,880
- Today...
- This is nice.

42
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,710
We will have
four refreshing guests...

43
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,350
who will recharge your vitamins.

44
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,520
- This is what we need.
- I knew we'd have guests today.

45
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,990
- Really?
- Refreshing?

46
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,550
So Min is dressed like this.

47
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,850
- I know two of them.
- But she won't stand out.

48
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,160
This is somber.

49
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,550
Please come on out.

50
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,400
Come on out, refreshing guests!

51
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,520
- Refreshing guests?
- Refreshing!

52
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,440
(The first refreshing guest
shows up.)

53
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,960
It's ITZY!

54
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,040
(Yeji of ITZY)

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,800
Yeji is here.

56
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,770
(It's ITZY!)

57
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,070
Jeon So Min, go away!

58
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,300
It's Yeji.

59
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,470
This is amazing.
I've never met her before.

60
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,110
- Who is she?
- Yeji.

61
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,610
Yeji of ITZY.

62
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,320
(He pretends to know her.)

63
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,660
You know the song.
Dear moon, deer moon

64
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,490
Dear moon, deer moon

65
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,390
- Yeji.
- Hello.

66
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,500
How have you been?

67
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,760
I'm different from kids these days

68
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,940
- My gosh.
- Hello.

69
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,840
- She looks sophisticated.
- I didn't know Yeji would come.

70
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,440
She's so sophisticated.

71
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,230
Who would say
such a thing these days?

72
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,440
Look at Yeji's hairstyle.

73
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,100
If you dare to copy it...

74
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,200
- You'll be in trouble.
- You'll be in big trouble.

75
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,750
- It looks good only on Yeji.
- Yes.

76
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,010
- She's not like kids these days.
- It's Moon Hee Joon's style.

77
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,720
I know. Say hello to our viewers.

78
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,910
She's so pretty.

79
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,380
Hello. I'm Yeji of ITZY.

80
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,480
- She looks like a doll.
- I know.

81
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,420
- This is amazing.
- Unbelievable.

82
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,820
Go away.

83
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,320
It hurts. It's been only three days.

84
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,690
Really? I'm sorry.

85
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,290
- The vaccine.
- So Min...

86
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,500
So Min will text you
after the shooting.

87
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,260
- "Haha, I'm sad."
- "I'm sad."

88
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,470
(Jeon So Min: Haha, I'm sad.)

89
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,940
Then I'll block your number.

90
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,310
Let's move on...

91
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,070
- to the second guest.
- Who is it?

92
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,470
- Refreshing and cheerful!
- Please come on out.

93
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,350
The guest I know isn't here yet.

94
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,850
Luda!

95
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,190
(Luda of WJSN)

96
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,290
Hey, Luda.

97
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,190
(Cheerful charm)

98
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,660
(The cute member of WJSN, Luda)

99
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,690
(The vocal of WJSN
with a warm voice)

100
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,820
Hey, Luda.

101
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,260
- WJSN.
- It's WJSN.

102
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,370
Luda!

103
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,470
Go away!

104
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,600
(Giggling)

105
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,700
Hi, Luda.

106
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,470
Wait.

107
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,670
- Luda.
- Luda.

108
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,940
- You know what?
- What?

109
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,380
Luda touched
her hair like this, and...

110
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,170
- What was that?
- It's refreshing.

111
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,780
- That's not it.
- What was that, Luda?

112
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,940
She came down the stairs
like this holding the pillar.

113
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,140
Did you see that?

114
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,160
(She did all the typical moves
of idol artists in a short time.)

115
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,920
- What was that?
- I tried to look cool.

116
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,100
I was told to be refreshing.

117
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,160
Refreshing.

118
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,870
- Refreshing.
- Haha was really funny.

119
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,000
He shouted like this,
turned around, and asked,

120
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,570
"Who is she?"

121
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,130
- That's not true.
- Excuse me.

122
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,670
I know she's WJSN. I asked her name.

123
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,200
(He shouts out loud immediately.)

124
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,570
(Who is she?)

125
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,720
- WJSN.
- It's WJSN.

126
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,750
- Hey, Luda.
- Go away.

127
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,320
This is our first time meeting you.

128
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,130
- This is how we become friends.
- Please be understanding.

129
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,190
You will be famous this way.

130
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,630
He keeps asking me about the guests.

131
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,390
Be honest. Do you know
all the members of WJSN?

132
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,020
- Do you?
- To be honest,

133
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,190
WJSN doesn't really know you.

134
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,070
- They know only a few of us.
- I worked with them a lot.

135
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,610
- WJSN...
- You worked with me a lot, right?

136
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,610
- A radio show.
- We did a radio show. And...

137
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,670
Right.

138
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,980
Even if they know you,

139
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,270
they are not interested in you.

140
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,940
I don't care that they are not.

141
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,940
- I only care about my wife.
- He's upset.

142
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,250
- "I don't care."
- I don't.

143
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,140
- You seem flustered.
- Do I?

144
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,140
- This is new. "What?"
- But...

145
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,380
"I don't care."

146
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,580
He's pretending to be bold.

147
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,950
"So what?"

148
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,820
(This is how the entertainer
with 30 years' experience survives.)

149
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,060
Anyway, we have Luda here.

150
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,130
- Luda.
- Luda.

151
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,730
- Who's next?
- I'm excited.

152
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,090
- I'm so thrilled.
- Who else is refreshing?

153
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,570
Here comes the third guest.

154
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,370
I know who it is.

155
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,130
(Who's the next guest
that Jae Suk knows?)

156
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,400
This song is BIBI.

157
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,630
- Hey, BIBI.
- BIBI.

158
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,700
It's BIBI!

159
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,610
(BIBI)

160
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,810
Hey, BIBI.

161
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,380
(She's a new hip-hop artist...)

162
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,420
(loved by the hip-hop scene
and fans in teens and 20s.)

163
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,450
(In the TV audition show,
"THE FAN",)

164
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,690
(she won second place.)

165
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,300
- Hey, BIBI.
- Hey.

166
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,690
- Hey.
- Hello.

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,170
Hello.

168
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,300
This is serious.

169
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,610
As BIBI walks down, Suk Jin said...

170
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,170
To the end of the earth

171
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,400
He thinks it's her.

172
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,700
To the end of the earth

173
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,050
To the end of the stars

174
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,310
- It's not her.
- It's BB.

175
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,210
Actually,

176
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,820
- You met Yeji on the audition show.
- Right.

177
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,580
- Really? Which show?
- Hello.

178
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,420
- They met on "THE FAN".
- Right.

179
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,360
- We were contestants.
- I see.

180
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,880
I thought it looked
awkward between you two.

181
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,690
Who was in a higher rank
on the show?

182
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,190
She was a lot higher.

183
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,260
- She was in the top two.
- She was the second place.

184
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,590
But in reality,

185
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,130
- I'm no match for her.
- No.

186
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,830
(I'm no match for her.)

187
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,960
No match for her?

188
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,610
That sounds rough.

189
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,900
She sounds friendly.

190
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,310
It will catch the ears of those
in the show business.

191
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,640
"I'm no match for her."

192
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,900
- I'm no match for her.
- I see.

193
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,550
She's really popular.

194
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,920
What did you do before your debut?

195
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,840
I just did my music...

196
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,510
as a hobby.

197
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,650
When Mi Rae heard my song,

198
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,580
she wanted to hire me.

199
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,780
- Hire you?
- So we signed the contract.

200
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,090
I like...

201
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,560
her word choices.
She sounds refreshing.

202
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,190
- Hire her?
- She picked her up.

203
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,390
- We don't usually say that.
- That's new.

204
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,760
The two CEOs of her agency
don't speak Korean.

205
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,900
- "I will hire you."
- Right.

206
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,010
"I will hire you."

207
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,010
- "I hire you."
- "You're hired."

208
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,110
- "I'm going to hire you."
- "You're hired."

209
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,140
"You're hired, okay?"

210
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,140
So we have three guests here.

211
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,620
- But there's one more.
- All right.

212
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,050
It's really...

213
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,690
I don't understand why he's...

214
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,260
- I don't understand it either.
- here with them.

215
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,510
- Why?
- I heard that yesterday.

216
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,080
- I heard it from Shinji.
- Is he someone refreshing?

217
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,580
Is he refreshing?

218
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,950
Let's meet him then.

219
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,390
Here's our fourth guest.

220
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,520
But he is...

221
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,670
Refreshing!

222
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,800
Gosh, he's too sour.

223
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,740
(The sour silhouette shows up.)

224
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,870
(MC Minzy, Jung Jun Ha)

225
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,440
Gosh, he's too sour.

226
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,380
(MC Minzy lip-syncs outright.)

227
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,440
My gosh.

228
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,680
(What?)

229
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,380
He's just too sour.

230
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,080
I had no idea.

231
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,550
- I knew it.
- But...

232
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,580
I don't understand
why he's here with these three.

233
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,210
This is ridiculous.

234
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,150
(MC Minzy of 0.11 tonnes walks
down the stairs with a sour smell.)

235
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,150
- He's lip-syncing.
- My goodness.

236
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,230
Humming

237
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,170
He's ruining the mood.

238
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,690
I didn't know about this.

239
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,690
(They don't know how to react.)

240
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,530
(MC Minzy comes forward.)

241
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,370
He's being silly again.

242
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,070
- He's being silly.
- My goodness.

243
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,240
There he goes again.

244
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,030
This is too sour.

245
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,400
Look at Ji Hyo. She looks tired.

246
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,940
- Why are you dancing like that?
- His head is so big...

247
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,380
that he ripped the cap open.

248
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,180
He ripped it open.

249
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,550
Be confident and keep going.

250
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,580
- That's enough.
- Stop it.

251
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,190
- Come back here.
- That's enough.

252
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,690
It's too sour.

253
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,950
- Another Saturday guy is here.
- I know.

254
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,230
Jong Kook is sensitive about this.

255
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,690
But he...

256
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,520
works hard even on Sunday.

257
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,090
Unlike someone.

258
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,240
He's all dressed up.

259
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,830
- Look. He's not like him.
- What about me?

260
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,960
He doesn't try hard.

261
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,400
You didn't care
about your outfit today.

262
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,980
- You should get dressed up.
- Think of "How Do You Play?".

263
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,340
- All right.
- By the way...

264
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,110
- About Jun Ha...
- You should talk to me.

265
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,670
Why are you here with them?

266
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,750
I'm just...

267
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,380
- Hang on.
- Generation MZ...

268
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,640
I'm grateful that
you are joining our show,

269
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,510
- but it's strange to be with them.
- He's so shameless.

270
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,260
Why? I'm here with other artists.

271
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
I'm MC Minzy.

272
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,650
Are you here as Jung Jun Ha
or MC Minzy?

273
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,830
MC Minzy.

274
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,090
Are you here as MC Minzy?

275
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,550
The artists who represent
Generation MZ.

276
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,760
- MC Minzy.
- Hey.

277
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,390
- You're too sour.
- Yes.

278
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,870
What's with your hand?

279
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,340
- This is what I do when I sing.
- Jun Ha.

280
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,740
- You're feeling awkward, right?
- No.

281
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,130
(- You're feeling awkward, right?
- No.)

282
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,400
You didn't know
we'd be like this, did you?

283
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,900
I had no idea.

284
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,110
Your face shows everything.

285
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,340
You know what?

286
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,770
The three of them are staying still,
but you're doing this alone.

287
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,850
(He's the guest
who seems most nervous.)

288
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,350
The gestures are very old-fashioned.

289
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,540
He looks like the mother
of these three, right?

290
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,990
How is his face so big?

291
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,810
There's no comedian today?

292
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,050
- You recently released a new song.
- Yes. That's my second single.

293
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,330
Is it "Abalone"?

294
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,330
- It's "Gizzard Shad".
- "Gizzard Shad"?

295
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,230
- Did you say "Country Life"?
- What was that?

296
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,260
"I Say Woo"...

297
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,930
sounds like shrimp...

298
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,200
in Korean.

299
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,290
"Gizzard Shad" is just like that.

300
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,010
It means "I feel great."

301
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,630
Gizzard shad

302
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,270
You mean the fish.

303
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,510
- It's "Gizzard Shad".
- I feel great

304
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,480
This is just my opinion,
but it's a bit far-fetched.

305
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,300
- It means you feel great?
- I feel great. What?

306
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,910
They don't sound similar at all.

307
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,850
- That's not like gizzard shad.
- It sounds differently.

308
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,990
- But I...
- That doesn't match.

309
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,180
I think it sounds similar.

310
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,590
(He denies their opinions
with no logic at all.)

311
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,730
Is he upset?

312
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,680
So we have MC Minzy here.

313
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,550
- We have four guests today.
- Welcome.

314
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,330
MC Minzy.

315
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,000
Let me tell you about today's race.

316
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,030
With your choice,
today's race will become...

317
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,000
a golden ratio or a dirty ratio.

318
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,010
It's an unpredictable race,
Golden Ratio Race.

319
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,580
It will be an individual game.

320
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,880
I'll give you the keyword
for the main mission first.

321
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,710
Once you check the keyword,

322
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,880
you will pick a captain.

323
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,460
Then the captain will give you
numbers from 1 to 11.

324
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,180
Then I will draw numbers...

325
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,650
- to divide you into two teams.
- That's...

326
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,100
If I pick number one,

327
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,830
there will be two teams
of number one and the rest.

328
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,740
If I pick number five,

329
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,370
from number 1 to 5 will be a team,

330
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,710
and numbers 6 to 11 will
be another team.

331
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,380
If you want to be on the same team
with a strong member,

332
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,270
it's important to get the number
that's close to the strong one's.

333
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,380
And that's what the captain decides.

334
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,510
- We should think of many things.
- I know.

335
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,640
We should win favor
with the strong members.

336
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,090
After the race, we will draw lots...

337
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,680
and decide who will get the prize
and who will get the penalty.

338
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,020
(Who will be the winner
with the golden ratio?)

339
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,550
I think it's a slipper game.

340
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,330
There are slippers.

341
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,790
Minzy!

342
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,330
(Minzy!)

343
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,560
Minzy!

344
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,200
- Hello.
- Minzy.

345
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,600
Gizzard shad

346
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,870
- MC Minzy, gizzard shard
- How old are you, Minzy?

347
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,010
- Me?
- Am I singing it right?

348
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,160
- He was born in 2002.
- In 2002.

349
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,880
- So you're younger than me.
- Yes.

350
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,300
He's younger than us.

351
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,670
He was born in 2002.

352
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,350
What?

353
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,850
- You're younger than me.
- You're younger than us.

354
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,540
- Gizzard shad
- The mission to decide the captain.

355
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,960
It's called Slippers with Feet.

356
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,510
You will go around the slippers...

357
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,590
outside the square dancing to music.

358
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,490
You should put on a slipper
when the whistle is blown.

359
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,460
MC Minzy must be good at this.

360
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,420
The one who survives
until the end is the winner.

361
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,830
The last survivor
will be the captain.

362
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,790
I guess I'll be the first one
to be eliminated.

363
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,010
(Big Nose looks determined
warming up.)

364
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,340
Suk Jin, are you warming up?

365
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,630
Yes. I should warm up.

366
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,580
I should fight...

367
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,270
- against MC Minzy and Jong Kook.
- MC Minzy is too strong.

368
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,380
He's strong.

369
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,140
- He's too strong.
- I'm strong.

370
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,750
I can pull a truck with my forehead.

371
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,220
- It will be tough.
- All right.

372
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,090
There are nine slippers.

373
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,010
- And there are 11 of you.
- So 2 of us will be eliminated.

374
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,510
- So...
- Two of us will be eliminated.

375
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,090
You should dance to the music
outside the square.

376
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,550
Gosh, this is...

377
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,650
It's over when the whistle is blown.

378
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,200
You will see.

379
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,230
(You will see.)

380
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,230
Haha will spare himself...

381
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,740
- playing this game.
- Why?

382
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,740
So he can focus
on "How Do You Play?".

383
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,210
(So he can focus
on "How Do You Play?".)

384
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,130
He doesn't work hard on Sundays.

385
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,740
- Good luck.
- He works hard only on Saturdays.

386
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,130
Haha, just think
that today is Saturday.

387
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,450
- You'll see.
- Today is Saturday.

388
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,380
- Try your best.
- Let's do this.

389
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,350
- All right. I'm ready.
- Try hard.

390
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,280
All right. This is Round One.
Music please.

391
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,950
Dance around the square.

392
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,280
This is an old song.

393
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,510
(They should dance outside
the square while music is playing.)

394
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,150
- Is this "Take on Me"?
- "Take on Me".

395
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,150
"Take on Me".

396
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,730
I think they chose this song
for you, Suk Jin.

397
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,960
Right. "Take on Me".

398
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,500
I wonder when the music will stop.

399
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,160
- I think...
- When will it be?

400
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,200
Won't we change the direction?

401
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,790
- Let's change the direction.
- Let's move backward.

402
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,300
(They changed the direction
of their own accord.)

403
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,470
It's up to us.

404
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,610
Let's try to understand the lyrics.

405
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,670
This is A-ha's song.

406
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,220
(While the others are having fun,
Sunday Man seems very nervous.)

407
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,670
(Blowing the whistle)

408
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,620
- Oh, gosh.
- Yes! I got one.

409
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,360
(Those who fail to get a slipper
get eliminated right away.)

410
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,960
(Se Chan quickly took a slipper
and got out.)

411
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,090
My hit-and-run strategy worked.

412
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,260
(Jong Kook got one easily.)

413
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,960
(So did Ji Hyo.)

414
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,060
There's only one left.

415
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:27,464
(Sunday Man is going crazy.)

416
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,240
Move! Go away!

417
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,890
(Falling)

418
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,760
(Sunday Man loses it
to prove his enthusiasm.)

419
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,840
Move!

420
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,480
- Go away, you all!
- My gosh.

421
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,900
What happened?

422
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,800
(He sweeps across the set,
leaving chaos behind.)

423
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,270
- Are you all right?
- Are you guys okay?

424
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,170
- Are you okay?
- How come you all failed?

425
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,910
- You're mistreating your guests.
- Why did you do that?

426
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,780
- I think I pushed someone.
- Hey, did the guests...

427
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,650
- Did they all fail?
- Who was that?

428
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,420
Hey, take it easy, will you?

429
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,680
Someone hit me on the head.

430
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,520
(Haha's twisted passion caused
many people damage.)

431
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,600
- Hey, Luna and...
- By the way...

432
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,160
- You can't do that to the guests.
- Suk Jin.

433
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,520
- Why?
- It's Luda.

434
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,700
- Oh, is it Luda?
- Yes.

435
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,790
- That's her name.
- Oh, Luda.

436
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,930
- I'm sorry, Luda.
- But...

437
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,370
Round One ended,

438
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,870
and two guests got eliminated.

439
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,470
- I'm sorry about that.
- I put it on backwards.

440
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,840
This is a competition, you know.
You understand me, right?

441
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,980
- Yes.
- Okay.

442
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,640
- Haha... Yes, you did your best.
- You saw me, right?

443
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,980
- Okay.
- Indeed.

444
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,350
I won't go easy on you guys.

445
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,510
(Round 2 begins right away.)

446
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,770
- Look at him.
- He came here.

447
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,140
Why would you come here?

448
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,280
This is a good spot.

449
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,620
It's a good spot.

450
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,280
We'll begin the second round now.

451
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,650
(People on the other side are
in a war of nerves too.)

452
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,290
What's with these punks?

453
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,330
Round Two begins. Play the music.

454
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,470
Let's dance.

455
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,290
Oh, yes. This is my song.

456
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,290
Pretty girls

457
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,560
("Dalla Dalla" by ITZY makes
everyone want to dance.)

458
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,610
I'm not like them

459
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,900
- I'm different
- I'm different

460
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,630
(The old men are excited
and start singing together.)

461
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,980
(Who will become the 7 winners
to get slippers?)

462
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,480
- I love the way I am, I'm just me
- I love the way I am, I'm just me

463
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,120
(Blowing the whistle)

464
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,130
(The slippers disappear
in an instant.)

465
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,960
(The quick ones take slippers
and leave.)

466
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,330
(There's a group of people left
in the corner.)

467
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,600
Gosh, you jerk.

468
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,870
(The 0.1t elephant flopped down.)

469
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,630
(MC Minzy fell down helplessly
with a loud shout.)

470
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,170
(MC Minzy who was born in 2002
was thrown down.)

471
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,510
(Se Chan steals his slipper.)

472
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,620
(The elephant ends up
being captured.)

473
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,680
Gosh, you.

474
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,220
Darn it.

475
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,260
- Hey.
- Look at him.

476
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,730
(The uninvited guest,
Jung Jun Ha shows up.)

477
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,460
- Who are you?
- My gosh.

478
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,330
(Jun Ha arrives
in the middle of the game.)

479
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,730
- Who is that?
- That's Jun Ha.

480
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,230
- Hey, my hair.
- Isn't he Jun Ha?

481
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,700
- Jun Ha, when did you get here?
- Help me take it off.

482
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,970
- Jun Ha, when did you get here?
- Gosh, that hurts.

483
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,930
- When did you come?
- Hello, Mr. Jung.

484
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,110
When did you arrive?

485
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,510
- Oh, that hurts.
- How did this happen?

486
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,610
Got it. Nice.

487
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,080
- Hello, Mr. Jung.
- Hey, hi.

488
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,880
- Jun Ha, when did you get here?
- It's been a while.

489
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,010
I just came...

490
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,490
- Oh, my.
- Hold on.

491
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,220
- What?
- Hey, MC Minzy.

492
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,490
I say woo

493
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,420
- He's doing well.
- Keep going.

494
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,830
I say woo

495
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,130
- Higher
- Oh, my. Jun Ha is so funny.

496
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,370
- How long have you been here?
- It's been a while.

497
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,660
- The game looked so fun.
- Right.

498
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,760
- Excuse me.
- What happened?

499
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,740
Aren't you Ms. Hyun Mee?

500
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,010
The singer of "Night Fog"?

501
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,480
Aren't you Ms. Hyun Mee?

502
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,900
Where did my slipper go?

503
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,010
Since you took it from Jun Ha
after he put it on,

504
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,980
- you must give it back to him.
- Really?

505
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,380
- I put it on, right?
- Okay.

506
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,850
- Exactly.
- I'm sorry.

507
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,680
(After Se Chan and Haha
got eliminated...)

508
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,050
Let's begin the third round.
Play the music.

509
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,510
Jun Ha's feet...

510
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,420
(Only 5 slippers remain.)

511
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,860
MC Minzy!

512
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,160
(While the other players start
dancing excitedly...)

513
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,520
- Lee Hyo Lee
- This is a very old song.

514
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,630
- You shouldn't go in there.
- Come out now.

515
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,560
(A daring dancer crossed
into the square.)

516
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,980
- Hey, come and join me.
- Come out now.

517
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,170
Hey, come out!

518
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,210
(Laughing)

519
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,040
- Hey.
- Come out now.

520
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,120
(The dance style
that only people over 50 like)

521
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,510
Stop flailing around and come out.

522
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,950
Exactly. Stop flailing around.

523
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,990
(The game resumes
once the flailing dancer leaves.)

524
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,850
(Blowing the whistle)

525
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,480
(The players flock around
at an unbelievable speed.)

526
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,120
- I got it.
- Give me that.

527
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,560
- Jae Suk, it's in front of you.
- I got it.

528
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,620
(MC Minzy versus Suk Jin)

529
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,130
Gosh. He's so annoying.

530
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,560
(And So Min tries to use
their brawl as a chance.)

531
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,720
- Jun Ha will lose.
- Gosh.

532
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,800
Come on.

533
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,660
(She took it off his foot.)

534
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,600
It's not over yet.

535
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,990
I put it on already.

536
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,370
(Dropkick)

537
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,230
(Suk Jin got hit with a dropkick
by the 0.1t man.)

538
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,240
Look at that slipper.

539
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,310
- He kicked Suk Jin in the end.
- The slipper got torn.

540
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,320
It's over.

541
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,940
What is this?
It's torn and worn out.

542
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,890
The first one
to put it on his foot wins.

543
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,680
- He's really strong.
- Jun Ha is so strong.

544
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,090
- Gosh.
- You're so persistent.

545
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,250
- Come on.
- Gosh.

546
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,100
(Falling down)

547
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,420
(It suddenly turns
into a wrestling match.)

548
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,220
- Put it on your foot.
- It's over.

549
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,140
(Jun Ha puts his foot
on the slipper first and wins.)

550
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,600
That was amazing.

551
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,900
- Good job.
- You did great.

552
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,140
- See? I knew that he'd win.
- Why am I here?

553
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,400
(MC Minzy aged a lot
during the fight.)

554
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,900
- He's invincible.
- I'm impressed.

555
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,670
He's been getting all the attention
while playing this game.

556
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,780
- I mean...
- My gosh.

557
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,550
Why would you get all the attention?

558
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,250
Where are my glasses?

559
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,650
Are you okay, Suk Jin?
Where are Suk Jin's glasses?

560
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,790
Hey, my glasses...

561
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,630
(Looking around)

562
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,990
Suk Jin, what are you looking for?

563
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,570
My eyes.

564
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,830
- What are you looking for?
- His glasses.

565
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,140
My eyes.

566
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,260
- Where did my eyes go?
- Where did his glasses go?

567
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,960
(His glasses disappeared
in the slipper commotion.)

568
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,460
Hey, help me find them.

569
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,730
- Suk Jin, did you...
- Where did you put his glasses?

570
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,170
- We don't know.
- Help me find them.

571
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,880
- Why did you lose your glasses?
- Hey, you.

572
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,280
- I mean...
- You hid them, didn't you?

573
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,440
- No.
- Where did you put his glasses?

574
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,290
(Jae Suk is wearing
Suk Jin's glasses!)

575
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,710
- Why did you lose your glasses?
- Hey, you.

576
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,050
- I mean...
- You hid them, didn't you?

577
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,860
- No.
- Where did they go?

578
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,830
- Hey, Se Chan. Come over here.
- Hey.

579
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,420
- I don't have them.
- Has anyone seen his glasses?

580
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,650
- Where are my glasses?
- I really don't know.

581
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,630
- Suk Jin's glasses.
- Where did you put his glasses?

582
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,920
- We don't know.
- Help me find them.

583
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,660
(His glasses are here.)

584
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,030
- I mean...
- You hid my glasses, didn't you?

585
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,070
(Suk Jin is grilling
the wrong person.)

586
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,070
Where did they go?

587
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,760
- Where are his glasses?
- I don't have them.

588
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,870
You guys, don't pull a prank on him
whenever you get a chance.

589
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,040
- Suk Jin.
- Seriously.

590
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,240
- Give me back my glasses now.
- Where did you hide his glasses?

591
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,400
- You can't find them?
- Where on earth are they?

592
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,580
- Hey.
- Come on. Give them back to me.

593
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,180
- You should stop pulling a prank...
- You took them, didn't you?

594
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,290
- No. Why would I do that?
- Seeing that you're being loud,

595
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,440
- you're suspicious.
- Oh, my.

596
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,920
(He looks at Jae Suk's face
but goes through his pockets.)

597
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,860
(He's unbelievably slow-witted.)

598
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,460
Give them back to me. Now!

599
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,140
Where did they go?
Suk Jin, keep looking.

600
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,640
(After a kick with no damage,
he gives up right away.)

601
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,570
- You see...
- Where did you put your glasses?

602
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,810
Continue. I'll keep looking.

603
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,840
Go on.
Don't let it drag on because of me.

604
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,170
My goodness.

605
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,700
How can he not notice?

606
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,500
His glasses are expensive.

607
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,610
My gosh.

608
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,970
Where did you put them?

609
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,510
- You took them, didn't you?
- Suk Jin, search Jae Suk.

610
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,940
- Why would I take them?
- What?

611
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,740
(What?)

612
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,750
(Something's strange.)

613
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,330
(After a long search,
he finally recognizes his glasses.)

614
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,360
I can't believe you.

615
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,360
Gosh. How long have you been
wearing them?

616
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,300
(It took Seok Sam 5 minutes
to find his glasses.)

617
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,570
- You didn't know?
- My gosh.

618
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,490
- When did you put them on?
- He didn't recognize them.

619
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,800
Did you just put them on?

620
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,040
That was hilarious.

621
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,070
(He barely found his glasses.)

622
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,310
Gosh.

623
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,730
Why didn't you recognize them?

624
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,280
Oh, please come to me

625
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,110
(They continued the game
to the final round.)

626
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,200
Hey. Gosh.

627
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,350
- Okay.
- Jong Kook won.

628
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,480
- Jong Kook is the captain.
- Okay.

629
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,210
- Gosh.
- Jae Suk didn't even try.

630
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,820
We'll bring you the board
to decide the order.

631
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,250
So this is how I decide the order?

632
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,190
That's great. I like it.

633
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,690
Before that,

634
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,900
I'll tell you the keyword
for the first mission.

635
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,070
The keyword
for the first mission is...

636
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,570
"Quiz".

637
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,730
(The keyword for the 1st mission is
"Quiz".)

638
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Those empty heads are in trouble.

639
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,200
- "Quiz".
- I'm done for.

640
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
"Quiz"?

641
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,240
She can't say anything.

642
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
- MC Minzy, are you empty-headed?
- I'm not confident.

643
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,280
- What are you talking about?
- You're empty-headed too, right?

644
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,940
- I'm pretty sure he's smart.
- I'm smart.

645
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,350
- He's totally stupid, right?
- No.

646
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,550
He took the college entrance exam
four times.

647
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,180
- I took the exam four times.
- MC Minzy studied...

648
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,150
- high school subjects properly.
- Is that so?

649
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,750
All right.

650
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,920
(Jong Kook will announce the order.)

651
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,490
The first one is Jae Suk.

652
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,220
- Me?
- It's a quiz game, right?

653
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,300
- Yes, it's a quiz game.
- Okay.

654
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,760
- I choose this number.
- Okay.

655
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,300
Somewhere in the middle.

656
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,260
Next up is Suk Jin.

657
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,190
He said that we should choose
our teammates carefully.

658
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,110
- I'll go next.
- Go ahead.

659
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,840
- You'll pick number eight, right?
- Yes.

660
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,610
- I'll go with number eight.
- My gosh.

661
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,380
It would be funny if the 1st team is
from numbers 1 to 7.

662
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,650
I think that numbers 9 to 11...

663
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,410
- I'm ready.
- Okay. Yeji.

664
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,240
- How she dyed her hair...
- Okay. Yeji, you're up.

665
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,390
There are many idol singers
who are unexpectedly dumb.

666
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,090
If the 1st team is
from numbers 1 to 8,

667
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,360
Yeji, you would have no hope.

668
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,090
If they're on the same team...

669
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:59,330
Now, I'm going to pick the number
to decide the teams...

670
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,600
as everyone watches.

671
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,690
- Yes.
- I'm worried.

672
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,720
- Okay.
- Here we go.

673
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,190
(What number will be chosen?)

674
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,190
Please.

675
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,840
Please pick a good one.

676
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,730
(Who will be on the brainy team
versus the empty heads team?)

677
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,610
The first team is...

678
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,080
(Se Chan, Haha, BIBI, and MC Minzy
are on the same team.)

679
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,200
- from numbers 1 to 4.
- Okay. Oh, yes.

680
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,150
- All right. This is good.
- Oh, no.

681
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,580
(Luda, Suk Jin, Jae Suk,)

682
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,180
(Jong Kook, Yeji, So Min, and Ji Hyo
are on the same team.)

683
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,180
- So Min.
- We'll definitely win.

684
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,720
(Team Majority, Luda, Suk Jin,
Jae Suk, Jong Kook,)

685
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,920
(Yeji, So Min, Ji Hyo)

686
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,360
We'll definitely win.

687
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,560
MC Minzy.

688
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,160
(Team Minority, Se Chan, Haha,
BIBI, MC Minzy)

689
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,140
(Those who aren't good at quizzes
are on Team Minority.)

690
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,160
- Gosh. BIBI, come over here.
- We'll definitely win.

691
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,570
- Se Chan, Haha, BIBI, and MC Minzy.
- That's great.

692
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,640
- We can't be sure yet.
- We can do it.

693
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,730
- Oh, no. Right.
- We've got this.

694
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,240
- I'm worried because I'm not smart.
- It's okay. We can do it.

695
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,280
- You're not smart?
- Not really.

696
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,510
- We'll surprise them.
- Really?

697
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,910
You can be the star of this episode.

698
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,710
How many are on your team?
The four of you? Oh, no.

699
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,010
The four of them.

700
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,360
We can do it.

701
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,820
Oh, dear. I'm worried.

702
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,250
However, the next game...

703
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,250
is not a normal quiz game.

704
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,250
(It's not a normal quiz game?)

705
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,630
It's not a normal quiz game.

706
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,760
You will move to the study room...

707
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,300
to cram before the game begins.

708
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,000
Oh, no. I'm not good at memorizing.

709
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,040
We'll study?

710
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,880
Okay. I can memorize things quickly
since I have an empty head.

711
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,040
There will be three categories.

712
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,900
- What are they?
- One is general knowledge.

713
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,080
- The second one is Chinese idioms.
- Yes.

714
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,090
The last one is
current affairs and economy.

715
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,210
- Divide the categories...
- You study the Chinese idioms.

716
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,510
within your teams
and cram for a while.

717
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,360
- Then we'll begin the game here.
- That would be better.

718
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,750
We can divide the categories
to study?

719
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,950
- Let's divide the categories.
- It's good we have more members.

720
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,260
But you may be given a question
from a category you didn't study.

721
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,460
- We won't get to choose?
- No. You never know.

722
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,230
- Please move to the study room...
- Can't we tell them the answer?

723
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,840
- Let's go to the study room.
- No, you can't.

724
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
Let's go to the study room to cram.

725
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,140
(How will they cram
for the quiz game?)

726
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,500
Will both teams study here?

727
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,900
"'Giving up' is not part
of our vocabulary."

728
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,710
"It's never too late
to start studying."

729
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,350
- It's too late.
- Thank you.

730
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,790
It looks like a real study room.

731
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,480
It's so nice in here.
We have snacks here.

732
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,950
(Snacks for the empty heads)

733
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,300
It looks so good.

734
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,830
Let's do this.

735
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,630
I'll read the newspaper.

736
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,460
Yeji and So Min,
which categories do you want?

737
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,160
- I'll study Chinese idioms.
- Go ahead.

738
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,110
Maybe I'll be called Empty Head too
after this.

739
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,310
- We can't predict the questions.
- I have no idea.

740
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,780
- Gosh, I'm hungry.
- Can you?

741
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,240
It's too difficult for me.

742
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,850
- This is my favorite snack.
- Chinese idioms.

743
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,650
(The empty heads always put
snacks before studying.)

744
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,120
That means "every house".

745
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,620
- "To turn over a new leaf".
- "Every house".

746
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,950
My, it's delicious.

747
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,560
Can anyone spell
the word "delicious"?

748
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,150
- D...
- D, I...

749
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,420
- D, E...
- Correct.

750
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
L...

751
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,400
I know about two-thirds of them.

752
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,630
(Jae Suk is studying
Chinese idioms.)

753
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,930
- But it may not come to mind.
- Exactly.

754
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,100
Especially the ones like
gyeontojijaeng.

755
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,230
A fight between a dog
and a rabbit... So it means...

756
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,080
It's used to describe
a trivial argument...

757
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,880
or a pointless argument.

758
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,740
- Gyeonto...
- Jijaeng.

759
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,910
Then what's unbearable bitterness
and resentment?

760
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,050
Gakgoltonghan.

761
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,740
"Each one must figure out
how to survive."

762
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,290
- Gakjadosaeng.
- Gakjadosaeng.

763
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,150
What? I can't believe this.

764
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,150
Why?

765
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,250
I didn't know
it was gyeonggeomangdong.

766
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,250
You didn't know?

767
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,560
- Did you say "go", not "geo"?
- Yes.

768
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,900
It's "geo", not "go".

769
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,460
- "Gyeong" means "light".
- I always said "gyeonggomangdong".

770
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,570
- Gosh.
- It's "geo", not "go".

771
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,070
"Gyeonggeo" means "light steps".

772
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,430
- "Gyeonggeo".
- Hey.

773
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,880
You really don't know that?

774
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,740
Gosh. How should I...

775
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,310
I can't seem to focus.

776
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,440
It's because there's a lot of people
and plenty of snacks in here.

777
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,390
It's hard to focus because there are
too many distractions here.

778
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,750
I just want to know...

779
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,890
I always hated it when I had a lot
to cover for an exam.

780
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,250
But it must be easier for you
as you have more people.

781
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,920
- I know.
- You know hyeongseoljigong, right?

782
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,100
- Yes.
- Let's study.

783
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,100
(Unlike what she said,
So Min is focusing on something.)

784
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,190
What was hyeongseoljigong?

785
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,300
The light of fireflies.

786
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,570
- What about nangjungjichu?
- Using the light of fireflies...

787
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,870
- to study at night...
- An ice pick in a pocket.

788
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,370
I only wrote down the answers.

789
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,670
What should I study?

790
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,080
Should I study Chinese idioms?

791
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,080
You should cover all the categories.

792
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,440
- Okay.
- Hyeongseoljigong.

793
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
(The empty heads are always late.)

794
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,650
Mister, your shadow makes it
too dark.

795
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,590
I'll just take this book and leave.

796
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,550
Can you give me this book
on common knowledge?

797
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,290
- This...
- Daegimanseong.

798
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,750
I want to keep it in my car
so I can read it as I move around.

799
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,120
If I memorize all this,

800
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,530
I won't be called
Empty Head anymore, right?

801
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,750
No. That won't happen.

802
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,400
I want to take
one of these books too.

803
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,920
I'll take one too.

804
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,990
Me too.

805
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,300
- And...
- Wait. What is this?

806
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,900
"It means a flame before the wind."
"Jonmang"?

807
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,110
I thought "jonmang" was
a slang word.

808
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,430
- "Jonmang"?
- It's "jon" as in "to exist".

809
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,880
- "Jon" as in "to exist"...
- Come on.

810
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,970
and "mang" as in "to perish".

811
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,440
It means "to exist or to perish".

812
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,440
- It's not what you're thinking of.
- What's wrong with her?

813
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,940
- "Jonmang"?
- But it sounds just like...

814
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,350
- "Jonmang".
- What's wrong with you?

815
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,620
Don't act like this in front of
your junior entertainers.

816
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,010
- Mangyeonjasil.
- Exactly.

817
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,410
- Will you...
- Already?

818
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,890
What should I study now?

819
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,690
- It's so difficult.
- "Bansinbaneui".

820
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
"Banpojigyo".

821
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,220
Why do I feel like
time passes so slowly?

822
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,870
It passes so slowly.

823
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,870
I'm done studying.

824
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,640
- Let me read it.
- Sure.

825
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,500
Okay. I put everything in my head.
I'm ready.

826
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,670
I mean, is it even possible
to memorize all this now?

827
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,380
- I give up.
- Me too.

828
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,120
Did you study a lot?

829
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,650
- Yes.
- It wouldn't work.

830
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,210
I studied everything
except for Chinese idioms.

831
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,350
- I'll tell you the rules.
- Okay.

832
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,560
If you look here...

833
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,910
One from each team will be
randomly chosen...

834
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:30,630
for a 1-on-1 quiz game.

835
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,870
The category will also be chosen
in a draw.

836
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,130
You will only get five questions.

837
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,490
The team that gets
more questions right wins.

838
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,110
That is, some of you won't get to
play the game at all.

839
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,500
(The smart members of each team
may not have a chance to play.)

840
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,430
- The first match is...
- Please.

841
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,610
(The players for the first match
will be chosen.)

842
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,970
- I picked the players.
- So Min, I don't think...

843
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,470
So Min versus MC Minzy.

844
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,550
- Me?
- Okay.

845
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,290
- So Min studied really hard.
- Empty Head.

846
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,390
- That doesn't even matter.
- So Min...

847
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,560
(He's glad that he'll compete
against So Min.)

848
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,450
- But So Min...
- I'll win

849
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,450
(MC Minzy seems excited...)

850
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,060
- So Min studied really hard.
- Please.

851
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,720
- Come on. Don't be like that.
- I'll win

852
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,640
Quiz, don't

853
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
- Laugh
- Laugh

854
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,340
The first category is...

855
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,640
I'm worried.

856
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,760
Chinese idioms.

857
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,340
- That's a relief.
- That's what So Min studied.

858
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,700
She studied that.

859
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,280
- She studied a lot.
- She can beat him.

860
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,050
So Min, you studied Chinese idioms.

861
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,120
(She memorized the Chinese idioms
using her entire body.)

862
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,320
I don't remember any of them.

863
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,880
I don't remember any.

864
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,560
If you know the answer,
say, "Let me answer."

865
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,910
- And then say the answer.
- Yes.

866
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,250
We should get the upper hand
in the beginning.

867
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,060
Don't try to remember
what you memorized.

868
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,150
- It'll pop up in your head.
- You can do it.

869
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,530
Concentrate, okay?

870
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,370
Here's your question.
"To complete..."

871
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,570
"the most important part
of a project".

872
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,660
(To complete the most important part
of a project)

873
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,140
I didn't see any idioms
with that meaning.

874
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:51,110
"To complete the most important part
of a project".

875
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,730
(The meaning isn't enough
to think of the answer.)

876
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,440
"To complete the most important part
of a project"?

877
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,550
Isn't this it?

878
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,810
(Whispering)

879
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,170
Let's just pretend
that we know the correct answer.

880
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,550
(Let's just pretend
that we know the correct answer.)

881
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,240
- Right?
- Yes, that's the answer.

882
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,510
(Cheeky)

883
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,750
That's it.

884
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,120
- It's an easy one.
- Right.

885
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,860
I think that's the answer.

886
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,090
(Looking at her arm)

887
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,950
- What could that be?
- "The most important part"?

888
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,650
Look. She's cheating.

889
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,830
- I wasn't cheating.
- You shouldn't cheat.

890
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,130
Jun Ha, wipe her arm
with your saliva.

891
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,230
You're mistaken.

892
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,570
What? There's nothing on my arm.

893
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,600
Gosh. What is this?

894
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,810
- There's nothing on my arm.
- Gosh. How could you?

895
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,900
It hurts. What are you doing?

896
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,080
I'll give you a hint.

897
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,240
It literally means to draw the eyes
of a dragon in a painting...

898
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,440
- We were right.
- Let me answer.

899
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,550
Oh, boy.

900
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,820
Hwaryongjeomjung.

901
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,590
- Pronounce it clearly.
- Hwaryongjeomjung.

902
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,090
(MC Minzy got it correct.)

903
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,120
- Thank goodness.
- Great.

904
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,560
(The answer is hwaryongjeomjung.)

905
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,650
- I knew the answer too.
- Yes!

906
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,090
- Scream!
- MC Minzy!

907
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,720
MC Minzy

908
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,860
I say

909
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:51,160
The second match is
Ji Hyo versus MC Minzy.

910
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,730
- Ji Hyo, you can win this.
- Jun Ha, you look awesome now.

911
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,640
The category is general knowledge.

912
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,140
All right. Let's go!

913
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,880
MC Minzy, you're not bad.

914
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,610
- Sorry?
- You're not bad.

915
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,280
MC Minzy is smart.

916
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,620
- He's smart.
- Yes, indeed.

917
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,650
Here's your question.

918
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,910
Who is the female poet, considered
1 of the 3 best things of Songdo,

919
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,510
who wrote "Bakyeon Falls"
and "Memories of Manwoldae"...

920
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,130
and was also a gisaeng?

921
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,180
- Let me answer.
- Good.

922
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,990
- Hwang Jin Yi.
- That's right.

923
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,300
(Hwang Jin Yi is
the correct answer.)

924
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,400
(Ji Hyo takes everyone by surprise!)

925
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,930
Why don't you know this
if you studied for so long?

926
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,160
(While everyone was chatting
and eating snacks,)

927
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,280
(Ji Hyo read the 1st page
of the book on common knowledge.)

928
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,940
Great job.

929
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,710
- Hwang Jin Yi! Yes!
- Great.

930
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,380
Ji Hyo, nice.

931
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,820
- I say woo
- I thought...

932
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,710
The third match is
Jong Kook versus Se Chan.

933
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,920
Jong Kook is quite smart.

934
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,060
Any one of you, bring it on.

935
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,830
Hey, my friend from the soccer club.

936
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,300
How about we choose
current affairs and economy?

937
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,760
- What?
- You don't know much about it.

938
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,840
- Jong Kook.
- Hey.

939
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,840
You can't even pronounce
those words properly.

940
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,430
I studied current affairs
and economy. I'm confident.

941
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,000
Okay. It's a Chinese idiom.

942
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,280
Oh, this will be interesting.

943
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,610
Even if I've never heard of it,

944
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,350
- I can guess it.
- I can't...

945
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,440
- I can't understand the meaning.
- Of course.

946
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,740
I'm sure
that you all have heard this one.

947
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,820
Do you think we've heard of it
many times or not?

948
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,710
- It's important.
- He's so sensitive.

949
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,710
Why don't you give us
a difficult question?

950
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,910
You may not have heard of it
many times.

951
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,180
Not many times?

952
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,560
"Each one must figure out
how to survive."

953
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,150
- What?
- You know this.

954
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,400
- You know this one.
- You're allowed to give them hints.

955
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,460
- You know the answer, right?
- I couldn't hear it.

956
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,690
- Jong Kook.
- "Each one must figure out..."

957
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,660
- "how to survive."
- "Each one..."

958
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,160
("Each one must figure out
how to survive.")

959
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,690
- I'm sure you know this one.
- I know the answer.

960
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,730
- We talked about this.
- You mentioned this.

961
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:42,170
(They all talked
about gakjadosaeng.)

962
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,350
People often say
they should do this.

963
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,620
- Right? It was among the first few.
- I think I saw it earlier.

964
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,980
- This...
- Let me answer. It's gagahoho.

965
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,210
- That's not it.
- Seriously?

966
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,320
(That one was among
the first few too.)

967
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,250
Nice. It's all right.
I quite liked that.

968
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,330
(No one is as confident as he is
when it comes to quizzes.)

969
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,630
"On our own" is the key phrase.

970
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,650
I'm sure you've at least
said this once in your life.

971
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,160
Let me answer. It's gakyanggaksaek.

972
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,690
No, but it's similar.

973
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,100
- I love this.
- Let me answer. It's gakgidareun.

974
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,260
- Seriously?
- Come on.

975
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,900
Just think.
The answer's in front of you.

976
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,310
Everyone's trying
to save themselves.

977
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,310
Then "saeng" must be
in there somewhere.

978
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,580
Everyone's trying
to save themselves.

979
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,670
Then "saeng" must be
in there somewhere.

980
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,120
This is killing me.

981
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,150
- If it isn't gakyanggaksaek...
- Se Chan has half of it right.

982
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,510
- He said the syllables.
- Really?

983
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,010
- Then...
- I did?

984
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,150
Gakyang... What did I say?

985
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,680
Gakgidareun.

986
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,830
(Jong Kook is just as clueless.)

987
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,490
Gakgae...

988
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:37,660
(Gakgae...)

989
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,730
Gaesaeng!

990
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,760
- Gakgaegaesaeng.
- I thought you were swearing.

991
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
- Gaesaeng!
- Gakgaegaesaeng.

992
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,970
Is it gakgaegaksaeng?

993
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,380
But I said the right syllables.

994
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,810
It's not "gae."

995
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,880
- Then...
- Let me answer.

996
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,010
It's gakjailsaeng.

997
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,880
- You know...
- Let me answer. Gakjagaksaeng.

998
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,090
- That's not it.
- Let me answer.

999
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,650
It's Gakja...

1000
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,120
honsaeng.

1001
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,130
Gakjagaesaeng!

1002
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,290
(Ding!)

1003
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,860
Gakjasipsaeng!

1004
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,360
(Ding!)

1005
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,920
(He's expressing
all aspects of life.)

1006
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,130
- Let's do this.
- "Gakja" is correct.

1007
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,300
- Then...
- Gakja...

1008
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,190
Gak, ja, blank, saeng.

1009
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,900
- It's not gakjahonsaeng?
- Come on.

1010
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,140
Everyone goes their own path.

1011
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,900
- They all seek their own path.
- Let me answer.

1012
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,170
Is it gakjadosaeng?

1013
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,650
Hold on. Who uses that
in ordinary speech?

1014
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,080
- Gakjadosaeng.
- While grouping up,

1015
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,880
- we use that term?
- Who uses that?

1016
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,240
I have never said that
in my entire life.

1017
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,440
You have probably heard it
at least once.

1018
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,510
- Not me.
- It describes how everyone...

1019
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,910
- seeks out their own path.
- Gakjadosaeng?

1020
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,450
Haha, you seem disappointed.

1021
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,560
- You fought well though.
- Okay.

1022
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,720
- You fought well.
- Good job.

1023
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,750
Nicely done.

1024
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,420
- Yeji, it's okay.
- Nice!

1025
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,420
(In the next round,
BIBI ties the score.)

1026
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,460
You're at a tie...

1027
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,870
and this is the last round.

1028
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,190
Kim Jong Kook versus Haha.

1029
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,930
(Jong Kook and Haha compete
when they're tied 2 to 2.)

1030
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,070
Haha, get out here.

1031
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,610
Haha, come on out.

1032
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,170
(Winning this round
means a win for the team.)

1033
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,200
Gosh.

1034
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,500
I'm feeling the pressure,
that's all.

1035
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,550
- They are the last players.
- The last?

1036
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,900
We win if Jong Kook does.

1037
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,280
- Really?
- They win if Haha wins.

1038
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,440
Brain teaser, please.

1039
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,890
Brain teaser.

1040
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,480
A celebrity quiz?

1041
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,180
- A celebrity quiz?
- A brain teaser?

1042
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,530
(He can't help but laugh
at Haha's request.)

1043
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,790
The category will be...

1044
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,650
(The category of the final round)

1045
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,100
- It'll be general knowledge.
- Okay.

1046
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,900
- I didn't study that though.
- Me neither.

1047
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,860
In other words,

1048
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,130
it is called...

1049
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,840
kkangkkangi or kkangkkaengi.

1050
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,510
This string instrument...

1051
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,680
Let me answer. Is it ajaeng?

1052
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,740
(Ding!)

1053
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,220
This string instrument...

1054
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,990
is always included
in a wind ensemble.

1055
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,050
It shows a balance between...

1056
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,880
a wind instrument
and a string instrument...

1057
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
It's not ajaeng.

1058
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,050
and is made using
the eight elements...

1059
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,760
- of traditional instruments.
- Let me answer.

1060
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,990
Is it geomungo?

1061
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,820
(Ding!)

1062
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,990
Just name every instrument you know.

1063
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,030
Let me answer. Gayageum.

1064
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,630
(Ding!)

1065
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,410
- Do we know what it is?
- I know what it is.

1066
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:57,700
It's similar to an ajaeng.

1067
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,800
That's right.

1068
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,780
- It's haegeum.
- It is made using...

1069
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,840
the eight elements
of traditional instruments.

1070
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,450
- You know what it is.
- Right.

1071
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,010
Come on.

1072
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,720
It's an instrument
that is similar to an ajaeng.

1073
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,950
- You know what it is.
- Right.

1074
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,760
Two syllables.

1075
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,260
Let me answer.

1076
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,820
(Haha wants to answer.)

1077
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,530
I know what it is. It's a pipe.

1078
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,630
(A pipe)

1079
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,530
(One would expect the final round
to be on a higher level.)

1080
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,530
It's a string instrument, right?

1081
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,090
- It's like an ajaeng.
- A pipe isn't a string instrument.

1082
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,930
It's a lot like an ajaeng.

1083
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,070
- You play it like this.
- I confuse them all the time.

1084
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,970
Hold on a second.

1085
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,130
- Let's give the first letters.
- It's on the tip of my tongue.

1086
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,470
No, not the first letters.

1087
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,240
(Instrumental sound)

1088
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,880
(They mimic the haegeum
with their voices.)

1089
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,820
- One letter will give it all up.
- Exactly.

1090
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,180
How about I give them
the first letter?

1091
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,680
How about this as a hint?

1092
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,880
The sea.

1093
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,910
Yes, the sea.

1094
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,530
- What?
- The sea.

1095
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,050
- The sea?
- Yes, the sea.

1096
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,550
The sea.

1097
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,760
Will that confuse them even more?

1098
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,530
- Let me answer.
- That's it. It finally came to you.

1099
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,700
- It's eojaeng.
- Seriously?

1100
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,910
(Eojaeng instead of ajaeng)

1101
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,300
Eojaeng.

1102
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,340
Eojaeng!

1103
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,700
Seriously?

1104
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,840
Unbelievable.

1105
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,240
Not ajaeng but...

1106
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,910
- Don't complicate things.
- Think of the Chinese character.

1107
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,570
Think of the sea in the easiest way.

1108
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,110
- Think of the Chinese character.
- Let me answer.

1109
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,150
Haegeum!

1110
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,380
(Haha is correct.)

1111
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,030
- Nicely done.
- See what I mean?

1112
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,990
- Of course.
- It was a close match though.

1113
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,400
(After a series of wrong answers,
he stumbled on the right one.)

1114
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,550
Nice!

1115
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,220
(The smart ones on Team Majority
didn't even get to compete.)

1116
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,860
Go, team!

1117
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,410
And just like that,

1118
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,630
Team Minority wins...

1119
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,780
which gives the 4 members
100 points each.

1120
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,650
(The 4 of them receive
100 points each.)

1121
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,970
(Nobody thought
Team Minority would win.)

1122
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,340
- We did it.
- Nice.

1123
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,150
- What a relief.
- Then,

1124
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,050
let's move on to the next mission.

1125
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,220
We could've won though.

1126
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,490
The keyword
for the next mission is...

1127
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,880
rapid response.

1128
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,220
- Sounds good.
- Rapid response?

1129
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,700
(In the preliminary round...)

1130
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,930
- Okay!
- Suk Jin is the captain.

1131
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,300
- This is how it should be.
- Okay.

1132
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,760
- Okay, good.
- Okay.

1133
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,530
Okay.

1134
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,530
(How will the teams be divided?)

1135
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,660
I'll draw a number now.

1136
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,410
All we need is Jong Kook
on our team.

1137
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,630
It'll be hilarious if he pulls out
a 1 or a 10.

1138
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,180
We don't know
what the game is though.

1139
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,740
Jong Kook might only get
to compete in one round.

1140
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,150
- So...
- What's the number?

1141
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,550
It's all in the luck of the draw.

1142
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,780
- What's the number?
- No way.

1143
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,910
Just until Suk Jin.

1144
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,110
(2, Ji Suk Jin)

1145
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,360
We've already won.

1146
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,760
No way.

1147
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,930
(Oh, dear...)

1148
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,860
- No way.
- We've already won.

1149
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,490
Jong Kook and me?

1150
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,090
We've already won.

1151
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,660
- But Suk Jin...
- This is insane.

1152
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,990
With Suk Jin?

1153
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,360
- How can this be?
- This is hilarious.

1154
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,740
- This is bad.
- Oh, no.

1155
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,910
- Just Jong Kook and Suk Jin?
- What's the game?

1156
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,840
How could this be?

1157
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,380
They're polar opposites.

1158
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,680
But I need to win.

1159
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,910
- I have no points.
- I need to win. I have zero points.

1160
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,320
- Let's do this.
- All right.

1161
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,150
To succeed in this next game,

1162
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,820
you must keep
your eyes and ears open.

1163
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,050
This is
Sickly White Glove Blue Glove.

1164
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,930
- Sickly White Glove Blue Glove?
- Are we doing the opposite?

1165
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,860
One from each team will compete.

1166
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,490
While facing each other,

1167
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,470
you will put on
a blue glove and white glove...

1168
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,970
on each of your hands.

1169
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,260
Follow the game host's lead...

1170
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,010
and play the regular game
of Blue Flag White Flag.

1171
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,280
If you fail to do
what the host says,

1172
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,840
you will lose a point.

1173
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,650
Losing five points
will get you eliminated.

1174
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,220
You must beat
all the opposing players to win.

1175
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,320
The game host may shout orders...

1176
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,590
such as
"Blue Glove, hit your opponent"...

1177
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,490
or "Blue Glove, touch your leg".
Anything goes.

1178
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,610
- It's at the host's discretion.
- I see.

1179
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,090
The game host...

1180
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,050
will be Jae Suk
since this is what he's good at.

1181
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,530
- Me?
- Of course.

1182
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,630
But he's such a prankster.

1183
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,590
In terms of this game...

1184
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,200
We're already in the lead.

1185
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,160
One of you can enter...

1186
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,340
and decide on your opponent.

1187
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,910
- Okay!
- Seok Sam, are you going first?

1188
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,300
Sure. I'll get rid of you all.

1189
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,380
(I'll get rid of you all.)

1190
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,910
Life is all about
taking on challenges.

1191
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,910
- But...
- Of course.

1192
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,150
Life is about taking on challenges.

1193
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,450
Your hearing isn't up to par,
so will you be all right?

1194
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,970
I hear what I need to hear.

1195
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,450
- Then...
- He can choose his opponent.

1196
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,840
- I'll choose.
- Is that so?

1197
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,320
- It'll probably be someone slow.
- No way.

1198
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,950
- It'll be one of you guys.
- Well...

1199
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,550
- Luda or...
- He might choose Luda.

1200
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,280
I'm sure of it.

1201
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,660
Don't pick on the weaker ones.

1202
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,900
(The hyena only goes after
the weakest links.)

1203
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,070
He's not even looking our way.

1204
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,860
Suk Jin's eyes have intensified.

1205
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,860
(He isn't even considering the men.)

1206
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,360
So Min, come on out.

1207
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,030
(He chooses So Min,
one who rivals him in weakness.)

1208
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,630
He's going to soar through
this round.

1209
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,570
Suk Jin, you don't scare me at all.

1210
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,840
So Min, come on out.
I need help with these gloves.

1211
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,450
So Min, knock him out, okay?

1212
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,090
Is this flour? Blue and white.

1213
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,720
Get more on the gloves.

1214
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,880
I have.

1215
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,090
(A hefty amount)

1216
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,820
This game was tailor-made
for Jun Ha.

1217
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,630
- How so?
- This is his game.

1218
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,220
- Is this the Jung Jun Ha game?
- He'll eat it up.

1219
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,490
How will you eat it up?

1220
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,900
- Deliciously.
- Deliciously, of course.

1221
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,800
- He'll make it look good.
- Deliciously?

1222
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,630
- It's like the flag game, right?
- Yes.

1223
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,630
So Min is trying her best though.

1224
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,840
Here we go.

1225
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,970
This will be a practice round...

1226
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,570
- since I need to practice as well.
- Sure.

1227
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,050
Blue Glove, up.

1228
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,780
White Glove, up.

1229
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,910
Blue Glove, down.

1230
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,280
White Glove, up.

1231
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,450
White Glove, down.

1232
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,490
Don't raise White Glove.
Blue Glove, up.

1233
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,860
Blue Glove, punch.

1234
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,860
That's it.

1235
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,950
Blue Glove, punch.

1236
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,030
That's it.

1237
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,380
(They both become Smurfs.)

1238
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,490
That's how it will be done.

1239
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,450
That's how the game will go.

1240
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,130
- Okay.
- That was harsh.

1241
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,900
- That's how the game will go.
- Do you see me as a guy?

1242
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,260
No, I'm just being fair.

1243
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,130
- Let the game begin.
- Sure.

1244
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,660
(The real game begins.)

1245
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,070
Blue Glove, down.

1246
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,780
White Glove, up.

1247
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,610
Don't raise Blue Glove.
White Glove, down.

1248
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,680
Don't raise White Glove.
Blue Glove, down.

1249
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,910
Don't lower Blue Glove.
Blue Glove, down.

1250
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,610
Don't lower Blue Glove.
White Glove, up.

1251
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,990
White Glove, down.

1252
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,860
White Glove, punch.

1253
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,410
(White Glove, punch.)

1254
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,610
White Glove, punch.

1255
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,590
(Did he punch with the blue one?)

1256
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,930
Didn't he punch with the blue one?

1257
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,550
- Yes, the blue one.
- Suk Jin got it wrong.

1258
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,260
Also, hesitating
will make you lose a point.

1259
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,530
- Of course.
- Yes, you can't hesitate.

1260
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,990
He's hitting me really hard.

1261
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,430
- Your face...
- Are you all right?

1262
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,360
- So Min, are you all right?
- Yondu?

1263
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,740
- Yondu!
- Oh, no.

1264
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,030
What happened to your face?

1265
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,570
It's been a while
since we saw Yondu.

1266
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,180
- What happened to your face?
- Oh, no.

1267
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,470
I'm not kidding...

1268
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,380
when I say he's punching me
with all his might.

1269
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,470
- I'm only invested in the game.
- Rather than...

1270
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,650
Here we go again.

1271
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,240
Blue Glove, down.

1272
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,090
- Don't raise White Glove.
- Hold on a second.

1273
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,180
(Minus 1 point, Minus 1 point)

1274
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,280
Hold on a second.

1275
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,260
What's the matter with you?

1276
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,720
- He lost points.
- Focus, will you?

1277
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,050
You lost points just now.

1278
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,360
Isn't this a hard game
for someone his age?

1279
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,570
How many points do I have left?

1280
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,470
- You're at minus four.
- Already?

1281
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,990
- What about her?
- Minus two points.

1282
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,990
- Here we go again.
- Sure.

1283
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,970
He'll be eliminated
if he loses another point.

1284
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,070
(Suk Jin can't afford
to make another mistake.)

1285
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,200
Blue Glove, down.

1286
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,240
Blue Glove, down...

1287
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,340
(Whispering)

1288
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,450
- What was that?
- That's out of the blue.

1289
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,200
- Is that allowed?
- I take requests.

1290
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,720
Is that allowed?

1291
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,410
- I do what you ask of me.
- She's not cheating, is she?

1292
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,550
I can do it for you.

1293
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,450
All right, now. Blue Glove, down.

1294
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,410
- She got her leg up.
- Blue Glove, down.

1295
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,590
- So Min is up to something.
- Blue Glove, up.

1296
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,990
Blue Glove, up.

1297
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,360
Punch as much as you want.

1298
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,300
(Punch as much as you want.)

1299
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,760
(So Min attacks first)

1300
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,260
Blue Glove, down.

1301
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,700
Suk Jin, you're eliminated.

1302
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,800
- Why?
- Oh, no.

1303
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,240
How come?

1304
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:09,630
We attacked at the same time.

1305
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,760
(Big Nose got eliminated
for responding late.)

1306
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,130
He lost when he got attacked
like that.

1307
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,070
(He gets eliminated humiliatingly.)

1308
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,450
We attacked at the same time,
so why was I eliminated?

1309
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,550
You're eliminated.

1310
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,340
- We attacked at the same time.
- You were slower.

1311
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:22,990
How? Based on what?

1312
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,240
- She hit you first.
- She was faster.

1313
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,910
There's such a thing
as punching as much as we want?

1314
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,180
This is upsetting!

1315
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,860
Is Suk Jin done with?

1316
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,990
What happened? Am I...

1317
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,450
Jong Kook can play next.

1318
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,800
What? Gosh, we're in trouble.

1319
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,130
Jun Ha is determined to win.

1320
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,240
He knows that this game
was made for him.

1321
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,160
He knows.

1322
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,530
He's running simulations
in his head.

1323
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,340
He's thinking,
"How should I make it fun?"

1324
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,030
"How should I get hit?"

1325
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,950
"I need to make it funny."

1326
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,200
Here we go.

1327
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,680
White Glove, down.

1328
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,590
White Glove, down.

1329
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,680
Blue Glove, down.

1330
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,880
White Glove, punch.

1331
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,450
(White Glove, punch.)

1332
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,910
White Glove, punch.

1333
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,680
(Throwing a left hook
with his teeth clenched)

1334
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,680
Good job!

1335
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,990
- Jong Kook is...
- He's good!

1336
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:06,820
He's showing no mercy.

1337
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,430
Blue Glove, punch.

1338
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:09,930
(Blue Glove, punch.)

1339
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,360
(So Min gets eliminated
after getting blue braises.)

1340
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,400
- So Min, you're eliminated.
- You're done.

1341
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,470
It's time...

1342
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,860
to teach them a lesson.

1343
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,570
You should start warming up.

1344
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,840
MC Minzy, you should devour them.

1345
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,070
Go devour them.

1346
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,280
It's the Jung Jun Ha game.

1347
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,240
- He's ready.
- Let's have him play right away.

1348
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,610
- MC Minzy!
- MC Minzy!

1349
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,490
(Here comes MC Minzy.)

1350
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,780
- Enjoy it all you want.
- I can't wait to see you play.

1351
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,260
MC Minzy,
play with him all you want!

1352
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,880
All right.

1353
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,680
"This is to my liking."

1354
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,090
I should wash my wig later.

1355
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,200
- MC Minzy.
- Here we go.

1356
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,800
- You were born in 2002, right?
- Yes.

1357
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,090
- Why are you so casual with me?
- Yes, I was.

1358
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,700
- I'm older than you.
- Here we go.

1359
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,030
Teach him a lesson, Jong Kook.

1360
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,130
Blue Glove, punch.

1361
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,910
(Blue Glove, punch.)

1362
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,070
That's one hilarious punch!

1363
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,570
You're taking the punch well!

1364
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,010
It's the Jung Jun Ha game.

1365
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,820
It's the game made for him!

1366
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,780
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes, I am.

1367
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,610
Isn't he knocked out?

1368
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,760
Isn't he... Are you okay?

1369
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,590
Are you good, MC Minzy?

1370
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,660
- He's good as expected.
- He takes the punch well.

1371
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,160
Here we go again.

1372
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,700
White Glove, punch.

1373
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,360
(White Glove, punch.)

1374
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,630
White Glove, punch.

1375
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,200
Are you okay?

1376
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,840
- He's...
- He's getting worked up.

1377
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,130
Let's get started.

1378
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,800
- All right.
- All right.

1379
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:30,070
- He's strong because he's so young.
- MC Minzy is...

1380
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:32,070
- He's hungry for it.
- You guys, watch it carefully.

1381
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,280
His punches are pretty fast.

1382
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,380
You're quite strong.

1383
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,450
- He learned boxing.
- I was like...

1384
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,950
- He learned boxing.
- You didn't...

1385
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,780
give us any other instructions
and told us to punch.

1386
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,450
Here we go.

1387
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,530
White Glove, punch twice.

1388
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,590
(White Glove, punch twice.)

1389
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,160
White Glove, punch twice.

1390
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:49,720
(Getting two punches at once)

1391
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,660
- It was two punches, right?
- Right.

1392
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,030
- Yes, it was correct.
- Are you okay?

1393
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,470
So you were supposed to punch
with White Glove first.

1394
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,360
Was it correct?

1395
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,180
Since you told them
to punch twice...

1396
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,380
Even if I swing my arms randomly,
he gets hit anyway.

1397
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,680
- It's fun.
- The area of his face...

1398
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,880
- It's very wide.
- We need to go faster.

1399
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,650
- He learned boxing, that's why.
- His face is wide.

1400
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:09,110
- MC Minzy game!
- Here we go.

1401
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,450
- Here we go.
- It's nerve-racking.

1402
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,220
Blue Glove, down.

1403
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,490
- Blue Glove, down.
- It's nerve-racking.

1404
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,050
Don't lower White Glove.

1405
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,180
(They lost a point each.)

1406
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,490
Don't lower Blue Glove.

1407
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:20,490
Don't lower White Glove.

1408
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,530
MC Minzy flinched.

1409
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:23,800
Blue Glove,

1410
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:25,630
down.

1411
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,130
Blue Glove, down.

1412
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,840
Don't punch with White Glove.

1413
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,430
He told you not to punch.

1414
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:31,610
Don't punch with White Glove.

1415
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:32,930
(Grunting)

1416
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,200
Don't punch with White Glove.

1417
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,050
I told you not to punch.

1418
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,950
(The boxer threw a right hook
by instinct.)

1419
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,990
I told you not to punch.

1420
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,280
Wait a minute. Goodness.

1421
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,220
He was all ready to punch.

1422
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,090
Are you okay?

1423
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,090
I mean...

1424
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,320
His punch...

1425
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,700
- Your punch is too fast.
- It's because I get trained a lot.

1426
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:56,990
- Hey.
- This is...

1427
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,760
But it hurts a little.

1428
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,340
(But it hurts a little.)

1429
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,760
It hurts.

1430
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,340
No, I didn't hit you hard.

1431
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,410
I didn't hit you hard.

1432
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,800
- It hurts a little.
- Are you okay?

1433
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,380
It hurts.

1434
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,820
- But...
- His face...

1435
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,840
- Wasn't this supposed to be fun?
- His face is too wide.

1436
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,280
Are you crying?

1437
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,910
No, I'm not. That's not it.

1438
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,030
This side of my face...

1439
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,930
- He looks like a mammoth from here.
- It's the first time my face...

1440
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:28,130
is hurting ever since I got hit
by my friend in high school.

1441
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,990
Didn't my eye just pop out?

1442
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,340
- It's okay.
- Is it okay?

1443
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,340
(It's okay.)

1444
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,910
You didn't get hit in the eye.

1445
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,360
- MC Minzy, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm good.

1446
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,570
- All right.
- You're quite fast.

1447
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,970
I really...

1448
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:43,910
care about the guests' well-being,
so don't worry.

1449
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,780
- MC Minzy game!
- Here we go again.

1450
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,410
If he loses another point,
he'll be eliminated.

1451
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:48,780
- He has only one point to go.
- It can happen.

1452
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,150
- Jun Ha, you're doing well.
- They took away my point instead.

1453
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,380
Here we go.

1454
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,680
Blue Glove, down.

1455
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,990
Blue Glove, up.

1456
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:57,130
Don't raise Blue Glove.

1457
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,530
Don't lower White Glove.

1458
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:59,800
Don't raise Blue Glove.

1459
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,930
(Don't raise Blue Glove.)

1460
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,630
(Whistle blowing)

1461
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,700
(MC Minzy is eliminated.)

1462
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,030
- He didn't get to punch at all.
- Hey.

1463
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,260
He didn't get to punch at all.
He was only beaten.

1464
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,360
You did it.

1465
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,360
Am I eliminated?

1466
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,410
That's so cruel.

1467
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,930
Well done, MC Minzy.

1468
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:17,010
- MC Minzy.
- You're quite strong.

1469
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,410
It looks like you pulled your shirt
up to here.

1470
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:22,680
You should be on variety shows
as you pursue your career in music.

1471
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,590
You're very talented.

1472
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:26,780
But it hurts so much.

1473
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,490
That was hilarious.

1474
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,030
That was great.

1475
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:33,090
- Who is going next?
- Then is Haha...

1476
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,300
going next?

1477
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,530
Haha, you should go next.

1478
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,090
My business partner.

1479
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:39,700
He plays golf too.

1480
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,570
Show us your footwork, will you?

1481
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:44,130
You know the one you're good at.

1482
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,930
- Show it to us.
- Gosh, it's been so long.

1483
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,450
- He's fast.
- He's different.

1484
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,950
- Go for it.
- He's so fast.

1485
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,910
The punches you do
as you put up a guard.

1486
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,650
(His punches aren't threatening
at all.)

1487
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:55,950
That was one great punch.

1488
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,910
- Let's do this.
- I can't wait to see this match.

1489
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,150
As expected of you.

1490
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,090
- Here we go.
- He's fast.

1491
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:02,880
(A match between business partners)

1492
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,090
Just beat him up.

1493
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,800
- Keep your eyes open until the end.
- Here we go.

1494
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,450
Blue Glove, down.

1495
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:09,700
Blue Glove, down.

1496
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,700
Blue Glove, up.

1497
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,700
Blue Glove, punch.

1498
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,740
- My goodness.
- Oh, no.

1499
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,760
Blue Glove, punch.

1500
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,360
(Blue Glove, punch.)

1501
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,070
(The cheeky boxer got beaten
in 3 seconds.)

1502
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,910
He's no match for Jong Kook.

1503
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,240
- It's not fair.
- But this is...

1504
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,740
- What's wrong with it?
- I don't think this will work.

1505
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,410
Do you want me to
throw in the towel?

1506
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:27,510
Are you okay?

1507
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:28,820
What's wrong?

1508
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,950
- Darn it.
- What's wrong?

1509
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,090
He's a father.

1510
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,510
- He's a father of three!
- What's wrong with it?

1511
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,260
- That was...
- What's wrong with it?

1512
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:37,760
- That was...
- What?

1513
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,450
Wasn't he hit right in the face?

1514
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,130
What's wrong?

1515
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,200
I thought he shot a fireball.

1516
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,160
You look like Dream.

1517
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,360
He looks like Dream.

1518
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,570
Don't raise Blue Glove.

1519
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,200
Don't punch with White Glove.

1520
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:54,470
Don't punch with White Glove.

1521
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:56,050
(Flinching)

1522
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:58,650
(He's daunted after getting shot
by a fireball.)

1523
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,280
- Are you doing okay?
- I feel bad for him.

1524
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,380
Oh, no.

1525
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,780
(Whispering)

1526
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,990
- All right. He asked me something.
- What is it?

1527
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,110
He demanded something.

1528
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,110
All right.

1529
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:11,180
Punch as much as you want.

1530
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,200
You jerk!

1531
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,160
(To protect the player,
Haha got eliminated.)

1532
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,260
He didn't get to attack.

1533
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,300
(To protect the player,
Haha got eliminated.)

1534
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,430
I'm bleeding.

1535
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:25,910
- Are you okay?
- Oh, no.

1536
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,570
- What's wrong?
- Are you okay?

1537
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:30,740
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

1538
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,740
Don't cry. What's wrong with you?
It's just a game.

1539
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,150
Don't cry.

1540
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:37,050
- Let's deal with Se Chan now.
- Se Chan, come out to play.

1541
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,910
You're trying to...

1542
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,360
- punish them, aren't you?
- That's not it.

1543
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,950
- You are...
- That's what I think too.

1544
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:46,450
You're trying to get rid of those
who get on your nerves.

1545
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:49,320
Come play,
Se Chan who loves golfing.

1546
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,760
Se Chan, get back at him for us.

1547
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,360
If Se Chan loses,

1548
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,160
the female players
will have to step up.

1549
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,660
- It's okay.
- You got this!

1550
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,860
You got this!

1551
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,430
- Se Chan who is good at golf.
- Here we go.

1552
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:00,880
(Se Chan
is Team Majority's last hope)

1553
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:02,570
- White Glove, down.
- Aren't we too close?

1554
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:03,740
They're too close.

1555
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,280
It'll hurt more
if you're too close to each other.

1556
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,470
Blue Glove, up.

1557
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,880
Blue Glove, to the side.

1558
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:10,510
White Glove, to the side.

1559
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,220
I'm sorry about that.

1560
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,550
White Glove, to the side.

1561
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,050
I'm sorry about that.

1562
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,550
I'm sorry.

1563
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,450
It was a mistake. I'm sorry.

1564
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,820
I got confused.

1565
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,030
Didn't you tell us to punch?

1566
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,820
- He didn't tell us to punch?
- I didn't.

1567
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,470
- It's okay. It can be confusing.
- It can be confusing.

1568
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:26,490
Wait a minute.

1569
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,760
- Wait. It can be confusing.
- You got hit.

1570
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,360
- Why would he be mad?
- He got hit.

1571
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,130
I was...

1572
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:33,680
I was too focused on it.

1573
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,410
- Shall we?
- He let his guard down.

1574
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:36,680
White Glove, down.

1575
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:38,470
I told you to put down White Glove.

1576
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:41,240
(White Glove, punch.)

1577
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:43,510
I told you to put down White Glove.

1578
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,180
I'm sorry.

1579
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,680
You need to follow the instruction.

1580
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,860
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

1581
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:48,990
My nose hurts.

1582
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,680
- Here we go.
- Se Chan.

1583
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,130
- You can do it.
- Here we go.

1584
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,300
Blue Glove, down.

1585
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,950
White Glove, down.

1586
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:57,090
Don't lower White Glove.

1587
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:58,820
- Wait for your chance.
- Blue Glove, down.

1588
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,860
All right. I lost.

1589
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,760
I lost.

1590
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,840
All right. I lost.

1591
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:06,880
(After giving him a good punch,
he quits voluntarily.)

1592
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,510
- All right. I lost.
- He lost.

1593
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,800
Stop lying.

1594
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:12,550
- That was...
- Se Chan lost!

1595
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:15,320
- I punched him twice!
- Se Chan lost!

1596
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,680
Fine.

1597
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,590
In 1, 2, 3.

1598
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:23,130
Look at your members resenting you.

1599
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,880
Seriously.

1600
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,820
It feels like we're getting dragged
to a slaughterhouse.

1601
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,160
Next is Ji Hyo.

1602
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,470
Gosh, that was hilarious.

1603
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:30,630
Let's beat them all!

1604
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,530
Yes, I won't lose to them.

1605
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,360
Ji Hyo, we only need one more win.

1606
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,430
You can do it, Ji Hyo.

1607
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:36,930
- Jong Kook, don't go easy on her.
- Let's do it, Ji Hyo.

1608
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:38,470
- Ji Hyo, let's go.
- You're the best.

1609
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,800
- Don't go easy on her.
- All right.

1610
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:41,740
Here we go.

1611
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:42,840
(The last redoubt of Team Majority,
Song Ji Hyo)

1612
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,950
Blue Glove, down.

1613
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,610
Blue Glove, down. Blue Glove, up.

1614
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,840
Blue Glove, down.

1615
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,220
- Blue Glove, down.
- What is he doing?

1616
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,490
What aren't you doing it?

1617
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,510
White Glove, down.

1618
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,680
White Glove, up.
Don't raise White Glove.

1619
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,880
Blue Glove, down.

1620
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,430
Don't lower Blue Glove.
White Glove, up.

1621
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,130
- Excuse me.
- White Glove, up.

1622
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:00,160
(Excuse me.)

1623
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,260
Ji Hyo is eliminated.

1624
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,800
- Ji Hyo is eliminated.
- You're eliminated.

1625
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,990
(Ji Hyo is eliminated.)

1626
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,030
Ji Hyo is eliminated.

1627
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:07,800
Why are you so bad at this?

1628
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,630
I've been counting,

1629
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,570
and she made about six mistakes.

1630
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:13,780
- Ji Hyo.
- That was...

1631
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,880
- Pull yourself together.
- She made that many mistakes?

1632
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:18,300
Team Minority wins.

1633
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,150
- Yes!
- All right! I'm so relieved.

1634
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,840
How did Team Minority win?

1635
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,610
The team that has Jong Kook
as its member always wins.

1636
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,380
(Jong Kook beats everyone else.
They move on to the next mission.)

1637
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,590
I keep losing.

1638
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:30,220
What's this?

1639
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:32,860
What's this?

1640
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,200
What's this?

1641
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,530
That's... My goodness.

1642
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,700
What is this?

1643
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,340
It's that one.

1644
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,470
(A huge set
that looks like a bridge)

1645
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:44,340
This looks exciting.

1646
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,570
I guess it has something
to do with using strength.

1647
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:47,680
- What's this supposed to be?
- What could it be?

1648
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,470
- What's this?
- It's scary.

1649
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,470
(It's 14m long and 3m high.)

1650
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:54,010
It must be something difficult.
I think we need to jump onto it.

1651
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:55,970
- Please go easy on us.
- We're in trouble.

1652
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,240
There are so many styrofoams.

1653
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,510
It must be a big game.

1654
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:00,760
It's the long-awaited final mission.

1655
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,510
The keyword for the last mission...

1656
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,680
is intuition.

1657
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,820
- Intuition?
- Intuition?

1658
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,090
We'll go in this order.

1659
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:09,570
Jae Suk, you trusted me to go first
because it uses our intuition.

1660
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,320
- What's your number?
- Nice.

1661
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,700
Five?

1662
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,200
- Until number five?
- We have Jong Kook on our team.

1663
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:15,700
Until number five?

1664
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,740
It's BIBI, Jong Kook, Se Chan,
Ji Hyo, and me.

1665
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:20,930
Let me tell you the rules
of this game.

1666
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:22,240
When you go up there...

1667
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,740
You know the glass panel bridge
in "Squid Game", right?

1668
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,380
- Oh, gosh.
- It's that game?

1669
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,450
Just like that game,

1670
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:32,320
You're going to cross 13 panels
with a 50-percent chance.

1671
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,450
Goodness.

1672
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,490
One is made of styrofoam,
and the other one is wood.

1673
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,660
If you step on the styrofoam panel,
you'll fall.

1674
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,090
That means you'll be eliminated.

1675
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:44,260
Then the next person
from the same team will go.

1676
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,490
The team that makes it
to the furthest wins.

1677
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,660
- It sounds fun.
- No way.

1678
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:48,800
You can't test the panel.

1679
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,570
Of course not.

1680
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,570
It's better to have more people
on your team.

1681
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,780
It's better to have more people.

1682
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,180
We're at an advantage
because we have more people.

1683
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,510
- Let's play.
- All right. Let's play!

1684
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:01,610
Gosh, I can't believe
we're playing this game.

1685
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,950
It looks fun though.

1686
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:05,220
I'm actually scared.
I don't want to go first.

1687
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:08,280
I thought both teams were crossing
from the ends.

1688
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,030
Some might not even get to try it.

1689
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:11,680
This is difficult.

1690
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,050
Right? Not everyone can play.

1691
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,360
This is difficult.

1692
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:15,990
- Of course.
- It's difficult.

1693
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:18,160
- It's really difficult.
- My gosh.

1694
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,240
But it's thrilling.

1695
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,570
It's scary.

1696
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,070
Gosh, I can't tell them apart.

1697
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:25,010
- I really can't tell them apart.
- Of course not.

1698
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,680
- I can't tell them apart from here.
- Jae Suk.

1699
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,110
- I can't tell at all.
- I can't tell at all either.

1700
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:30,070
This one looks like styrofoam.

1701
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:34,010
To everyone on the winning team,

1702
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,240
we'll give 100 points each.

1703
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,550
We'll give additional points
for the number of panels...

1704
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:39,590
you guessed right.

1705
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:40,860
- You're giving us more points?
- Yes.

1706
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,610
Which member is going first?

1707
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:44,130
Members from each team
should step forward.

1708
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,530
Look how Suk Jin got up
to go first.

1709
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:47,660
- It's...
- You're awesome.

1710
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,990
I can't do it.

1711
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:50,070
I didn't volunteer.

1712
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,530
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Ji Suk Jin.

1713
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,360
- Ji Suk Jin.
- That's not it.

1714
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,660
- Ji Suk Jin.
- You're awesome.

1715
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,660
Okay, I'll go first.

1716
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,680
Will you shout out my name
a few times?

1717
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:04,510
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Ji Suk Jin.

1718
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,050
(Studying others)

1719
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:07,780
Since we have fewer members...

1720
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,840
- You should go.
- A man should go first.

1721
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,510
In terms of the order,
you'll have to go first.

1722
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:12,510
Okay. I'll go first.

1723
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:13,880
Jae Suk was suddenly pushed
to go first.

1724
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,380
You should step in the middle.

1725
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,990
Which one is a styrofoam panel?

1726
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,260
I think this is...

1727
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,700
Let's see if we can tell them apart.

1728
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,860
- That one looks like styrofoam.
- Let's take a look at it together.

1729
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,070
- I think this is styrofoam.
- This looks like styrofoam.

1730
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,090
- This looks like styrofoam.
- I can't tell them apart from here.

1731
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,340
- I have no idea.
- I have no idea also.

1732
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,930
Gosh, one of them is a wooden panel?

1733
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:32,910
You did such a fine job.
I can't tell them apart.

1734
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,470
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

1735
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:37,070
We have 13 chances?

1736
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,050
How are we supposed to make it
within 13 chances?

1737
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:40,240
We have 13 chances?

1738
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,280
They have a better chance
of winning.

1739
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,990
It's somewhat scary.

1740
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:46,010
The team that advances more
will win.

1741
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,490
If this was "Squid Game",
we die if we fall.

1742
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:49,590
You're right.

1743
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:51,590
I'll just think
that my life depends on it.

1744
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:52,680
Here we go then.

1745
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,490
(It's scary to jump from there
as the bridge is tall.)

1746
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,320
If we make it,
then we'll turn the tables.

1747
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,490
- Gosh, they made it so well.
- Maybe that's not the one.

1748
00:55:58,490 --> 00:55:59,700
- I can't tell them apart.
- Go.

1749
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,490
- Go, Jae Suk.
- He made up his mind.

1750
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:03,760
- No. Don't go.
- You're the lucky one.

1751
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,430
Gosh.

1752
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,200
- Don't look down.
- Goodness.

1753
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,740
I think I'll find you flat
on the ground soon.

1754
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,780
(I think I'll find you flat
on the ground soon.)

1755
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,780
- I'm going now.
- Okay, go ahead.

1756
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,050
- I got this!
- You can do it.

1757
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:14,070
- Here we go.
- I think...

1758
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,470
you'll be flat on the ground
like a squid.

1759
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:16,780
Is that why
it's called "Squid Game"?

1760
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:18,410
- You won't fall flat from here.
- Okay.

1761
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:19,410
You'll be less scared...

1762
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,090
if you just think you're going to
break through the panel.

1763
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:22,280
- Think that you'll break through.
- Let's go!

1764
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,180
- Three...
- You should jump with both feet.

1765
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,760
- Jump with both feet.
- Okay!

1766
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,760
(Why would you talk to me?)

1767
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,300
- Let's go!
- Think that you'll break through.

1768
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:30,700
- In one...
- Three.

1769
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,660
(Standing at the starting line)

1770
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,570
- In one...
- Three.

1771
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:41,470
- Two, one. Go!
- Two.

1772
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:44,280
Go! Why aren't you leaving?

1773
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,070
Hey! If this was in drama,
we'd all die!

1774
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,720
- I told you to go.
- Just break through it.

1775
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,240
- You're going to break through it.
- Three...

1776
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,720
- Two, one.
- I'm going to jump on that one.

1777
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,950
(Jae Suk chose the panel
on the right.)

1778
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,260
(Will he make it?)

1779
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,860
- Zero!
- Go!

1780
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:01,990
- Go!
- Die!

1781
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:14,740
(He jumped.)

1782
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,800
- You're going to break through it.
- Zero!

1783
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,010
- Go!
- Go!

1784
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:18,610
- Die!
- Oh, gosh.

1785
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,280
(It was a wooden panel.)

1786
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,140
Gosh!

1787
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,050
That's it!

1788
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:26,410
(He was really scared.)

1789
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:27,640
- You made it!
- He got the right one.

1790
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,010
- You made it.
- Gosh!

1791
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:31,010
(He couldn't help but kneel.)

1792
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:32,160
- Can you tell them apart?
- You did it.

1793
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,780
Gosh, you're amazing.

1794
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,200
- I thought he'd fall.
- Me too.

1795
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,300
Oh, no!

1796
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,300
- I nearly died!
- It's a little different.

1797
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,930
- It almost killed me.
- I'm going next.

1798
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:44,140
Jae Suk. There must be a twist.

1799
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:45,660
You should go diagonally.

1800
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,660
(It's time to move on
to the second panel.)

1801
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,760
- There must be a twist.
- No.

1802
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,410
In "Squid Game", they chose
the one above it.

1803
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:51,970
No, you shouldn't.
I don't think there's a twist.

1804
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,370
- You don't think so?
- I don't know.

1805
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:54,550
I don't think
you should choose that.

1806
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:56,320
Try to think
of the host's intention.

1807
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,070
(Should he go straight
or diagonally?)

1808
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:00,220
I don't think it's the one
on the left.

1809
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,220
- I think you should go straight.
- Should I choose the other one?

1810
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,550
Jae Suk. Don't you think
you should go straight?

1811
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:03,680
I'll go diagonally.

1812
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,390
- Go ahead.
- Really? It's too obvious though.

1813
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:06,930
- I'll give it a try.
- Go ahead.

1814
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:08,120
- Go ahead.
- Go for it.

1815
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,030
- I don't care now.
- We'll see where you go,

1816
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:12,120
- and we'll follow next.
- I'm as good as dead.

1817
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,300
- You know that, right?
- All right.

1818
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,300
- I'm as good as dead.
- We heard you.

1819
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,700
- Three.
- Two.

1820
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:17,700
- One!
- One.

1821
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,700
- Jump!
- Go!

1822
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,160
- Go!
- Oh, no!

1823
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,260
Oh, gosh.

1824
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,780
Is it this one or that one?

1825
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,950
Oh, no.

1826
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:27,680
- Three, two,
- Which one will you choose?

1827
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,180
- one!
- I can't bring myself to do it.

1828
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,180
(I can't bring myself to do it.)

1829
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:33,640
Go!

1830
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,430
(He falls right through the panel.)

1831
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:39,950
That was styrofoam.

1832
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,320
What happened?

1833
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:42,890
That was styrofoam.

1834
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,590
(The scaredy-cat
got even more scared...)

1835
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:46,300
(by the bottom that was lifted
for safety.)

1836
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,800
(Screaming)

1837
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,470
- Oh, gosh.
- Darn it.

1838
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,800
- We never know who'll win.
- We never know.

1839
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,070
I really can't tell them apart.

1840
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:56,410
You need to go as far as possible.

1841
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:57,680
I really can't tell them apart.

1842
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,280
- Oh, no.
- I want to get eliminated already.

1843
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,280
(I want to get eliminated already.)

1844
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,740
I shouldn't watch them play.

1845
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:06,140
Why did they prepare this game
when I'm here?

1846
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,180
I hate this kind of game the most.

1847
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:09,780
- My feet are sweaty already.
- Suk Jin, I'm sorry.

1848
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,180
I can't do this.

1849
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,530
It's so scary.

1850
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:13,930
Please continue.

1851
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:16,160
It's impossible to tell them apart
from their appearance.

1852
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,220
Let's go, Mr. Ji.

1853
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,300
(Suk Jin's choice
became more important...)

1854
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,390
(as Jae Suk succeeded
in the first stage.)

1855
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,990
I hope Mr. Ji can make it
through halfway.

1856
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:23,140
I know. If he makes it
through halfway...

1857
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,370
Il Nam!

1858
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:27,970
"What did I say?"

1859
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:29,740
"Did I say it's on the left?"

1860
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:33,240
Suk Jin, just stick to one side
and go straight.

1861
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:34,950
- He's right.
- Three,

1862
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:36,680
- two, one, go!
- Two, one, go!

1863
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,590
- Go!
- No, I can't!

1864
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:40,490
You should go.

1865
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:43,490
Three, two, one.

1866
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:44,590
Let's go.

1867
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,280
(He can't bring himself to go
as he's scared.)

1868
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,660
- They're so well-crafted.
- Three, two...

1869
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,390
- You should just run.
- Three, two,

1870
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,120
- one!
- I won't die.

1871
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,300
- Go!
- Go!

1872
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,870
- Go!
- Go!

1873
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,160
(He fell from the first panel.)

1874
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,760
Oh, no.

1875
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,530
You should think that
they'll break anyway.

1876
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:04,280
That's right.

1877
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,180
Gosh, you said...

1878
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,910
- You said this was the styrofoam.
- We're in the lead.

1879
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:10,140
- All right.
- We're ahead of them.

1880
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,120
It's Team Minority's turn.

1881
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,410
- We're ahead of them.
- All right!

1882
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,510
Ji Hyo is the lucky type,

1883
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,390
- You should jump on it hard.
- so she has a chance.

1884
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:19,030
- It doesn't hurt much.
- It's this one, right?

1885
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:21,490
- That's it.
- Jump on it hard.

1886
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:23,050
You can step on the next one.

1887
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:24,760
- Go for it.
- Okay.

1888
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,120
- That's it.
- Even when you know...

1889
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,590
This is where I need to
choose one, right?

1890
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,570
Ji Hyo, I don't think
it's on that side.

1891
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:35,300
Watch carefully. If you do, you
might be able to pick the right one.

1892
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,110
- Which one should I pick?
- But Jong Kook,

1893
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:39,110
do you think they put
the wooden panels in a row?

1894
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,280
It's plausible.

1895
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,970
I think they put them in a row.

1896
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,120
- Go for it.
- Right, Ji Hyo?

1897
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,370
I think this one is styrofoam.

1898
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,990
But I think it's too risky.

1899
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:47,180
If it's three blocks in a row...

1900
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,590
- I would go straight.
- Me too.

1901
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:50,860
Then go straight. Okay.

1902
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,950
Bo Pil, this game
really draws us in.

1903
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,660
- You need to be the judge, Ji Hyo.
- One, two...

1904
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:56,160
Three.

1905
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,390
Is she suddenly picking her hose?

1906
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:00,030
- She is suddenly picking her nose.
- It felt itchy.

1907
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,300
Okay. You can pick your nose
before you die.

1908
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:02,390
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

1909
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:04,530
- You should go diagonally.
- No.

1910
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:06,200
- Hold on.
- No. I will go straight.

1911
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,740
- Will you go straight?
- Go.

1912
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,010
(She decides to go straight
and gets down to jump.)

1913
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:12,340
It's hard.

1914
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:13,700
- It's hard, right?
- It's hard, right?

1915
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,740
It's hard.

1916
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:16,410
If it's hard for Ji Hyo,
it will be harder for us.

1917
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,390
Go.

1918
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:19,840
- Come on.
- Gosh.

1919
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,640
I can't believe
Ji Hyo is that scared.

1920
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,950
She is someone who bungee-jumped
from the Macau Tower.

1921
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,860
- Three, two,
- I understand.

1922
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:28,160
- one. Go.
- One. Go.

1923
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:29,930
It's impossible to jump like that.

1924
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:31,660
Go. Come on.

1925
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:33,970
(Grunting)

1926
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:35,070
What are you doing?

1927
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:36,590
- This is driving me crazy.
- If Ji Hyo is that scared...

1928
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,800
Here I go.

1929
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:39,640
- Just jump.
- Ji Hyo.

1930
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,800
- Just imagine that you will fall.
- That's the way to go.

1931
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:43,410
(Trembling)

1932
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:45,570
- You need to be ready.
- Her legs are trembling.

1933
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,780
This is driving me crazy.

1934
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,180
Gosh, this is nothing.

1935
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:51,820
- She is becoming angry.
- Gosh.

1936
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,050
- She is becoming angry.
- Go.

1937
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:54,490
You can curse.

1938
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:55,950
- That's good. Go.
- You can curse.

1939
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:57,910
It would have been easier
if there were no floor.

1940
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:59,220
It's okay. Just imagine
that there is no floor.

1941
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,260
(She is more scared of the floor.)

1942
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,800
One, two,

1943
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:04,550
- three.
- Three.

1944
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,890
It's okay.

1945
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:06,890
There you go.

1946
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,490
- It's wood.
- She chose correctly.

1947
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:09,590
(It's wood.)

1948
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:12,240
She chose correctly.

1949
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,470
- It's wood.
- Ji Hyo, jump again.

1950
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,740
It was the block on the right
three times in a row.

1951
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:17,840
Let's keep going.

1952
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:19,870
Hey.

1953
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,510
It has to be that one.

1954
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:23,140
It has to be that one.

1955
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:24,950
Trust yourself.

1956
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,120
(Nervous)

1957
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:27,550
- Go.
- Here I go.

1958
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,280
- Go.
- Here I go.

1959
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,760
Ji Hyo.

1960
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,090
(It's wood again!)

1961
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,390
That's incredible.

1962
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:37,620
She is moving forward.

1963
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:40,620
- Ji Hyo, I love you.
- She is moving forward.

1964
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:43,590
She has good intuition.
What should we do?

1965
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,840
- Here I go.
- Okay. One.

1966
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:47,410
- She will go diagonally.
- Two.

1967
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,970
- Two, three.
- She will jump.

1968
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,570
- Go.
- Jump to the center.

1969
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:54,280
Come on. Jump.

1970
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:55,510
Jump.

1971
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,340
What?

1972
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,180
- What?
- That's incredible.

1973
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,160
(How is that even possible?)

1974
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,090
- That's incredible.
- We are set.

1975
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:08,860
- No way.
- We are set.

1976
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,950
This is scarier.

1977
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:12,700
It's unbelievable.

1978
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:15,160
I forgot the path she took.

1979
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,890
- Right, right, right.
- You need to memorize the path.

1980
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,740
Shouldn't you go straight?

1981
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:21,760
I don't think
you should go diagonally.

1982
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,140
Will you go diagonally?

1983
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:24,700
Don't you think
you should go straight?

1984
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,300
No. I will go with my hunch.

1985
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:28,620
- I think you should go straight.
- Me too.

1986
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:30,450
- There she goes.
- One,

1987
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,720
two,

1988
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:33,820
- three.
- It will be insane if she succeeds.

1989
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:35,120
Then I will acknowledge her talent.

1990
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,360
You can take one step first.
You don't have to jump.

1991
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:41,160
- Do that.
- I want to poop.

1992
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,260
(I want to poop.)

1993
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,050
- Put your right foot on the block.
- Here I go.

1994
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:45,430
- Okay.
- I will jump...

1995
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:46,430
- and land on two feet.
- There you go.

1996
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:47,800
- That's good. Okay.
- Ji Hyo.

1997
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,930
It has to be wood.

1998
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,740
(What?)

1999
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,140
- Is it wood?
- No way!

2000
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,300
- She is insane.
- Hey.

2001
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,510
(The staff members are talking
among themselves.)

2002
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:03,570
- She is insane.
- Hey.

2003
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:04,640
Ji Hyo.

2004
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,390
- She is insane.
- That's insane.

2005
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,320
Do you know the answer?

2006
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:11,860
My hands are shaking.
I am so scared.

2007
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:14,120
- My goodness.
- I got goosebumps.

2008
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,660
- I am scared.
- What is up with Ji Hyo?

2009
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,120
- She is incredible.
- That's amazing.

2010
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,260
That's amazing.

2011
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:20,430
You are insane.

2012
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:21,530
(Team Minority reached the middle.)

2013
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:23,090
We look so shabby in comparison.

2014
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,410
What should we do?

2015
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:28,110
Ji Hyo got four blocks right.

2016
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:32,950
(But she still has
a long way to go.)

2017
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,610
Don't you think
you should go straight?

2018
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:36,470
- Leave her be.
- Shall I leave her be?

2019
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:37,570
She has a good hunch.

2020
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:39,240
It's a gift from the above.

2021
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,390
Mom.

2022
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,120
I miss my mom.

2023
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,260
(What will be Ji Hyo's choice
this time?)

2024
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,450
I miss my mom.

2025
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:45,720
(Missing her mom in Mapo-gu,)

2026
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,390
(she chooses
to go diagonally again!)

2027
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:48,450
Let's go.

2028
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,090
(She chose to go diagonally
4 times in a row!)

2029
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:51,860
My entire body is shaking.

2030
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:53,220
- Here I go.
- Okay.

2031
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,390
(Please!)

2032
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:58,700
Oh, no.

2033
01:04:58,700 --> 01:04:59,910
She startled me.

2034
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,510
- Oh, no.
- She startled me.

2035
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:03,510
She startled me.

2036
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:05,030
I was so startled.

2037
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,050
Her legs gave out.

2038
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:08,820
Do it like you did before.

2039
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,950
Take a step
before you jump with both feet.

2040
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,620
I will take a step
before I jump with both feet.

2041
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,680
- Don't land hard on one foot.
- Okay.

2042
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,720
- All right.
- Do it with both feet.

2043
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,660
Three, two, one.

2044
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:18,680
Go.

2045
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:24,120
(She survived 5 consecutive blocks!)

2046
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:27,700
(Their jaws drop.)

2047
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,030
She knows the answer.

2048
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:31,160
- Hey.
- Gosh.

2049
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,700
She knows the answer.

2050
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:34,760
- Hey.
- You are the doctor, right?

2051
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,610
- You are the doctor, right?
- Maybe she is the mastermind.

2052
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,030
- How is this possible?
- She must know the answer.

2053
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:39,550
(The entire group goes
into a frenzy.)

2054
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:41,050
You know the answer, right?

2055
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:43,070
- Do you know the answer?
- What is going on?

2056
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:44,910
- My hands are shaking.
- How is this possible?

2057
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:46,510
Do you know the answer?

2058
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,860
What's the mathematical probability?

2059
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,450
Forget it. You are doing great.

2060
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:51,950
It has to be really low.

2061
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:53,950
She chose correctly
five times in a row.

2062
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:56,700
Only six blocks remain.

2063
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,300
(Only 6 blocks remain.)

2064
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,570
- Gosh.
- Since there are six blocks left,

2065
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:00,700
we will be able to succeed.

2066
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:01,700
We got this.

2067
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,090
- We are safe.
- We got this.

2068
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:04,890
- We are safe.
- We will be able to succeed.

2069
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,110
- Are you memorizing the path?
- Of course.

2070
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:08,260
- Zigzag.
- Three and four.

2071
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,510
- Did I come from that block?
- Yes.

2072
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:12,300
- I came from that block.
- You moved diagonally.

2073
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,740
Will you move diagonally again?

2074
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,720
- Suit yourself.
- I think she should go straight.

2075
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,680
I don't think you should go zigzag.

2076
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,450
Do what you think is right.

2077
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:21,240
For how long
will the zigzag pattern continue?

2078
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,890
What will be Ji Hyo's choice?

2079
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,280
What will it be?

2080
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,820
I think you should go straight.

2081
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,220
- Will you go zigzag?
- I feel dizzy.

2082
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,700
- If she succeeds again...
- You have done so well already.

2083
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:32,160
Despite being in an opposing team,
I can't help but root for her.

2084
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:34,260
- I don't care about the teams.
- I hope she wins.

2085
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,390
Just do it.

2086
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:36,570
Reach the end, Ji Hyo.

2087
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:37,970
I can't watch this.

2088
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:40,010
Your intuition is incredible.

2089
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,510
I will take off 1 foot
and land on 2 feet.

2090
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:43,930
This makes no sense.

2091
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:45,870
In terms of probability...

2092
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:47,910
It will be okay even if I fall.

2093
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:49,050
One foot.

2094
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:50,780
(She is extremely nervous.)

2095
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,490
- Go, Ji Hyo.
- All right.

2096
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:54,410
- Don't land on the right foot only.
- Go.

2097
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:55,910
- Here...
- She will fall.

2098
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:56,910
- I go.
- Just go.

2099
01:06:57,950 --> 01:06:59,030
- I go.
- Just go.

2100
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:00,030
(She succeeded 6 times in a row!)

2101
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:02,120
- That's amazing!
- No way.

2102
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,660
How is this possible?

2103
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,530
- That's amazing!
- That's impossible.

2104
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:07,490
- No way.
- How is this possible?

2105
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:08,760
How is this possible?

2106
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,030
- No way.
- It feels staged.

2107
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,890
- You know the answer, right?
- Unbelievable.

2108
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:13,340
Maybe she is just light.

2109
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,610
- This is unbelievable.
- Maybe she is just light.

2110
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:17,780
- How is this possible?
- This is insane.

2111
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:18,870
Gosh.

2112
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,010
Even I am getting nervous.

2113
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:22,910
Her intuition is incredible.

2114
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:26,090
Ji Hyo, you would survive
"Squid Game".

2115
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,910
Shall we have Team Majority
go first?

2116
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,010
- Yes.
- Let's do that.

2117
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:30,890
- Give it a try.
- You can resume afterward.

2118
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:31,950
Okay.

2119
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:33,030
Sit down.

2120
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,530
Sit down, Ji Hyo.

2121
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:35,930
Ji Hyo, I respect you.

2122
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:37,030
Now,

2123
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:39,370
- will Yeji go next?
- I will die anyway.

2124
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:40,590
You will survive.

2125
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:41,870
Go to the left.

2126
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,260
- I studied the blocks.
- Yeji.

2127
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,470
It's Yeji's turn.

2128
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:47,070
- Yeji, you should...
- I think...

2129
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:48,340
it's this block.

2130
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:50,200
- Go with your hunch.
- Hold on.

2131
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,340
The blocks don't look different.

2132
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,240
You need to go with your hunch.

2133
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:58,140
You can't tell by looking.

2134
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,590
This one.

2135
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:00,990
- All right.
- Okay. Go.

2136
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:02,490
- I don't think it's a bad choice.
- Jump gently.

2137
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:04,120
- Shall we do a countdown?
- One.

2138
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,490
Three,

2139
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:07,780
two,

2140
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:09,700
one. Go.

2141
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,390
(Flapping)

2142
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:15,430
Are you okay?

2143
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:16,930
- That was funny.
- Why can't I jump?

2144
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,390
- It's hard, right?
- Is it that scary?

2145
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:19,740
I am okay.

2146
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,910
- I understand how it feels.
- Me too.

2147
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:22,930
It's okay.

2148
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:25,200
Yeji.

2149
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,050
I am sorry, but are you a spirit?

2150
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,700
- You keep...
- He is someone who passed away.

2151
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,640
- Can you see me?
- This one.

2152
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:32,390
- I will go.
- Okay.

2153
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:34,410
- Three, two...
- Jump at once.

2154
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,360
- Don't hesitate.
- You will get hurt if you do.

2155
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:38,050
- Two, one.
- Jump at once.

2156
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,790
Go.

2157
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:45,590
(She got the styrofoam board.)

2158
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,220
(Laughing)

2159
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:50,040
- My goodness.
- We have no hope.

2160
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:52,000
- Should I go back?
- Yes.

2161
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,040
We have no hope.

2162
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:54,240
I guess I am bad at this.

2163
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:55,370
- MC Minzy.
- Look at that.

2164
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:57,110
The board will completely shatter
if I stand on the top.

2165
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:58,780
- Oh, no.
- It's impossible to tell.

2166
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:00,300
Shall we have another member go?

2167
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:01,500
Have another member go.

2168
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:02,840
- Ji Hyo is incredible.
- Two more members should go.

2169
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:03,950
MC Minzy.

2170
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:05,620
- MC Minzy, let's go.
- MC Minzy.

2171
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:07,320
- Let's go.
- I think I am going to die.

2172
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,860
I can't do this.

2173
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:10,460
Come on. Don't be like that.

2174
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:12,330
Do you want Luda to go?

2175
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,550
Would that be okay?

2176
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,490
- Haha should go.
- Go ahead, Haha.

2177
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:17,030
- I don't think I can do this.
- Hurry up, Haha.

2178
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:18,290
So Min is the next in order.

2179
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:21,330
Gosh, the older members...

2180
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:22,890
- don't act their age.
- Go.

2181
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:24,090
- Gosh.
- Go.

2182
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:25,570
- Haha is the same.
- Go, So Min.

2183
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,070
So Min.

2184
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:30,380
- So Min, you are really cool.
- Let's win. You are cool.

2185
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,500
- Hey.
- So Min.

2186
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,470
You won't jump
into the hole, will you?

2187
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:35,080
That will be funny.

2188
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:36,750
Good luck.

2189
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,450
- You can do it.
- Are you a spirit?

2190
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:39,540
Can you see me?

2191
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,680
So Min, go.

2192
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,040
- Good luck.
- Was it really scary?

2193
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:43,710
Once you sink,

2194
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:45,630
you think, "This is it."
But the moment...

2195
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:47,380
- The moment you jump.
- The moment you jump,

2196
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:49,330
- your heart sink.
- Really?

2197
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,030
But it's okay. It isn't that bad.

2198
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,700
You were brave.

2199
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:55,960
- So Min, go.
- We will root for you.

2200
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,590
- This is really scary.
- So Min, go.

2201
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,930
(So Min is
Team Majority's third player.)

2202
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:04,280
I think...

2203
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:06,540
the dirtier board is wood.

2204
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:08,780
- This one. I will go straight.
- Okay.

2205
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,170
You should definitely go straight.

2206
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,320
The earlier pattern was zigzag,
so you should go straight.

2207
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:13,820
So Min is incredible.

2208
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:15,120
So Min, shall I count down?

2209
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:16,750
- No. Don't do it.
- Okay.

2210
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:19,530
Let's beat the other team.

2211
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,680
- Your form is nice.
- What am I going to do?

2212
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,090
I am Super So Min!

2213
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:26,720
- Okay.
- That's good.

2214
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:28,460
Let's fly!

2215
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,930
- Get ready for the fall.
- You can do it.

2216
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:31,700
- I am ready.
- Let's go.

2217
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,170
One.

2218
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:34,800
I won't get startled.

2219
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,210
It's the sound that startles people.

2220
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:37,610
Drum roll.

2221
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:39,410
- I think you chose correctly.
- Really?

2222
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:40,640
- One, two, three.
- Three, two, one.

2223
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,750
(Will So Min give
the first success to the team?)

2224
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,420
That's it.

2225
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,750
(She got the styrofoam board.)

2226
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:47,790
What was up with that face?

2227
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:49,680
She closed her eyes and fell.

2228
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,880
What should we do?

2229
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:52,790
The pattern continues to be zigzag.

2230
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,160
(Team Majority failed
3 times in a row.)

2231
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:56,290
It was completely fine.

2232
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,530
But...

2233
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:58,630
- It was completely fine, right?
- Yes.

2234
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:00,760
- Next.
- How did I fail in one go?

2235
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,500
- Team Majority.
- MC Minzy.

2236
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:03,700
- MC Minzy, let's go.
- How did I fail in one go?

2237
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:04,870
I can't do this.

2238
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:06,910
Let's go up to Ji Hyo.

2239
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:08,210
- MC Minzy.
- I feel like...

2240
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:10,110
- I am going to poop.
- It's nothing.

2241
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:11,410
Do you want to go after Luda?

2242
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:12,500
Shall I go next?

2243
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:14,640
- Ji Hyo will go next.
- She can jump right away.

2244
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,080
Really? Thank goodness.

2245
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,880
- You will go sooner or later.
- My goodness.

2246
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:22,250
Ji Hyo, you have already done
an incredible job.

2247
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,180
Seriously.

2248
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,250
(She got 6 answers in a row.)

2249
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:28,790
Ji Hyo, you really are
extraordinary.

2250
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,890
(The probability of Ji Hyo's path)

2251
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,090
She chose correctly.

2252
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:39,910
- It's wood.
- No way.

2253
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:45,000
- How is this possible?
- She must know the answer.

2254
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:46,750
- Here I go.
- Just go.

2255
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:53,010
(Ji Hyo achieved
the probability of 1.5 percent.)

2256
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:54,450
I came from this block, right?

2257
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,550
- Yes. You did.
- I came from this block, right?

2258
01:11:57,790 --> 01:11:59,330
There have been five blocks
in a zigzag pattern.

2259
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:01,420
Three straight blocks
and five zigzag blocks.

2260
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:03,220
Don't you think
you should go straight this time?

2261
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:05,760
Had there been someone like you
in "Squid Game",

2262
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,890
about 20 people would have survived.

2263
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:11,000
- She is so cool.
- I would get confused.

2264
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,610
- She won't succeed again.
- That's right.

2265
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,740
- Will you go zigzag again?
- Will you go zigzag again?

2266
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:15,800
(She chose the diagonal block
6 times in a row!)

2267
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,930
She will do it again. Okay.

2268
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:17,930
- Go.
- Do what you want.

2269
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:19,840
- I will go zigzag.
- Okay.

2270
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,140
- We kept getting it wrong.
- That way,

2271
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,640
- we will see the pattern.
- That's right.

2272
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,710
- We kept getting it wrong.
- Two, three.

2273
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:26,380
One, two, three. Go.

2274
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,510
(The probability will be 0.7 percent
if she succeeds again.)

2275
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,680
I will take off 1 foot
and land on 2 feet.

2276
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,010
That's right. 1, 2...

2277
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,050
(She will compete
for the 0.7-percent probability.)

2278
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,750
Will she get it right again?

2279
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:37,860
- I think she will.
- She got it right.

2280
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:38,960
She knows what to do.

2281
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:40,530
(What will be the result
of her 7th jump?)

2282
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:42,290
One, two, three. Go.

2283
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:43,930
Just go.

2284
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,170
This makes no sense.

2285
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:51,040
(She achieved
the 0.7-percent probability.)

2286
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:53,300
(Unbelievable)

2287
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:54,970
(This makes no sense.)

2288
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,880
- Gosh.
- You know the answer, right?

2289
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,710
- This is impossible.
- How...

2290
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,080
- Hey.
- How is this possible?

2291
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,490
- This makes no sense.
- Seriously.

2292
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:02,680
- It's insane.
- This makes no sense.

2293
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,580
(The production crew's
point of view)

2294
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,330
(Oh!)

2295
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:07,580
(My goodness!)

2296
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:08,830
(For goodness' sake.)

2297
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:10,220
(The production crew
became confused.)

2298
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,390
- How...
- I think...

2299
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:12,720
- she is a glass specialist.
- How is this possible?

2300
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,000
- This makes no sense.
- Seriously.

2301
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,130
- I think she knows the pattern.
- Is she a spy?

2302
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:17,890
- She is just that good at it.
- Ji Hyo, just finish it.

2303
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:19,740
- Is she a spy?
- She is unbelievable.

2304
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,070
Will you go zigzag again?

2305
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:24,170
(Will she go zigzag again
for the 8th block?)

2306
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:26,640
(Perhaps it will give her
8 consecutive successes.)

2307
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,000
I am going to try it.

2308
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,880
- Okay. Try it.
- Go.

2309
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,820
Isn't she the second player?

2310
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:32,990
Her team will win.

2311
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,340
You never know. MC Minzy
might reach the finish line.

2312
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:36,880
She might make it happen.

2313
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:38,680
- We are riding on her coattails.
- Here I go.

2314
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,720
- Go.
- If I fail, it's the other one.

2315
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,830
- Can you cross three blocks?
- Okay.

2316
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:44,660
She is so cool.

2317
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:46,000
- "Can you cross three blocks?"
- She is incredible.

2318
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,460
- She is incredible.
- I know.

2319
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:48,700
(Team Minority has
three members left.)

2320
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,330
- She is cool.
- She is sexy.

2321
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:51,760
I will take off 1 foot
and land on 2 feet.

2322
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,760
- That's right.
- Okay.

2323
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,370
She is so cool.

2324
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:56,300
She is incredible.

2325
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,380
How did she do that?

2326
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:01,250
(Will Ji Hyo succeed
8 times in a row?)

2327
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:14,920
- Gosh.
- It's okay.

2328
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:17,660
- Gosh.
- It's okay.

2329
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:18,680
Good job.

2330
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,790
Are you okay?

2331
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:21,750
- Ji Hyo.
- She did so well.

2332
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,890
- You are amazing.
- It's the other block.

2333
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:24,960
- Okay.
- Okay.

2334
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,030
Thank you.

2335
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:27,500
- Seriously.
- We are set.

2336
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,060
You are incredible.

2337
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,090
- You got this, right?
- Okay.

2338
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:33,670
She is cool.

2339
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,580
- What should I do?
- Team Minority...

2340
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:37,930
will succeed
unless everyone fails at once.

2341
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:39,080
That's right.

2342
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,840
If everyone fails at once,
you won't succeed.

2343
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,250
This is hard.

2344
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:44,640
If two people fail,
you need to get the last one right.

2345
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:46,210
- Really?
- Right?

2346
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,620
- I need to get one right.
- That's right.

2347
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,490
- I need to get one right.
- You are nervous.

2348
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:50,790
You are nervous.

2349
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:53,220
I need to get 1 right.
The 2 of you...

2350
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:54,720
- should do well.
- Someone needs to succeed.

2351
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:57,630
- Our team needs a hero.
- MC Minzy.

2352
01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:59,130
- Our team needs a hero.
- Let's go.

2353
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:00,220
I am going to die.

2354
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:01,890
Here comes the hero of the team.

2355
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:03,430
I want to poop.

2356
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,630
I understand.

2357
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:06,500
It's scary.

2358
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:08,600
Which way should I go?

2359
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,040
It's that block after this block.

2360
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,880
- What?
- You know the 1st 3 blocks.

2361
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,450
- That's right.
- Go zigzag three times.

2362
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:15,880
Then you choose a block.

2363
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:17,640
Let's hurry up.

2364
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:19,840
- Although she is an opponent...
- Gosh, Ji Hyo.

2365
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,550
- You are incredible.
- You are amazing.

2366
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:22,660
- You are amazing.
- You are so cool.

2367
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:24,810
Ji Hyo, give us a tip
if you have one.

2368
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:26,380
- Sit here.
- Sit comfortably.

2369
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:27,550
Sit comfortably.

2370
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,550
What will become of our lives?

2371
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:32,390
She is incredible.

2372
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:34,700
It's so nerve-racking.

2373
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,170
- My goodness.
- I know.

2374
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:39,060
Let's go.

2375
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,800
- Go.
- Those blocks are safe.

2376
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,280
- They are wood.
- They are wood.

2377
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,210
I want to see
how it would feel when I jump.

2378
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,840
They are wood.
You can just walk past them.

2379
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,340
They might break
because of my body weight.

2380
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:50,340
It's okay.

2381
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:52,290
Get yourself on the block
and jump on the spot.

2382
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:53,420
The wooden blocks can support
up to two tonnes.

2383
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,180
- That's right.
- So this is what it feels like.

2384
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:58,680
- It's okay.
- Jump to the center.

2385
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:00,160
- You won't die.
- That's right.

2386
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,250
Why is it scary
to move to that block?

2387
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:04,460
- It's okay. For goodness' sake.
- Gosh.

2388
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:06,830
- I hate games like this.
- It's okay.

2389
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:08,740
You know how scared I get
of such games.

2390
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:10,200
What are you saying?

2391
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,100
It's no wonder
they wanted me for this date.

2392
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,460
Why are you babbling?

2393
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:15,970
- I can't do this.
- What are you saying?

2394
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:17,040
What are you saying?

2395
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,670
They said it would be
the most comfortable and easy.

2396
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:20,470
Who are you talking to?

2397
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:22,250
I would rather take a punch
to the face.

2398
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:24,580
- What do you want us to do?
- We could push you.

2399
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,950
I am the most scared of this game.
I want to poop.

2400
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:28,290
MC Minzy, we could push you.

2401
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:29,680
It will be funny if you poop.

2402
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,310
That block is safe. Just go.

2403
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:33,990
I just want to know
how it would feel.

2404
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:35,630
I know it's safe. I am not a fool.

2405
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:37,130
MC Minzy, it's time to choose.

2406
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,130
Look.

2407
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,800
Three blocks made a zigzag pattern.

2408
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,060
Will you go zigzag again?

2409
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:44,960
- Go zigzag again.
- Will you go zigzag again?

2410
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,910
- Trust me.
- Go.

2411
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,600
- For goodness' sake.
- Go zigzag.

2412
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,340
- MC Minzy. Go zigzag.
- Go.

2413
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,470
- For goodness' sake.
- MC Minzy.

2414
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:53,600
Succeed three times.

2415
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,380
- Go diagonally.
- I am bad at things like this.

2416
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,640
- MC Minzy, just jump.
- Succeed three times.

2417
01:16:57,970 --> 01:16:59,510
- Go diagonally.
- Put your hands together.

2418
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:00,920
- Put your hands together.
- Go diagonally.

2419
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,090
Lovely MC Minzy.

2420
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,550
- I know.
- Put your hands together.

2421
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:04,790
We are worried about you.

2422
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:06,030
I will put my hands together.
Don't rush me.

2423
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:07,090
We only reminded you
because you didn't do it.

2424
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:09,160
- MC Minzy, just jump.
- Go.

2425
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,700
- Go.
- Jump.

2426
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,220
- Will you go straight?
- That's cute.

2427
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:13,560
- Three, two.
- Jump.

2428
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,370
- Go.
- Jump.

2429
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:18,240
- Go.
- Go.

2430
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,540
- Go.
- Gosh!

2431
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:23,670
The TV ratings will fall!

2432
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:26,140
- I am sorry.
- People will switch the channel.

2433
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:27,470
MC Minzy.

2434
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:29,010
- "I am sorry."
- For goodness' sake.

2435
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:30,880
- Be quiet.
- Jump.

2436
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,180
Hold on. Gosh.

2437
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:33,680
Just jump.

2438
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:35,960
- I can't say anything.
- I know.

2439
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:37,880
- Jump.
- Jump.

2440
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,220
- Go.
- Go.

2441
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:41,590
We will push you.

2442
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:42,800
- Go.
- Go.

2443
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,750
Don't push me!

2444
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,090
(MC Minzy is filming a monodrama.)

2445
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:47,090
All right.

2446
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,930
Say "I Say Woo!" and jump.

2447
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:52,170
Hurry up and go.

2448
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:54,670
- "I Say Woo!"
- Woo!

2449
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,170
(Thanks to the cheer,
he decides to go straight.)

2450
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:59,140
- "I Say Woo!"
- Go diagonally.

2451
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:01,000
No. Go diagonally.

2452
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,340
I think I should go straight.

2453
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,920
- "I Say Woo!"
- "I Say Woo!"

2454
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,920
(The "I Say Woo!" choir
cheers for him endlessly.)

2455
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:09,620
- "I Say Woo!"
- "I Say Woo!"

2456
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:10,680
Here I go.

2457
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:13,750
Go, MC Minzy, go.

2458
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:15,420
MC Minzy, go.

2459
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,160
You can do it.

2460
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,330
(He checks the bottom and jumps.)

2461
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:22,700
(Breaking)

2462
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:23,960
- Gosh.
- I told you...

2463
01:18:24,336 --> 01:18:24,960
(The styrofoam board shatters.)

2464
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:27,060
I told you to go diagonally.

2465
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:28,540
I said it was this block.

2466
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,040
I told you many times
to go diagonally.

2467
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,670
Everyone told you to go diagonally.

2468
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,140
I was going to go diagonally.

2469
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,000
But Suk Jin stopped me.

2470
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,010
- I told you to go diagonally.
- Seriously.

2471
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:38,680
- They are fighting.
- I told you many times.

2472
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,990
- What did I tell you?
- He told you to go diagonally.

2473
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:41,680
- He did tell you that.
- I told you that...

2474
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,710
- about 13 times.
- All right.

2475
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:46,250
It's over.

2476
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:47,880
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

2477
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:49,830
- Gosh.
- Do you feel relieved?

2478
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:51,500
I feel like I am going to die.
But I do feel relieved.

2479
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,670
It's our turn.

2480
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:54,920
BIBI.

2481
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,630
- You didn't forget, did you?
- No.

2482
01:18:56,870 --> 01:19:00,340
- Be careful!
- That's not the right block!

2483
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:01,500
- You startled me.
- You startled me.

2484
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,580
Hey.

2485
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,500
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

2486
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,840
(Walking forward)

2487
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,210
- Does she know the path?
- Go slowly.

2488
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:12,680
- Gosh, she is...
- She doesn't hesitate.

2489
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:13,840
Youngsters these days.

2490
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,790
There you go.

2491
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:17,180
(This youngster
seems to be enjoying herself.)

2492
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:18,350
There you go.

2493
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,220
- There you go.
- There you go.

2494
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,500
- There you go.
- There you go.

2495
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,250
- Go straight.
- Now comes the choice.

2496
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:25,700
(Three blocks remain.)

2497
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:29,870
One member needs to succeed.

2498
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,170
We will be safe
once one member succeeds.

2499
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:33,670
- Just succeed once.
- I will go this way.

2500
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:35,540
- If she fails and I fail,
- Okay.

2501
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:36,600
- it will be bad.
- Here I go.

2502
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,930
- Will you go diagonally?
- Hold on.

2503
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:40,300
Here I go.

2504
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,300
- Will you go diagonally?
- Hold on.

2505
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,580
(She jumps without missing a beat.)

2506
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:44,080
Things just got complicated.

2507
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,620
- It's scary.
- Things will get complicated.

2508
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:47,180
- This looks bad.
- This is a headache. Is it my turn?

2509
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,290
- It's okay.
- You can do this.

2510
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:50,490
Luda, with your good hunch...

2511
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:51,850
- Wish me luck.
- Finish this game...

2512
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:53,180
- and be the star.
- What do I do?

2513
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:55,890
We've lost four members in a row.

2514
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:56,890
(It's interesting that the 4 members
got eliminated in a row.)

2515
01:19:56,890 --> 01:19:58,960
- Do you have Luda and Haha?
- Yes.

2516
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:00,800
Luda, you have to finish this.

2517
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,800
(All they have after Luda
is Haha who's terrified.)

2518
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,500
Luda, you're so cool.

2519
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:05,430
Luda, please finish this for me.

2520
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:06,430
All right. Go.

2521
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:08,970
- We've moved only six spaces.
- My gosh.

2522
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,430
- Here I go.
- Okay.

2523
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:12,450
(Luda decided to go diagonally.)

2524
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:14,170
- Go.
- This is scary.

2525
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:16,780
Three, two, one. Jump!

2526
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:19,140
(What's Luda's destiny?)

2527
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:20,210
Jump!

2528
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,510
(Screaming)

2529
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:24,750
(It's the styrofoam again.)

2530
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:25,880
My goodness.

2531
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:28,330
- Oh no.
- What do we do?

2532
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:30,420
- Team Majority...
- I told Jun Ha to go left.

2533
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,560
- I know.
- You have to finish this.

2534
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,870
No one on this team
got to move forward.

2535
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:36,090
- We have one member left.
- What do we do now?

2536
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:37,560
I believe Haha will finish it.

2537
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,960
- Se Chan, do you know that?
- Se Chan, do you remember?

2538
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,930
I will watch you.

2539
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,800
- One more.
- That's right.

2540
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,950
- Go zigzag. Right.
- That's right.

2541
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:47,210
- And...
- No.

2542
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,470
- Go straight.
- Move two spaces straight.

2543
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:51,250
They are almost there.

2544
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:52,790
(If Se Chan gets one space right,
his team will cross the bridge.)

2545
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:54,750
- Go.
- Just give it a try.

2546
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:55,750
Go.

2547
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,030
(Sighing)

2548
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:01,130
Watch it carefully, Se Chan.

2549
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:02,800
I'll do it like Jiangshi.

2550
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,700
- I'll just leap forward...
- Okay.

2551
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,060
- and finish it.
- All right.

2552
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,060
I will just keep leaping
without talking.

2553
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:09,060
- Go.
- He's being talkative.

2554
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,430
- Please finish it.
- He's talking a lot.

2555
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:11,760
Here I go. This is hard, right?

2556
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:13,800
Go on one more space.

2557
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,800
Go.

2558
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:16,600
- Is that right?
- He seems nervous.

2559
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,670
Just go. Go!

2560
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:21,750
- My goodness.
- What was that?

2561
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,050
(It's supposed to be wood,
but it broke.)

2562
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:26,420
- It broke.
- That's...

2563
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:28,850
What's this? This is safe.

2564
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:30,750
My goodness.

2565
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,590
- You should be careful.
- What's going on?

2566
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:33,590
Be careful.

2567
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:35,800
- This is safe.
- If I tried, it would've caved in.

2568
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,250
- I think so.
- My goodness.

2569
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:39,170
The styrofoam on top broke.

2570
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:40,800
I almost got killed.

2571
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,090
- Be careful.
- If it was me,

2572
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:43,870
- I would've been eliminated.
- I can't do this.

2573
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:45,760
- Watch out.
- I'm scared.

2574
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,210
- There's wood, right?
- Yes.

2575
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,100
I'm scared now.

2576
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:51,470
He can't do this.

2577
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:52,470
Just go.

2578
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:54,840
Se Chan, don't walk on tiptoe.

2579
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:56,080
- All right.
- Don't jump too hard.

2580
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,310
Se Chan might finish it.

2581
01:21:57,380 --> 01:21:58,380
Right.

2582
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,950
If I fall down here,
you'll be in trouble.

2583
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:02,310
- Right.
- Here I go.

2584
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:03,960
- I'm going.
- You can do this.

2585
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,160
One, two, and three.

2586
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:07,290
(Groaning)

2587
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:10,200
(Yang Se Chan is eliminated.)

2588
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:12,200
- He fell.
- Oh no.

2589
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,800
Haha, we still have a chance to win.

2590
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,200
What is he going to do?

2591
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:17,260
Is it over for us?

2592
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:18,260
Do we have Haha left?

2593
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,260
- Jong Kook.
- Should I go first? Not Haha?

2594
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:22,500
(Jong Kook
of Team Minority goes first.)

2595
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,000
Go three spaces straight.

2596
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,840
- Go diagonally.
- Diagonal.

2597
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,080
(The last player to decide
the team's fate is Jong Kook.)

2598
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,920
- Go diagonally.
- Go zigzag.

2599
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,550
- One more.
- Zigzag.

2600
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:33,090
How did we make it that far?

2601
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:35,880
- If he fails here, is it over?
- Yes.

2602
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:38,250
- Jong Kook, just go.
- I have no idea.

2603
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:40,130
I have no idea.

2604
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:42,850
- You can't tell, right?
- No, I can't.

2605
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,050
- Go?
- Go.

2606
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:46,060
- Here I go.
- It's no big deal.

2607
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:47,700
We've come a long way.

2608
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:48,870
- We're going to win.
- We will win anyway, right?

2609
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:50,060
Yes. Don't worry.

2610
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:52,370
Here I go. One, two, and three.

2611
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:55,500
(The last jump
for Team Minority's destiny)

2612
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Here I go. One, two...

2613
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,410
(Despite the slim chance,)

2614
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:03,140
(will they manage
to cross the bridge?)

2615
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:05,590
Three.

2616
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:09,290
(They succeeded
in crossing the bridge.)

2617
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:11,960
(Nice!)

2618
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,130
You did it, Jong Kook!

2619
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:15,590
He survived!

2620
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:16,660
(He survived!)

2621
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:20,260
(Thanks to Ji Hyo's superb play,
Team Minority crossed the bridge.)

2622
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:24,390
(But Team Majority has
the hero of Mapo-gu, Haha.)

2623
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:26,170
Go zigzag and straight.

2624
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,600
(But he didn't move
even one space forward.)

2625
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,410
(Screaming)

2626
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:33,970
Dream! I jumped!

2627
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:37,120
Dream! Your dad did it.
I died, but I did it.

2628
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:39,990
We didn't move...

2629
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:41,790
- even one space forward.
- Dream, I did it!

2630
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:45,090
None of you moved one space forward.

2631
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:46,750
Not even one space.

2632
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:49,500
So all the members
of Team Majority failed the mission.

2633
01:23:49,890 --> 01:23:51,130
Team Minority wins.

2634
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:52,200
(Team Minority's
overwhelming victory)

2635
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,870
The winning team
gets 100 points each.

2636
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:58,430
And you got additional points
for the spaces you moved.

2637
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:00,710
If that's the case, Ji Hyo is...

2638
01:24:00,710 --> 01:24:01,910
You're right.

2639
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:03,710
Let's check the rankings then.

2640
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,210
- Let's check it.
- The rankings?

2641
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:06,840
What? Is my ranking high?

2642
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,050
- What? I'm in fourth place.
- Is this the final?

2643
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:09,310
Yes. They are the final rankings.

2644
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:11,210
- Why am I in fourth place?
- I'm in the first place?

2645
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:12,210
Why is that?

2646
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,380
BIBI and I are in seventh place.

2647
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:15,510
What?

2648
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:16,590
Am I in third place?

2649
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:17,960
- Jun Ha was...
- Why?

2650
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,250
Oh, that one.

2651
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:21,160
- He did well at the beginning.
- That's why I'm in the first place.

2652
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,300
- We won the first game.
- Right.

2653
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:25,390
I'm at the bottom.

2654
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,170
All right.

2655
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,500
The rank I pick and higher
will be winners.

2656
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,300
- Okay.
- The rest of them will get a penalty.

2657
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,300
I have little chance of winning.

2658
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,760
- The rest of us will get a penalty?
- Yes.

2659
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:36,080
I'll be fine.

2660
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,710
- Pick 8.
- It'll be funny if he picks 7.

2661
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:39,000
- Pick eight.
- All right.

2662
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,170
Is there number one in it?

2663
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:41,580
Pick four.

2664
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:43,780
He picked eight earlier,
so we had lunch...

2665
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:45,420
- Why are you smiling?
- We ate Chinese...

2666
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:46,840
- I'm nervous.
- What?

2667
01:24:47,010 --> 01:24:49,960
The number I show you
and above will survive.

2668
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:52,420
- Four?
- One...

2669
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,490
What's a common number?
Is it 5 or 4?

2670
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:55,850
- It's 5.
- It's 8.

2671
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:58,220
- It's eight!
- That's amazing.

2672
01:24:58,250 --> 01:24:59,300
There's no number eight.

2673
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:00,890
- Numbers 1 to 7 survived.
- From 1 to 7?

2674
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:02,700
Numbers 9 to 11 will get a penalty.

2675
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:07,410
(Yeji, So Min, and Luda
will get a penalty.)

2676
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:08,540
It's So Min again.

2677
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:10,300
- BIBI, we've survived!
- I know.

2678
01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:13,500
- Gosh, this is unbelievable.
- My goodness.

2679
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:16,710
I'll reveal the penalty.

2680
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:19,790
You should know that
this is product placement.

2681
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:21,050
What is it?

2682
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:23,310
- Product placement?
- Only top stars can do it.

2683
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:24,420
(The idol artists and So Min are
specialized in product placement.)

2684
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:28,490
You'll dance to our guests' songs
in costumes for one minute.

2685
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,420
- Really?
- That's a lot of work.

2686
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:31,500
It's so annoying.

2687
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:32,870
- Costumes?
- That sounds really annoying.

2688
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:34,030
That sounds like a lot of work.

2689
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:37,800
But this is
what Yeji and Luda are good at.

2690
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,960
So Min, you're lucky.

2691
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,260
And that's what you like.

2692
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,540
This is pretty.

2693
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,600
(Today's costumes are glittering
jackets and colorful wigs.)

2694
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,910
Should we look at the camera?

2695
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:48,210
(It's a new 3-member girl group.)

2696
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,580
(There's a member who learns
dance moves from her colleagues.)

2697
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:54,490
(She's got the moves
from the 1980s.)

2698
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:56,120
Let's begin then.

2699
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:57,750
- Okay.
- Music please.

2700
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:58,750
(Today's penalty is dancing
to the guests' songs for 1 minute.)

2701
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:00,880
(Music cue)

2702
01:26:03,390 --> 01:26:06,090
(The new 3-member girl group
is busy showing off their charms.)

2703
01:26:07,090 --> 01:26:10,040
(The music changes to WJSN's song.)

2704
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:16,130
(The 3-member girl group's cheerful
debut performance is over.)

2705
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,300
All right.

2706
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,470
"I just like this moment."

2707
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:21,640
And...

2708
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:24,880
"I just like this moment."
and "I like everything."

2709
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,510
"Running Man" and "Curly hair".

2710
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,250
(They are done posting the video.)

2711
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:30,510
- Thank you.
- Good work.

2712
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:31,750
Thank you.

2713
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:34,250
- Good work today.
- Thank you.

2714
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:35,330
(We thank MC Minzy, Luda, BIBI, and
Yeji for all the fun they gave us.)

2715
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:40,890
(A bleak mansion)

2716
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:43,390
Is it a nouveau riche?

2717
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:46,800
(Kim Joon Ho, 45 years old,
an unfortunate guy)

2718
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,500
(Since you're here,
I guess this is about a bet.)

2719
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:54,380
(The icon of misfortune, Joon Ho
wants to be the icon of promise.)

2720
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:58,380
(The debate of the 2022's
variety star candidates)

2721
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,210
(I'm about to become a parvenu.)

2722
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:02,090
(I think you'll be embroiled
in a big lawsuit.)

2723
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:04,210
(Is it even possible to cast them?)

2724
01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:05,790
(Why are you asking me
about the casting?)

2725
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:06,880
(You should ask them!)

2726
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,160
(- This is my speaking time.
- I'm not listening.)

2727
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:11,750
(It's the variety star election
with candidates of all ages.)

2728
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:14,300
(The father of comedians,
Kim Joon Ho is joining the race.)
