1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,840
(The smell of fall is in the air
with a chilly wind.)

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,150
It's fall.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,480
- Hello.
<i>- In fall</i>

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,280
(Fall is more precious
because it's short.)

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,050
Fall is in the air.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,410
It's the season of the high sky
and plump horses.

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,720
But the trees are still green.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,020
- I know.
- You're right.

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,720
- They should turn red.
- It suddenly became cold.

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,130
- My gosh.
- How did it change so soon?

12
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,820
I was wearing shorts
only three days ago.

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,160
- I wore short-sleeved shirts.
- He's still wearing shorts.

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,930
(He wears shorts
even when it's cold.)

15
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,570
- Shorts?
- What's wrong with that?

16
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,540
At least he's wearing long-sleeved
shirts because he's old now.

17
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,170
- Why would you say that?
- Now that he is in his 40s...

18
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,470
- I'm wearing two shirts now.
- He wasn't like that before.

19
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,710
He wore short-sleeved shirts
until the end of October.

20
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,110
This is too soon.

21
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,000
Right.

22
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,650
By the way,

23
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,850
you two are standing together again.

24
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,510
Actually, that's what I thought...

25
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,150
as I was walking in here.

26
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,050
"I think I picked the wrong spot."

27
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,820
(He's standing
right next to Ji Hyo.)

28
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,720
- If that's what you thought...
- You're being self-conscious.

29
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,120
If you felt that way,

30
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,530
- you should've moved...
- No.

31
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,120
- to another spot like this.
- That would've been strange.

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,720
- This happens a lot.
- It's strange.

33
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,900
I came in a little late today.

34
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,430
And you guys came in all together.

35
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,900
Actually, it's going crazy.

36
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,540
Some people want...

37
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,630
to cast Jong Kook
in my favorite drama,

38
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,710
"Princess Hours."

39
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,680
- "Princess Hours?"
- Jong Kook is the protagonist.

40
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,850
And it features Eun Hye and Ji Hyo.

41
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,710
My goodness. What?

42
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,110
I'll be the casting director.

43
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,820
- Like "Yoo's Princess Hours."
- Right.

44
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,110
That's what I'd like to watch.

45
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,460
It will get high viewer ratings.

46
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,520
- Thank you.
- Will you be in the drama too?

47
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,460
What? No, I'll just watch it.

48
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,880
- As a viewer,
- You just like it.

49
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,550
I like the cast.

50
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,570
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo
will be in the drama.

51
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,690
- You should produce a movie.
- All right.

52
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,130
- A blockbuster movie.
- I should make one.

53
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,540
- You should make it.
- For sure.

54
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,040
We can do that on Running Man.

55
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,630
- It will be fun.
- No, don't do it.

56
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,470
- We can make a drama here.
- Just don't.

57
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,300
- We can do it on Running Man.
- Suk Jin,

58
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,350
you won't be in the drama anyway.

59
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,580
Why not?

60
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,580
You should be in the drama
as Gung Ye.

61
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,610
- Gung Ye?
- That would be fun.

62
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,050
- Gung Ye?
- As Jong Kook's spy.

63
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,990
- Ji Gung Ye.
- I can play Gung Ye.

64
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,430
Suk Jin, why don't you
change your hairstyle?

65
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,330
- Dye your hair.
- No.

66
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,990
- Why?
- It's always the same.

67
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,630
You know what? I've always wanted
to have dreadlocks.

68
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,620
Just do it. You can do it.

69
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,930
I want to try it at least once.

70
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,460
With your hair, you will get
only about three strands.

71
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,030
With your hair, you can make
only three strands of dreadlocks.

72
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,740
- Only three.
- Gosh, Suk Jin.

73
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,370
- How dare you...
- Why are you swearing?

74
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,300
- Three strands.
- I have thick hair.

75
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,900
Three dreadlocks.

76
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,080
Hey!

77
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,150
That's because dreadlocks are thick.

78
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,180
- My gosh.
- You...

79
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,450
He's right about that.

80
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,260
You will have to wear a queue.

81
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,780
I will try dreadlocks someday.

82
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,260
Give me a chance.

83
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,680
- Because Suk Jin...
- I'll do whatever I want.

84
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,620
Everything about Suk Jin is
fashionable except his hairstyle.

85
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,900
But his hairstyle is old-fashioned.

86
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,620
- This is just...
- He'd look good with bangs.

87
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,620
- Look.
- I have to go to a beauty shop.

88
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,860
This hairstyle is optimal
for Suk Jin's gesture.

89
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,900
How would he have
a different hairstyle?

90
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,740
This is what Suk Jin does
all the time.

91
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,370
- Let your hair grow longer.
- This is funny.

92
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,180
As you can see,

93
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,480
we will shoot today's episode
in a big mansion.

94
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,210
- This is cool.
- What is this building?

95
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,920
I didn't know there was
a place like this in Myeong-dong.

96
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,810
The owner of this mansion
invited you here.

97
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,810
- The owner?
- Who is it?

98
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,610
Please bring in
the owner of this mansion.

99
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,760
Is there someone?

100
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,200
(The owner is dressed
in flashy silver tails.)

101
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,430
(The frivolous fingers show
the dignity of the mansion owner.)

102
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,360
It must be someone rich.

103
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,640
Who is it? Are we having an actor?

104
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,180
(They burst into cheers...)

105
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,650
(and laughter.)

106
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,240
(The owner of the mansion...)

107
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,020
My goodness.

108
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,990
(The owner of the mansion,
Kim Joon Ho)

109
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,650
Is it a nouveau riche?

110
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,260
He's a nouveau riche.

111
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,520
He's just a puppet.

112
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,330
- Isn't he a butler?
- Seriously.

113
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,930
- Hello?
- Isn't he a butler?

114
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:55,460
What? A dolphin is stuck
in the drain? Pull it out.

115
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,930
A dolphin in the drain?

116
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,170
- All right.
- A butler.

117
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,740
Let Yoo Jae Suk
host the birthday party.

118
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,930
Welcome to my house.

119
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,450
- Hey, come on.
- Nice to meet you.

120
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,580
Hey, come on. Come on down, Joon Ho.

121
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,180
Welcome to Charlie's house.

122
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,180
- Charlie's house? Is that his name?
- By the way...

123
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,490
Obviously,

124
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,150
he rented the suit.

125
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,610
Isn't that his suit?

126
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,990
- I've always wanted to meet you.
- Hello.

127
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,620
Joon Ho, isn't this
your first time on Running Man?

128
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,620
Yes, it is.

129
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,190
- Is he the only guest?
- Hello.

130
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,290
Is Joon Ho the only guest for today?

131
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,200
- Only one?
- He's not that popular.

132
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,420
Joon Ho, is there someone else?

133
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,630
Is someone else coming?

134
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,440
He's not popular enough
to be a sole guest.

135
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,030
Seriously, did he come alone?

136
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,440
- We had many different plans,
- And?

137
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,510
but it happened this way.

138
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,900
I guess things got messed up.

139
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,080
Seriously, am I the only guest?

140
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,250
- Why is that?
- Joon Ho.

141
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,880
Since you're here,
I guess this is about a bet.

142
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,340
Don't say that.

143
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,470
That's your thing.

144
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,690
- Stop it.
- Let's call it promise.

145
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,280
- Promise?
- He calls it promise.

146
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,520
The promise special.

147
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,890
(He decided to become
the icon of promise.)

148
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,580
We are going to have a race
at Kim Joon Ho's house today.

149
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,220
- And it will be an individual game.
- Really?

150
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,150
The winner will be decided by
the number of chocolates you have.

151
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,500
Now you will pick the chocolates
that you will start the race with.

152
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,770
Please bring in the bags.

153
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,330
- That's right.
- The numbers of chocolates...

154
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,230
You're not supposed to touch them.

155
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,250
The bags have different numbers
of chocolates...

156
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,400
from 20 to 6.

157
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,250
- That's what we do?
- The difference is too big.

158
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,410
You can't tell how many there are.

159
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,880
The one that looks small
might have many chocolates.

160
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,340
You can put your name
on a bag you want.

161
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,040
- Let's pick one each.
- Okay.

162
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,760
- Joon Ho, you go first.
- Me?

163
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,780
Charlie.

164
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,560
Joon Ho has a pretty nose.

165
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,580
- But he has grey nose hair.
- What?

166
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,260
You're right. He has grey nose hair.

167
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,500
His nose hair is grey.

168
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,000
Why is he pretending not to hear us?

169
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,370
- Am I supposed to pick one?
- He can't hear you.

170
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,700
- His nose hair is grey.
- Joon Ho.

171
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,940
Your nose hair is grey.

172
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,590
My nose hair? Is it sticking out?

173
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,010
- No, it's grey.
- It's grey over here.

174
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,370
Excuse me.

175
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,510
(He apologizes for his grey
nose hair like a gentleman.)

176
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,010
It's all right.

177
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,340
I'm serious. It's true.

178
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,750
I understand.

179
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,780
- Don't pull it out. You might die.
- It's all right.

180
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,620
My ears are turning red.

181
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,210
Your ears?

182
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,720
Your ears are red.

183
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,260
I'm sorry.

184
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,630
I don't care about the men though.

185
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,200
I have manners.

186
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,830
All right then.

187
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,370
Ji Hyo, you go next.

188
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,460
I'll be the last one.

189
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,370
- I want number two.
- All right.

190
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,570
- We will open the bags all at once.
- Okay.

191
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,400
- I want number two.
- I want number three.

192
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,080
- This one is heavy.
- Okay. Number seven.

193
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,330
- Cool.
- Okay.

194
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,810
- Open your bag and show us.
- Se Chan, what's your number?

195
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,020
It has 20 chocolates at most.

196
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,770
- How many...
- Number three!

197
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,120
- What? Why?
- Why?

198
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,780
(Jae Suk picked number 3.)

199
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,150
- Is it 20 pieces?
- Jae Suk picked 20 chocolates.

200
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,910
- Are these 20 pieces?
- Yes.

201
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,190
Number 3 has 20 chocolates.

202
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,280
I have quite a lot.

203
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,200
- It's 12.
- That's good.

204
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,870
I...

205
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,160
- It's 16.
- I have 16.

206
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,330
I have 18.

207
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,570
That's good.

208
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,590
I have ten.

209
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,010
- So Min has 10.
- I have 14.

210
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,030
I have only 8. I wanted number 2.

211
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,600
Why did I pick this? It's only six.

212
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,580
What's with me?
How is this possible?

213
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,910
- How many for Jae Suk? Is it 20?
- I have 20.

214
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,710
The penalty will be decided
by the number of chocolates.

215
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,150
So you should take
good care of them.

216
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,540
- I have only six.
- Okay.

217
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,980
Today,

218
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,850
you will have
the Mansion of Misfortune Race.

219
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,020
The owner of this mansion...

220
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,150
and the icon of misfortune,
Kim Joon Ho...

221
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,630
invited you guys over
to get good energy from Running Man.

222
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,640
You should share your good luck
with Joon Ho...

223
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,010
to help him make it into top ranks.

224
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,210
Are we supposed to help him?

225
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,640
It will be an individual game today.

226
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,100
Those who make it
into the top four will get prizes.

227
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,580
And Joon Ho's rank will decide
who will get the penalty.

228
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,910
(His rank will decide the number
of members to get the penalty.)

229
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,210
You should protect me.

230
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,150
If Joon Ho makes it
into the top four,

231
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,460
among the members
who are ranked below Joon Ho,

232
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,480
one person picked by Joon Ho
will get the penalty.

233
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,150
- One person?
- If Joon Ho is in the top four.

234
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,900
If Joon Ho is in third place,
he will pick one from number 4 to 8.

235
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,070
(Joon Ho will pick one
from number 4 to 8.)

236
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,500
If Joon Ho fails to make it
into the top four,

237
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,530
all the members ranked below Joon Ho
including him will get the penalty.

238
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,210
(The members ranked below Joon Ho
including him will get the penalty.)

239
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,880
If Joon Ho is in fifth place,
number 5 to 8 will get the penalty.

240
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,900
Okay, I get it.

241
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,150
If he's number 6, number 6, 7,
and 8 will get the penalty.

242
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,650
If he's number 7,
number 7 and 8 will get the penalty.

243
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,020
If he's number eight,
all of you will get the penalty.

244
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,020
- He shouldn't be number 8.
- We can't make him number 8.

245
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,040
He shouldn't be number eight.

246
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,350
It's the best
to make him number four.

247
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,320
So you should help Joon Ho...

248
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,350
while staying
in a higher rank than him.

249
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,020
As I said, the winner will be
decided by the number of chocolates.

250
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,330
You will get more chocolates
after each mission.

251
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,000
And after each mission,

252
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,790
you can get extra chocolates
by playing One or the Other.

253
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,030
That sounds good.

254
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,290
And we will reveal...

255
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,570
Joon Ho's rank after each mission.

256
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,880
Number 1 and 2 will get to know
their ranks as well.

257
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,140
(Number 1 and 2 will get to know
their ranks as well.)

258
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,100
You will go get changed
and start the first mission then.

259
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,770
- Okay.
- Yes!

260
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,270
(They will get changed
and move to the first venue.)

261
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,250
This place reeks of alcohol.

262
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,620
- Wine.
- This is pretty.

263
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,890
Joon Ho is very successful.

264
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,720
- I prepared this for you.
- The crew members prepared it.

265
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,280
- Gosh, Joon Ho.
- You're successful.

266
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,130
You look even worse
in a casual outfit.

267
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,450
(Laughing)

268
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,820
I thought you were
talking about the wine.

269
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,730
(He has a mysterious body
that looks horrible in any outfit.)

270
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,690
Joon Ho, you look even worse
in a casual outfit.

271
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,160
Joon Ho is...

272
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,340
sitting here like that,
but he's a CEO.

273
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,340
- We know.
- Really?

274
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,470
He's a CEO.

275
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,480
- You know what?
- With Dae Hee...

276
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,200
Other comedians respect him a lot.

277
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,980
- Right.
- He's like their godfather.

278
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,120
Totally.

279
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,650
He's the father of comedians.

280
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,780
- The beggar of comedians?
- No, not a beggar.

281
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,780
Stubborn?

282
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,450
- No, the father.
- I said the father.

283
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,520
The father of comedians.

284
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
I'm not a beggar.

285
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,130
He says the beggar of comedians.

286
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,050
- The father of comedians.
- The father of comedians.

287
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,400
- I'm embarrassed to say that.
- It's so cool.

288
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,230
Jae Suk is the father of comedians.

289
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,730
- No.
- He's the king.

290
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,770
The king?

291
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,270
- The king of comedians?
- The king of comedians?

292
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,560
- The king.
- The king of comedians.

293
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,610
He's the king.

294
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,800
He's Mr. Comedian.

295
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
Mr. Comedian.

296
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,880
- Just a comedian?
- What am I?

297
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,010
- What does that mean?
- Just a comedian.

298
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,300
(Just a comedian.)

299
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,700
- How dare you...
- Like Mr. Ji Suk Jin.

300
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,910
Hey, Mr. Comedian.

301
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,650
He's the father of comedians,
and he's the king of comedians.

302
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,650
Hey, Mr. Comedian.

303
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,950
(The famous comedians
are gathered together here.)

304
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,550
All right. I'll tell you
about the mission then.

305
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,420
In the first mission, you work with
your team to get more chocolates.

306
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,900
It's called Shout at the Same Time.

307
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,770
- I see.
- Shout at the Same Time.

308
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,660
- Shout at the Same Time.
- Show us how you say it.

309
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,640
- That's your thing.
- You should say it right.

310
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,470
Shout at the Same Time.

311
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,560
This is how Cho Hye Lyun says it.

312
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,430
She keeps saying
that I stole her catchphrase.

313
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,850
- But mine is different.
- Like how?

314
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,040
Shout at the Same Time.

315
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,120
It's different, isn't it?

316
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,180
It sounds different.

317
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,440
- He's good.
- That's really nice.

318
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,550
You will play it in teams of two.

319
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,890
A team of two members
will wear headsets...

320
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,820
and play Cry in Silence
for three minutes.

321
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,790
But this isn't a game
with general rules.

322
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,660
Each member gets different words.

323
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,700
So the two members will
explain different words.

324
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,840
It will be confusing
because you can't hear each other.

325
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,750
And the number of correct answers
you give will be your points.

326
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,910
Even in the same team, the one
who gets more correct answers...

327
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,410
will be ranked higher.

328
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,810
(The one who gets more correct
answers will be ranked higher.)

329
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,860
Let's say
your team took first place.

330
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,320
If you get more correct answers
than your partner,

331
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
you'll be ranked higher.

332
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
In my team.

333
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,400
So you're playing it as a team,

334
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,160
but you still need to get
more correct answers.

335
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,560
Joon Ho, explain the rules.

336
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,240
Joon Ho, explain the rules.

337
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,270
- How is it going?
- So...

338
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,570
- This is like "Family Arcade."
- Right. This is Cry in Silence.

339
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,980
So we should shout.

340
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,380
- Right. Like how?
- What do we shout?

341
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,300
There are rules.
They are a little complicated.

342
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,020
Well...

343
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,540
Joon Ho,
you weren't listening, were you?

344
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,650
No.

345
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,440
I don't know
what he's talking about.

346
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,280
You'll see once you play it.

347
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,780
- I have no idea.
- You'll...

348
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,020
You'll see once it begins.

349
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,020
Okay.

350
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,180
You should pick teams first.

351
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,500
To pick a team,

352
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,900
you will choose a partner you want
all at the same time.

353
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,000
Those who choose each other
will be ruled out.

354
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,160
- Okay.
- Pointing at each other.

355
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,400
Send a signal.

356
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,510
Are you two going to be a team?

357
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,530
No.

358
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,840
They won't do that.

359
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,240
It's not going to happen.

360
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,610
Ji Hyo.

361
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,040
- If you keep choosing her,
- Good.

362
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,770
- you might become her partner.
- Right.

363
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,480
- They might become a team.
- Sure.

364
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,620
Let's do this.

365
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,020
- All right.
- He seems to like it.

366
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,360
- Let's begin.
- One.

367
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,620
One, two, and three.

368
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,910
See?

369
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,020
It's done.

370
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,150
Those who are paired up
should be out.

371
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,050
All right. Joon Ho and me.

372
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,400
(Joon Ho and Jae Suk
are on the same team.)

373
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,660
(Suk Jin and So Min,
and Se Chan and Haha are paired up.)

374
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,770
Who's left?

375
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,320
Okay.

376
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,840
Okay.

377
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,530
- This is spontaneous.
- Okay.

378
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,510
All right.

379
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,430
- This is spontaneous.
- This is spontaneous.

380
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,570
Let's...

381
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,440
make things awkward.

382
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,150
- Okay.
- All right.

383
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,650
So Min and Suk Jin.

384
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,850
I can't hear anything.

385
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,410
This is what Suk Jin did today.

386
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,860
We talked about brand names earlier.

387
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,390
Se Chan said...

388
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,130
he liked to show
the brand names of his clothes.

389
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,920
- I like it.
- And Suk Jin said,

390
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,090
"Hey."

391
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,790
"That's what novices do."

392
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,790
"Those who don't know fashion
like to show brand names."

393
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,630
And look at his pants.

394
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,240
(His outfit is covered
with its brand name.)

395
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,870
- He's a novice.
- He knows nothing.

396
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,980
(He didn't hear it because
of the song "Ring Ding Dong.")

397
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,010
(Excited)

398
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,380
All right. You have three minutes.

399
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,980
Start.

400
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,020
- They get different words.
- What?

401
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,280
(The word Suk Jin explains
to So Min: Squid Game)

402
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,590
- It's a drama.
- It stinks.

403
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,120
(The word So Min explains
to Suk Jin: Stinky tofu)

404
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,220
- A drama.
- It stinks.

405
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,550
- A drama.
- No gesture.

406
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,860
- The smell.
- Squid.

407
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,920
Don't use your hands.

408
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,950
No gesture.

409
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,900
It's a drama. No?

410
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,970
No. You can only talk.

411
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,520
- It's a drama.
- Fold your hands behind your back.

412
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,660
- Square, triangle,
- Title?

413
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,790
and circle.

414
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,660
- They both should answer.
- It's a drama.

415
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,470
Square, triangle, and circle.

416
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,010
- This is what we do.
- A drama.

417
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,750
<i>Green light, red light</i>

418
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,980
I can't hear you.

419
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,910
<i>- Green light, red light</i>
- Light...

420
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,150
<i>- Red light...</i>
- Light...

421
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,590
You know this.

422
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,280
You know what it is.

423
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,890
<i>- Green light, red light</i>
- Hatching?

424
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,390
- Green light.
- Hatching.

425
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,950
- My goodness.
- Hatching?

426
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,650
She knows it.

427
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,290
Are you crazy?

428
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,820
It's a famous drama.

429
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,560
Why are you yelling at me?

430
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,600
- Netflix!
- Don't get mad at me.

431
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,160
- He's throwing a tantrum.
- Hatching?

432
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,800
- He's upset.
- Why is he throwing a tantrum?

433
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,300
- I can't hear you.
- You die if you lose.

434
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,350
- I can't hear you!
- Read my lips.

435
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,480
- Explain to him.
- You go ahead now.

436
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,070
- Read my lips...
- It's a smelly food.

437
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,980
(So Min describes "stinky tofu.")

438
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,890
- A smelly food?
- It's a smelly food.

439
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:16,120
- No. "Green light, red light."
- A smelly food.

440
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,450
- You really can't hear me? Gosh.
- A smelly food.

441
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,450
- Try to guess the word.
- I mean...

442
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,450
He won't even try to listen to her.

443
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,130
- They should... Exactly.
- He's only talking to her.

444
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,270
Teamwork is important in this game.

445
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,190
- Hey!
- A smelly food.

446
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,660
A smelly food?

447
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,190
Oh, I get it. Stinky tofu.

448
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,470
- Correct.
- Stinky tofu.

449
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,140
(Finally, they succeed
and get the right answer.)

450
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,510
- What?
- It's in the bathroom.

451
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,270
- Okay. Keep going.
- Did you say "cookie stew?"

452
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,070
- When you...
- Cookie stew in the bathroom?

453
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,070
Open your mouth wide.

454
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,390
(Frustrated and upset)

455
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,260
- I can't hear him at all.
- They're running out of time.

456
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,720
- It's over.
- Time's up.

457
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,360
- It's over.
- It's over.

458
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,820
- You got only "stinky tofu" right.
- Hey.

459
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,260
- I couldn't hear him at all.
- I said, "green light, red light."

460
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,420
Your pronunciation wasn't right.
I couldn't read your lips.

461
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,600
- Right. Pronunciation is important.
- But...

462
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,560
You just kept
swearing and yelling at me.

463
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,930
No. I also said,
"square, triangle, and circle."

464
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,660
I couldn't hear you. You should've shaped
your mouth more clearly.

465
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,140
- You know "Green light, red light."
- I know that game and the drama.

466
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,510
But I couldn't hear you.

467
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,650
- Please stop arguing.
- Hey.

468
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,750
- That's enough, you guys.
- I'll never team up with him again.

469
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,770
I won't either.

470
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,070
- Give me your chocolate.
- You played dumb on purpose.

471
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,720
- That's ridiculous. Try it.
- Let's take turns.

472
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,850
- I know it was intentional.
- I couldn't hear you.

473
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,760
- Stop it, So Min.
- I have only six chocolates.

474
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,020
- You know that.
- I couldn't even hear you.

475
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,150
- Give me one chocolate.
- Give me one too.

476
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,490
- I'll never team up with you again.
- Help me out.

477
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,290
- I won't team up with you either.
- You have more chocolates.

478
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,790
What?

479
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,290
You have more chocolates than I do.

480
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,190
Ready. Go.

481
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,160
(Se Chan to Haha, nose hair,
Haha to Se Chan, parvenu)

482
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,740
Haha, what's in Joon Ho's nose?

483
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,840
Gosh.

484
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,300
It's in Joon Ho's nose. Two words.

485
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,770
In his nose.

486
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,480
(Something in his nose?)

487
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,010
- Nostrils.
- No.

488
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,170
- Nose hair.
- Yes, that's correct.

489
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,250
Correct.

490
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,750
- Hey.
- Haha.

491
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,410
What do people put on
when they go out these days?

492
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,990
Hey.

493
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,760
- Wait.
- Joon Ho...

494
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,180
- Joon Ho.
- Joon Ho?

495
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,790
- Joon Ho...
- Nose hair. Grey nose hair.

496
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,260
It stinks.

497
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,100
- A rich man...
- A rich man?

498
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,470
who became rich all of a sudden.

499
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,290
- Parvenu.
- Yes.

500
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,270
- It's my turn. When you go out,
- When I go out...

501
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,700
what do you put on?

502
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,930
- A mask.
- Correct.

503
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,350
(They get 3 answers right in a row.)

504
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,940
(Haha to Se Chan, gyeonggeomangdong)

505
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,070
(A Chinese idiom shows up.)

506
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,270
It's a Chinese idiom.

507
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,570
He doesn't know any Chinese idioms.

508
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,520
A Chinese idiom.

509
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,910
Gagyageogyeo?

510
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,020
- It's a Chinese idiom.
- King Sejong?

511
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,860
(He's getting
stiff shoulders already.)

512
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,450
A Chinese idiom.

513
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,130
A Chinese idiom?

514
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,520
Yes. Look at my lips.

515
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,370
You...

516
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,690
He doesn't know the meaning of it.

517
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,770
I...

518
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:42,930
You act...

519
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,790
like this.

520
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,840
A lunatic.

521
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,740
- You go like this.
- A Chinese idiom?

522
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,670
He doesn't know the meaning
of the idiom.

523
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,940
Pass.

524
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,150
- Hey.
- Haha, it's my turn now.

525
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,480
Glass slippers.

526
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,750
Glass slippers?

527
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,250
Who wears them?

528
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,680
(Se Chan to Haha, Cinderella)

529
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,250
A fairy tale.

530
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,280
- Glass slippers.
- A fairy tale.

531
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,390
- He doesn't know?
- A girl.

532
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,280
- Snow White.
- Yes. What?

533
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,030
- Snow White.
- Yes.

534
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,720
(Snow White wears glass slippers?)

535
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,900
He said "Snow White."

536
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,030
No.

537
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,220
You idiot. Look at my lips.

538
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,430
No.

539
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,230
(You idiot. Look at my lips.)

540
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,460
Snow White meets the seven dwarfs.

541
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,500
Oh, I know. An apple, right?

542
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,670
Yes.

543
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,840
Who eats the apple?

544
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,050
- An apple?
- Who eats the apple?

545
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,240
- That's not it.
- Who eats the apple?

546
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,280
- No.
- The apple...

547
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,010
- That's still Snow White.
- The apple.

548
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,510
- The apple. Snow White.
- The apple. Yes.

549
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,210
- She eats it and falls asleep.
- He got it all wrong.

550
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,510
- The seven dwarfs?
- He got confused.

551
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,180
- No. She eats the apple...
- She eats the apple.

552
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,220
and falls asleep.

553
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,750
- He suddenly got confused.
- She wears glass slippers.

554
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,830
- Yes.
- Who is she?

555
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,630
- No, listen. She eats the apple...
- She eats the apple...

556
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,130
- Cinderella doesn't eat an apple.
- and wears glass slippers. Who?

557
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,900
- It's Snow White who eats an apple.
- Snow White.

558
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,340
No.

559
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,990
- Glass slippers.
- No?

560
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,040
You said "apple."
She eats an apple...

561
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,070
- That must be...
- It has four syllables.

562
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,970
Yes, it has four syllables.
S-now-whi-te.

563
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,580
- No.
- The apple. Right?

564
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,080
- Glass slippers.
- Glass slippers.

565
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,240
- Yes, she wears glass slippers...
- She wears glass slippers.

566
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,940
- and eats an apple.
- She eats an apple.

567
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,210
Who is she?

568
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,290
(Cinderella in the story Haha knows
eats an apple as well.)

569
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,350
- Who is she?
- No?

570
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,750
Gosh, that idiot.

571
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,680
- Come on. Who wears glass slippers?
- She doesn't...

572
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,180
She doesn't eat an apple.

573
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,130
She wears glass slippers
and eats an apple.

574
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,900
- She falls asleep after that.
- But the prince kisses her.

575
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,370
- Yes.
- My gosh. This is frustrating.

576
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,420
It has four syllables.

577
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,870
Does she turn into a frog?

578
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,760
(It's getting weirder.)

579
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,110
- Four syllables.
- Pumpkin carriage.

580
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,930
- Unbelievable.
- Seriously.

581
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,200
That's Snow White, right?

582
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,670
- Why...
- Another princess.

583
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,780
- What's wrong with them?
- My goodness.

584
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,850
- He's the problem.
- Hey.

585
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,850
- Hey.
- Cinderella doesn't eat an apple.

586
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,150
Why would she eat an apple?

587
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,850
- That's Snow White.
- See?

588
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,240
- It's Snow White who eats an apple.
- Yes.

589
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,710
- Who wears glass slippers?
- It's Cinderella who wears them.

590
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,130
- It's not Snow White.
- She wears them and eats an apple.

591
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,560
- Exactly. Right?
- No.

592
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,750
- She wears glass slippers... No?
- They both got it wrong.

593
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,420
- That's ridiculous.
- Am I wrong?

594
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,630
- Cinderella...
- Hey.

595
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,840
- After midnight...
- It turns back into a pumpkin.

596
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,260
- Cinderella goes home at midnight.
- That's right.

597
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,960
What a shame.
I did explain well, but...

598
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,000
- Hold on a second.
- Joon Ho.

599
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,430
- We combined those two stories.
- Yes.

600
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,580
- Cinderella and Snow White...
- You guys combined those stories.

601
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,050
- Your hand is so sweaty.
- I know.

602
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,200
- You got three questions right.
- Joon Ho, you get it now, right?

603
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,380
- We'll go first.
- Use simple words.

604
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,670
- It's our turn.
- We'll go first.

605
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,710
Oh, you two will go first?

606
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,150
- Yes, we'll go first.
- Okay. Go ahead.

607
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,410
- You can't. You have a small mouth.
- This means two syllables.

608
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,590
And this means three syllables.

609
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,180
- Come on. Don't cheat.
- Two syllables.

610
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,650
- Stop.
- Three syllables.

611
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,090
- He...
- Gosh.

612
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,750
- What are you doing?
- That's just disgusting.

613
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,630
He went like this.
"This means three syllables."

614
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,830
(He came up with a cheating skill.)

615
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,400
Two syllables, and three syllables.

616
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,070
Joon Ho,
I'll say a few keywords, okay?

617
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,460
There's no point in saying it loudly
since you can't hear anything.

618
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,930
Oh, my. I can't hear anything.

619
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,040
Let me get it straight.
Snow White's story...

620
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,580
- is similar to the story...
<i>- Ring, ding, dong</i>

621
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,240
- of Kong Jwi and Pat Jwi, right?
<i>- Ring, ding, dong</i>

622
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,670
Ready. Here's your question. Go.

623
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,010
- Glass slippers...
- You get this as you age... Wait, no.

624
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,250
- Hands at the back.
- You...

625
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,640
(He's using his face
instead of his hands.)

626
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,610
What's that? What does that mean?

627
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,910
- This right here.
- What is it?

628
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,090
A double chin?

629
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,610
A double chin?

630
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,450
This. What you're seeing now.

631
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,450
You get this when you get old.

632
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,530
You get this when you get old.

633
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,720
You're going...

634
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,120
You get this on your face
when you get old.

635
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,530
You're going...

636
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,100
- That's close.
- You're going...

637
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,630
- You get this on your face...
- You're going...

638
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,930
You go...

639
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,470
- You...
- What's he doing? Speak.

640
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,170
- Describe it.
- Let me answer. Goby.

641
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,410
Hands at the back.

642
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,850
You get this on your face.

643
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,940
(Goby uses his facial expressions
as he's not good with words.)

644
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,320
A monster?

645
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,410
Pass.

646
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,150
- It's really frustrating.
- Is it my turn?

647
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,680
You were on this.

648
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,180
- That's too easy.
- The TV show you appeared on.

649
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,500
(Jae Suk to Joon Ho,
"2 Days 1 Night")

650
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,720
Upper limit.

651
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,620
Upper limit and lower limit.

652
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,070
- Upper limit. Lower limit.
- Jerk?

653
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,660
Jerk?

654
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,900
- Upper limit. Lower limit.
- Is it...

655
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,040
Jerk?

656
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,310
- You get stuck on a certain word.
- What?

657
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,470
Jerk?

658
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,280
It...

659
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,970
(Gibberish)

660
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,050
What did you say?

661
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,050
- Describe the word.
- You go first.

662
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,090
I'll describe mine.

663
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,560
- The TV show...
- TV show?

664
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,320
that you appeared on.

665
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,450
"2 Days 1 Night."

666
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,150
Too loud.

667
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,800
The upstairs neighbors are too loud.

668
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,920
Three words.

669
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,000
Noise between floors?

670
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,620
- Correct.
- Great job.

671
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,620
- Keep going. You're good at this.
- Jae Suk is good at this.

672
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,740
They got easy questions.

673
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,890
Why didn't you say anything?

674
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,110
I'm not good at games like this.

675
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,510
You two got three questions right.

676
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,610
Since Jae Suk described them all,
he wins.

677
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,940
I win?

678
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,580
- I can't hear anything.
- Indeed.

679
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,280
Oh, my. I really can't hear at all.

680
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,490
Ready. Go.

681
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,520
(Jong Kook to Ji Hyo,
blind date for marriage)

682
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,260
What is it? Can we start? Okay.

683
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,320
Say, "love."

684
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,360
- Jong Kook.
- Say, "I like you."

685
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,420
- Four words.
- "Let us start dating."

686
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,560
- Stock investment.
- "My heart for you."

687
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,330
- Four words.
- Four words?

688
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,720
"Honey. Darling."

689
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,100
- A man.
- "I really like you."

690
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,190
A fan.

691
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,860
- A woman.
- A woman.

692
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,040
A man and a woman...

693
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,340
- meet each other.
- The opposite sex? Okay.

694
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,930
- They meet each other.
- "Let's get married."

695
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,970
They might end up...

696
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,130
- "Let's get married?"
- They talk about marriage.

697
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,470
(Let's get married.)

698
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,550
- "Let's get married?"
- They talk about marriage.

699
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,200
- "How about we get married?"
<i>- Will you marry me?</i>

700
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,820
A man and a woman...

701
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,380
- He said, "You and I..."
- meet up...

702
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,490
- to get married.
- To get married?

703
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,760
- Someone sets them up.
- Dating.

704
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,260
Someone sets them up. Four words.

705
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,360
- Jo...
- Someone sets them up.

706
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,560
Joraengi rice cake?

707
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,100
She said, "joraengi rice cake."

708
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,690
- Someone sets them up.
- "Joraengi rice cake?"

709
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,430
Speak more loudly.

710
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,100
- A man...
- A man.

711
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,340
- and a woman...
- A woman.

712
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,570
- meet up...
- They meet up.

713
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,200
to be introduced to each other.

714
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,580
A blind date.

715
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,170
No. Four words.

716
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,670
She doesn't know.

717
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,050
Arrangement.

718
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,440
It's for people who are not
so young anymore.

719
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,970
It's not that she doesn't know
the answer, right?

720
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,090
Four words.

721
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,210
I'm starting to think
that she might not know it.

722
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,380
- I bet she doesn't know.
- A group blind date?

723
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,790
See? She doesn't know the answer.

724
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,220
Not a group blind date.

725
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,180
- It's not a normal blind date.
- It's a Korean word.

726
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,650
- It's not a normal blind date?
- Add more words to that.

727
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,950
- You know...
- Picking up a girl in public.

728
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,060
What is it?

729
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,530
She doesn't know.

730
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,460
- Dating.
- No.

731
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,540
Jong Kook keeps smiling
unlike how he usually reacts.

732
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,630
A blind date for marriage.

733
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,630
(She finally got it right!)

734
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,540
- A blind date for marriage.
- Correct? Okay.

735
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,630
It's your turn.

736
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,670
Jong Kook.

737
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,540
- Say, "I love you."
- Gambling.

738
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,280
- "Gumbling?"
- Gambling.

739
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,410
- Money.
- What?

740
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,640
Money.

741
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,490
- Mo...
- I want to edit this part...

742
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,850
- to make this look romantic.
- How many words?

743
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,110
- Lee Kwang Soo.
- Lee Kwang Soo?

744
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,410
- His movie.
- They look so affectionate.

745
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,090
His movie? "Collective Invention?"

746
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,120
- This is so romantic.
- They're deeply in love.

747
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,380
- Two words.
- They're like Romeo and Juliet.

748
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,390
Two words?

749
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,150
(It makes
the love story lovers happy.)

750
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,460
- "I'm sorry."
- Gambling.

751
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,660
- Gambling.
- My goodness.

752
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,660
Kwang Soo's gambling movie.

753
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,930
Kwang Soo's gangster movie?

754
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,360
- "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks."
- Two words. Correct.

755
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,930
"Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks."

756
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,110
(A perfect question for them
shows up.)

757
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,200
(Cheering)

758
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
(Ji Hyo to Jong Kook, cutie)

759
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,810
- Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook.

760
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,550
- I...
- You.

761
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,090
- "I like you."
- It's a five-letter word.

762
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,520
It's a five-letter word.

763
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,110
What did you say?

764
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,360
- Five letters.
- Five letters? Okay.

765
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,920
- Five letters.
- Five letters.

766
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,180
- Come on.
- A cute gesture?

767
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,330
- Cutie.
- That's correct.

768
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,150
- That's impressive.
- Cutie.

769
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,420
- He sees it every day.
- Right.

770
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,890
- He's used to it.
- I bet he saw it yesterday too.

771
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,800
- Keep going.
- Time's up.

772
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,340
- It's over.
- Time's up.

773
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,160
- Was "Cutie" the correct answer?
- Yes, it was.

774
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,310
- Really?
- We all feel the same way.

775
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,930
- I guess I did a good job.
- They did really well.

776
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,110
(The cutie shows up again.)

777
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,010
- She's acting cute again.
- I think I did a good job.

778
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,050
- I didn't expect that question.
- She's so cute.

779
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,050
They came in first place
with their fantastic teamwork.

780
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,490
- Really?
- That's amazing.

781
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,450
We can't defeat a couple
in a game like this.

782
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,120
Jong Kook described more words
to Ji Hyo.

783
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,920
- Really? I did?
- Yes.

784
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,720
Ji Hyo got 3 questions right.
So Ji Hyo is in 2nd place.

785
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,160
Se Chan is in 3rd place.

786
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,240
- He gets clumsy sometimes.
- He's so cute.

787
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,740
Jae Suk is in 5th place,
and Joon Ho is in 6th place.

788
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,040
So Min is in 7th place,
and Suk Jin is in 8th place.

789
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,370
We'll give you chocolates
according to your rankings.

790
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,350
- Really?
- We'll give you chocolates now.

791
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,200
- Oh, my.
- That's a lot.

792
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,350
- He got so many chocolates.
- Indeed.

793
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,320
- How many did he get?
- He got 20 chocolates.

794
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,410
- It's Se Chan.
- Se Chan, here you go.

795
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,410
- Thank you.
- That's a lot.

796
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,790
- How many did he get?
- He got 20.

797
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,360
- How many will I receive then?
- Twenty?

798
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,610
- Yes.
- And...

799
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,760
Currently, Joon Ho is ranked...

800
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,100
fifth out of all of you.

801
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,100
That's not bad.

802
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,800
- No. He should move up.
- He should be ranked fourth.

803
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
But it's a good start.

804
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,220
If he remains in fifth place
until the end,

805
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,130
those who are ranked from 5th to 8th
will get a penalty...

806
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,810
because Joon Ho is not
in the top four.

807
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,010
We can give some of our chocolates
to Joon Ho later.

808
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,310
True. But if you do,
it'd be a loss for you...

809
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,400
since you'd go down in the ranking.

810
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,750
And the top two, I'll tell you
your rankings in private.

811
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,750
Please come forward.

812
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,750
- Really? Will you tell us that?
- Yes.

813
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,180
No. I have
fewer chocolates than you.

814
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,850
- I don't have many.
- Now...

815
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,880
If you go two floors up,

816
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,790
you'll see three rooms
where you can play One or the Other.

817
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,790
You can enter any of those rooms.
You'll be given only five minutes.

818
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,920
You can gain more chocolates there.

819
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,330
We're here.
We're on the second floor.

820
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,360
I see numbers 1 and 2.

821
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,390
(Contemplating)

822
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,930
- One or the Other?
- It seems to me...

823
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,660
Oh, it's hard to decide.

824
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,270
- I'll go into the last room.
- What's this?

825
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,280
- Should we choose the room too?
- Joon Ho, you'll go in now, right?

826
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,970
- Kid, come on in.
- All right.

827
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,050
The game you will play
in this room is...

828
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,910
Russian roulette.

829
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,110
(Russian roulette)

830
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,440
- What's this?
- Take turns shooting each other.

831
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,820
The winner gets double
the amount he betted.

832
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,820
(The first one to pop the balloon
gets double the amount he betted.)

833
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,990
You have to place your bet first...

834
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,830
Regardless of the result
of the game,

835
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,000
I'm just excited
to get to point a gun at him.

836
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,360
(It's a good chance to get on
Jong Kook's nerves all he wants.)

837
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,660
Why don't we bet five chocolates?

838
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,270
Gosh. Fine. Let's bet five each.

839
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,740
It's up to luck,
and I have no choice but to do this.

840
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,840
Which one of you will shoot first?

841
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,200
- Who should go first?
- I'll go first.

842
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,700
- Okay.
- Wait.

843
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,670
The order is important
in this game too.

844
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,350
- If he goes first...
- It could pop in the first shot.

845
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,750
- You don't know either, right?
- That's correct.

846
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,050
- Did you shuffle it?
- Go ahead. You go first.

847
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,320
I think I should go first.

848
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
(Haha will go first.)

849
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,030
If the balloon pops,
Jong Kook loses.

850
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,060
Got it.

851
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,760
Go ahead.

852
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,890
(The business partners meet
at the worst place.)

853
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:02,130
(The two tycoons are fighting
over their stakes in a restaurant.)

854
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,750
(He who was a business partner
turns into an enemy.)

855
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,750
You haven't even gotten married yet.

856
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,280
I'm sorry.

857
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,320
(He acted cool but fails.)

858
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,560
- I think...
- Hold still.

859
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,530
Maybe it was supposed to pop
but it didn't.

860
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,290
No, I don't think so.

861
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,100
You should pull it all the way.

862
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,650
I pulled it all the way.

863
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,100
Then I guess you failed.

864
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,160
(He already got scared.)

865
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,900
(Breathing out heavily)

866
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,280
He's acting like an assassin.

867
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,640
(The assassin of the wilderness,
Muscle Gunman, shows up.)

868
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,410
(The latest movie, "Protein Pistol")

869
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,410
Don't move.

870
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,880
I said, stay put, you punk.

871
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,180
(Evil laughter)

872
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,490
Please spare me.

873
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,360
I'm begging you. Spare me.

874
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,560
- You punk.
- I have a wife and kids.

875
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,160
- You have a wife and kids? Right.
- I have a wife and kids.

876
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,360
- A wife and kids?
- Please.

877
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,660
Okay. One.

878
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,660
(Could Muscle Gunman punish Haha?)

879
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,740
Two.

880
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,740
(Could Muscle Gunman punish Haha?)

881
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,310
(He failed.)

882
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,440
(Little Gunman is back.)

883
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,250
How many bullets are there in it?

884
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,850
Hey, the first one to start is
at an advantage in this game.

885
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,050
I know that.

886
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,020
Why didn't you go first?

887
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:34,420
I always imagined this moment
behind your back.

888
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,420
What game are they playing?

889
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,220
(Screaming)

890
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,130
(The 2 gunmen in their 40s are lost
in playing cowboys.)

891
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,340
What's this game?

892
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,570
- You're out if it pops.
- Do you know what this is?

893
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,580
You startled me. What is it?

894
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,630
Get out.

895
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,850
You can't...
Wait, that's not how it's done.

896
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,050
- That's not how this works.
- Don't ruin the game.

897
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,110
Is that so?

898
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,640
(He's pointing the gun at Jong Kook
for the third time.)

899
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
Just get it over with.

900
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,140
(What could be
Muscle Gunman's fate?)

901
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,210
Shoot.

902
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,020
Does it pop when the bullet is shot?

903
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,380
- Sit down.
- If it pops, you lose.

904
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,650
- Sit down.
- If it doesn't go off...

905
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,760
- Hey.
- Please. I'm begging you.

906
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,620
- What are you talking about?
- Please. Just this once.

907
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,030
- What are you begging for?
- Just one week.

908
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,840
Please give me just one week.

909
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,100
- Please.
- What's going on in here?

910
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
What game are you playing?

911
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,810
- Are you still playing the game?
- Get out.

912
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,630
- You're not done yet?
- Get out, old man.

913
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,870
- You're still playing it?
- "Get out, old man."

914
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,750
The old man
with three strands of hair.

915
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,010
I have a feeling
that it'll pop this time.

916
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,370
Say your last words.

917
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,410
Go ahead.

918
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,410
Shoot!

919
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,110
Hey, get it together, will you?
Focus, all right?

920
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,110
Please.

921
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,880
Please.

922
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,790
(Five chocolates are at stake.
How will their fate turn out?)

923
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,560
(Popping)

924
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,430
(Muscle Gunman beats Little Gunman
and wins five chocolates.)

925
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,430
Okay.

926
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,930
- Hello.
- I came with Joon Ho.

927
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,740
- Can we sit down right away?
- Yes, please sit.

928
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,010
The game you'll play in this room is
TMI Choice.

929
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,900
You'll be given a question
about the cast members.

930
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,320
If you get the question right,

931
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,440
we'll give you a double amount
of chocolates you betted.

932
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,440
I see.

933
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,850
Do we get to play once?

934
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,150
Yes, you have only one chance.

935
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,920
Where was Haha born?

936
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
(Stuttgart or Saint Petersburg)

937
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,150
Stuttgart or Saint Petersburg?

938
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,770
Where are those regions?

939
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,390
- Where?
- Germany.

940
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,100
Is Haha German?

941
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,430
- He was born in Germany.
- Stuttgart is on this side.

942
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,900
Saint Petersburg is the other side.
Please bet your chocolates.

943
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,700
That's all I know.

944
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:32,320
- You don't know the region?
- Stuttgart or Saint Petersburg?

945
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,940
(Ji Hyo betted one chocolate
on Stuttgart.)

946
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,490
Stutt... Shugart. Schubert.

947
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,790
Where is Schubert from?

948
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,560
Schubert.

949
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,030
(He talked nonsense
while contemplating for a while.)

950
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,650
Wait, Joon Ho.

951
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,560
- You shouldn't do this.
- It's okay.

952
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,500
- You shouldn't bet all you have.
- Don't worry.

953
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,890
Trust me. I'm telling you...

954
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,460
You decided to start anew.

955
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,930
- It's okay. These are chocolates.
- Come on.

956
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,580
- Don't do this, Joon Ho.
- What are you thinking?

957
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,630
You really shouldn't bet them all.

958
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,580
- Done.
- How many did you bet?

959
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,750
- I betted 27 chocolates.
- I see.

960
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,440
- And you betted three, right?
- Yes.

961
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,640
Joon Ho.

962
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,910
- I trust you.
- All right.

963
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,850
(What could be the answer?)

964
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,590
The answer is...

965
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,110
- Stuttgart.
- Yes!

966
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,150
(Stuttgart)

967
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,260
- Stuttgart.
- Yes!

968
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,390
(I hit the jackpot.)

969
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,270
Here. Have one.

970
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,740
- Have one.
- Give me one too, please.

971
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,190
Sure. Here you go.

972
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,930
Wait. This won't help me
create a good image.

973
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,540
My gosh.

974
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,930
- I'll give all of you...
- Are you done? Come on out.

975
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,140
Joon Ho, I see you won a lot.

976
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,580
- Yes, I did.
- Ji Hyo, how many did you win?

977
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,320
I betted three.

978
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,580
What game do we play here?

979
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,910
- What are the rules?
- The game you'll play here is...

980
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,650
- TMI Choice.
- I see.

981
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,530
You will be given a question
about one of the cast members.

982
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,530
- If you get it right,
- That's what we did this morning.

983
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,330
you'll get a double amount
of what you betted.

984
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,830
- We can double the amount?
- Here's your question.

985
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,270
Did Se Chan wash his feet...

986
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,740
while showering this morning?

987
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,840
(Yes or no)

988
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,930
I know the answer.

989
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,540
You mean if he rubbed his feet
with a bath towel, right?

990
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,200
Yes. Put them on this side
if you think he washed his feet...

991
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,900
I bet he didn't wash his feet.
I'm all in.

992
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,280
Se Chan always rinses his feet
with water.

993
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,990
He never uses soap to wash his feet.

994
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,820
I remember...

995
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,820
that he said it during a shoot.

996
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,880
I think he rubs down to his ankles
with a bath towel.

997
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,150
Right?

998
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,890
I betted all the 13 chocolates
I had.

999
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,530
Okay. He didn't wash his feet.

1000
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,390
What? Why did you bet
on the same thing?

1001
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,540
- He didn't wash his feet.
- How many are these?

1002
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,540
They're 31.

1003
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,930
- Okay.
- That's a lot.

1004
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,200
- You bet he didn't wash his feet.
- Yes. We're all in.

1005
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,170
- I hope he didn't wash his feet.
- Please.

1006
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,140
- Please.
- I really hope so.

1007
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,440
- I'll be disappointed if he did.
- Please.

1008
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,820
- That's not like him.
- The answer is...

1009
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,410
- He didn't wash his feet.
- Okay.

1010
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,940
You're rich now.

1011
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,880
- While showering this morning,
- Yes?

1012
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,720
did you wash your feet or not?

1013
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,830
Actually, I recently changed...

1014
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,760
my shower routine.

1015
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,570
I rub my feet as well
with a bath ball now.

1016
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,960
So I've been
scrubbing my feet these days.

1017
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,360
Did you scrub them today?

1018
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,540
No, not today.

1019
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,840
(No, not today.)

1020
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,860
I only scrub them at night
and not in the morning.

1021
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,540
I'm trying to make it a habit
of scrubbing them at night,

1022
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,870
so I didn't scrub them this morning.

1023
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,200
(Thanks to Se Chan,
they both hit the jackpot.)

1024
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,250
We scored big.

1025
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,350
That's 30.

1026
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,940
I'll take 31, please.

1027
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,990
Jae Suk, you're rich.

1028
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,320
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1029
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,490
- Really?
- Yes.

1030
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,950
- You should have one.
- I should.

1031
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,720
I should have one as well.

1032
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:37,890
(A banquet hall
is prepared at the mansion.)

1033
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,270
(2. Yang Se Chan, 3. Ji Suk Jin)

1034
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,630
(8 nameplates with their names are
on an individual stand.)

1035
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,200
- What's this?
- What's going on?

1036
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,040
What is this for?

1037
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,970
- What's this?
- One, two.

1038
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,200
(They each find their stands.)

1039
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,350
One, two, three.

1040
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,610
- It's like...
- What is this for?

1041
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,110
- What is this?
- It's like a presidential debate.

1042
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,370
- It must be a debate.
- A debate?

1043
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,710
I need to win a lot of chocolate...

1044
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,790
and increase the number
in the next game.

1045
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,260
- Everyone.
- Yes?

1046
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,090
By being logical
and speaking eloquently,

1047
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,290
you are to persuade
the staff of Running Man.

1048
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,030
This is the Running Man
Election Debate.

1049
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,500
- An election debate?
- This is out of the blue.

1050
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
(Running Man Election Debate)

1051
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,540
- I'm not good at debates.
- Neither am I.

1052
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,540
You all entered the election
as celebrities...

1053
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,430
who will have
a more promising year in 2022.

1054
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,970
- All of us?
- Next year?

1055
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,870
You had a good year in 2021,
but next year will be even better.

1056
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,820
I like how that sounds.

1057
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:28,510
You will each get
three minutes to speak.

1058
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,450
Then we'll move on to a debate
where one takes initiative.

1059
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:34,410
When the debate is over,
staff members will vote.

1060
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:35,760
- You'll actually vote?
- Yes.

1061
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,760
The chocolate you receive
will depend on your ranking.

1062
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,530
During the debate, you will vote...

1063
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,070
for the worst candidate among you.

1064
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,590
That person will receive a penalty.

1065
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,140
The worst candidate?

1066
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,840
We should choose our words wisely.

1067
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,970
I can't afford to get on
anyone's bad side.

1068
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,070
In a minute,
starting with So Min,

1069
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,780
you will get a minute
to appeal to the others.

1070
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,550
- To gather votes?
- Exactly.

1071
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,820
Take this time
to think about what you'll say.

1072
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,390
(It's their first chance
to win over the staff.)

1073
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,140
- This isn't easy.
- It's quite tricky.

1074
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,410
What can I say?

1075
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,090
Show us how valuable you are.

1076
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,760
- Our value?
- In 2022.

1077
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,530
I wonder what I should say.

1078
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,700
Suk Jin...

1079
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,660
What was that word again?

1080
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,930
Together...

1081
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,570
- This year...
- Suk Jin.

1082
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,370
The word for when
two candidates come together.

1083
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,140
- A partnership.
- Not a merger but...

1084
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,110
What's the word?

1085
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,610
- When two candidates...
- A unification.

1086
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,870
Yes, a unification.

1087
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,640
- A unification.
- I thought it was a merger.

1088
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Seriously?
I can't believe I forgot.

1089
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,510
Haha, how about we put up
a unified front?

1090
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,780
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk's done
with his speech.)

1091
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,220
Okay, I'm ready.

1092
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,490
(Glancing)

1093
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,930
Are you copying my words?

1094
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,450
Why would you copy mine?

1095
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,390
I wanted to know
how successful people speak.

1096
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,090
Unbelievable.

1097
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,370
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

1098
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,910
Just so you know,
there are about 80 voters here.

1099
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,010
They won't vote for you
if you sound snobby.

1100
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,870
Not being greedy
can lead to good results.

1101
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,450
All right. I'm good.

1102
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,010
I'm ready.

1103
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,820
(1. Jeon So Min, 2. Yang Se Chan,
3. Ji Suk Jin, 4. Yoo Jae Suk)

1104
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,360
All right, we'll begin.

1105
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,930
Jeon So Min will be
the first to speak.

1106
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,280
Hello, everyone.

1107
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,300
I am candidate number one
Jeon So Min.

1108
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,390
It's good to meet you all.

1109
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,430
There's a good reason...

1110
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:29,570
why you can look forward to me
in the year to come.

1111
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,840
I recovered from
being sick last year.

1112
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,680
And like a frog
coming out of hibernation,

1113
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,050
I've been taking on
more and more projects.

1114
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,220
As you all know,

1115
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,840
I haven't been able
to act in the past few months,

1116
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,950
and Running Man was
the one and only project I was in.

1117
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,660
However, this year,
I have two dramas coming up,

1118
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,050
and another has been set
to air next year.

1119
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,390
For me, the year 2022
is looking to be one...

1120
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,930
where I enjoy the second surge
of great luck in life.

1121
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:55,930
(1. Jeon So Min)

1122
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,220
Hello?

1123
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,620
- "Hello?"
- It's over.

1124
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,760
- What was with the "Hello?"
- What was that?

1125
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,510
Let's not be rude.

1126
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,910
- Wait.
- Seriously?

1127
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,740
Are we on limited time
like an actual debate?

1128
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,340
- That was too short.
- Watch your language.

1129
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,280
- Seriously.
- Come on!

1130
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,140
- This is ridiculous.
- Hello.

1131
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,280
I am Yang Se Chan,
the celebrity set to have...

1132
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,340
a better year in 2022.

1133
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,990
I'd appreciate a round of applause.

1134
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,820
(2. Yang Se Chan)

1135
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,820
(He made a request
in a cheesy voice,)

1136
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,180
(but his shy fans
applaud with courage.)

1137
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,220
Thank you.

1138
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,700
His voice...

1139
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,260
- You lost ten seconds.
- Thank you.

1140
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,530
You see, next year...

1141
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,840
- is the year of the tiger.
- What?

1142
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,530
I was born in 1986
which is the year of the tiger.

1143
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,700
What does that
have to do with anything?

1144
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,070
It goes to show
that it could be my year.

1145
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,370
Weren't you born
in the year of the vole?

1146
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,950
That doesn't even exist.

1147
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,280
You can say
that I'm still quite young as well.

1148
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,120
Anything Running Man wants,
I can deliver.

1149
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,950
A love connection too...

1150
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,990
Enjoy it on your own.

1151
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,590
We don't expect much
from you next year.

1152
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,360
- Why not?
- Forget it.

1153
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,280
I'm looking forward to
a love connection with a guest.

1154
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,450
- We don't have many these days.
- With a guest?

1155
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,260
They will. Also...

1156
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,570
(His minute is over.)

1157
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,700
See?

1158
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,200
Hey, mic testing.

1159
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,340
It's too short.

1160
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,660
(Next is Mr. Ji,
the former event host)

1161
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,800
Hello, everyone.

1162
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,840
(Plucked)

1163
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,300
(The event host makes his entrance.)

1164
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,410
- The celebrity who...
- Is this an event?

1165
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,410
- Is this an event?
- Hi, I'm Ji Suk Jin.

1166
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,740
First of all,

1167
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,180
I'd like to inform you
of my unrivaled quality.

1168
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,890
I am the only
male celebrity in his 50s...

1169
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,010
who is a regular
on a weekend variety show.

1170
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,430
As you all know,

1171
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,950
MSG Wannabe shocked the world.

1172
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,870
It all goes to prove
my future value.

1173
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,120
- Jae Suk made it happen.
- Also,

1174
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,590
many projects are being
offered to me again.

1175
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,030
That also proves
the future value I possess.

1176
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,610
There you have it.

1177
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,840
Aren't you looking forward
to how 2022 will turn out for me?

1178
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,970
He fumbled just now.

1179
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,340
I'm Ji Suk Jin.

1180
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,550
Thank you!

1181
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,050
(He wasted his time
by repeating himself.)

1182
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,050
Hello, everyone.

1183
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,280
Like this year...

1184
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,410
and last year,

1185
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,950
- next year...
- He's so serious.

1186
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,410
You can put your faith in me.

1187
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,780
- What a joke.
- We must first...

1188
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,720
go over the basics.

1189
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,820
- The Winter Olympics...
- He's so succinct.

1190
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,450
and the World Cup.
International sports events...

1191
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,720
will be held for us to enjoy.

1192
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,990
When there are events
that steal most of our attention,

1193
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,160
we must come up
with special episodes of our own.

1194
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,140
So let me tell you this.

1195
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,240
(Candidate Yoo is planning
a special episode.)

1196
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,010
Next year, I will make sure that
Yoon Eun Hye appears on the show.

1197
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,370
(I will make sure that
Yoon Eun Hye appears on the show.)

1198
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,700
I second that!

1199
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,370
(He promises to get
Yoon Eun Hye on the show.)

1200
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,320
(The voters cheer.)

1201
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,640
I will make that happen.

1202
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,220
- Are you insane?
- One should make...

1203
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,390
the grand events and surprises
that people look forward to happen.

1204
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,050
- He's crazy.
- You know that.

1205
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,620
- Seriously?
- Unbelievable.

1206
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,720
- He went off the rails.
- Unbelievable.

1207
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,700
As you know,
I'm putting my life on the line.

1208
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,930
My life is at risk
every time I mention her.

1209
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,990
Anyway, please look forward
to me next year.

1210
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,160
My cheekiness...

1211
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,640
will continue next year.

1212
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,640
(His time ends as he leaves
what could be a will.)

1213
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,180
- Next year...
- Your time is up.

1214
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,370
- Enough.
- That's enough!

1215
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,700
Your minute is up.

1216
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,740
That's too bad.
I had more to say, you know.

1217
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,070
You'll have to speak faster.

1218
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,640
Hello, everyone. I'm the cheeky...

1219
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,390
(Hello, everyone. I'm the cheeky...)

1220
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,720
I'm the cheeky chipmunk.

1221
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,930
- This is the worst.
- Back when I was younger,

1222
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,620
I flew around like
a chipmunk with wings.

1223
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,120
However, I then became
the icon of self-reflection...

1224
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,840
and became known as a failure.

1225
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,160
My life was filled with bitterness.

1226
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,300
I've already hit rock bottom...

1227
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,610
which means a simple jump
can make me relevant again.

1228
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,030
Jae Suk is at the top
which means...

1229
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,870
Hello, I'm Kim Jong Kook...

1230
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,910
and 2022 will be a better year
than 2021 was for me.

1231
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,240
But you already knew this.

1232
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,550
I began a new project
by opening my YouTube channel.

1233
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,550
His YouTube channel!

1234
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,860
- That's close to cheating.
- Come on.

1235
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,220
That's like cheating.

1236
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,660
Well...

1237
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,780
Most importantly though,

1238
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:50,200
for ten years, I wasn't able
to cash in the investment I made.

1239
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,760
However, Haha promised
to free up my money for me.

1240
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,990
- Finally?
- That's right.

1241
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,740
- Will you get your money back?
- In any way he can.

1242
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,140
He finally gave me hope that
I could make money with it again.

1243
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,010
If that money gets freed up,

1244
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,280
there will be nothing left
to hold me back.

1245
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,820
You can probably tell yourselves,

1246
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,140
but I have all the potential...

1247
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,340
- in the world. Thank you.
- That's enough.

1248
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,090
Okay.

1249
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,680
I'm Haha, the celebrity
who will shine more in 2022.

1250
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,490
I will be selling
my business next year.

1251
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,180
(Okay!)

1252
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,800
You must be aware
that I'm a kingmaker.

1253
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,450
Kim Jong Kook is proof of that.

1254
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,720
- I...
- A kingmaker?

1255
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,660
He won the Grand Award at all
three major broadcasting stations.

1256
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,760
Thanks to my help,

1257
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,930
he also won the Grand Award
at the Entertainment Awards.

1258
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,140
He was given the endorsement deal
to promote my business...

1259
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,410
which helped reshape his image
from being like a thug.

1260
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,970
After I dissolve
my business next year,

1261
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,510
I will launch my new project
to become a rich man.

1262
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,820
As long as I'm your leader,

1263
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,740
you won't have
to pay for team dinners.

1264
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,510
I am Song Ji Hyo,

1265
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,950
the celebrity
who will shine brighter next year.

1266
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,220
I'm candidate number eight.

1267
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,660
I'm genuinely excited
for Ji Hyo though.

1268
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,590
I believe...

1269
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:57,470
that a career is built,
not earned by a lucky strike.

1270
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,590
(A career is built,
not earned by a lucky strike.)

1271
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:02,470
- That's a nice way to put it.
- Up until now,

1272
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,930
I put up a wall around me.

1273
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,410
However, I've been breaking it down.

1274
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:08,300
- It has been coming down.
- She's not wrong.

1275
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,800
In 2022,
I will be looking for love...

1276
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,970
and seeking out
a better career path.

1277
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,550
You'll be looking
for love next year?

1278
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,280
I'm saying I'll be in love.

1279
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,240
- I see.
- I'll be in love.

1280
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,510
We heard what you all had to say.

1281
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,890
Now, we will begin
the initiative debate.

1282
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,760
- What's that?
- In the initiative debate,

1283
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,360
the one in charge
will get three minutes.

1284
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,390
Using that authority,

1285
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:33,240
he or she will ask
any question they want.

1286
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,990
- Got it.
- Who'd like to go first?

1287
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,930
Suk Jin, go ahead.

1288
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,200
(Candidate Ji raises his hand.)

1289
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,200
Your three minutes begin now.

1290
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,470
- My question is for Jae Suk.
- Sure.

1291
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,470
How long do you expect
to be popular?

1292
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,970
I'm not one to have
thought of that in particular.

1293
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,410
Of course you haven't.

1294
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,890
- The way I see it though...
- Yes?

1295
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,950
I believe you're at your peak...

1296
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,860
- and that you'll go downhill...
- I don't know how you'll take this,

1297
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,720
but a fortune-teller
I met on another show said...

1298
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,200
that I was in for
great luck next year.

1299
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,120
That great luck refers to
your luck in real estate.

1300
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,490
- Real estate?
- I'm sure that's what he meant.

1301
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,840
Are we going to reveal
our economic conditions?

1302
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,160
I don't know about that.

1303
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,430
- Should I talk about yours too?
- I know that you don't own...

1304
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,470
that many buildings.

1305
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,470
Should I bring up the land
you bought in Paju?

1306
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,700
- The land in Paju?
- Yes.

1307
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,610
I've revealed it on a show before.
I've shared that already.

1308
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:20,570
- Excuse me. This is my turn.
- All right.

1309
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:23,090
Until when... I think...

1310
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:24,390
your popularity reached its peak
this year.

1311
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:26,260
"How Do You Play?" was a big hit.

1312
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,950
This may be another topic,

1313
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,360
but during the 11 years
of Running Man,

1314
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,550
you remained obscure for nine years.

1315
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,890
(Jae Suk's counterattack)

1316
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,530
- Yes. He only got popular recently.
- It's seven years.

1317
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,390
I helped you become popular
through MSG Wannabe.

1318
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,700
I practically raised him.

1319
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,370
- You really did.
- Right.

1320
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:46,700
You should send Jae Suk
some gifts during the holidays.

1321
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,800
- I don't do that.
- He should do that,

1322
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,740
- but I don't...
- I can't do it because it's corny.

1323
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,320
- When Ji Ho goes to college,
- But you...

1324
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,890
I'll pay for his tuition.

1325
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,780
Now that you put it that way...

1326
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,450
Of course.
When Ji Ho goes to college,

1327
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:02,050
I'll pay for his first tuition.

1328
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,990
- Thank you.
- He will go to college, won't he?

1329
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,890
- He will...
- Wait a minute.

1330
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,160
(He will go to college, won't he?)

1331
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,220
- Wait.
- Candidate number three.

1332
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,870
- I meant...
- You attacked his family.

1333
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:15,300
- That was a bit...
- I'm sorry.

1334
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,530
- I'm sorry.
- That was a bit...

1335
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:17,700
I hope no one gets me wrong.

1336
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,970
You never know what he wants.

1337
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,070
Please don't get me wrong.

1338
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:22,300
He might want to do something else
instead of going to college.

1339
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,740
These days,
going to college is not a must.

1340
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,950
- Of course not.
- Right, it's not.

1341
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,570
- That's why I said that.
- All right.

1342
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,450
- I apologize.
- I got your intention.

1343
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,220
Thank you. Shall I go next?

1344
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,220
- Okay.
- Sure.

1345
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,280
Please turn on my mic. Thank you.
This is Yang Se Chan.

1346
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,180
I want to ask a question
to candidate number seven, Haha.

1347
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,050
You work really hard
on "How Do You Play?"

1348
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:42,120
- but you slack off on our show.
- He does work really hard.

1349
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,200
Right. Please tell us
which show you value more.

1350
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:46,700
I've told you already.

1351
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,340
I value Running Man more.

1352
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,010
What about "How Do You Play?"
Are you ditching it?

1353
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:51,610
I value that show as well.

1354
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,340
If you were to choose between the two,
which one would you choose?

1355
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,030
(A stress question to
choose between the two)

1356
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,550
- Who are you to ask that?
- You need some time to think?

1357
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:57,640
Who are you to ask that?

1358
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,740
Last time,
you even dressed up on that show.

1359
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,340
You dressed up for the opening.
But you don't do that here.

1360
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,320
That's a misunderstanding.

1361
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,450
You're saying that...

1362
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,050
Thank you. That's all.

1363
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,360
- I'll ask Mr. Ji a question now.
- Sure.

1364
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,430
(Se Chan cuts him off and moves on.)

1365
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:11,780
What's your secret to good health?

1366
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,090
(What's your secret to good health?)

1367
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:15,300
What's your secret to good health?

1368
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,620
- That's random.
- Yes.

1369
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,090
What's your secret to good health?

1370
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,660
I think I'm healthier than you.

1371
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,740
- In what ways?
- That's my secret.

1372
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,240
Could you pay more respect...

1373
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,240
- to your opposing candidate?
- I apologize.

1374
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,530
The question was so poor that I...

1375
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,140
What do you mean
the question was poor?

1376
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,570
He suddenly asked
a random question...

1377
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,340
when we're talking about celebrities
who will have a promising year.

1378
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,640
- We're the same candidates.
- Why would you ask about my health?

1379
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,550
- You should respect him.
- Please tell us your secret.

1380
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:35,280
To stay healthy,
you need to eat small portions.

1381
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,410
- And...
- Eat small portions?

1382
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,490
Yes.

1383
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:39,990
Didn't you stuff yourself
with the buckwheat crepe earlier?

1384
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,320
I eat small portions intermittently.

1385
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,280
I do that,
and I fight with my wife often.

1386
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,950
- So I'm always tense.
- It invigorates you.

1387
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,390
- That's my secret to good health.
- I see.

1388
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,590
- My wife takes care of my health.
- All right.

1389
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:52,700
Let me ask a question
to Mr. Kim Joon Ho this time.

1390
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,200
Mr. Kim, how old are you?

1391
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,430
You must think
you're a big star now.

1392
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,260
Excuse me! How could he...

1393
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,510
(You must think
you're a big star now, Se Chan.)

1394
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,800
Why would he be mad?
As a fellow candidate...

1395
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,010
Bo Pil!

1396
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:08,950
- You should answer his question.
- Se Chan thinks he's a big star.

1397
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,220
- What are you doing?
- You should answer his question.

1398
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,340
He was just a little kid.

1399
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,490
- He was just a kid.
- You should answer his question.

1400
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,510
Why would you say that?

1401
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,780
- Shall I take the initiative now?
- Sure.

1402
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,360
Mr. Ji, how old are you?

1403
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,530
I'm 56 this year.

1404
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,390
- You'll turn 57 next year.
- That's right.

1405
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:25,660
He's turning 57?

1406
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,490
When do you plan to retire?

1407
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:28,570
- Me?
- Yes.

1408
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:29,910
I'll reveal that there.

1409
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:33,610
- I'll retire when I turn 60.
- Really?

1410
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:36,110
(I'll retire when I turn 60.)

1411
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:37,180
Really?

1412
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:38,640
Really?

1413
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:43,490
(I'll retire when I turn 60.)

1414
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:45,180
That's only a few years away.

1415
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,090
- It's only three years away.
- That's only a few years away.

1416
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:48,090
That's only a few years away.

1417
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:49,780
- You should make it clear.
- Make it clear.

1418
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,590
Make it clear. When you turn...

1419
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:55,820
I'll start my career again
when I turn 60.

1420
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,720
I believe
my second heyday will come.

1421
00:46:58,570 --> 00:46:59,740
Then when are you planning
to retire?

1422
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,340
When I can't walk on my own...

1423
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,800
That's what you think.

1424
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,370
But you never know what will happen.
You might get fired next week.

1425
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:06,430
- That's true.
- Let's say...

1426
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:07,910
- Of course.
- you got fired from Running Man.

1427
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:09,780
Do you have a retirement plan?

1428
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,370
I think Running Man
will be my last show.

1429
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:14,450
Are you sure?

1430
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:15,970
- Hold on.
- What about "Tteokbokki Brothers?"

1431
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,010
What about "Tteokbokki Brothers?"

1432
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:20,050
- All right.
- Okay.

1433
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,160
I'll ask Mr. Kim Jong Kook...

1434
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,620
- a question.
- Me? All right.

1435
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:26,450
Do you actually...
Please answer it honestly.

1436
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:29,990
If I succeed in inviting Eun Hye
to the show next year...

1437
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:34,890
Hold on.
When you take the initiative,

1438
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:38,140
you should ask questions
about the pledges...

1439
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:41,200
and attack the opposing candidates.

1440
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,870
I don't plan to do that at all.

1441
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,570
I'm asking what you think
about my pledge.

1442
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,550
Why would you get me involved
in your pledge?

1443
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,340
You should ask a question about me.

1444
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,890
I wanted to see
if you're willing to execute it.

1445
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:53,280
- Execute it?
- If you can invite her.

1446
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,780
Why would you ask me that?
You should ask her!

1447
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,990
All right.

1448
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:59,890
- He's full of anger.
- You're quite sensitive.

1449
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:02,220
I mean, why would you ask me that?

1450
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,700
I'm curious.
Why do you only ask his opinion?

1451
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,890
(Why do you only ask his opinion?)

1452
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:11,300
- All of a sudden?
- Doesn't my opinion matter too?

1453
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,870
Is that so?

1454
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,340
Hold on.

1455
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,070
(Laughing)

1456
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:17,110
- Hold on.
- Is that so?

1457
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:19,840
- Why would you leave me out?
- Will you be okay with it?

1458
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,010
I don't like the idea.

1459
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:24,950
(I don't like the idea.)

1460
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,010
Well done.

1461
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,220
You don't like the idea
of inviting Eun Hye?

1462
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,950
One of our members
is against the idea.

1463
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:33,990
Then this makes...

1464
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:37,090
But still,
even if she's against the idea,

1465
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,820
people will be more interested
in it.

1466
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,890
That's a good approach.

1467
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:42,800
Anyway, I'll have to consider
various factors,

1468
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,200
- but I'll proceed with the plan.
- That's great.

1469
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,070
I promise to...

1470
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,280
(He promises to keep his pledge.)

1471
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,700
I haven't even begun.

1472
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,280
- Let me take the initiative now.
- All right.

1473
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,010
We're discussing
who would perform well next year,

1474
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:58,950
but if you think about
the special talents of the members,

1475
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:02,360
they're all lousy.

1476
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,390
- Isn't yours the lousiest?
- We...

1477
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:06,530
- His talent is old fashioned.
- We...

1478
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,530
The one where he rolls his eyes.

1479
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,970
- That's the lousiest one.
- It's the worst.

1480
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:12,090
The one where he goes like this.

1481
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,700
This is supposed to be my turn!

1482
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:16,870
Starting with So Min,

1483
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,340
you should all show
a new special talent.

1484
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,840
- A new special talent?
- A new one?

1485
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,240
So Min has the most special talents
among us.

1486
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,550
She does.

1487
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:25,970
- Can you impersonate Jeon Do Yeon?
- Jeon Do Yeon.

1488
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:29,320
"Sung Tae! Hey, Gu Sung Tae."

1489
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:32,120
- She's really good.
- Yes, So Min is good.

1490
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,120
- She's good.
- She is.

1491
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,780
- Can you do one, Se Chan?
- Shall I impersonate Kim Jung Min?

1492
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,860
- Kim Jung Min?
- That's a good one.

1493
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,160
- Kim Jung Min of...
- You mean the singer?

1494
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,220
(Impersonating Kim Jung Min
of MSG Wannabe)

1495
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,720
It'll be very brief.

1496
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,590
(Come out)

1497
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:44,120
(Let's go somewhere)

1498
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,890
(Gosh, that startled me)

1499
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,530
(There's a man)

1500
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,240
Stop it. It's funny enough.

1501
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,930
- What?
- Stop it since it's funny.

1502
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:53,180
You told me to do it!

1503
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,780
We all have special talents.

1504
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,780
(Candidate Kim Joon Ho falls behind
his junior comedian.)

1505
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,140
Do you have one, Suk Jin?

1506
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,570
I'm a man
with excellent special talents.

1507
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,820
But I haven't had a chance
to develop them.

1508
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,010
- He will never develop them.
- He hasn't had a chance?

1509
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,910
- I'll impersonate Lim Byung Soo.
- Until when are you going to...

1510
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:08,780
- impersonate him?
- I'll impersonate Lim Byung Soo.

1511
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,320
(The hit singer
of the 70s and 80s...)

1512
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,160
(whose footage is difficult to find)

1513
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,090
"Hello, everyone.
I'm Lim Byung Soo."

1514
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,220
(Saying I love you)

1515
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,220
(Is too common)

1516
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,470
That's so old.

1517
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,640
(His lousy special talent
with sweet voice)

1518
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,200
We should be looking forward
to how 2022 will turn out.

1519
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:25,870
I'll impersonate Baek Seol Hee now.

1520
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,530
(My heart)

1521
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:30,200
This is seriously old.

1522
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,200
(Is beating)

1523
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,570
He passed the comedian audition
with this.

1524
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,570
He passed...

1525
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:37,590
(It's a lousy special talent
from 30 years ago.)

1526
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,620
Gosh, Father. You're doing so well.

1527
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,950
This is just...

1528
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:43,360
(Showing off his singing skill)

1529
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,550
Isn't he just too much?

1530
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,860
Take your initiative.

1531
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,720
I asked him to show
a new special talent.

1532
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,930
It's like his 60th birthday party.

1533
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:50,120
Wasn't that hilarious?

1534
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,590
He's been doing this
since his debut.

1535
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,740
He's seriously incredible.

1536
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:57,800
The young writers of the show
don't even know who they are.

1537
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,570
- It's funny though.
- He's horrible.

1538
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:01,840
Wasn't it fun to watch
even if you didn't know them?

1539
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,180
It was fun to watch, right?

1540
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,200
Mr. Yoo Jae Suk, you should
come up with a new special talent.

1541
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,010
Let me impersonate Jong Kook.
It's been a while since I did.

1542
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,240
- Sorry?
- Jong Kook?

1543
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,220
- You'll impersonate me?
- I don't do it often.

1544
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,410
A few of us know
that I sound exactly like him.

1545
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:16,530
We do.

1546
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:18,120
- I'll sing "One Man."
- "One Man?"

1547
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:22,120
(There is a man)

1548
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,300
(This man sounds super petty.)

1549
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,840
He's making fun of you!

1550
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,140
- You're taunting him.
- You should punch him for it.

1551
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,470
- He made fun of you!
- No.

1552
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:31,470
- That's not it.
- He's making fun of you.

1553
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:32,470
How could he do that?

1554
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:35,470
(I'm always in the same place)

1555
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,510
My voice isn't working well today.

1556
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:38,550
(Brazen)

1557
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:40,050
(Right then,
the fake singer steps forward.)

1558
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:41,840
Usually, my voice
is in good condition.

1559
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,320
(There is a man)

1560
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,490
What was that?

1561
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,340
(He starts the second part
of his dinner show.)

1562
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,180
- I'll show you my special talent.
- What was that?

1563
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,890
- Which one?
- I'll show you my special talent.

1564
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,590
(Twisting joints)

1565
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:56,450
- That must hurt.
- What do you think?

1566
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,160
That was my special talent.

1567
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,200
- Gosh, he twisted my arm.
- That must've hurt.

1568
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,200
He almost tore off my muscles.

1569
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:03,970
That was my special talent.

1570
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:06,970
Is it still my turn?

1571
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:08,930
- I'll ask Haha a question.
- Your turn is over.

1572
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:10,370
- It's over?
- Your turn is over.

1573
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:11,570
- It's over?
- Yes.

1574
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,620
Gosh, I wasted my turn
on the lousy special talents.

1575
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,470
(The end of a lousy talent show
that hasn't improved for 20 years)

1576
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,320
It's been 20 years
since I last developed one.

1577
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,890
Now, we'll do a mid-checkup.

1578
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:23,430
Based on what you learned
through the debate,

1579
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,220
write down the name of the person
you're not looking forward to.

1580
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,990
- The one I don't look forward to?
- The one I don't look forward to?

1581
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:30,990
Yes, pick the worst one
and submit it later.

1582
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,930
Whom should I pick?

1583
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:34,570
In one...

1584
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:36,610
Gosh, whom should I pick?

1585
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:37,660
Two,

1586
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:39,510
three!

1587
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:42,910
(The mid-checkup results
will be revealed soon.)

1588
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,450
One vote for Haha,

1589
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,950
one vote for Jong Kook,

1590
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:48,680
three votes for Joon Ho,

1591
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:51,890
and three votes for Suk Jin.

1592
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:56,180
Joon Ho and Suk Jin were picked
as the worst candidates.

1593
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,720
(Mid-checkup, Worst candidates,
Kim Joon Ho, Ji Suk Jin)

1594
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,760
- Who voted for me?
- For the two of you...

1595
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,090
- This is great.
- The members next to them...

1596
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,260
will put makeup on them
before the final appeal.

1597
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,700
- They'll put on makeup?
- Yes.

1598
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:07,160
- On Suk Jin?
- Yes.

1599
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,370
Wait. For Joon Ho...

1600
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:10,340
He can handle
pretty much everything.

1601
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,340
- I've done it a lot.
- He can handle everything.

1602
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:15,070
- Nothing will be that bad.
- It won't be bad.

1603
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,280
His plain face itself
is the funniest.

1604
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,050
- I'm handsome for a comedian.
- You're funny as is.

1605
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:23,390
(The youngest members help
with Candidate Ji's makeup.)

1606
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:25,340
- He's bleeding.
- It won't be fun if it's too much.

1607
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,550
(Putting on a straight face)

1608
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,890
He's telling us not to put a lot...

1609
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:30,120
- because it won't be fun.
- He just yelled at us.

1610
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,930
We can't help with his makeup
because he's disheartening us.

1611
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:34,220
- He won't let us!
- He's complaining.

1612
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,700
Let us do it however we want.

1613
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,120
Se Chan, you should make
his eyebrows droopy.

1614
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,370
Yes, they should be.

1615
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:40,490
- Make them droopy.
- You're making me look like a fool.

1616
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,990
If you add too much,
it won't be fun.

1617
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:43,470
What are you putting on my ear?
It won't be seen anyway.

1618
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,110
- I'm coloring it.
- Hey.

1619
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:46,430
Just let me do it!

1620
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,640
- Suk Jin.
- His ear...

1621
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,200
- So Min, that's a bit...
- His ear is bleeding.

1622
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,370
- It can't be seen anyway.
- No, it will be.

1623
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:53,450
- It's hard to erase it.
- So Min, that's too much.

1624
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:54,450
That's too much.

1625
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:56,180
- You're cute.
- He's cute.

1626
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,090
- It's hilarious.
- Only my right side is red.

1627
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:59,090
(They look more sallow
because of their red ears.)

1628
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:01,360
That's the end of the debate.

1629
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,360
You call that a debate?

1630
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,720
What does that make us?

1631
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,160
- Sorry?
- What does that make us?

1632
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,450
They put makeup on you so that
you can raise their expectations.

1633
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,800
Oh, is that so?

1634
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,220
You keep...

1635
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,590
- It doesn't mean anything.
- It's okay.

1636
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,700
- That's it? We just put on makeup?
- Or the two of them...

1637
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,340
- There was no reason.
- Just randomly?

1638
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,760
Those who just tuned in
might wonder what we are.

1639
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,280
All right, now.

1640
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,680
Every staff member
is holding a ballot.

1641
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,640
Everyone, please take a look
at my pledges.

1642
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,910
- Everyone, let's become rich.
- Everyone.

1643
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:30,740
Keep up with the trend.
They're not meaningless.

1644
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:33,450
- You should read the trend.
- I'm the kingmaker.

1645
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,890
Everyone.

1646
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:37,620
(Ji Suk Jin,
"Old ways are the best.")

1647
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:40,430
(Yoo Jae Suk, "I'll keep the pledge
that will draw attention.")

1648
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:43,370
(Song Ji Hyo, "I'll communicate
with the world.")

1649
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,590
(After each candidate's
last remark,)

1650
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:49,470
(the staff members
carefully cast their votes.)

1651
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:50,530
(Who will they pick
as the celebrity...)

1652
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:51,610
(who has the most promising year
in 2022?)

1653
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:54,010
- Everyone, we have the results.
- All right.

1654
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,740
I'd be grateful if just one of you
voted for me.

1655
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,950
- I don't think I'd get one.
- Let's just hit the average.

1656
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,740
The total number of votes is 97.

1657
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,010
Ninety-seven votes? That's a lot.

1658
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,070
All right, now.

1659
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:05,340
There were some who wrote
their reasons.

1660
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,490
- Oh, really?
- I'll read them to you.

1661
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:08,550
- Reasons?
- This person picked Jae Suk.

1662
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:10,360
- Yes?
- They wrote only one thing.

1663
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,680
- What does it say?
- "Yoon Eun Hye."

1664
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,160
(The reason they voted for Jae Suk
was Yoon Eun Hye.)

1665
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,160
- My gosh.
- That was his pledge.

1666
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,700
- I knew my pledge was strong.
- It's one of the production crew.

1667
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,970
Another person
who picked Jae Suk...

1668
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,640
said, "I'm in charge of him,
so he needs to do well."

1669
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,740
("I'm in charge of him,
so he needs to do well.")

1670
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,260
I can tell who wrote that.

1671
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,240
(Jae Suk's cameraman
played favorites with him.)

1672
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,430
- Next is So Min.
- Someone picked me?

1673
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,950
- "Let's go, the Year of the Tiger."
- Who wrote that?

1674
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,700
I was also born in the Year of
the Tiger. Why didn't you pick me?

1675
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,010
- Who wrote it?
- I'm in the Year of the Tiger too.

1676
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:36,990
You see? You were born
in the Year of the Rat.

1677
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:38,840
- Let me announce the results.
- The Year of the Rat?

1678
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,840
Okay.

1679
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,410
(Announcing the final results)

1680
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,530
- First place...
- It must be Jae Suk.

1681
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:44,780
won 25 votes.

1682
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:45,820
(1st place, 25 votes)

1683
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,530
(First-place candidate
won 25 votes out of 97.)

1684
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:48,590
- It must be Jae Suk.
- It must be Jae Suk.

1685
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,220
I'd be glad if I got just one vote.

1686
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,640
(1st place, 25 votes)

1687
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,160
It's Ji Suk Jin.

1688
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,410
What?

1689
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:00,610
(Ji Suk Jin won 1st place
in the list of a celebrity...)

1690
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:03,240
(that will have a promising year
in 2022.)

1691
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,910
Thank you so much, everyone!

1692
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:07,240
- What's so promising about him?
- I'll work hard.

1693
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,740
- What's so promising about him?
- Everyone!

1694
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,550
I'm sorry that
I don't recognize you sometimes.

1695
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:12,340
Earlier, he showed
an old-fashioned special talent.

1696
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,720
I'm always grateful.

1697
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,220
What is this?

1698
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,590
(An encore stage
to celebrate his win)

1699
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:23,470
(His sweet voice melted
the hearts of staff members.)

1700
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:27,840
(A shoulder dance is a must
at a party.)

1701
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,470
(They can't help but get excited.)

1702
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,640
- You're doing well.
- All right!

1703
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,970
Good job.

1704
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:35,280
That suits him well.

1705
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:38,550
- That was hilarious.
- How did Suk Jin win first place?

1706
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:40,950
I know. Thank you so much.

1707
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,470
Next is second place.

1708
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:46,240
(2nd place)

1709
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,510
Second place won seventeen votes.

1710
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,590
(2nd place, 17 votes)

1711
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,160
- It's Yang Se Chan.
- What?

1712
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,950
(2nd place, 17 votes, Yang Se Chan)

1713
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,090
It's Se Chan?

1714
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:54,720
Thank you so much!

1715
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:58,200
(He puts on an encore performance
right away.)

1716
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,930
(Gosh, that startled me)

1717
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:02,840
They voted for me?
Thank you so much.

1718
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,140
(Se Chan gets 18 chocolates
for winning 2nd place.)

1719
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,410
Thank you, everyone.

1720
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,910
Gosh, I need to come in
fourth place, at least.

1721
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:09,240
Next is third place.

1722
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:10,570
Third place won fifteen votes.

1723
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:11,840
(3rd place, 15 votes)

1724
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,840
It's Yoo Jae Suk.

1725
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,640
- As expected.
- He can't get better than this.

1726
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,010
Please look forward to
my performance next year.

1727
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,180
- You can do it!
- Shouldn't Joon Ho...

1728
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,510
come in fourth place?

1729
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,890
If you don't put me in fourth place,

1730
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:26,090
- you'll all get penalties.
- You're right.

1731
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:28,320
You should've encouraged me.

1732
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,450
- I forgot about that.
- Seeing how things are going,

1733
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:30,590
I think you'll win fourth place.

1734
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:32,700
- I forgot about that.
- I forgot about that.

1735
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,890
All right. Fourth place...

1736
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,240
- won 13 votes.
- Kim Joon Ho.

1737
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,840
It's Kim Jong Kook.

1738
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,840
- Joon Ho won fourth place?
- No, Jong Kook did.

1739
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,240
- It's me?
- It's Jong Kook?

1740
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,070
- It's me.
- Gosh, seriously.

1741
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,340
Goodness.

1742
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,640
- Jong Kook...
- He should be in fourth place.

1743
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,740
Fifth place won ten votes.
It's Song Ji Hyo.

1744
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,050
- What happened, Joon Ho?
- Joon Ho...

1745
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,240
Why is he even here?

1746
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,220
Sixth place won nine votes.
It's Jeon So Min.

1747
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:56,620
- What's wrong with him?
- This is...

1748
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:58,780
Next is seventh place.

1749
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,360
Seventh place won six votes.
It's Kim Joon Ho.

1750
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,700
- I'm in seventh place?
- What? I'm in last place?

1751
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,530
- Kim Joon Ho.
- I'm in seventh place?

1752
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:06,120
Haha, you're in last place.
You won three votes.

1753
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:07,700
Three votes?

1754
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,800
Go and get more votes
from "How Do You Play?"

1755
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:11,700
No one will vote for you here!

1756
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,030
Go and get more votes
from "How Do You Play?"

1757
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,340
You should just join
"How Do You Play?"

1758
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:16,430
Why do you keep bringing that up?

1759
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,740
- I mean...
- Don't mention that show here.

1760
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:20,450
Many of our staff members
felt betrayed.

1761
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:23,140
That's not true! Don't be like this.

1762
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,740
I value Running Man more!

1763
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:25,910
Thank you, anyway.

1764
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:26,910
(Thank you, anyway.)

1765
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:29,590
(At least Haha
won Jae Suk's heart.)

1766
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,550
I'll tell you Joon Ho's ranking
according to the results.

1767
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:35,990
Joon Ho got 8 chocolates
because he's in 7th place.

1768
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:37,320
(Joon Ho got only 8 chocolates
for winning 7th place.)

1769
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,490
- And?
- But...

1770
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,820
he's in second place.

1771
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:42,240
- I'm in second place?
- He must have a lot.

1772
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,700
He increased the number
through betting.

1773
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,370
He earned more chocolates
through betting.

1774
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,970
- He was betting separately.
- Don't make bets!

1775
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:49,740
He was betting separately.

1776
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,700
- You should promise me.
- He did what?

1777
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,050
- Seriously?
- Why would you do that on our show?

1778
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:56,470
- Stop betting, Joon Ho.
- Why would you keep betting them?

1779
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:58,240
Why would you do that on our show?

1780
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,180
I only tried to win some chocolates.

1781
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:03,590
Suk Jin and Se Chan who won
1st and 2nd place,

1782
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:04,950
I'll tell you your ranking.
Please come forward.

1783
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:05,950
- They'll only share it with us.
- All right.

1784
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:07,530
Joon Ho must be in fourth place
at least.

1785
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:09,090
- Yes, he must.
- Right?

1786
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:10,800
(Sharing his ranking)

1787
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,840
Did I hear that right?

1788
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:16,570
I won 1st place this time,
but I'm in 8th place overall?

1789
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,910
I'm in 8th place out of 8?

1790
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:20,200
(Despite getting 20 chocolates,
he's in last place.)

1791
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:23,010
Let's move on to the room
where you can play One or the Other.

1792
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:25,070
- All right.
- All right.

1793
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:28,180
- Which room should I pick?
- Oh, gosh.

1794
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,780
What is this? I haven't played it.

1795
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:31,720
- It's Russian roulette.
- I see.

1796
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,160
- You two should play.
- I'm betting everything I got.

1797
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,280
- You're betting the whole thing?
- Yes.

1798
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,780
- I'll bet everything.
- You shouldn't...

1799
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,220
- You shouldn't bet like this.
- You shouldn't do this.

1800
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,220
No, I'll give it a try.

1801
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,320
- No, this is...
- You shouldn't bet everything.

1802
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,890
I'm infuriated
because I lost earlier.

1803
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:44,720
- I'll bet six.
- But you should be...

1804
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,970
in fourth place, at least.

1805
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:48,430
It's go big or go home.

1806
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:49,530
It has a 50-50 chance.

1807
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:51,160
- It has a 50-50 chance.
- Here's my bet.

1808
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,110
If the balloon pops,

1809
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:54,930
- then Suk Jin will be eliminated.
- How many times can he...

1810
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:56,280
What if it pops on the last bullet?

1811
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,740
(Will he be able to break the jinx?)

1812
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,340
(Popping)

1813
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:03,280
(Unlike everyone's expectation,
he popped the balloon at once.)

1814
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,720
- I told you I'd bet more!
- You were right.

1815
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,360
- Goodness.
- Darn it.

1816
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,590
- I'll double the amount you bet.
- All right. Thank you.

1817
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:11,590
(Joon Ho wins
a total of 48 chocolates.)

1818
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:12,780
That's a lot.

1819
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,260
I won 48 chocolates.

1820
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:17,300
- Are you joining this room?
- You can go in there.

1821
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:20,090
- What are we playing?
- The game you'll be playing...

1822
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:21,430
is Dial Tone Odd or Even.

1823
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:24,030
- Sorry?
- You'll have to choose...

1824
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:26,140
whether your friend
will pick up the call...

1825
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:28,280
after it rings in odd numbers
or even numbers.

1826
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,950
If your guess is right, you'll get
double the amount you bet.

1827
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:35,550
Gosh, this is the difficult part.

1828
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:37,180
How do we know
when they'll pick up?

1829
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,860
I'll bet ten.

1830
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:43,120
(Haha bets 10 chocolates.)

1831
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,160
Which one?

1832
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:47,030
- I bet on odd numbers.
- You bet ten on odd numbers.

1833
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:48,050
I'll bet ten on even numbers.

1834
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,590
You bet ten on even numbers.

1835
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:51,700
I'm calling Geun Sik.

1836
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:52,930
- That's one.
- One.

1837
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:54,530
- Who are you calling?
- I'm calling Geun Sik.

1838
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:58,840
(It rings once.)

1839
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,240
Two. That's an even number.

1840
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,070
Pick it up!

1841
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:06,450
- Pick it up!
- Hey, Haha.

1842
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:08,550
Geun Sik, I love you.
I'm shooting Running Man right now.

1843
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:11,490
You're indeed my best friend.
Thanks a lot!

1844
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:14,680
Since you succeeded,
I'll give you 20 chocolates.

1845
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,160
Gosh, what do I do?

1846
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,620
I can watch how she does, right?

1847
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,820
I'll call my mom.

1848
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:21,160
(So Min, who bet on even numbers,
decides to call her mom.)

1849
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,620
- Odd.
- That's one.

1850
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,120
(It rings once.)

1851
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,970
(So Min bet on even numbers.)

1852
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:31,430
Even.

1853
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,970
(She picked up at an even number!)

1854
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:34,240
Mom, I love you.

1855
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,800
(Mom, I love you.
I'll call you later.)

1856
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,450
I'm in the middle of a shoot.
I'll talk to you later.

1857
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:40,640
Okay.

1858
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,450
She's not surprised at all.

1859
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,740
(So Min, who bet on even numbers,
wins 20 chocolates.)

1860
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,620
- That was incredible.
- Haha.

1861
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,760
I'll never come back to this room.

1862
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,780
- I won't come back either.
- This room...

1863
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,120
- It's not to my liking.
- It's too difficult.

1864
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,180
Let's go to the other room.
The TMI Room.

1865
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,720
I'll ask you TMI questions
about the members.

1866
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:55,800
(Jae Suk entered the TMI Room.)

1867
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,120
What's Se Chan's body secret?

1868
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,200
His hair grows
on the left nipple only.

1869
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,490
His hair grows
on the mole on his butt.

1870
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,240
The question repulses me.

1871
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,240
(The question repulses me.)

1872
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,240
(What's Se Chan's body secret?)

1873
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,340
It repulses so much.

1874
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,970
It's the TMI that he shared himself.

1875
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:13,050
Gosh, this is...

1876
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:14,740
What did you say?
What about his nipple?

1877
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:18,720
His hair grows
on the left nipple only.

1878
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:20,760
(She fails to hold her laughter.)

1879
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,760
(The TMI makes
the staff laugh as well.)

1880
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,890
His hair grows
on the mole on his butt.

1881
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:24,890
(The TMI makes
the staff laugh as well.)

1882
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:27,890
The hair is supposedly very long.

1883
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,030
His hair grows
on the left nipple only?

1884
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,320
(Laughing)

1885
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:35,530
Let's go. Why can't I?

1886
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:37,530
- You can play with him.
- All right.

1887
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:38,970
I'll tell you the question.

1888
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:40,070
(He joins Jae Suk
without knowing what it is.)

1889
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:41,430
- By the way...
- This is TMI Choice.

1890
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:42,910
Did you earn some?

1891
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:44,180
No, I lost them.

1892
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,050
This is TMI Choice.

1893
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:47,970
What's Se Chan's body secret?

1894
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:50,450
His hair grows
on the left nipple only.

1895
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:52,840
His hair grows
on the mole on his butt.

1896
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:54,890
The question is so repulsive.

1897
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,090
His hair grows
on the left nipple only.

1898
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,820
His hair grows
on the mole on his butt.

1899
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:01,160
- On the mole on his butt?
- On the mole on his butt. Yes.

1900
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,720
(Sighing)

1901
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,720
Can the hair grow
on the left nipple only?

1902
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:08,160
I can't believe
I have to think about this.

1903
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:10,160
This is driving me crazy.
Do I need to worry about this?

1904
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:12,910
It's impossible to have hair grow
on the left nipple only.

1905
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:15,110
You could have hair grow on a mole.

1906
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,470
But how does he know
he has a mole on his butt?

1907
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:20,370
I am not sure about this.

1908
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:22,240
- Nipple.
- I will go with the nipple too.

1909
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,410
(Jae Suk bets 1 chocolate
on the nipple.)

1910
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:24,450
Please place your bet.

1911
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:26,390
Does anyone grow hair
on the left nipple only?

1912
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:27,590
I don't even know.

1913
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:28,780
(Suk Jin bets 2 chocolates
on the nipple.)

1914
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:30,160
What's the answer?

1915
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,280
- I am so curious.
- Se Chan's body secret is...

1916
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:35,490
(Is it about the left nipple
or the mole on the butt?)

1917
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:39,430
(They have seen Se Chan's nipples
and butt in the past 5 years.)

1918
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,800
What's the answer?

1919
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,640
- I am so curious.
- Se Chan's body secret is...

1920
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,080
that his hair grows
on the left nipple only.

1921
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,410
I should have bet
all the chocolates.

1922
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:01,500
His hair grows
on the left nipple only.

1923
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,750
(Both of them are correct.)

1924
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,910
He wouldn't have known
about hair on his butt.

1925
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:07,020
For goodness' sake.

1926
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:08,750
(They didn't win much since they bet
only a few chocolates.)

1927
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,980
I heard that you have a body secret.
Please reveal what it is.

1928
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,290
I don't know
if it's exactly a body secret.

1929
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:16,850
Hair grows...

1930
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,190
around my left nipple.

1931
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:23,140
(He readily agreed to show it.)

1932
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:26,460
- All right, We will film it.
- It's right here.

1933
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:27,540
(Surprisingly,
he was telling the truth.)

1934
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:30,640
Why does he have hair
on his left nipple only?

1935
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:33,870
How annoying! It makes no sense.

1936
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,870
He would be
the most annoyed about it.

1937
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:38,540
- He would be the most annoyed.
- That's right.

1938
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,540
- He would be the most annoyed.
- Hair on the left nipple only.

1939
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:43,520
- Why does it grow there only?
- Why does it grow there only?

1940
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,350
- The left nipple.
- Is it the same for his armpit?

1941
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:47,620
They wouldn't know.

1942
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:49,500
How would Hyung In know that?

1943
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,100
Maybe his body hair grows
on the left side only.

1944
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:54,160
- Let's have another one.
- Let's have another one.

1945
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:55,390
I can give you a question
about someone else.

1946
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:56,870
- Really?
- Let's have another one.

1947
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:58,500
This is the most interesting.

1948
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:00,770
You want to bet all chocolates.

1949
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:01,910
Please give us another one.

1950
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:04,210
(The production crew
provides an additional question.)

1951
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:07,040
- Jong Kook has a mole on his neck.
- Okay.

1952
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:09,770
Is it on his left or right side?

1953
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:11,020
I know this.

1954
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:12,310
(Is Jong Kook's neck mole
on his left side or right side?)

1955
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,410
Is it on his left or right side?

1956
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:18,060
Isn't it on his right side?

1957
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:19,430
I think it's on his right side.

1958
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,460
How about you, Jong Kook?

1959
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,790
- I am from Anyang.
- Yes.

1960
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:26,230
(He saw Jong Kook's neck mole
every week for the past 11 years.)

1961
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:28,100
(He definitely saw it.)

1962
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:29,940
My goodness.

1963
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:31,190
Which side is which?

1964
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:33,330
- The left side and right side.
- I will choose the right side.

1965
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:35,210
- Did you bet everything?
- I bet everything.

1966
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:36,410
I don't know.

1967
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,980
How many chocolates are there?

1968
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,100
There are 71 chocolates.

1969
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,500
You bet 71 chocolates.

1970
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,480
- I will bet all chocolates too.
- You will bet on the right side.

1971
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,870
- Yes.
- There are 71 chocolates.

1972
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:45,910
(Both of them went all in
on the right side.)

1973
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:47,910
Jong Kook's neck mole is...

1974
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,810
(What will be the answer?)

1975
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,790
on his left side.

1976
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:53,930
(The left side)

1977
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:55,060
I am sorry.

1978
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:56,930
- Why did you ask about the number?
- Hyung In.

1979
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:57,960
Seriously.

1980
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,100
- Why did you ask about the number?
- Hyung In.

1981
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:03,160
(The production crew takes
all the chocolates.)

1982
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,290
What a strange producer!

1983
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:06,960
- Why did you ask?
- Why did you ask?

1984
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:08,460
I was curious.

1985
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:10,730
For goodness' sake.

1986
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:12,100
You can leave now.

1987
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:14,270
Are you telling us to get lost?

1988
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:19,480
(They lose all the chocolates
they collected during the day.)

1989
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:22,790
Suk Jin. I was waiting for my turn.

1990
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:24,810
- Why did you cut in line?
- Jong Kook.

1991
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,460
Your mole is
really on the left side.

1992
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:29,500
(He cries blood.)

1993
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,660
It's on the left side.

1994
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:34,770
(They hear a cheer
from the neighboring room.)

1995
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:38,660
(The icon of promise won big
from playing Russian roulette.)

1996
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,870
(He won 96 chocolates!)

1997
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:44,910
(He became rich in chocolates.)

1998
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:46,410
You won 96 chocolates.

1999
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:47,540
That's great.

2000
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,210
Joon Ho, kids watch this show.

2001
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:51,680
Kids love this show.

2002
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,940
If you show
that kind of a reaction...

2003
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:57,580
Hey, these are chocolates.

2004
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,960
I should make another call.

2005
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,190
- Does it pay well?
- I will bet everything.

2006
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:03,730
This is the last one.

2007
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:06,000
(He enters the TMI Room
as haughty as ever.)

2008
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,870
This is your last chance.

2009
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:10,790
I have too many chocolates.

2010
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,560
That's insane.

2011
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,710
What's Se Chan's body secret?

2012
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:18,180
His hair grows
on the left nipple only.

2013
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:20,270
His hair grows
on the mole on his butt.

2014
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,440
- That's disgusting.
- I saw it.

2015
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:26,640
Seriously.

2016
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,850
(Everyone reacts the same way
to the question.)

2017
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:29,440
I saw it.

2018
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:31,750
It's strange...

2019
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:33,980
that hair grows
on only one of the nipples.

2020
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:35,850
I think I heard about it.

2021
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:37,660
I think he got drunk and
told me about it tearfully.

2022
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:41,460
Please place your bet.

2023
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,560
The chest.

2024
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:46,460
- Eight, ten...
- Joon Ho.

2025
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,230
Let's bet on the same thing.

2026
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:49,810
- Two, one.
- A mole on the butt is strange too.

2027
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,180
- What is up with you?
- I hit the jackpot.

2028
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,350
(Heavy)

2029
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:55,680
I hit the jackpot over there.

2030
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,410
I went all in and hit the jackpot.

2031
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:58,540
(She hit the jackpot
and became a new-rich.)

2032
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,890
(Did she hit the jackpot?)

2033
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:03,560
Shall we go?

2034
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,980
What will it be?

2035
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,980
Three, two...

2036
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:06,980
I choose the nipple.

2037
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:07,980
(Joon Ho suddenly opens his bag.)

2038
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,080
How about you, Joon Ho?

2039
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,290
Will you go all in?

2040
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:14,500
The butt.

2041
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,620
(He bets everything on the butt.)

2042
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:17,890
(The icon of promise
was motivated by So Min.)

2043
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:19,270
So Min motivated me.

2044
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:21,100
Se Chan's body secret is...

2045
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,770
I chose the nipple
and Joon Ho chose the butt.

2046
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:26,850
(Haha bet on the nipple
and Joon Ho bet on the butt.)

2047
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,640
I chose the nipple
and Joon Ho chose the butt.

2048
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:30,640
His hair grows
on the left nipple only.

2049
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,680
(The answer is the left nipple.)

2050
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,580
His hair grows
on the left nipple only.

2051
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,160
(His eyes become unfocused.)

2052
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,560
I will give you ten chocolates.

2053
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:40,980
It's So Min's fault.

2054
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:43,120
Why did she have to enter
and run her mouth?

2055
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:45,250
Please move on to the next mission.

2056
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,360
Use this for transportation.

2057
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,400
- Forget it.
- Use this for transportation.

2058
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,070
Give me five chocolates.

2059
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,700
Eat gukbap too.

2060
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:53,770
Five chocolates.

2061
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:55,530
- Don't walk home, okay?
- For goodness' sake.

2062
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:56,740
(The icon of promise
sacrificed himself for a lesson.)

2063
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,780
I shouldn't have entered this room.

2064
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:01,310
What a lousy room.

2065
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:03,850
I shouldn't have entered this room.

2066
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:05,020
(Thus, his life turned bitter.)

2067
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,070
For goodness' sake.

2068
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:07,080
(The second One or the Other ends.)

2069
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:10,390
- We will now have the last mission.
- Okay.

2070
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:12,080
We have to point out...

2071
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,560
that Joon Ho...

2072
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,650
He is a fool.

2073
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:17,860
How many times
did I tell you not to do that?

2074
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,530
Gosh, that really hurt.

2075
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,270
I told you...

2076
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:23,460
not to do that.

2077
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:24,900
I told you to stop
when you won chocolates.

2078
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:27,810
- I told you not to do that.
- So Min bragged about her winnings.

2079
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:30,700
Why did you bet recklessly
just because she won chocolates?

2080
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:33,650
We need to make him number four.

2081
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:35,780
- He needs to move up the ranks.
- Seriously.

2082
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:38,450
I will explain the last mission.

2083
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:40,450
In the last mission, you will see...

2084
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:43,390
the difference between Joon Ho,
the easy Kim Grand Award,

2085
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:47,750
and Jong Kook,
the scary Kim Grand Award.

2086
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:50,620
It's Green Light, Red Light
with Kim Grand Award.

2087
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:51,620
What?

2088
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:54,600
The two Kim Grand Awards
will take turns...

2089
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,440
being the traffic cop.

2090
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:58,200
Unlike the traditional version,

2091
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:01,360
everyone will disperse in a minute
before the game starts.

2092
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,680
The traffic cop will walk around...

2093
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:07,070
and say "Green light, red light"
with the walkie-talkie.

2094
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:10,020
The seven members...

2095
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,180
will have a bell on their shoes.

2096
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,950
While the traffic cop
does the chant,

2097
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:16,990
they will search the place
for the four-leaf clover cards.

2098
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:18,750
A lot of cards are hidden.

2099
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:20,780
While the traffic cop chants,

2100
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:23,200
"Green light, red light,"

2101
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,950
- the rest of the members can move.
- Okay.

2102
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:27,230
When the chant ends,

2103
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:28,430
both the traffic cop...

2104
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,570
and other members can't move.

2105
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:32,440
But if you aren't
in his line of sight,

2106
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:33,610
you can search freely.

2107
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:35,330
- I see.
- Do you understand?

2108
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:37,530
Let's say the chant ended...

2109
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,680
and the traffic cop
caught you moving.

2110
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,900
- Then you are out.
- Yes.

2111
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:42,900
Do the traffic cops get chocolates
for catching people?

2112
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,950
Each person you catch will count
as 3 4-leaf clover cards.

2113
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,280
(Each person they catch will count
as 3 4-leaf clover cards.)

2114
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,280
Okay.

2115
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,780
It will be hard. Isn't that right?

2116
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,060
Round One's traffic cop is...

2117
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:52,560
- Jong Kook.
- It will be hard.

2118
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:54,450
You have a minute to hide.

2119
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:55,780
- A minute.
- Then the game will begin...

2120
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,790
- with the chant.
- I bet the cards are outside.

2121
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:00,600
Once you go up,
you won't be able to come back down.

2122
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:01,960
All right.

2123
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,440
(Go to a place where you can find
the four-leaf clover cards!)

2124
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:04,990
All right. Get ready.

2125
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:07,810
Your one minute begins now.

2126
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,500
Find many four-leaf clovers
in order to win.

2127
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,370
Many people are going up the stairs.

2128
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:20,990
(Kim Grand Award listens
to figure out their locations.)

2129
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:23,210
Find many four-leaf clovers
in order to win.

2130
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:25,560
(Joon Ho and Jae Suk go
to the 2nd floor.)

2131
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,450
Where are the four-leaf clovers?

2132
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,990
(Where are the four-leaf clovers?)

2133
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:38,570
(Searching)

2134
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:40,860
Okay. Here is one.

2135
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,860
(It's a four-leaf clover!)

2136
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:44,140
A four-leaf clover.

2137
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:45,680
Okay. It was here.

2138
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,740
I found one.

2139
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:48,200
(The number of four-leaf clovers
will determine the ranking.)

2140
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:51,870
(Se Chan found
a four-leaf clover as well.)

2141
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:53,450
Here.

2142
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:54,490
(1 card)

2143
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:56,080
(2 cards)

2144
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:58,820
This is great. I found two.

2145
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,780
(Everyone is absorbed in the search
for four-leaf clovers.)

2146
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:01,990
You have 20 seconds.

2147
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:03,400
(20 seconds left.)

2148
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,320
There are no cards here.

2149
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:06,460
Do we have 20 seconds left?

2150
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,620
I need to hide now.

2151
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,070
(The members become nervous
with 20 seconds remaining.)

2152
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,700
Where should I hide? Oh, no.

2153
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:13,110
Oh, no.

2154
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:18,900
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan
go up to the 2nd floor.)

2155
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,650
(Suk Jin also
goes up to the 2nd floor.)

2156
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:29,690
Green light...

2157
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:33,750
(Jong Kook sets off.)

2158
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:37,230
(He is on the move.)

2159
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:40,360
Red...

2160
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,530
(So Min is the only one
who is still outside.)

2161
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:47,940
The game has begun.

2162
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:49,160
(The rest of the timid members...)

2163
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,610
(are on the 2nd floor of the house.)

2164
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:56,450
(They hear Jong Kook's voice.)

2165
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:01,450
(But they don't know where he is.)

2166
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,710
(Please.)

2167
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:09,150
(Where will Jong Kook head?)

2168
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,200
Light...

2169
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,790
(He heads to the 2nd floor.)

2170
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:15,930
Red...

2171
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:21,810
(6 members
are searching the 2nd floor.)

2172
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:27,780
(He storms the 2nd floor.)

2173
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:31,150
Light.

2174
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:35,820
(He spots Suk Jin
as he says the last word!)

2175
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:38,520
Green light, red light.

2176
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,930
(Jong Kook takes steps toward him.)

2177
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:43,990
Green light...

2178
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:45,250
(He charges at the target.)

2179
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:46,930
Light...

2180
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:48,930
(He passes by a weak member!)

2181
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:52,330
Red light.

2182
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:53,360
(Suk Jin quickly runs away.)

2183
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,460
Green light,

2184
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:01,480
red light.

2185
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,740
(The tense atmosphere
makes the members hide hurriedly.)

2186
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,850
(Haha spots Jong Kook.)

2187
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:11,560
Red light.

2188
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:19,320
Green light, red...

2189
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,660
(Green light, red...)

2190
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:25,960
Light.

2191
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:28,940
Green light, red light.

2192
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,000
Haha is out.

2193
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:33,180
(Haha ran fast,)

2194
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:35,780
(but he couldn't stop at "Light!")

2195
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:38,450
(Haha is out.)

2196
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:40,080
I am so annoyed.

2197
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:43,020
(News of the first elimination...)

2198
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:46,150
(makes everyone
even more nervous.)

2199
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:50,650
(Ji Hyo)

2200
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:54,730
(Will the members
on the 2nd floor be safe?)

2201
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:57,740
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk came outside.)

2202
01:14:57,990 --> 01:15:00,140
(Walking stealthily)

2203
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:04,180
Green light, red light.

2204
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:05,530
(He finds a four-leaf clover.)

2205
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:09,370
(Ji Hyo is also searching
with bated breath.)

2206
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:12,040
Green light...

2207
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:18,390
Green light, red...

2208
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:20,930
(Suk Jin runs into Jong Kook
again.)

2209
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:22,150
(He runs into Jong Kook
at every turn.)

2210
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,190
light.

2211
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:25,230
Green light, red light.

2212
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:27,700
Green light, red light.

2213
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:31,940
Green light, red light.

2214
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,200
Where is everyone?

2215
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:36,870
What am I going to do?

2216
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:39,110
What am I going to do?

2217
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:46,240
Green light, red light.

2218
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:47,850
Don't come here. Go away.

2219
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:48,950
Go away.

2220
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:50,190
Go away, Jae Suk.

2221
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:51,910
(Jae Suk joins her
against her wish.)

2222
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:52,910
Hey.

2223
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:54,860
Did you find the clovers?

2224
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:56,990
Did you find the clovers?
What do they look like?

2225
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:58,950
- Did you find the clovers?
- They are in envelopes.

2226
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:03,400
Green light, red light.

2227
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:05,490
Where is Jong Kook?

2228
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:12,030
Green light, red light.

2229
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:15,500
Green light, red light.

2230
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:19,110
Green light, red light.

2231
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,690
(It's Jong Kook.)

2232
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:23,190
(Chuckling)

2233
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:25,150
Green light, red light.

2234
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:26,560
(The two targets are on his radar.)

2235
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:27,560
Oh, no.

2236
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:29,360
Green light...

2237
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:33,150
(Jong Kook is watching.)

2238
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,360
Red light.

2239
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,740
(He will be eliminated
if he moves an inch.)

2240
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:40,740
Green light, red light.

2241
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:44,810
Green light, red light.

2242
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:48,540
(So Min couldn't stop at "Light.")

2243
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,710
- So Min, you are out.
- I didn't hear it.

2244
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,520
(So Min is out.)

2245
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,820
The sound broke off.

2246
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,650
I am out.

2247
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:57,710
I couldn't find any clovers.

2248
01:16:57,710 --> 01:16:59,390
(She gets eliminated
without finding any clovers.)

2249
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:02,450
Green light, red light.

2250
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:04,430
(Jong Kook moves.)

2251
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:08,320
Green light, red light.

2252
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,810
Green light, red light.

2253
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:15,400
(He runs to a place
where Jong Kook can't see him.)

2254
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:18,110
Green light...

2255
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:19,240
(He moves as his heart pounds.)

2256
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,280
Red light.

2257
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,850
(My goodness.)

2258
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:26,070
Green light, red light.

2259
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:31,490
(His heart pounds.)

2260
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:35,190
Green light, red light.

2261
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:39,200
Green light, red light.

2262
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:41,600
Red light.

2263
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,770
(Peek-a-boo.)

2264
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:45,990
Green light, red light.

2265
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:48,740
Green light, red light.

2266
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:50,200
(Even when Jong Kook attacks
suddenly,)

2267
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,940
(Jae Suk remains frozen.)

2268
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:53,500
Green light, red light.

2269
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:55,370
Green light, red light.

2270
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:58,710
(The target holds out,
but Jong Kook is persistent.)

2271
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:01,610
Green light, red light.

2272
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:02,650
(Suk Jin enters the house.)

2273
01:18:02,650 --> 01:18:04,210
- Look under the wine.
- Books.

2274
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:05,990
Check the green books.

2275
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:07,430
- Look under the wine.
- It's next to that green book.

2276
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:10,030
I want you to do well, Suk Jin.

2277
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:11,600
It's at the top.

2278
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:13,900
- It's over there.
- There is another one at the top.

2279
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,270
- Green light,
- Why can't you see it?

2280
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:17,830
- red light.
- Look under the wine.

2281
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:22,570
(The survivors move
while the focus is on Jae Suk.)

2282
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:24,900
Green light, red light.

2283
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,200
(Jae Suk runs away.)

2284
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:31,150
(I barely managed to survive.)

2285
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:35,490
Green light, red light.

2286
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:36,540
(He runs away
from Jong Kook's gaze.)

2287
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:37,820
Green...

2288
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,250
Red light.

2289
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,530
(Jong Kook appears again!)

2290
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:44,530
Green light, red light.

2291
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,790
(Freezing)

2292
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:51,100
(Chuckling)

2293
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,740
(Kim Grand Award is a scary hunter.)

2294
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:54,940
Green light, red light.

2295
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:56,830
You have one minute.

2296
01:18:56,830 --> 01:19:00,850
Green light, red light.

2297
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:01,870
(Jae Suk needs a lot of clovers.)

2298
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:06,040
Green light, red light.

2299
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,410
For goodness' sake.

2300
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:11,360
Green light, red light.

2301
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,610
(Running at full speed)

2302
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:16,620
(Jae Suk gives his last spurt
away from Jong Kook.)

2303
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,530
Green light, red light.

2304
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:21,990
Green light, red light.

2305
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:24,030
(Jong Kook chases after him.)

2306
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:27,330
Green light, red light.

2307
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:28,940
(A scary hide-and-seek)

2308
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:31,110
Green light, red light.

2309
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:32,280
(Will Jae Suk get caught
in 1 minute?)

2310
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:35,480
Green light, red light.

2311
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,370
(Joon Ho was on the 2nd floor.)

2312
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:40,520
Green light, red light.

2313
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,740
(He looks for four-leaf clovers.)

2314
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:44,210
(You can see Jong Kook
in the mirror!)

2315
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:47,620
(After pretending to leave,
he looks in the mirror.)

2316
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:49,820
Green light, red light.

2317
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:54,120
(He moved.)

2318
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:59,330
(Jong Kook caught him
by looking in the mirror.)

2319
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:00,440
You moved.

2320
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,360
Joon Ho is out.

2321
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:05,480
- You moved.
- You can't use a mirror.

2322
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:07,650
You can't use a mirror.

2323
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:09,570
- Yes, I can.
- Does it count?

2324
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,110
I can't believe it counts.

2325
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:15,390
This time, Joon Ho is
the traffic cop.

2326
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:17,560
Green...

2327
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,710
(Joon Ho needs to catch many people
in order to be in the top 4.)

2328
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:20,690
light...

2329
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:25,200
Green light, red light.

2330
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,860
(No matter how much he runs,)

2331
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,770
I can't catch a single person.

2332
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:30,120
(he can't catch a single person.)

2333
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:32,940
(Since this Kim Grand Award
is slow,)

2334
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,000
There it is.

2335
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,500
(they find many four-leaf clovers!)

2336
01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:41,540
(The members collect
a lot of four-leaf clovers.)

2337
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:46,950
Green light, red light.

2338
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:48,780
(He misses the member
who was behind him.)

2339
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,820
Where did they go?
They are so fast.

2340
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:53,060
This really is Running Man.

2341
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:54,320
Joon Ho, look over there.

2342
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:56,990
Joon Ho, here.

2343
01:20:56,990 --> 01:21:00,620
(Some members try to bump up
Joon Ho's rank.)

2344
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:01,620
I caught you.

2345
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,230
I let you catch me.

2346
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:04,360
Is that so?

2347
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,860
- I let you catch me.
- Okay. Good.

2348
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:07,770
Time's up. Please gather around.

2349
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,110
I found nine.

2350
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:10,740
- Ten.
- How did you find so many?

2351
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:11,830
How did you find so many?

2352
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:12,870
(Joon Ho caught two members!)

2353
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:16,000
- I did this in my childhood.
- Suk Jin found so many.

2354
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,210
How many did you find?

2355
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:18,240
I couldn't find them.

2356
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,820
- You found a lot.
- Where did you find them?

2357
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:22,520
I couldn't spot them.

2358
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:23,690
I only found three.

2359
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:25,190
- How many did you find?
- Zero.

2360
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:27,230
What will happen?

2361
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:28,450
Can his rank be the fourth?

2362
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,150
My goodness.

2363
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:31,450
This is bad.

2364
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:33,290
- Everyone.
- Yes?

2365
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:34,460
The result is out.

2366
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:36,100
This is bad.

2367
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:39,240
I will announce Joon Ho's rank first
since it's the most important.

2368
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,160
I think I am the fourth.

2369
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:44,400
If Joon Ho is in the top four,

2370
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:48,570
only one of the lower ranks
will receive the penalty.

2371
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,150
He needs to be the fourth.

2372
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:52,280
If Joon Ho's rank is
the fifth or lower,

2373
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:55,210
everyone below him
will receive the penalty with him.

2374
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:57,820
If Joon Ho's rank is the last,

2375
01:21:57,910 --> 01:21:59,990
everyone will receive the penalty.

2376
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:02,860
- This is scary.
- Kim Joon Ho's final rank is...

2377
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:03,900
Joon Ho.

2378
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,320
He's got nine chocolates.

2379
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,530
(Kim Joon Ho's final rank is...)

2380
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:08,820
- He's in sixth place.
- Why?

2381
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,660
(6th place)

2382
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,070
- Why?
- You are not good at calculations.

2383
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:14,530
You should've made me the fourth.

2384
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:16,330
- And...
- My goodness.

2385
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:17,700
Then who's ranked below me?

2386
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:19,610
And there are two members
who took seventh place.

2387
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:20,810
What happened?

2388
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:22,180
My goodness.

2389
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:23,950
That can't be me.

2390
01:22:24,370 --> 01:22:27,540
The two members who took seventh
place are Se Chan and Jae Suk.

2391
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:29,580
(In 7th place, Se Chan and Jae Suk)

2392
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,650
(They will get the penalty
with 7 chocolates.)

2393
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:33,750
So the members
to get the penalty today...

2394
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:36,230
are Joon Ho, Jae Suk, and Se Chan.

2395
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:37,650
My gosh. Really?

2396
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,360
Oh, dear.

2397
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,570
- The prize is...
- Do we have a prize?

2398
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:42,820
It's the symbol of good luck.

2399
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,270
It's Korean pork.

2400
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:45,660
- My gosh.
- Really?

2401
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:46,770
It's pork.

2402
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:47,770
(1st place So Min, 2nd place Ji Hyo,
3rd place Jong Kook and Haha)

2403
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:49,640
The four of you will get the pork.

2404
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,110
I'll reveal today's penalty.

2405
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:52,640
- What is it?
- The penalty.

2406
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:54,500
The penalty is...

2407
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:57,370
- Is it something tiresome?
- We will give you...

2408
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:58,410
Something tiresome.

2409
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:00,690
a storybook which you will read
and write a book report on.

2410
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:02,020
- My gosh.
- I hate that.

2411
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:04,360
- That's good.
- I'm not good at it.

2412
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,690
It's really tiresome.

2413
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:07,080
That's the worst.

2414
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,450
- What?
- I'd rather get doused in water.

2415
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:11,100
You should read a children's book
we give you...

2416
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:12,600
- Good.
- and write...

2417
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,660
a book report of 400 letters.

2418
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:16,960
- Gosh, seriously...
- My goodness.

2419
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:19,270
I can't believe this.

2420
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:20,500
I'll read "Cinderella."

2421
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,530
Let me see.

2422
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:23,610
(Se Chan wants to read "Cinderella"
which he didn't know earlier.)

2423
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:25,000
I'll read
"The Emperor's New Clothes."

2424
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,570
Can I write it right away?

2425
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:29,310
Yes. Read the book first.

2426
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:32,650
We will post it
on Running Man's social media.

2427
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:34,280
Gosh, please.

2428
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:37,490
I'll read
"Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp."

2429
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:39,860
I don't know how to write
a book report.

2430
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:42,080
- Can I start by saying hello?
- No.

2431
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:44,900
- What do I do then?
- "Today, I..."

2432
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,820
Read the book
and write about how you feel.

2433
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:48,620
How about "I read a book today?"

2434
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:50,430
- That's a journal.
- Really?

2435
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:53,100
"Let me tell you about how I feel."

2436
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:56,440
Then what am I supposed to do?
I don't know.

2437
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,070
Aladdin in Persia...

2438
01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:59,480
But Cinderella... Joon Ho.

2439
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,350
Her shoe size is 260mm.

2440
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:04,710
- You have only one shot in life.
- Only one shot in life.

2441
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,450
Actually, Aladdin has
the same message.

2442
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:10,110
"I read the book again
after a long time."

2443
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:11,280
(Jae Suk starts writing
his book report first.)

2444
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,060
"It made me think of many things."

2445
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:17,080
I can't finish the sentence here.
Can I write it on the next line?

2446
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,200
- The sentence is cut here. Then...
- Move onto the next line.

2447
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,070
I want to say, "It was touching."
But there's no space.

2448
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:23,100
Should I change it to "Touching?"

2449
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,440
You can continue the sentence
on the next line.

2450
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,440
"Then,"

2451
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,270
"will I..."

2452
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,140
This is so embarrassing.

2453
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,370
"By any chance..."

2454
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:34,310
"Someone else..."

2455
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,950
You can't copy mine.

2456
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:39,410
You have a different book.

2457
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,820
I can say,
"It made me think of many things."

2458
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,890
- I'll say the same thing.
- Hey.

2459
01:24:43,890 --> 01:24:46,210
- "It was very touching."
- My goodness.

2460
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,650
"Pretty and nice..."

2461
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,360
"Cinderella..."

2462
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:54,270
"I should live
with an honest heart."

2463
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:55,600
Should I finish this?

2464
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,620
I'm done.

2465
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:58,960
- Do you want me to read it?
- Read it for us.

2466
01:24:58,960 --> 01:24:59,990
(Joon Ho finishes his report first
and reads it out loud.)

2467
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:03,610
"I read 'Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp',
and thought of many things."

2468
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:06,500
"It made me wonder
if I ever hesitated..."

2469
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:09,310
"due to other people's gaze."

2470
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:13,070
What does that mean?

2471
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:14,540
Hey, you copied mine.

2472
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:15,850
(Hey, you copied mine.)

2473
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:17,320
I read it first.

2474
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:19,650
- I read it first.
- It's the same as mine.

2475
01:25:19,650 --> 01:25:20,890
What did you write?

2476
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,360
"I thought of many things
after reading this book."

2477
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,650
"It made me wonder
if I ever said..."

2478
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:28,620
"what I didn't really mean
due to other people's attention."

2479
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:30,100
You can't copy mine.

2480
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:33,530
"It made me wonder if I hesitated
due to other people's gaze."

2481
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:36,700
What does this have to do
with Aladdin?

2482
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:37,980
This is for
"The Emperor's New Clothes."

2483
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:40,650
It's for
"The Emperor's New Clothes."

2484
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,610
- Hey.
- It's just the beginning.

2485
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:46,180
"If I had a magic lamp,
what wish would I make?"

2486
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:48,740
"My first wish is to become rich."

2487
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:51,520
"The second is to make people laugh
on variety shows."

2488
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,650
"The third is to make
another three wishes."

2489
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,900
"If I keep making that wish,"

2490
01:25:58,060 --> 01:25:59,860
"I will be able to have
all of my wishes granted for life."

2491
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:01,790
"Aladdin is so stupid."

2492
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:02,790
(Aladdin is so stupid.)

2493
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:03,960
(He ruins childhood innocence.)

2494
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,330
"I should be smart."

2495
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:06,660
Is that how I should
write a book report?

2496
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:09,530
"You should use your brain
when you make wishes."

2497
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:11,180
This is a real book report.

2498
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:12,780
This is just pretense.

2499
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,370
Why would you live
with an honest heart again?

2500
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:17,570
You're right. But this is
what a book report should look like.

2501
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:19,020
- My gosh.
- This is difficult.

2502
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:21,820
You basically just wrote a summary.

2503
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:23,280
- We're done.
- Thank you.

2504
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,080
- Thank you for today.
- Thank you.

2505
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:27,950
(Read their special book reports
on Running Man's social media.)

2506
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,490
The weather is nice.

2507
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:30,790
It's a perfect day for hiking.

don't act their age.)

2510

(There's a lady
on the campaign trail.)

2511
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:40,940
(We're getting to know each other.
What's your name?)

2512

(The couples
get to know each other.)

2513
01:26:43,270 --> 01:26:45,180
- Hey, Hyuk. Come with me.
- Hyuk?

2514

(Jang Hyuk, 44 years old,
a new member)

2515
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,540

each other too.)

(It didn't even take an hour
from Seoul,)

2517
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:52,950
(but this place has a fine view.)

2518
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:55,020
(They have fun looking around...)

2519
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:58,820
(and get carried away.)

2520
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:00,610
(Why do you keep taking photos?)

2521
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:02,820
(She suddenly wants
to take photos with us.)

2522
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:03,820
- I know.
- We should make them spend money.

2523
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:06,150
(Someone's making them spend money.)

2524
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:08,160
(If they don't spend money,)

2525
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,990
(you will be eliminated.)
