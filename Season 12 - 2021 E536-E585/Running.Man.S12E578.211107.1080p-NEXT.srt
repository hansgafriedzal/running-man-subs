1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,790
(The end of fall
when the fall foliage peaks)

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,590
- This is nice.
- It's like a film set for fall.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,590
Look at the tinted leaves.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,730
The weather is so nice.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,560
Hello, guys.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,610
- Good to see you again.
- This is nice.

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,780
I like the fall weather.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,470
- Hi.
- This is really nice.

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,000
- Hello.
- This is like a film set.

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,980
A film set
with the background of fall.

11
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,370
- Like "Autumn in My Heart".
- Hello.

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,680
- It's a lovely day.
- This is like a film set.

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,960
We need to talk about someone first.

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
What?

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,590
- Is this a parachute or what?
- The overall...

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,590
- concept of this episode...
- Excuse me.

17
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,790
- Are you a lifeguard or something?
- No.

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,320
I think you are mistaken
about today's episode.

19
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,070
- Are you wearing a picnic mat?
- No.

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,330
Who would wear mountain clothes
when hiking?

21
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,260
We were told to wear
mountain clothes today.

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,330
- Hear me out first.
- You look strange.

23
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,810
A lot of people these days
wear things like this.

24
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,610
- He's flustered.
- He's embarrassed.

25
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,350
He knows he looks strange.

26
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,640
- He can't get his way today.
- What happened?

27
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,640
I just wear
what I get from my stylist.

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,250
- Suk Jin.
- Think of what I’ve worn so far.

29
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,010
Do you think
they were what I wanted to wear?

30
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,060
Did you wash your bag in hot water?

31
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,060
- It shrank.
- It shrank a lot.

32
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,750
This is So Wool’s bag.

33
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,790
You’re a thief.

34
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,220
- What happened to your bag?
- Forget about...

35
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,550
- Suk Jin, hang on.
- those miscellaneous things.

36
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,100
Are you getting on a plane?

37
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,770
- No.
- This is a life vest.

38
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,330
- My stylist got me this.
- A life vest.

39
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,940
It’s not like that. That’s not true.

40
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,240
Where should we blow in? Here?

41
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,470
- I'm interested in fashion.
- You should blow in here.

42
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,680
What is this?

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,710
Is this a magnet or what?
It's like the N pole and the S pole.

44
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,910
You're wearing a skirt.

45
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,140
- No. These are pants.
- It's a screen.

46
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,720
- To cover his diaper.
- Cover his diaper?

47
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,880
Hey! I'm not wearing a diaper.

48
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,220
Are you playing soccer?

49
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,190
- No, I'm not playing soccer.
- "I'm not playing soccer."

50
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,490
He's answering every question.

51
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,750
Maybe they are soccer shoes.

52
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,630
- I guess they are soccer shoes.
- No, they are not.

53
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,100
Is this soccer?

54
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,460
I think they are soccer shoes.

55
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,070
Why would you play soccer like this?

56
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,330
He's the only one
who's not wearing mountain clothes.

57
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,890
- Why are you playing soccer?
- Forget it.

58
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,210
We have Alpinist Um Hong Gil here.

59
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,910
- I look like him.
- You look just like him.

60
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,940
This is how
real mountain clothes look.

61
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,000
They are mountain clothes.

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,680
- This is real.
- This is perfect.

63
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,640
- You should go to the Himalayas.
- I'm wearing hiking pants.

64
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,050
- Jong Kook is...
- This is the standard.

65
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,440
Jong Kook likes exercising,

66
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,440
but he doesn't usually go hiking.

67
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,610
He's going hiking
with his girlfriend.

68
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,790
Because she wants him to.

69
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,060
- Can I wear this for hiking?
- Yes.

70
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,320
- That's how Jong Kook looks.
- This is how it feels.

71
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,350
- You alone...
- And about Ji Hyo.

72
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,790
- I'm...
- It looks like she's campaigning.

73
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,250
She's an old lady.

74
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,690
- She looks like she's campaigning.
- Please vote for me.

75
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,100
- Pick up garbage.
- Thank you.

76
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,400
She's campaigning.

77
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,600
She's not interested
in hiking at all.

78
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,910
She comes to the mountains with
her husband during elections.

79
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,130
You and I love hiking,

80
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,470
but we are not popular at all.

81
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,970
(Jae Suk and I love hiking,
but we are not popular at all.)

82
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,250
I'm all dressed up though.

83
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,350
Right. You're a member of a club.

84
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,010
This isn't just mountain clothes.
I try to look fashionable.

85
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,120
- But you're not fashionable.
- I look somewhat strange.

86
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,010
Isn't she amazing?

87
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,590
- Everyone.
- I was mistaken.

88
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,350
- You'd want to cry.
- Why?

89
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,350
- Is that Red Devils?
- It's Red Devils.

90
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,530
- Yes, it is.
- Where did you get it?

91
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,760
(2002 Red Devils)

92
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,570
Korea

93
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,070
Korea!

94
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,660
(Clapping together)

95
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,200
Korea!

96
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,600
My goodness.

97
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,840
You're wearing Taegeukgi.

98
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,440
Be the Reds.

99
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,910
I haven't seen this for a long time.

100
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,970
Be the Reds.
It's been a while, right?

101
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,820
- It's been a really long time.
- By the way,

102
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,910
- I think...
- Doctor Choi.

103
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,540
- today's best dresser is So Min.
- I agree.

104
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,150
- This is detailed.
- I like her outfit.

105
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,750
- Look at her.
- She has her own theme.

106
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,190
- Look at the gold watch.
- I like your pants.

107
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,030
- She looks like a drama character.
- This is like a drama.

108
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,350
- It looks like she's in a drama.
- But...

109
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,100
Honestly, I don't think
I'm wearing mountain clothes.

110
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,400
That's not true.
You're wearing mountain clothes.

111
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,690
Earlier today,

112
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,230
my car was parked next to So Min's.

113
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,070
So we met as we got off.

114
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,160
And So Min said hello to me
dressed like this.

115
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,540
This is how I felt at the moment.

116
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,200
"So Min looks good in that outfit."

117
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,880
(So Min looks good in that outfit.)

118
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,540
- I think so.
- Seriously.

119
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,720
- That's true.
- When she dressed like this before,

120
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,220
it felt like...

121
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,620
she was wearing
a costume for this show.

122
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,220
I was a little surprised
to see her earlier.

123
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,510
To be honest, I was surprised too.

124
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,220
- I was startled.
- Because you looked good?

125
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,090
- Yes.
- She's almost 37 now.

126
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,950
She will soon turn 37.

127
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,630
So Min, you have to accept that.

128
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,530
There's something more surprising.

129
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,320
How old do you think So Min was
when she joined Running Man?

130
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,070
- Was she 35 or 34?
- She was 31.

131
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,630
- Only 31?
- Or 32.

132
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,470
- I was 32 or 33.
- She was 32.

133
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,910
- It's been five years.
- My goodness.

134
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,940
I asked So Min
about it this morning.

135
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,730
- Has it been that long already?
- It's been so long.

136
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,650
Jong Kook, how old were you
when you did "X-Man" with me?

137
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,720
"X-Man"?

138
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,570
I was 28 or 29.

139
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,410
- You were 29.
- I was 29.

140
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,680
Suk Jin, how old were you
when you did "Star Golden Bell"?

141
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,680
Suk Jin was 48.

142
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,850
Even back then?

143
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,350
- Hey.
- Was he 48 back then?

144
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,620
Am I 80 now?

145
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,120
Suk Jin, is it that you've
never been 30 before?

146
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,850
I turned 40 right after my teens.

147
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,970
I've lived in my 40s since then.

148
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,230
As far as I know,
in his 30s, Suk Jin did...

149
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,230
(He was busy seducing women
with his dance.)

150
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,770
"Come here."

151
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,280
"Come in here, guys.
This is the room of freedom."

152
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,580
- Room of freedom?
- Come in here.

153
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,450
- In his 30s?
- That's what he did in his 30s.

154
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,780
We have some news.

155
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,240
- Jong Kook released a new album.
- Right. Jong Kook did.

156
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,610
(Jong Kook released a new song,
"Walking Along With You".)

157
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,460
I just released it in secret.

158
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,980
- What?
- Take a look at this.

159
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,520
- What's that?
- What?

160
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,720
Are they pants or legs?

161
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,760
- What's wrong with you?
- Why are you naked?

162
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,960
- What's wrong with you?
- What...

163
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,960
- My goodness.
- I'm wearing pants.

164
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,360
- Hey.
- Did you sing in your underpants?

165
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,030
- How could you...
- I can't believe this.

166
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,770
- He sang in his underpants.
- He's wearing a diaper.

167
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,990
Seen from a distance...

168
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,340
I thought he was wearing a diaper.

169
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,060
That's not true.
Kwang Soo uploaded...

170
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,540
this darn photo.

171
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,730
Did Kwang Soo upload it?

172
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,600
I'm not naked. I'm wearing pants.

173
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,580
I'm wearing brown pants.

174
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Was it Kwang Soo?

175
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,450
Kwang Soo posted the photo.

176
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,780
Hang on.

177
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,980
Why? Will you call Kwang Soo?

178
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,540
- Do you want to call Kwang Soo?
- Wait.

179
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,180
So did he quit or not?

180
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,760
- Kwang Soo got pink eye.
- He did?

181
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,960
Let me see.

182
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,350
That's disgusting.

183
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,490
He got pink eye.

184
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,400
- Kwang Soo got pink eye.
- That's true.

185
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,720
- And he has a nose problem.
- Why?

186
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,060
His nose.

187
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,040
- I guess he has a sinus cold.
- A sinus cold.

188
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,360
He has rhinitis.

189
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,540
I was worried about him
when I saw this photo.

190
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,430
- What's with that pose?
- What's wrong with him?

191
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,010
- So are we having new members?
- Who?

192
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,080
- New members.
- Are we having new members?

193
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,580
- I heard there would be one.
- Right.

194
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,370
- Are we having a new member?
- There will be a new member.

195
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,980
- Really? I didn't know.
- Yes.

196
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,890
- A new member?
- I heard there would be one.

197
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,590
Is it Jung Jun Ha?

198
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,720
- There he comes.
- Where?

199
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,220
- Who?
- Who is he? Is he Joon Ho?

200
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,680
Why would he go hiking
looking like that?

201
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,960
- I saw him in the restroom earlier.
- Who is he?

202
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,160
Hang on.

203
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,120
- Who is he?
- We met in the restroom.

204
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,600
- He's...
- He's your friend.

205
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,100
- Is he my friend?
- He's Jang Hyuk.

206
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,060
"I'm Jang Hyuk."

207
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,280
- He's Jang Hyuk.
- Hyuk.

208
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,910
"Hello. I'm Jang Hyuk."

209
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,910
- We really like him.
- I know.

210
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,220
- Why did you not tell me?
- I know.

211
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,410
- What do you know?
- Hello.

212
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,810
I didn't recognize you, Hyuk.

213
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,410
- You should've told me.
- Hello.

214
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,410
- Hello.
- You are my favorite actor.

215
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,810
- Hello, Hyuk.
- Hello.

216
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,550
"I'm Jang Hyuk."

217
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,660
Hyuk, long time no see.

218
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,960
I didn't recognize you.

219
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,460
You know what?

220
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,420
Let me tell you this right away.
Hyuk is shooting a new movie.

221
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,470
(Hyuk is shooting a new movie.)

222
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,060
- He's here to promote it.
- Tell us.

223
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,560
- Are you releasing a new movie?
- Yes.

224
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,770
- It's "Tomb of the River".
- Right.

225
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,270
- "Tomb of the River".
- Is it "Tomb of the River"?

226
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,510
There are two gangs...

227
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,840
in Gangneung.

228
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,710
- Is it about gangs?
- He likes it.

229
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,580
- It's a film noir.
- Is it a film noir?

230
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,020
You should've called me then.

231
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,950
I was going to,
but you were too busy.

232
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,390
- I see. That sounds exciting.
- So?

233
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,720
It's about the gangs
engaging in a power struggle.

234
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,830
- In Gangneung?
- Yes.

235
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,760
And you're a gangster
in a moneylending business.

236
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,620
That sounds interesting.
I love film noir.

237
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,560
- It sounds fun.
- That's my favorite.

238
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,400
That sounds perfect for him.

239
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,990
- Good.
- That's my favorite.

240
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,770
A movie about gangs is really fun.

241
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,560
I've never seen Jong Kook...

242
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,930
stand so close to a guest before.

243
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,100
He's standing very close.

244
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,430
- Seriously...
- He's my friend.

245
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,150
He came running to greet you.

246
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,410
(When Jang Hyuk
showed up earlier...)

247
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,810
(That's my friend.)

248
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,910
(He comes running to greet Hyuk.)

249
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:49,660
(He stands close to Hyuk
and checks his body fat.)

250
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,830
They are friends.

251
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,490
I saw him in the restroom earlier.

252
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,330
He was dressed like this with
a mask, so I didn't recognize him.

253
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,490
But, suddenly, "Hello."
He was like this.

254
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,540
(Hello.)

255
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,010
So I said hello.

256
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,600
I didn't know he'd be here.

257
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,580
- "Hello. I'm Jang Hyuk."
- "I'm Jang Hyuk."

258
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,210
The whole nation can do
his impression.

259
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,950
- Everyone can do it.
- Literally everyone can.

260
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,080
Seriously, I don't sound like that.

261
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,090
You do.

262
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,980
Hyuk, it's been a long time.

263
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,260
- Say, "Hello, I'm Jang Hyuk."
- To our viewers.

264
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,550
I just can't copy it.

265
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,850
Just do it for us.

266
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,350
- He copies himself.
- "Hello. I'm Jang Hyuk."

267
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,420
Let's say you are talking
to someone far away.

268
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,790
- Over there.
- Start.

269
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,860
Hello. I'm Jang Hyuk.

270
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,970
(I'm Jang Hyuk.)

271
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,560
- Good.
- You did it.

272
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,880
That was perfect.

273
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,830
- You can do it.
- That was perfect.

274
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,280
He did it well.

275
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,650
"I'm Jang Hyuk."

276
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,520
Last year,

277
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,410
we had a special episode
on Jeju Island.

278
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,750
- And Se Chan...
- I called him.

279
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,020
- Se Chan called him.
- He did.

280
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,580
He spoke his mind.

281
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,760
"What happened to Tae Hyun?"

282
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,490
He told me everything.

283
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,450
(Running Man Episode 528)

284
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:02,256
(Se Chan called Hyuk
with Jong Kook's phone.)

285
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,740
(Where are you headed?)

286
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,610
(I need to go home first
then I have to go to Gangneung.)

287
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,510
(Jang Hyuk didn't recognize
his best friend's voice.)

288
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,200
(Hey, doesn't Tae Hyun
call you these days?)

289
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,880
(He suddenly brings up a topic.)

290
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,310
(That's what he does these days.)

291
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,950
(He starts chattering
talking about this and that.)

292
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:33,000
(He opened his heart
without knowing anything.)

293
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,130
What happened?

294
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,420
- Right.
- How could you fall for that?

295
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,630
Seriously,

296
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,960
I thought he called me.

297
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,740
That was hilarious.

298
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,540
Today, with our new
member Jang Hyuk,

299
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,800
we are going on a fall picnic
of Running Alpine Club.

300
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,670
It's called My Money
and My Alpine Club Race.

301
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,710
We are going on a trip to places
where you can appreciate fall.

302
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,150
- Nice.
- We're going on a trip.

303
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,440
The rules are simple.

304
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,050
Once you arrive at your destination,

305
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,360
you will enjoy
various tour courses...

306
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,160
that we prepared.

307
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,420
And you will pay for them
with your own money.

308
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,920
- Really?
- With my own money?

309
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,270
- Did you bring money?
- Yes.

310
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,400
- I did.
- I brought some.

311
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,690
I was told to bring 100 dollars.

312
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,660
But it's not that all of you
will spend your money.

313
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,790
There's a way...

314
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,330
- you can enjoy it for free.
- What is it?

315
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,930
Before you pay
for the tour course you enjoyed,

316
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,930
you will be asked to make a choice.

317
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,250
If what you choose is in a minority,

318
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,280
it's free.

319
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,310
Only those in the majority
will split the money.

320
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,180
- We should use our heads.
- Split the money?

321
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,990
After the race is over,

322
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,860
the two members who spent
the least money will win prizes.

323
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,690
And we will have penalty balls
for the rest by rankings.

324
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,950
- Number 3 gets 1 ball,
- So?

325
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,160
and number 4 gets 2 balls.

326
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,090
And we will select two members.

327
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,060
And they might go home very late.

328
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,430
- We've already come a long way.
- "Very late?"

329
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,830
- We might get stuck in traffic.
- That's the worst.

330
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,740
- On Jayu-ro.
- It will be tiresome.

331
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,610
It's tiresome to get a penalty.

332
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,670
Right.

333
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,940
- They give us annoying penalties.
- I know.

334
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,150
It'd be better to be covered
with fresh cream.

335
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,340
We prefer water slaps.

336
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,120
- I agree.
- If we have to pick acorns...

337
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,340
- We'll go on a fall foliage hike.
- Okay.

338
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,160
This is the activity list
you can enjoy.

339
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,410
- Have a look.
- It sounds fun.

340
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,760
- Shall we have a look?
- Tell us what you want.

341
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,490
The weather is so nice too.

342
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,590
Let's eat something first.

343
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,320
There's a list of activities
and a snack menu here.

344
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
I don't want any snacks.

345
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,660
- I want a corn dog.
- Can we get yukgaejang?

346
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,900
- Or something like that?
- They make great corn dogs here.

347
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,460
- Really? Let me have a look.
- It's really good.

348
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,460
Let's have an instant photo taken.

349
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,430
- One photo would be reasonable.
- Absolutely.

350
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,110
- We can afford it.
- "Kang Chan Hee"?

351
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,170
"Once in a lifetime photo taken by
the living legend Kang Chan Hee".

352
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,210
- He took our photo on Jeju Island.
- Right.

353
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,620
- Chan Hee did a lousy job.
- That's not true.

354
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,540
- Our photo was great.
- It was a mess.

355
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,950
- He made us look erotic.
- We looked great in the photo.

356
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,490
- It wasn't erotic.
- He made it look erotic.

357
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,860
- He's bad at taking instant photos.
- He really did it.

358
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,860
(The legendary Chan Hee is not good
at taking instant photos.)

359
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,050
We can have a lotus leaf corn dog?

360
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,590
- Let's all have corn dogs.
- We should.

361
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,050
- We should have this too.
- Who wants a corn dog?

362
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,090
- I want a corn dog.
- Let's order one for each.

363
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,090
Let's order lotus flower bread too.

364
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,740
One lotus leaf ice cream
as well, please.

365
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,000
I'd like lotus flower bread, please.

366
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,270
- Can I have lotus flower bread too?
- Right.

367
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,160
- I'll have lotus flower bread too.
- One for each of you?

368
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,560
- I want lotus flower bread too.
- We all will have it.

369
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,200
- Let's all have the ice cream too.
- We all will have it.

370
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,510
Then we'll begin
our fall foliage hike.

371
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,910
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go for a rickshaw ride.

372
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,440
Let's go!

373
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,670
It's beautiful here.

374
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,340
- It's nice.
- It's really nice.

375
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,580
- I'm excited.
- It's so beautiful over there.

376
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,040
- I see that.
- It's so nice.

377
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,790
- Hey, what is this place?
- It's pretty.

378
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,180
- I'll bring my wife here some time.
- It's magnificent.

379
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,030
President Yang.

380
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,690
Are we going to have baeksuk
together after this?

381
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,060
Of course we will.
Let's drink some makgeolli together.

382
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,270
By the way, President Yang...

383
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,590
Is she your girlfriend?

384
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,830
- Or your wife?
- She's not my wife.

385
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,060
We're just getting to know
each other.

386
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,410
- Is she your wife?
- Hey.

387
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,300
- Come on.
- I didn't mean to pry.

388
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,780
This is my first time
joining you guys.

389
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,840
- Really?
- Yes.

390
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
We're just getting to know
each other.

391
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,150
- It's a perfect day for hiking.
- It's nice.

392
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,620
- This is such a beautiful place.
- It's really nice here.

393
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,650
- How nice.
- He seems to be feeling too hot.

394
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,710
- Oh, him?
- No, I'm not.

395
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,860
He must be really hot.

396
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,890
- I must say...
- Not at all.

397
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,030
He looks like
he's actually here to hike.

398
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,320
- That's annoying.
- I didn't mean it like that.

399
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,820
Your tone was offensive.

400
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,870
- Why?
- Gosh, seriously.

401
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,900
- That was funny.
- He's here to hike.

402
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,370
I don't like your tone.

403
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,090
- The king of hiking.
- Since you go hiking often...

404
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,060
- Yes. I'm the king of hiking.
- The hiking king.

405
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,800
He's actually here to hike.

406
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,300
- Oh, my. What's that?
- That's so funny.

407
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,880
- This is so nice.
- I wish I knew this place sooner.

408
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,010
- It's pretty.
- How beautiful.

409
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,310
- Look at those jars.
- It's nice.

410
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,440
- It's a jar fountain.
- It's so pretty.

411
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,150
- It says "Crock Fountain".
- It's so beautiful here.

412
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,650
I didn't know there was a place
like this.

413
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,390
So Min, look. Is that the fountain?

414
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,760
Your snacks are on the way.

415
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,660
- You can enjoy the activities here.
- Got it.

416
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,730
- Hey.
- I want to ride a bicycle.

417
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,820
I want to ride a rickshaw.

418
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,320
I want to ride a rickshaw too.

419
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,450
Let's go on a ride.

420
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,920
How many people can ride in it?

421
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,370
- Two people.
- Two?

422
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,920
- Two people ride in it together.
- I see.

423
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,640
- Hold on. Let me think.
- I want to try it too.

424
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,040
- President Yang and his girlfriend.
- Right.

425
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,160
- You two take a ride together.
- Come on.

426
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,700
- We're getting to know each other.
- All right.

427
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,410
- Please don't get the wrong idea.
- I'll pull the rickshaw for you.

428
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,800
- And these two close friends.
- Yes?

429
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,040
You two take a ride together.

430
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,840
- But I'd feel bad. I mean...
- You two ride in it together.

431
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,880
I want to ride with someone else.

432
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,250
- Gosh. You're so slow-witted.
- Hey...

433
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,540
- Oh, I forgot.
- Right.

434
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,440
- Oh, I forgot.
- Don't do that. You little...

435
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,620
- I hope you understand.
- Come forward.

436
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,860
- Right. They should...
- Come on.

437
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,050
- What's wrong with you?
- They're also...

438
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,760
- getting to know each other.
- That's right.

439
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,030
- They're in the same phase.
- Yes.

440
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,230
- You know...
- Are you for or against?

441
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,760
Well, if they're just
getting to know each other...

442
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,690
Exactly. They're just
getting to know each other.

443
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,400
You put a secret message
in your new song too.

444
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,870
- What do you mean by that?
- That you want to walk with her.

445
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,870
- That I want to walk with her?
- "I want to walk with you."

446
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,060
It's just a song.

447
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,480
You can use this as a chance
to walk with her.

448
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,540
(I want to walk with you,
I really want to)

449
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,610
- This is your chance.
- "I want to walk with you."

450
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,340
- Don't miss the chance.
- Why else did he release the song?

451
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,340
- Exactly.
- What strange timing.

452
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,710
Seriously.

453
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,810
(The news made the hearts
of the hiking club members flutter.)

454
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,910
- We'll enjoy the ride.
- Let's go.

455
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,760
- Let's go.
- A rickshaw ride is a must.

456
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,490
Do you guys mind if we take a video
during the rickshaw ride?

457
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,760
- Do we have to pay for it?
- Go ahead.

458
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Yes. I want to leave a record
of our memories.

459
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,920
- It's up to you.
- Right?

460
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,900
- How nice.
- Like an old-fashioned home video.

461
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,000
It's so nice here.

462
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,610
It's peaceful and relaxing.
I like this place.

463
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,780
- Oh, my. Is this it?
- I like it

464
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,980
- This is it.
- It looks nice.

465
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,670
- Let's take the yellow one.
- Oh, this is it.

466
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,070
- Let's get on.
- There are two of them here.

467
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,380
- The rickshaws are here.
- You two ride together.

468
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,980
- I want to drive it.
- So Min wants this one.

469
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,210
- All right. I'm excited about this.
- Hey, come on up.

470
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,440
- What?
- Let's have fun.

471
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,120
Oh, no. What are you going to do?

472
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,360
I think you have to run along
with us while filming us.

473
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,030
- Is he the one who'll film us?
- Yes.

474
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,080
It's a paid service. How much is it?

475
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,160
I think it's 50 dollars.

476
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,030
- Just talk to me.
- We'll receive the video file.

477
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,770
Don't you need to be on this too?

478
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,930
- That's right. You should.
- Do you think you can keep up?

479
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,660
What's with those sunglasses?

480
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,830
Hey, guys.

481
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,510
Come on, President Yang.

482
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,780
She drives me crazy.

483
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,750
She's being too cheesy.

484
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,170
Hey, Ms. Song...

485
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,040
- and Mr. Kim should...
- No, his friend is here.

486
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,440
- Take a ride with your friend.
- Right.

487
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,620
- No.
- You two ride together.

488
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,120
- We don't want to ride together.
- Come on. Go with your friend.

489
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,130
- Go on and have fun.
- What's the point?

490
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,490
- Take a ride with your friend.
- Have a nice chat.

491
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,530
- Is it uncomfortable?
- What would we do during the ride?

492
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,190
- You can have a nice chat with him.
- Sorry?

493
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,320
You want us to ride this together?

494
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,400
Are you uncomfortable
being alone with each other?

495
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,770
It's not that. It's meaningless
for us to ride this together.

496
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,640
- Just take a ride around here.
- You should take a ride.

497
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,110
- He's right.
- Hyuk, do you want to go with me?

498
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,300
- Sounds great. Let's go together.
- You two together?

499
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,880
- You both will be quiet all along.
- Why?

500
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,200
- Go ahead, Suk Jin.
- He's a little shy, right?

501
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,670
- Yes, he is.
- I'm not shy.

502
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,010
- Okay. Let's try this.
- Right. Go ahead.

503
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,980
- He seems to be feeling shy.
- Sorry?

504
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,620
- You seem shy right now.
- We can tell you're feeling shy.

505
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,790
- You seem...
- Suk Jin, take a ride.

506
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,180
Why would he make me do this?

507
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,580
- Don't be like that.
- I feel awkward.

508
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,180
- Hold on.
- Go on and try it.

509
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,360
- I can be a little shy sometimes.
- For a moment...

510
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
It's okay.

511
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,860
It's so awkward.

512
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,360
I feel stifled just watching them.

513
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,130
- Suk Jin, it's okay.
- Hey, let's eat that first.

514
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,730
Let's eat.

515
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,190
- What is it? Oh, good.
- Let's eat.

516
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,330
Let's eat corn dogs.

517
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,060
- Hey, look at you.
- Hyung In, what's with your outfit?

518
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,560
- Hyung In, what are you doing?
- Oh, great.

519
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,560
- It's big.
- Hey.

520
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,040
- Hyung In.
- Why are there only four?

521
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,410
- Hyung In.
- We'll bring you the rest shortly.

522
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,650
I know you never dress like this.

523
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,150
- It looks good.
- Look at how you're dressed.

524
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,170
(So they purchased corn dogs
and ice cream from the peddler.)

525
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,540
So Min.

526
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,170
(So they purchased corn dogs
and ice cream from the peddler.)

527
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,710
- This is so good.
- Indeed.

528
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,340
It's so tasty.

529
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,760
- It's so good.
- I like this.

530
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,210
- People wait in line for this.
- It's so good.

531
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,820
(The purpose of the club is
to eat and chat more than to hike.)

532
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,590
- It's good, right?
- It's good.

533
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,130
What is Haha holding?

534
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,920
I didn't order ice cream.

535
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,290
We ordered one for each of us.

536
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,290
(The lotus leaf ice cream arrives.)

537
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,400
- It smells so good.
- It has the scent of lotus leaves.

538
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,300
- This ice cream is so tasty.
- Really?

539
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,200
It's really good.

540
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,430
We'll leave when you finish
your food.

541
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,610
Hey, this is the best.
I'm impressed.

542
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,800
It's so good, right?

543
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,840
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

544
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,840
- What?
- Show us your dance.

545
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,690
- Me?
- Why so suddenly?

546
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,790
If I suddenly start dancing here...

547
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,110
That's okay. You've got this.

548
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,460
(He suddenly starts dancing.)

549
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,190
- I knew he'd do it.
- Oh, my. Mr. Ji.

550
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,930
- You see, Suk Jin is...
- He's in a good mood.

551
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,960
I'm in a good mood.

552
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,030
Suk Jin is...

553
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,230
I'm so excited. This is nice.

554
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,790
Since I've gotten older,

555
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,440
I'm becoming fond
of watching scenery like this.

556
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,800
- We'll be off now.
- Okay. Let's go.

557
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,240
- Hyuk.
- Oh, dear.

558
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,710
Jae Suk got on it.

559
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,400
(Jae Suk and Suk Jin get on
the empty rickshaw.)

560
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,900
- Then I should take a ride.
- Wait.

561
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,420
- Let's go.
- Let Hyuk and Suk Jin go together.

562
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,480
Right. Hyuk, come here.

563
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,580
- That's okay.
- Hyuk, come here.

564
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,020
- I mean... Hyuk.
- Have fun.

565
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,450
We'll be all right, Suk Jin.

566
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,810
- All right. Come on up.
- We'll be all right.

567
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,110
(Chuckling awkwardly)

568
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,530
Suk Jin said
he wasn't a shy person.

569
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,430
We're off now.

570
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,790
- Let's go, Hyuk.
- Bye.

571
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,730
(The relaxing rickshaw ride begins.)

572
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,000
- We've never sat together before.
- True.

573
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,940
- Right?
- No, we once sat together.

574
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,600
When was that?

575
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,510
We sat next to each other
while playing a game.

576
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,540
- While playing a game?
- Yes.

577
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,570
Except for that...

578
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,980
We've never had a chat like this,
just the two of us.

579
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,450
I think this is our first time.

580
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,180
You're right. We should get to know
each other too.

581
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,680
Yes. We're getting to know
each other like them.

582
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,450
(They're getting to know
each other.)

583
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,150
Since we're getting to know
each other, may I ask your name?

584
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,110
- I'm Bong Pal.
- Oh, my.

585
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,260
I'm Bok Ja.

586
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,850
- Oh, your name is Bok Ja?
- Yes.

587
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,030
(Bong Pal and Bok Ja
are growing closer to one another.)

588
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,360
Bok Ja, it's really nice
to take a rickshaw ride.

589
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,770
- We have similar names.
- Indeed.

590
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,060
My full name is Jeon Bok Ja.

591
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,500
- Oh, your family name is Jeon?
- Yes.

592
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,000
My full name is Choi Bong Pal.

593
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,740
- I see, Bong Pal.
- Yes.

594
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,440
Are you married?

595
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,780
I was once.

596
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,940
(Bong Pal is back to being single.)

597
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,240
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Well...

598
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,250
I'm going to make one.

599
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,640
(Bong Pal is open to all options.)

600
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,980
Those leaves are beautiful.

601
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,140
They just started turning yellow.

602
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,220
Right.

603
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,760
(These 2 are so quiet.)

604
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,080
You two, say something.

605
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,790
I guess you two aren't so close.

606
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,930
We're having a chat.

607
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,820
You guys seem so awkward.
Put your arm around his shoulders.

608
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,270
Why would I put my arm
around his shoulders?

609
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,270
It's an order from the president.
Put your arm around his shoulders.

610
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,360
Why are they being so shy?

611
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,940
That's great. Thank you.

612
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,100
Oh, I see some lotus leaves.

613
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
(Laughing with satisfaction)

614
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,010
Look how they're putting their arms
around each other's shoulders.

615
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,010
They look so uncomfortable.

616
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,140
Oh, gosh.

617
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,250
That's so funny.

618
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,780
All those lotus leaves
have withered.

619
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,490
I keep making random remarks.

620
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,720
(He keeps making random remarks
since he feels awkward.)

621
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,020
I can't help it.

622
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,610
- I know.
- I don't feel it though.

623
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,430
- You don't feel it either, right?
- No, I don't.

624
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,030
The air is so fresh.

625
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,790
This is nice.

626
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,820
(While the rickshaw team
shares moments of friendship...)

627
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,120
Why don't you
have an instant photo taken?

628
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,330
Don't force us to do it.

629
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,330
How much is it?

630
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,470
- It's three dollars.
- Let's have one taken.

631
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,900
- Okay. Let's do that.
- Great.

632
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,330
I want to look at it later.

633
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,510
Is that person...

634
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,370
Michael Jackson?

635
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,870
(Drawn in by her artistic style,
they pose freely.)

636
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,950
One, two, three.

637
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,250
I look great in these sunglasses.

638
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,380
This photo is a little bit slanted.

639
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,690
Thank you.

640
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,990
Would you like one more photo?

641
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,700
- No. We don't need any more photos.
- I must say...

642
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,890
(The photographer in dark pink
knows how to sell things.)

643
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,790
- Who gets this? I'll keep it.
- She keeps forcing us.

644
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,230
- She won't stop forcing us.
- Then take one more photo for us.

645
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,890
- Okay then.
- I think we need four photos.

646
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,830
- We don't need that many.
- Whenever you're ready.

647
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,670
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

648
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,300
- It's because... Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

649
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,870
- Each of us should have one.
- That's not necessary.

650
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,480
- Then let's have three taken.
- Okay.

651
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,310
- You two are always together, so...
- Hey.

652
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,340
Let's have photos taken for now.

653
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,720
Jong Kook, this one is ours.

654
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,520
She said, "This one is ours."

655
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,990
One, two, three.

656
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,380
- I like this one.
- That's nice.

657
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,550
- Okay.
- All right.

658
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,850
- That's great.
- Let's go.

659
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,120
- Come over here.
- Oh, my.

660
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,620
- You see, I think...
- Yes?

661
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,770
I guess it's sort of
an essential activity.

662
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,860
Today is the perfect day
for an outing.

663
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,040
It's perfect.

664
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,590
It got much colder,

665
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,970
but it's sunny and warm today.

666
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,510
- The weather is so nice.
- It's really sunny.

667
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,010
- This doesn't happen that often.
- Absolutely.

668
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,570
The air quality is good today too.

669
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,640
- Oh, my. Look at the sky.
- It's not too hot or too cold.

670
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,720
It reminds me of the sky
in Los Angeles.

671
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,280
Why do you always...

672
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,290
- compare the best things to LA?
- I mean, the sky is...

673
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,310
- You're in Korea right now.
- I know that.

674
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,430
Look at the sky. It's magnificent.

675
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,930
- That's crazy.
- There are no clouds or anything.

676
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,560
It looks so clear.

677
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,270
- This is so tasty.
- We should look up at the sky.

678
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,670
We never know when we get to see
the sky like this again.

679
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,630
Oh, my. It's really nice here.

680
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,900
I should really bring my loving wife
to a place like this.

681
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,710
(Ms. Jeon Bok Ja is excited.)

682
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,280
- This is really nice.
- What's with you?

683
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,520
What's the length of the video
for 50 dollars?

684
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,220
My goodness. I didn't know
I would meet you here.

685
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,020
I can't believe I met you here.

686
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,720
It's so good to see you again.
Have you been well?

687
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,760
Ms. Jeon.

688
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,320
Guys, I just met my friend here.

689
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,350
- Ms. Jeon.
- She's acting like a mom.

690
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,350
How are the kids?

691
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,700
- I heard...
- Ms. Jeon.

692
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,470
that your child went to college.

693
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,090
- Gather round, everyone.
- I see an R flag here.

694
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,270
- Oh, we should go that way.
- Where?

695
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,900
- Please come this way.
- Come here.

696
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,750
There are some crocks
and other things here.

697
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,800
(The prankster is acting up again.)

698
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,180
(The kid with the ice cream
already got on the rickshaw.)

699
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,690
My, this is so good.

700
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,220
- Are you ready?
- The rickshaw driver looks strong.

701
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,850
- That's good. Keep going.
- Right. Okay.

702
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,290
- This is good. He drove too slowly.
- Okay.

703
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,120
- We're going really fast.
- Okay.

704
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,290
We're going so fast.

705
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,290
- Oh, no. Watch out.
- Be careful.

706
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,890
- This is fun.
- That's pretty.

707
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,630
Jong Kook, is this good exercise
for your lower body?

708
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,400
Yes, but I wish you two were
a little heavier.

709
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,900
- Are we too light?
- Yes.

710
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,540
- You two are too light. Girls...
- He says we're light.

711
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,900
I mean you two are too light.
What's that chair?

712
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,750
Jong Kook is doing that as exercise.

713
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,720
- Right? I thought so.
- Not long ago...

714
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,420
Of course he's doing that
as exercise.

715
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,220
- He said he hadn't worked out...
- Mister.

716
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,920
- Move.
- Who are you?

717
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,150
Gosh, seriously.

718
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,650
He can't get on it.

719
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,960
(The hipster member
jumped in again.)

720
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,120
This is nice.

721
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,030
My, it's incredibly tasty.

722
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,150
Wait. One of you should stay.
We're awkward around each other.

723
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,390
Don't leave us alone.
It's still awkward for us.

724
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,940
Jong Kook should take care of Hyuk.

725
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,010
We don't do that for each other.

726
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,130
What is it? Yes, please take
a photo of us together.

727
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,210
With that scenery behind us.
That's good.

728
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,450
(They made an impulse buy.)

729
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,720
Thank you.

730
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,220
- Thank you.
- It's three dollars.

731
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,810
- Pardon?
- That's three dollars?

732
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,650
You're practically a thief.

733
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,690
(You're practically a thief!)

734
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,850
That's a place
where you can make a wish.

735
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,350
- Does anyone have a coin?
- I didn't expect to see that.

736
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,030
- This place is nice.
- The weather is so good.

737
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,730
I'm with the people I love
on such a beautiful day.

738
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,170
- It makes you feel happy.
- Everything is perfect.

739
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,560
"Anyway, that's why I was happy."

740
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,200
- Exactly.
- Anyway, that's why I was happy

741
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,300
Wave at the camera.
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

742
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,680
It's nice to meet you.

743
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,950
- Oh, my.
- Hello.

744
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,570
Hyung In,
can you take a photo of me?

745
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,640
- Me too.
- Come with me.

746
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,610
- Look at the flowers.
- Don't have a photo taken alone!

747
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,310
- Mister!
- He's having a photo taken alone?

748
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,190
Why would you do that?

749
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,020
Why would he waste our money
like that?

750
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,580
My gosh. You can't spend our money
just as you please.

751
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,390
- Good.
- My gosh.

752
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,960
Why would you waste our money?

753
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,290
(Let's have a photo taken together.)

754
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,470
- Go away. I'll pose with him alone.
- But I want to...

755
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,500
Let me have one taken with him too.

756
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,360
Have a photo taken with him alone
after this.

757
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,060
- One, two, three.
- Gosh.

758
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,800
- That was great.
- Hyuk, can I take one with you too?

759
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,900
- Can you take a photo of us? Yes.
- Would you like a photo?

760
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,900
(Everyone asks the star
for a photo.)

761
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,680
That's great.

762
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,790
- Hyuk, can I take one with you too?
- Yes?

763
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,380
In front of the flowers there.
Excuse me.

764
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,420
- I want to join you guys.
- Hyuk, can you...

765
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,850
- strike this pose with me?
- Sure.

766
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,730
Guys, stop having photos taken.

767
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,000
- One, two, three.
- Ms. Jeon.

768
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,320
- He's a married man.
- My gosh.

769
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,500
- Thank you.
- I look great in this photo.

770
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,740
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk was looking at
his photos.)

771
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,010
- Hyung In, I like this photo.
- Thank you, Hyuk.

772
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,170
- I like this one. It's great.
- Do you like it?

773
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,800
- How much is for a photo?
- I like this.

774
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,300
Why would you have it taken alone?

775
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,210
How many photos
did you have taken alone?

776
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,220
My gosh.
Why did you have photos taken alone?

777
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,840
- Am I not allowed to do that?
- Why?

778
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,720
- Come on. You spent...
- It's our common fund.

779
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,540
- That's not true. I spent my money.
- Why would you do that?

780
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,810
- Hey... Photographer.
- Mister, come on.

781
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,080
- What's wrong...
- He called her "Photographer".

782
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,820
- Can we take a group photo?
- You shouldn't do that.

783
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,500
- A group photo, everyone.
- Chan Hee...

784
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,320
- Gather round for a group photo.
- It's ridiculous.

785
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,970
- What's going on?
- We're taking a group photo.

786
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,320
- But...
- Smile.

787
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,560
Gosh, seriously.

788
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,670
(They're taking
a group photo again.)

789
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,940
Ready? One, two, three.

790
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,630
(Their trip expenses are going up
higher and higher.)

791
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,640
- Enough. Stop spending money.
- This is great.

792
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,870
- I'm serious.
- Give me that.

793
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,070
Oh, my. The weather is so nice.

794
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,990
Indeed.

795
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,310
Try to imitate Hyuk.
"I'm Jang Hyuk."

796
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,190
"I'm Jang Hyuk."

797
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,320
"Hello."

798
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,080
- "I'm Jang Hyuk.
- "I'm Jang Hyuk.

799
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,590
It's so beautiful here
with the mountain in the distance.

800
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,120
- It's a perfect spot for a picnic.
- It's beautiful.

801
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,320
It's pretty over there.

802
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,360
- We have chairs. Look at the view.
- How beautiful.

803
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,290
- Hey... Photographer.
- It's beautiful.

804
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,010
- Stop it!
- Come over here, photographer.

805
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,060
Stop taking photos.

806
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,630
We have to take a photo here.

807
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,710
That's enough.

808
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,370
- This is such a hassle.
- Photographer.

809
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,800
- Why are we...
- Come here, Haha.

810
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,310
- Can you take a photo of us?
- Join us here.

811
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,810
- Gosh. Stop it, guys.
- Here.

812
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,610
- Smile.
- Stop having photos taken.

813
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,380
How many more photos will you buy?

814
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,720
(The pretty middle-aged man's love
for photography explodes.)

815
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,580
- That was nice.
- Who will have this photo?

816
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,580
- It's really nice.
- Look around. It's beautiful.

817
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,320
- It's magnificent.
- Why won't you enjoy the scenery?

818
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,790
- This is like a work of art.
- I'm amazed.

819
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,090
- Coffee or adlay tea?
- I want the one with walnuts.

820
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,330
- Walnuts?
- Is tea free?

821
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,560
Yes, it's free.

822
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,940
- Great. It's free.
- Really?

823
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,040
- Wait. It's free?
- It's nice.

824
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,070
- Pardon?
- Is it free?

825
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,370
- It's free.
- That's great.

826
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,570
You can't take them away.

827
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,600
But you said it was free.

828
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,370
It's free.

829
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,640
Didn't your son get fired for
stealing from the staff lounge?

830
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,220
Gosh. Don't say that.

831
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,020
So Min looks so natural
as if it's not acting.

832
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,880
This tea tastes quite good.

833
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,930
My, this Solomon's seal tea is good.

834
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,430
(Everyone is enjoying tea
while catching their breath.)

835
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,620
This is amazing.
I look great in this photo, Ji Hyo.

836
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,790
- This is amazing, right?
- Indeed.

837
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,790
I got a good one.
This is the best photo of me.

838
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,360
- It's worth every penny.
- Why did you take a photo alone?

839
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,940
- I like it.
- Why would you guys do that?

840
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,100
Don't take a photo alone.
We don't have much money.

841
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,370
But I really wanted to take one
with Hyuk.

842
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,840
You spent so much
from our common fund.

843
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,640
- You shouldn't...
- I really like this photo.

844
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,810
- What did he say?
- Hyung In, I like this photo.

845
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,810
- This is the best photo of me.
- Show me.

846
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:10,880
Take a look.

847
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,950
Oh, my.
It doesn't look like a Poraroid.

848
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,380
- "A Poraroid"?
- He said "Poraroid".

849
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,320
It looks as if they were abroad.
Isn't it nice?

850
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,850
- We look great, right?
- Why does it taste weird?

851
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,290
It looks as if I met a top star...

852
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,650
at a tourist spot overseas.

853
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,770
- It's amazing indeed.
- Yes.

854
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,620
Hey, did you meet Hyuk?
I met him too.

855
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,090
- You met him too?
- I met Hyuk too.

856
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,560
- Me too.
- Hyuk must've traveled a lot.

857
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,400
- I met Hyuk too.
- Hyuk has great body proportions.

858
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,900
- He met Hyuk too.
- Yes, I did too.

859
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,710
Hyuk must've traveled
to so many places. Suk Jin.

860
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,710
- You shouldn't have...
- You should save memories.

861
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,840
- Have more photos taken.
- You had so many photos...

862
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,780
Why haven't I received my photo?

863
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,280
Maybe you didn't ask for it.

864
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,040
Hyuk, did you receive
the photo of us together?

865
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,020
- Yes, I have it here.
- You have it?

866
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,460
I can't believe this.

867
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,730
I wanted to keep our memories too.

868
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,230
- Gosh. Hey, photographer!
- He startled me.

869
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,530
- I want my money back.
- Calm down.

870
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,560
- Gosh. What is this?
- Where are you going?

871
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,940
- Look. Give me my money back.
- It's not that bad.

872
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,090
- Photographer! Look at this.
- Show me.

873
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,360
- It was shot against the light.
- Look at this.

874
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,470
They should give me my money back.

875
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,180
I'll explain the rules
of the first mission now.

876
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,010
- Okay.
- Forget about the rules.

877
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,040
Let's just have fun.

878
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,180
- We'll just see Hyuk's dance.
- Right.

879
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,370
- Why would I dance here?
- Right, his old dance performance.

880
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,190
- Let's see his dance performance.
- Let's just play a quiz game.

881
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,580
- You'll understand if you hear it.
- Is that so?

882
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,020
Hyuk is famous for his performance
in "The Slave Hunters", right?

883
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,530
- "The Slave Hunters".
- Absolutely.

884
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,620
- "Un Nyun!"
- "Un Nyun!"

885
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,590
- "Un Nyun!"
- So are we going to hunt slaves?

886
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,670
The first mission is...

887
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,090
Reminiscent Chattering.

888
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,440
- That's great.
- Reminiscent Chattering?

889
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,510
- That sounds fun.
- I like the title of the mission.

890
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,600
Reminiscent Chattering.

891
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,210
- I love chattering the most.
- When it comes to chattering,

892
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,540
- We can talk about old days.
- Hyuk is really good at that too.

893
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,400
- Hyuk likes chattering too.
- Yes.

894
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,810
- He likes chattering.
- He speaks slowly though.

895
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,640
Here are the rules.
You have 30 minutes...

896
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,190
to just have a chat.

897
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,290
- Oh, yes!
- Okay.

898
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,310
However, if no one speaks
for more than five seconds,

899
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,930
ten dollars will be added
to your trip expense.

900
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,850
- Come on. That's so long.
- We won't even last three seconds.

901
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,120
That's total nonsense.

902
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,430
- That won't ever happen.
- Give us a topic,

903
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,590
and see how we continue
talking about it.

904
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,330
- Of course.
- Also, since this is an outing,

905
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,740
- there's one special rule.
- What is it?

906
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,360
In 30 minutes,
each one of you has...

907
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
- your Secret Santa.
- What?

908
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,380
- We'll decide your Secret Santa.
- Okay.

909
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,400
As someone's Secret Santa,

910
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,320
you must react enthusiastically
to whatever he or she says.

911
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,460
(Secret Santa Rule:
React enthusiastically to every comment.)

912
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,360
We do that, no matter who speaks.
You know that.

913
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,900
- We're like robots.
- However,

914
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,470
after it's over,

915
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,470
- We shouldn't get caught?
- if you find out...

916
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,740
who your Secret Santa is,

917
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,470
both you and your Secret Santa
get extra points.

918
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,630
- Then should we be explicit?
- It'll be too obvious.

919
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,980
There's another rule.

920
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,270
Let's say Jong Kook is...

921
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,250
- Jae Suk's Secret Santa.
- Okay.

922
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,110
The others can pretend...

923
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,420
- they're Jae Suk's Secret Santa.
- That could happen.

924
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,490
If you fail to find
your Secret Santa,

925
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,520
you will lose points...

926
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,810
while the other gains points.

927
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,190
- That sounds like fun.
- Do you get the rules?

928
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,730
- Then...
- Did you three...

929
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,020
Did you three hear me?

930
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,230
- Then...
- Lotus leaf bread...

931
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,290
- Can we get more bread?
- Sorry?

932
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,200
The lotus leaf bread is to die for.

933
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
It's even better...

934
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,530
- with this beverage.
- I know.

935
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,400
You will come forward...

936
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,270
- All we have to do is talk.
- and find out...

937
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,600
whose Secret Santa you are.

938
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,910
- Sure.
- Got it.

939
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,130
You can tell us while we're here.

940
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,450
You need to hear it one at a time.

941
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,950
- I will be...
- Why?

942
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,680
- Keep it short.
- Respond to this person well...

943
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,870
and make sure that
he or she keeps talking.

944
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,110
Can I refuse?

945
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,840
How funny.

946
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,690
You must respond to others
if you wish to win points.

947
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,230
Okay, I got it.

948
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,660
Hyuk, you're next.

949
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,000
In Hyuk's case...

950
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,670
Respond well
whenever this person talks.

951
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,590
- Got it.
- He's not one to respond well.

952
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,860
Who do I have?

953
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,060
(Oh...)

954
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,600
Okay, I got it.

955
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,170
Really?

956
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,570
- This is easy.
- I'm guaranteed a point.

957
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:58,010
Just let the other person know that
you're trying to get them to talk.

958
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,180
- Sure.
- Can we tell the other person?

959
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,580
I'll just tell everyone
whose Secret Santa I am.

960
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,280
Go ahead. It might be a lie, right?

961
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,720
- Is that so?
- Jae Suk, are you going to say it?

962
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,810
- Yes.
- Who is it?

963
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,110
You know how I am.

964
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,460
I don't play mind games.

965
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,660
Really?

966
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,850
- You won't tell us?
- No.

967
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,960
- Haha, seriously?
- It's him.

968
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,120
He won't say it.

969
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,200
He won't say
whose Secret Santa he is.

970
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,900
That's nothing to laugh at.

971
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,670
Can you believe it?

972
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,210
- So Min, enjoy.
- What's this?

973
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,370
Hey, it's young pollack.

974
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,100
- It's the real deal.
- No way.

975
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,950
- Look.
- So this is what young pollack is.

976
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,750
- Your 30 minutes start now.
- Okay!

977
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,020
And go.

978
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,840
Hyuk, why do even men
find you attractive?

979
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,110
What makes you so charming?

980
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,110
Suk Jin is Hyuk's Secret Santa.

981
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,380
- What on earth?
- I'm sure of it.

982
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,460
That was out of the blue.

983
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,850
Wasn't that awkward?

984
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,930
- What was that?
- It was too obvious.

985
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,350
- He...
- I agree.

986
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,620
- He's Hyuk's Secret Santa.
- Of course.

987
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,820
Hyuk!

988
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,130
- I'm the reason he's a big star.
- You can say just about anything.

989
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,060
He became a top star
due to the love I had for him.

990
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,470
- What?
- In middle school,

991
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,470
- I was Hyuk's...
- That's right!

992
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,530
- That's true.
- I was a fan since his early days.

993
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,240
I bought magazines
to get photos of him.

994
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,210
- Really?
- He was the first celebrity...

995
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,450
- she ever liked.
- They went up on my wall.

996
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,980
I liked him since he appeared in
god's music video of...

997
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,340
- "To My Mother".
- That's right.

998
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,580
Hold on a second.

999
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,110
This isn't just some
meaningless chatter.

1000
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,810
- It was when he was in "Zzang".
- Exactly.

1001
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,230
- Do you know that movie?
- What we want

1002
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,930
- Yes, that's the one.
- Say what you want

1003
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,020
Dong Geun from that movie
is my friend.

1004
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,400
- Hyuk.
- Yang Dong Geun?

1005
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,790
- Hyuk, I remember "School".
- Cha In Pyo played the teacher.

1006
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,740
The KBS series "School".

1007
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,910
I enjoyed that a lot.

1008
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,830
Don't they look like an old couple?

1009
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,210
I almost dropped out of school,

1010
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,530
but that movie prevented me
from doing so.

1011
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,070
I was a huge fan
of the TV series "School".

1012
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,680
(Could Haha be Hyuk's Secret Santa?)

1013
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,690
"Zzang" was filmed near my house.

1014
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,310
- In Anyang?
- In my neighborhood.

1015
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,690
It was filmed
right across the street.

1016
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,310
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1017
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,810
(Is that so?)

1018
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,930
- In your neighborhood?
- That's right.

1019
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,090
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1020
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,820
You were in the TV series "School".

1021
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,060
Yes, "School".

1022
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,230
I remember.

1023
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,330
- So Min, you have a great memory!
- I'm a fan...

1024
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,970
- Wait, you're being weird.
- What do you mean?

1025
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,240
- Hold on a second.
- Wait.

1026
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,860
Is there something you don't know?

1027
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,680
(Is there something you don't know?)

1028
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,680
It's just hard to accept,
that's all.

1029
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,770
Jong Kook has never been...

1030
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,650
this enthusiastic about
what I had to say.

1031
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,340
- Exactly.
- So Min!

1032
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,840
Don't fall for it.

1033
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,350
- So Min, don't fall for it.
- Can Jong Kook...

1034
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,780
be my Secret Santa all the time?

1035
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,690
- So Min!
- This is weird.

1036
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,960
- Well, So Min...
- Ji Hyo,

1037
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,590
weren't you chosen
as someone's Secret Santa?

1038
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,620
(Weren't you chosen
as someone's Secret Santa?)

1039
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,560
Were you the only one
who didn't get a partner?

1040
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,560
- Actually...
- Yes?

1041
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,060
My partner's talking too much,
so I don't know what to do.

1042
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,300
- Really?
- Someone's running wild.

1043
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,330
- Don't overdo it.
- It must be a dilemma for you.

1044
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,440
Hyuk.

1045
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,370
Out of the actresses
you worked with,

1046
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,150
who was most beautiful?

1047
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,100
Out of his projects so far?
That I want to know too.

1048
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,570
- You're right.
- I want to know.

1049
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,110
- Everyone was beautiful.
- But still...

1050
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,150
- What if you had to choose one?
- If you had to choose...

1051
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,610
Everyone was beautiful.

1052
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,920
- But still.
- If you had to choose one.

1053
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,460
Can you ask him? I'm curious too.

1054
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,730
Everyone was beautiful.

1055
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,120
(Laughing awkwardly)

1056
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,930
Everyone was pretty in your eyes!

1057
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,560
We all know you're faking it.

1058
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,270
Everyone was pretty!

1059
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,670
They were all pretty!

1060
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,830
Are you all right?

1061
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,010
When I first met Hyuk,

1062
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,740
he wore glasses like these
all the time.

1063
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,330
- Right?
- Yes.

1064
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,510
- See?
- Do you know where I first met you?

1065
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,340
At the cinema.

1066
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,950
- Really?
- The one in Samseong-dong.

1067
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,950
You were with Jun Ji Hyun.

1068
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,540
Really? I've never
seen her in person before.

1069
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,480
"Windstruck", right?

1070
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,710
- Yes, that movie.
- Right.

1071
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,250
- Your hair was bleached.
- You were there to see it.

1072
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,130
- You wore this kind of glasses.
- You were there to see it.

1073
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,590
Weren't you signed
by the same agency?

1074
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,650
Yes, it's why
we were there together.

1075
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,400
- Of course.
- It was an intense moment for me.

1076
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,320
Just so you know, Bae Yong Joon...

1077
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,230
has this "trauma" about him.

1078
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,460
- What was that word again?
- A trauma?

1079
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:40,832
(Bae Yong Joon is traumatized?)

1080
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,940
I meant an aura.

1081
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,300
- Seriously?
- Unbelievable.

1082
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,340
- An aura.
- A trauma?

1083
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,300
- There's an aura to him.
- Suk Jin.

1084
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,440
- Unbelievable.
- Suk Jin,

1085
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,780
- did he try to beat you up?
- That's not it.

1086
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,250
- Were you traumatized?
- I mean...

1087
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,250
I can't believe that he majored...

1088
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,610
- in business administration.
- This is an aura, right?

1089
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,690
- They're not even similar.
- A trauma?

1090
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,420
- I found it funny though.
- But...

1091
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,690
Yong Joon...

1092
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,820
- Did he ever beat you up?
- Unbelievable.

1093
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,190
Was it the "Autumn Sonata"?

1094
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,590
- "Winter Sonata".
- "Winter Sonata".

1095
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,800
After...

1096
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,940
- "Autumn in My Heart".
- After he became a star,

1097
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,670
we met at someone's wedding.

1098
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,270
I saw him...

1099
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,170
and his hair was long
and waving in the wind.

1100
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,530
He's probably younger than I am.

1101
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,150
- He is.
- Isn't he younger than you?

1102
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,070
- Isn't he the same age as you?
- Yes, he's the same age.

1103
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,610
You said that wrong just now.

1104
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,150
Unbelievable.

1105
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,050
- It's not even that long, but...
- While talking,

1106
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,610
he slipped up about ten times.

1107
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,190
It was a joy to see him...

1108
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,420
and I felt like
I had seen a celebrity.

1109
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,050
I bowed and said hello
while he did this.

1110
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,420
"Yes, hello."

1111
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,590
I bowed...

1112
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,860
while he just shook my hand.

1113
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,770
Anyway, the aura he had...

1114
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,360
(Yelping)

1115
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,230
(To the side)

1116
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,000
(He shows off his talent
for slapstick comedy.)

1117
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,280
That was hilarious.

1118
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,900
It was fun.

1119
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,070
- I liked it.
- He's a funny one.

1120
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,820
Suk Jin sure is a funny one.

1121
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,020
Did you remove my chair?

1122
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,340
- No, it wasn't me.
- Was it you?

1123
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,110
He must be traumatized.

1124
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,250
That was funny.

1125
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,960
Did someone pour alcohol
into his cup?

1126
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,190
I'm your Secret Santa.

1127
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,420
I mean it. I'm your Secret Santa.

1128
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,480
(Was it Se Chan's way
of helping Suk Jin?)

1129
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,630
From what I hear,
"Princess Hours" is being remade.

1130
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,130
- Really?
- Yes.

1131
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,960
- You were in the original series!
- Ji Hyo...

1132
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,360
- Of course.
- Of course I was in it.

1133
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,090
- I had forgotten about it.
- How could you now knot that?

1134
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,610
It's ironic, isn't it?

1135
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,860
In "Princess Hours"...

1136
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,300
With Yoon Eun Hye...

1137
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:30,210
- Did you see that?
- What's so ironic?

1138
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,550
- I mean...
- That's enough.

1139
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,750
- You've done enough.
- Jong Kook.

1140
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,820
Aren't I allowed
to mention "Princess Hours"?

1141
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,210
- You can but...
- There's that photo.

1142
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,480
A photo of the poster
with Jong Kook's face on it...

1143
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,780
- is being circulated.
- That's what I told you.

1144
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,650
- Isn't it true?
- So Min...

1145
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,380
Unbelievable.

1146
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,800
Did you see the photo?

1147
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,550
Of course I did, So Min.

1148
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,670
- Goodness.
- So actually...

1149
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,940
- So Min's on a roll today.
- If you think about it,

1150
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,590
- life can take odd turns.
- Exactly.

1151
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,730
- Kim Jeong Hoon was in it too.
- Can you explain this?

1152
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,500
Rumor has it
that Chaeyeon liked you.

1153
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,230
- They met when she was a fan.
- She was a fan.

1154
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,550
- What's with this gesture?
- Well...

1155
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,940
- As a fan...
- We didn't see each other.

1156
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,170
- You met on "Date with the Stars".
- Exactly.

1157
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,610
- With Chaeyeon...
- She was Jin Sook back then.

1158
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,050
- Yes, Jin Sook.
- Back when she was in high school,

1159
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,960
we met through a show
called "Date with the Stars".

1160
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,820
It might be hard to understand
if you don't explain it well.

1161
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,900
In the 90s, there was a show
that let fans meet their idols.

1162
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,570
- Yes, "Date with the Stars".
- There was a show.

1163
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,320
- That existed.
- They got about...

1164
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,270
- one or two days.
- Yes, two days.

1165
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,130
- They got to spend time together.
- Really?

1166
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,500
Before Chaeyeon made her debut,

1167
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,900
- she went by Jin Sook.
- That's right.

1168
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,440
She applied for
a spot on the show...

1169
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
- and she met with Jong Kook.
- That's right.

1170
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,800
Did you date her?

1171
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,380
- No, we...
- That's all I'll say.

1172
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,840
- Did they date?
- What do you mean?

1173
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,150
She accompanied me on my gigs...

1174
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,150
- and...
- They went to a ski resort.

1175
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,090
- For an overnight trip?
- White snow

1176
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,550
- Falls
- Of course not.

1177
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,820
She followed me around...

1178
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,750
- and rode with me in my van.
- For how many days?

1179
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,250
Hold on.

1180
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,800
What happened after
the cameras stopped filming?

1181
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,000
- Did you get a few drinks?
- No, that's not it.

1182
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,420
- She was in high school!
- She was...

1183
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,800
- in high school.
- She was in high school.

1184
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,170
Goodness.

1185
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,400
Do you get it?
She was in high school.

1186
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,230
Later on, they met on "X-Man".

1187
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,340
And I...

1188
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,980
During the Absolutely Game,

1189
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,170
she asked if he remembered her.

1190
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,420
- The Absolutely Game?
- Through his thin eyes he said,

1191
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,210
"Have you been well, Jin Sook?"

1192
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,750
(Have you been well, Jin Sook?)

1193
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,360
That's how he said it!

1194
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,750
- Hey!
- What is it?

1195
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,030
That wasn't the case.

1196
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,590
I'm the one who asked her first!

1197
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,590
(He recognized her first
and said this.)

1198
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,800
Jin Sook, it's been a while.

1199
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,960
"Jin Sook, it's been a while"?

1200
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,000
(With memorable lines,)

1201
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,170
(Jong Kook created
many memorable scenes.)

1202
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,340
You're all grown up now.

1203
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,840
(You're all grown up now.)

1204
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:46,050
Jong Kook was the first to ask
if she had been well.

1205
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,280
- That's enough.
- That's so cool.

1206
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,840
- You created a lot of drama.
- He...

1207
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,050
Were they in a love triangle then?

1208
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,880
- Not a love triangle.
- That wasn't it?

1209
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,050
It wasn't a love triangle.

1210
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,550
He had a thing
with both women though.

1211
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,650
- There weren't any feelings.
- He said...

1212
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,150
it wasn't a love triangle...

1213
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,190
but you had a thing with both women.

1214
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,900
There must've been
something going on.

1215
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,730
- I bet you don't know him well.
- A friend knows best.

1216
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,460
Don't be ridiculous.
Nothing was going on.

1217
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,070
Instead, it was...

1218
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,670
The fact that he's drinking water...

1219
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,070
tells me that it's worth
looking into.

1220
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,500
Are you kidding me?

1221
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,380
- Is this because he's nervous?
- Don't be ridiculous.

1222
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,840
- I bet he's nervous.
- He sure is.

1223
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,570
Hyuk has been in the industry
for a long time.

1224
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,550
- Of course.
- Of course.

1225
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,460
I just got the chills.

1226
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,590
When we're this far away,

1227
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,860
Jong Kook normally chooses
to ignore what I say.

1228
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,650
I didn't even speak out loud,
but he heard everything.

1229
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,860
Well, you just have
a lot of great things to say today.

1230
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,570
- Why don't you dance?
- What?

1231
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,530
From what I know, Jong Kook...

1232
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,900
(Laughing loudly)

1233
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,070
Ji Hyo, why don't you dance too?

1234
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,210
So Min...

1235
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,840
(Lady Song shimmies as well.)

1236
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,900
There you go.

1237
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,300
This is fun.

1238
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,710
(They're suddenly having
a dance party.)

1239
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,210
- What don't I have?
- Wait.

1240
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,320
- What do you think you're doing?
- Well...

1241
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,840
- What are you doing?
- What is this?

1242
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,980
I was just excited.

1243
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,320
- Look at this!
- It's so dirty.

1244
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,550
Why is his leg so skinny?

1245
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,590
What is this?

1246
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,750
- Look at his leg.
- This is...

1247
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,690
- Why is your leg white and skinny?
- What is this?

1248
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,730
- I can't believe it.
- What's wrong with you?

1249
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:10,860
Mister!

1250
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,770
- What's wrong with your thigh?
- That's...

1251
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:13,900
You want to open it more?

1252
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,440
It's not working.

1253
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,270
My goodness.

1254
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,030
Your leg...

1255
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,780
What's wrong with your leg?

1256
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,030
It's so skinny and white.

1257
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,170
Why is it so white?

1258
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,900
- What happened to you?
- What?

1259
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,150
- What about it?
- What happened to your leg?

1260
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,920
- What's wrong with it?
- It's really white.

1261
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,420
My legs aren't that thick.

1262
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,210
- Speaking of which...
- I want to hear more stories.

1263
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,710
- I want to hear more from them.
- Hyuk...

1264
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:40,360
So Min was a big fan of Hyuk's.

1265
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,130
And you're seeing
each other on a show.

1266
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,590
Did you have his poster as well?

1267
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,730
- Did you?
- I actually...

1268
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,360
Why are you saying such nonsense?

1269
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,400
You don't do that...

1270
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,630
- on "How Do You Play?".
- Exactly.

1271
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,460
"How Do You Play?" is really fun
these days.

1272
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,940
Will you pay more attention
to Running Man as well?

1273
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,840
Your character
on "How Do You Play?"...

1274
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,900
- is a big hit.
- That's right.

1275
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,300
Please treat us to drinks.

1276
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,780
You should treat them to drinks
from time to time!

1277
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,380
You've never asked
to hang out with me.

1278
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,190
- Not even once!
- Stop it!

1279
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,190
- Haha is in his 40s now!
- This is why...

1280
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,150
- "This is why"?
- I didn't want to meet up.

1281
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,590
- Haha is in his 40s now!
- Hey!

1282
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,550
Take that off, Suk Jin!
I hate the sight of it.

1283
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,460
Why? I like it. Why would you
tell me to take it off?

1284
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,690
We're not even by the sea!

1285
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,630
- That's not it.
- Why are you wearing a life jacket?

1286
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,690
I like it!

1287
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,230
- I like it.
- He's traumatized.

1288
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,900
Anyway, it's all a misunderstanding.

1289
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,110
- Okay.
- It's a misunderstanding.

1290
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,610
- Haha loves us.
- All right.

1291
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,000
You guys are the first ones
I give out yellow corvina to.

1292
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,340
Right. That's true.

1293
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,880
I have a question.
If I'm someone's Secret Santa,

1294
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
is he or she mine too?

1295
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,980
- No.
- Oh, it's different.

1296
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,550
- You didn't know that until now?
- Suk Jin.

1297
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,820
- He is indeed traumatized.
- That could happen.

1298
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,210
I haven't played it for so long.

1299
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,610
He is traumatized.

1300
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,630
What's with this?

1301
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,860
Suk Jin is traumatized.

1302
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,920
- He's traumatized.
- He's traumatized.

1303
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,090
He's indeed traumatized.

1304
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,400
- He's indeed traumatized.
- Of course.

1305
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,800
- By the way, Hyuk...
- "Eat up."

1306
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,940
Whose Secret Santa is Hyuk?

1307
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,860
- Seriously.
- I could roughly tell others'.

1308
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,460
- All right. Time is up.
- Oh, really?

1309
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,880
Guess who is your Secret Santa...

1310
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,400
and write it down.

1311
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,440
It's obvious.

1312
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,750
I could...

1313
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,820
I could clearly tell.

1314
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,520
- I have to find my Secret Santa?
- That's right.

1315
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,590
- The one...
- Find the person...

1316
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:13,110
- who reacted to you the most.
- Someone who reacted the most.

1317
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,480
It's so confusing.

1318
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,460
- Someone who reacted for me...
- Look at him.

1319
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,750
Only one person reacted for me.

1320
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,190
(Some are certain,
and some are confused...)

1321
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,230
So Min.

1322
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,800
(as they write down the names.)

1323
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,090
(Exchanging looks)

1324
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,190
It's so clear.

1325
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,400
I'm really confused.

1326
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,670
- No one reacted for me.
- You're confused?

1327
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,670
Haha wasn't one either.

1328
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,530
Many people reacted
to what Hyuk said.

1329
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:34,940
They could've made me
their target on purpose.

1330
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,150
- I'll announce the results now.
- All right.

1331
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,440
- Of course I guessed right.
- Suk Jin...

1332
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,150
- picked Se Chan.
- That's right.

1333
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,190
Really?

1334
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,280
And it is...

1335
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,650
(Suk Jin picked Se Chan
as his Secret Santa.)

1336
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,750
Se Chan.

1337
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,380
- It was really you.
- That's right.

1338
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,710
- You're getting a point each.
- I was your Secret Santa.

1339
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,130
It was you.

1340
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,530
Ji Hyo...

1341
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:53,690
(Ji Hyo picked...)

1342
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,420
picked Suk Jin as her Secret Santa.

1343
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,590
(Suk Jin as her Secret Santa.)

1344
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,800
It is Suk Jin.

1345
00:42:58,570 --> 00:42:59,820
- What?
- For real?

1346
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,800
- Yes!
- Why did he react so late then?

1347
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,710
No, he did react occasionally.

1348
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,710
- Did he?
- Really?

1349
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,000
Jae Suk...

1350
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,380
- wrote So Min's name.
- Yes.

1351
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,340
- And it is So Min.
- I knew it was her.

1352
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,500
- You all got it.
- Of course it was So Min.

1353
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,250
Why would Secret Santas
make it so obvious?

1354
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,320
I know who it is now.

1355
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,920
Jong Kook...

1356
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,050
(Jong Kook picked...)

1357
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,050
- wrote Jae Suk's name.
- That's right.

1358
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,020
And it is Jae Suk.

1359
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,480
It's impossible
for you to guess it wrong.

1360
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,280
That's right.
But it's nerve-racking...

1361
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,530
- This is somewhat heartwarming.
- although I know who it is.

1362
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:30,630
So Min wrote down Jong Kook's name,

1363
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,270
- and it is Jong Kook.
- It was obvious.

1364
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,000
- It's so heartwarming.
- I did well, didn't I?

1365
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,530
- This is heartwarming and nice.
- Are you done with it now?

1366
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,940
- We don't have to be mean.
- Yes.

1367
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,210
He's done with it now.

1368
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:39,400
Haha...

1369
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,400
(Haha picked...)

1370
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,230
wrote down Ji Hyo's name.

1371
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,250
It's her.

1372
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,050
- It is her.
- We all got it correct?

1373
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,170
- We all got it correct.
- We all got it correct?

1374
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,320
- Right?
- We all got it correct.

1375
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,710
Se Chan...

1376
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,710
(Se Chan picked...)

1377
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,150
- I think he got the wrong one.
- No, he got it correct.

1378
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,750
- wrote down Hyuk's name,
- It's me.

1379
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,190
- and it is him.
- Yes!

1380
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,190
(Se Chan picked Hyuk
as his Secret Santa.)

1381
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,320
Hyuk.

1382
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,280
- I thought he got it wrong.
- You reacted for him?

1383
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,630
I reacted to everything he said.

1384
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,650
It didn't even show.

1385
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,250
- Hyuk...
- I got the wrong person.

1386
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,920
wrote down So Min's name,

1387
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,190
- It was Haha.
- and it's not her.

1388
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,800
- What's wrong with you?
- Hey.

1389
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,400
(His real Secret Santa was Haha.)

1390
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,000
- I talked to you a lot!
- That's not it.

1391
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
How could you have
guessed that wrong?

1392
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,110
I didn't have that many questions
about you, to be honest!

1393
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,400
I knew it was...

1394
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,920
one of you two,
and I was wondering who it was.

1395
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,050
- Me too.
- I almost picked Haha at the end,

1396
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:25,920
but So Min's reaction...

1397
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,280
- was very aggressive, so...
- So Min kept reacting to...

1398
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,360
what Jae Suk said.

1399
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,420
- That's right.
- You didn't see that?

1400
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,150
- That's how I felt.
- Thank you.

1401
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,920
It's because you kept telling him
that you were his fan.

1402
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,360
He's the sloppiest person
that I know.

1403
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,460
I can tell.

1404
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,770
So Min will take another point.

1405
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,960
And Hyuk and Haha
got one point taken off.

1406
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,070
The winner,

1407
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:45,940
the sole winner, So Min...

1408
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,900
will get extra 20 dollars.

1409
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,380
Treat us to one, will you?
Let's take a photo.

1410
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,210
- Of course. Let's take a photo.
- How many points did she win?

1411
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,280
- Let's take a photo.
- Thank you.

1412
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,380
She got three points.

1413
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,610
- Gosh, So Min.
- I don't have much.

1414
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:59,590
So far, you've spent 183.5 dollars.

1415
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,610
- We spent so much.
- What did you say?

1416
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:01,750
We spent so much.

1417
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:02,960
The entrance is beautiful.

1418
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,030
(Entrance fee for 8)

1419
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,690
(8 lotus leaf corn dogs)

1420
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:07,360
(8 lotus leaf ice cream)

1421
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,050
(2 rickshaws)

1422
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,400
(Lots of photos)

1423
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,570
(Total: 183.5 dollars)

1424
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:21,710
We'll tell you how you'll pay
for it once you're in the car.

1425
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,940
- We spent that much?
- Do we have that much money?

1426
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,670
- Let's move on to the next spot.
- Shall we?

1427
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:29,050
All right. Let's go!

1428
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:36,090
It's time to decide how you'll pay
for the money you spent lavishly.

1429
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,750
You guys took so many
individual photos.

1430
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:40,550
Don't say we spent money lavishly.

1431
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:43,300
Soon, you'll get in the car
one by one.

1432
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:47,800
There are three flags
waiting in front of the car.

1433
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,400
They are in red, yellow, and green.

1434
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,400
(They need to pick choose
one of the flags.)

1435
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,210
You'll each select one
before getting in the car.

1436
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,670
The ones who picked
the color that was least picked...

1437
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:54,670
will be exempted.

1438
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:55,670
(The ones that pick the least picked
color will be exempted.)

1439
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,440
- No!
- You can...

1440
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,570
You can discuss it in advance.

1441
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,280
You like green, don't you?

1442
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,280
Well...

1443
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,380
I'm sorry, but I'm going to
pick red no matter what.

1444
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,480
- I pick red too.
- I'm sorry.

1445
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,610
- I'll also pick red.
- I can't help but pick red.

1446
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:07,780
I'll also pick red.

1447
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,480
- I'll pick red.
- He likes red.

1448
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:11,630
I also like red, but...

1449
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:12,730
What about you, Hyuk?

1450
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,190
Well, I like green.

1451
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,650
- You like green?
- I like red too.

1452
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:17,570
If you're ready,
let's start with Haha.

1453
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,030
(Haha sets off first.)

1454
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,500
(It's a psychological battle
that requires quick wit and luck.)

1455
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,210
These are the colors of reggae.

1456
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:27,400
(They need to pick the least
chosen color to be exempted.)

1457
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:29,280
I'll pick this.

1458
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,480
- I know. He'll pick green.
- Everyone.

1459
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,920
- I want to pick yellow though.
- You'll pick green no matter what.

1460
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,940
I'll pick yellow.

1461
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,190
I think many people
will pick yellow.

1462
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,840
- Go for yellow.
- Many will go for yellow.

1463
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,750
This is so difficult.

1464
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:42,210
(He's come to the place
to make his decision.)

1465
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,050
(He picked the green flag?)

1466
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,250
(He said he'd pick yellow,
but he picked the green flag.)

1467
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,000
You're here.

1468
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I'm here.

1469
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,400
Which one did you pick?

1470
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,340
Which color did you pick?

1471
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,860
- My gosh.
- Did you also pick green?

1472
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:59,170
You don't like green that much.

1473
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,230
You picked that thinking no one
would pick it.

1474
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,530
(Which color did Haha pick?)

1475
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:04,050
I told you I'd pick green.

1476
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:08,110
- Why did you pick green?
- I told you I'd pick green.

1477
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,150
- You should've picked yellow.
- I was going to, but...

1478
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,150
Which one should I pick?

1479
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,050
My favorite color.

1480
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,860
Hey!

1481
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:21,960
Which one did you pick?

1482
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,050
(The two of them
already picked green.)

1483
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,030
- They told me to take it.
- Right. Let me see.

1484
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,630
(She picked the yellow flag.)

1485
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:28,630
Is it different from yours?

1486
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:29,730
I'm glad.

1487
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,030
(Green 2, Yellow 1)

1488
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:35,110
Which color should I pick?

1489
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:37,110
(Thinking hard)

1490
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:38,380
I'll just go for it.

1491
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,380
He's here.

1492
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,250
Which one did you pick?
I think he got the green flag.

1493
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,250
- Which one did you pick? Green?
- No way.

1494
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:46,250
You said you'd pick red.

1495
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:47,420
(It's another green flag.)

1496
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,980
I told you I'd pick green.

1497
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:51,550
(The three middle-aged men
hit it off.)

1498
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,630
But I told everyone
that I'd pick green.

1499
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,000
You picked green? Darn it.

1500
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,550
I'm done for. Green is the majority.

1501
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,770
- Gosh.
- No, there are just three of us.

1502
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,170
We'll have to pay for this later.

1503
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,440
They said the penalty
was something tedious.

1504
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,230
My gosh.
I guess yellow stands a chance.

1505
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:04,530
It does.

1506
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:06,110
No one was interested in it.

1507
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:07,280
Green is done for.

1508
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:11,900
(Yang Hong Gil comes to
pick his flag while humming.)

1509
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,210
The three of us
will pick red for sure.

1510
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,650
- I'm going for red.
- Shall we push ahead with it?

1511
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:18,550
Which color will you pick, Hyuk?

1512
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:19,780
I'm picking red.

1513
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:21,880
- Are you going for red too?
- Yes, I'm going for red.

1514
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,880
I'll pick red for real.

1515
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,480
(All four of them told each other
that they'd pick red.)

1516
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:30,190
(Se Chan picked the red flag
for real.)

1517
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,190
Where should I hide it?

1518
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:34,090
- I picked red for real.
- No one has chosen red yet.

1519
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:35,130
- Really?
- Yes.

1520
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:36,800
That's why I was going to
pick yellow.

1521
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,860
Which one did you pick?

1522
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,570
I picked yellow,
and they all picked green.

1523
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:40,570
Really?

1524
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:41,980
(So Min and Se Chan have
high chances. The rest set off.)

1525
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,030
What is this?

1526
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:46,210
I think Se Chan picked green...

1527
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,820
after making everyone else pick red.

1528
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,880
(The minority will be decided
based on their choices.)

1529
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,250
I'll pick red.

1530
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,250
(Ji Hyo chose red.)

1531
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,320
I'll pick red.

1532
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,150
(Jong Kook chose red.)

1533
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,030
Hide it inside so they can't see it.

1534
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:05,270
(Even Hyuk picked red.)

1535
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,900
Hyuk. Which color did you pick?

1536
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,090
- Which one did you pick?
- Which color is it?

1537
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,300
- All right!
- He picked red too.

1538
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,500
It's decided!

1539
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:14,380
This is fascinating.
Am I an outcast or something?

1540
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,530
Why am I the only one
who picked yellow?

1541
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:17,050
This is incredible.
Only one person picked yellow.

1542
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:19,980
The seven of you
will divide the bill...

1543
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,320
- All right.
- and pay 26 dollars each.

1544
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:26,150
Give me 30 dollars each.
I'll give you the change.

1545
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:27,550
- Gosh.
- Thirty dollars?

1546
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:28,980
- Thirty dollars.
- Thirty dollars.

1547
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,880
So Min even earned extra cash.

1548
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,920
So Min, you might be
the sole winner today.

1549
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,400
- Aren't we getting a prize?
- You are.

1550
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:36,250
We have a prize today.

1551
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,270
Let's move to the next spot.

1552
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:39,670
- All right.
- We'll get going now.

1553
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,090
Thank you.

1554
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,170
Where are we headed to?

1555
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:45,210
We'll have lunch, and you'll be
done for today after one mission.

1556
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:46,460
- What are we having?
- But I'm full!

1557
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,730
I'm so full too.

1558
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:49,900
What are we having?

1559
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,570
When you're on an outing,
you should have...

1560
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:52,940
- Baeksuk?
- No, not baeksuk.

1561
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,340
We had baeksuk recently.

1562
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,440
- Is that so?
- Are we having eel?

1563
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,480
Yes, we're having eel.

1564
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,340
(Revitalizing food for autumn, eel)

1565
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,090
- Nice! We're having eel.
- My gosh.

1566
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,320
I had eel for breakfast though.

1567
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,530
- I should work out a lot today.
- Who has eel for breakfast?

1568
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:06,460
I had eel for breakfast
because we had it at home.

1569
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,550
- I love eels.
- That's incredible.

1570
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,030
We also prepared many dishes
other than eels.

1571
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:10,190
- Oh, really?
- There's green onion jeon too.

1572
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:11,500
- All right!
- Green onion jeon sounds good.

1573
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:13,270
I guess we'll have to
pay for it too.

1574
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,270
- Oh, right. We have to pay for it.
- We're having eel?

1575
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,300
- That'll be expensive.
- Let's enjoy it and pay for it.

1576
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,300
Let's do that.

1577
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,710
Right. Let's not mind it
when we eat.

1578
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:20,940
We'll divide the bill anyway.

1579
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,230
- Can you take a photo of me?
- Again?

1580
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,880
- Stop. I'm so tired of it.
- I want to take it with you.

1581
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,170
Then I'll take it when we arrive.

1582
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,250
Let's take a photo
at a good spot when we arrive.

1583
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,710
We haven't even driven for an hour
from Seoul,

1584
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:33,520
and the view
is already looking nice.

1585
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,110
I didn't get to enjoy
views like this.

1586
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,110
(I didn't get to enjoy
views like this.)

1587
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,530
What do you mean?

1588
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:40,530
We came here often with Yong Man.

1589
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,530
- You mean Yangsu-ri?
- We did?

1590
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:43,500
What do you do
when you three meet up?

1591
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,130
- We didn't enjoy the scenery.
- We didn't.

1592
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:48,170
We only looked around to see
if there were any women...

1593
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,300
interested in us.

1594
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,730
There's a famous spot
where there's a bonfire.

1595
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:52,730
Oh, it's Bonjour.

1596
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:53,730
Right. It was called Bonjour.

1597
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:55,670
So Min knows a lot about this area.

1598
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:56,900
I've come to this area often
for a date.

1599
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,800
- You know a lot about this place.
- It's nice out here.

1600
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,800
(They've arrived at the next spot
while chatting.)

1601
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,440
It's breezy here.

1602
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,610
- I can smell ginkgo nuts.
- I can smell ginkgo nuts.

1603
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:08,110
- Is it the smell of ginkgo nuts?
- Gosh, the smell of ginkgo nuts.

1604
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:10,020
We should take a photo
since we're here.

1605
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,230
- Don't stand against the sun.
- Let's take a photo.

1606
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,690
Stop taking photos already!

1607
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:17,900
Why do they keep taking photos?

1608
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,570
Hyung In. Can you
take a photo of me?

1609
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:20,570
Jae Suk took more than I did.

1610
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:21,840
- Stop it, Jae Suk.
- Stop taking photos.

1611
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,090
- You're standing in the shade.
- Stop it already.

1612
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:25,860
- I haven't taken one by myself.
- Look at Haha.

1613
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,670
And the "How Do You Play?" team
keeps taking photos together.

1614
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:32,440
- Don't get together.
- Take it elsewhere!

1615
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,340
Don't they take photos for you
on that show?

1616
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,520
It's not that.

1617
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,250
- I'm just doing my best.
- You're quite sensitive.

1618
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:39,820
Why would you two take photos here?

1619
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,050
- They're taking one too.
- You're so sensitive.

1620
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:42,920
- Can you take a photo of me alone?
- Gosh.

1621
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,380
All right. Before we have lunch,

1622
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,300
to make our
autumn outing more exciting,

1623
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,300
Are we playing games?

1624
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,900
we'll have Successful Story
of Bright Relay Race.

1625
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,690
- It's a relay race?
- A relay race?

1626
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:55,130
You'll form a team of two.

1627
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,530
Then you'll have a race
with obstacles.

1628
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,530
Here are the obstacles
you need to overcome.

1629
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:01,900
This is a forward roll zone.

1630
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,610
You'll need to roll forward
in this zone.

1631
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:04,780
- All right.
- I see.

1632
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,000
- Then you'll see hurdles.
- All right.

1633
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,820
It's an all-fours zone.

1634
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,690
You can only crawl on all fours
and pass through the hurdles.

1635
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:11,780
On all fours?

1636
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:14,150
Next is jumping ropes.

1637
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:17,190
You can just jump ropes
ten times and move on.

1638
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,360
Next is a mini ranger training zone.

1639
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,400
You can crawl past it on your back.

1640
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,090
(Mini ranger training zone, pass
through the obstacle on your back.)

1641
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:25,360
And the last zone
is an assassin zone.

1642
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,460
They'll slam you
with toy hammers ruthlessly.

1643
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:31,110
You'll have to pass through that.

1644
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:32,900
Unlike other relay races,

1645
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,840
we'll be using a baton
made of chalk.

1646
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,280
It'll break easily.

1647
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,670
- A 70cm-long piece of chalk.
- My gosh.

1648
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:39,250
Oh, it's that one? It breaks easily.

1649
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,250
Oh, gosh.

1650
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,110
- It'll break for sure.
- While trying not to...

1651
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:44,840
break the chalk, you'll race walk...

1652
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,880
and pass through the obstacles
to make it to the finish line.

1653
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,630
Do we have to hold the chalk
while doing the forward roll?

1654
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:51,730
- Yes, you do.
- Oh, my.

1655
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:52,860
- We have to hold it?
- We have to hold it?

1656
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,900
- It won't be easy.
- It'll be a team of two.

1657
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,920
You'll complete
four rounds in total.

1658
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,360
- A relay race?
- You got it, right?

1659
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,320
The chalk will end up this small.

1660
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,840
We'll deduct the lap time...

1661
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,570
by the length of the chalk
you managed to keep.

1662
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:05,570
- Is that so?
- Let's say you finished the race...

1663
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:06,960
in 3 minutes and 30 seconds.

1664
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:09,610
If your chalk is 30cm-long,
then your record will be 3 minutes.

1665
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:11,710
- You're deducting 30 seconds?
- Yes. You got it, right?

1666
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:14,050
Also, since
it's a bright relay race,

1667
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:16,920
when a trot song starts to play
during the race,

1668
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,840
- We have to dance.
- You must dance.

1669
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,860
During the time you dance,

1670
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,980
you can attack the others' chalks.

1671
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,130
(They can attack other teams'
chalks while dancing.)

1672
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,690
- That'll be dangerous.
- We got it.

1673
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:27,900
But you need to be dancing
while attacking others.

1674
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,190
We must be dancing.

1675
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,090
We'll end up cracking the chalks.

1676
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:33,730
We'll tell you your teams.

1677
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:35,900
We grouped you in advance
to make it balanced.

1678
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,860
- All right.
- Team One...

1679
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,440
is Team "How Do You Play?".

1680
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,110
- What? Stop it already.
- I'm so sick of it.

1681
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:43,340
(I'm so sick of it.)

1682
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,550
I'm so sick of it.

1683
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:46,150
You're not even
discreet about it anymore.

1684
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,420
- What's with him?
- You...

1685
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,250
- What made you so upset?
- Hey.

1686
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,920
- Team "How Do You Play?"?
- What's wrong...

1687
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,610
- This is...
- They're dressed alike too.

1688
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:53,980
- Hey.
- You're dressed alike.

1689
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,150
What did you say?
Team "How Do You Play?"?

1690
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:57,690
- What's that?
- You want me to call all of them?

1691
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,050
You went hiking on that show
dressed like that.

1692
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,530
- Come on.
- They did?

1693
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:04,090
- General Manager Yoo, calm down.
- My gosh, this is...

1694
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:05,320
Listen.

1695
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,730
How dare you criticize us?

1696
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:08,440
General Manager Yoo,
please calm down.

1697
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,630
He called him General Manager Yoo.

1698
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:11,300
"General Manager Yoo"? Hey.

1699
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,940
He called him General Manager Yoo.

1700
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:15,130
I'll see you next Saturday.

1701
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,500
(The JMT employees
hurriedly leave the place.)

1702
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:17,980
Next is...

1703
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:20,440
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo
whom everyone roots for.

1704
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,110
Come on. You didn't have to.

1705
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,110
- Our number one couple.
- Will I do okay with her?

1706
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:28,150
It's Team "Can We Get Married",
right?

1707
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,280
- What?
- Hold on.

1708
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,550
I'm sorry,
but don't put flesh on it.

1709
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:35,190
You put flesh on us too.

1710
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,730
We're also members of Running Man,

1711
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,000
but you kept shunning us.

1712
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:44,300
(Gosh, you.)

1713
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,730
He's so ugly.

1714
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,300
It looks like he's in a good mood,
so we can invite Eun Hye now.

1715
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,050
(He couldn't help
but blurt out her name.)

1716
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,020
- Stop it.
- All right.

1717
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,710
Next is the meeting
of a star and his fan.

1718
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:59,150
It's Hyuk and So Min.

1719
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:01,320
Wait a minute.

1720
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,460
Next are Suk Jin and Se Chan.

1721
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,690
- It's worth trying.
- It is.

1722
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:06,690
- All right.
- It's worth trying!

1723
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:08,460
It's worth a try.

1724
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,920
With Captain Um Hong Gil...

1725
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,590
- A strange man.
- It suits him.

1726
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,460
A strange man who likes clothes.

1727
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,300
- With Captain Um Hong Gil...
- Let's do this!

1728
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:17,840
and an ocean lifeguard...

1729
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,230
- We need to hold the chalk and...
- An ocean lifeguard?

1730
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,980
- Let's do this!
- We got this!

1731
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,300
The first runner from each team,
please stand here.

1732
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,210
- The rest will stand over there.
- Okay.

1733
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,610
Do you want to go first or second?

1734
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,340
I think it'll break right away
once we do the forward roll.

1735
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,520
Gosh, we're in trouble.

1736
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,020
The forward roll must be difficult.

1737
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,520
Suk Jin, be careful.

1738
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,550
Get ready.

1739
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,530
(Get ready. Start.)

1740
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,530
(Broken)

1741
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,130
(The chalk breaks in half
as soon as the race starts.)

1742
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,090
- Darn it.
- Suk Jin.

1743
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,070
- Gosh, watch out.
- Be careful.

1744
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:49,530
Haha, be careful.

1745
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,170
- Oh, no.
- You can leave it there.

1746
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:52,460
We need to speed up.

1747
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:54,670
Hurry up!

1748
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:56,440
My chalk!

1749
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,550
(Haha and Jae Suk
are currently in the first place.)

1750
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:58,900
My chalk!

1751
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,050
(Suk Jin and Se Chan
move up to second place.)

1752
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,550
- Hey.
- Who is that?

1753
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:04,610
(Broken)

1754
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,090
It's okay.

1755
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:08,090
You need to roll one more time.

1756
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,250
- So Min.
- Wait.

1757
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:11,780
- Can't you do a better job?
- Where are you going?

1758
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,030
Where are you going?

1759
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:14,750
- Why is she...
- You need to race walk!

1760
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:18,630
(Suddenly making a deep bow)

1761
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:19,900
- So Min.
- You should...

1762
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,130
It's all broken.

1763
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:24,440
(Walking fast with the chalk
that broke in half)

1764
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,400
What will you do now, Hyuk?

1765
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,530
I have no idea.

1766
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,400
You're done for.

1767
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,710
I think this is
So Min's biggest piece.

1768
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:32,380
It's all broken.

1769
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,440
We have to race walk, right?

1770
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,440
(Behind Haha
who's leading the race,)

1771
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,520
(Suk Jin and Ji Hyo...)

1772
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,020
(are catching up fast.)

1773
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,980
(The 3 of them have entered
the 3rd course.)

1774
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:49,090
How many?

1775
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,730
Break it!

1776
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:52,820
(Break it!)

1777
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,840
(They can break each other's
chalk while dancing.)

1778
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,530
(Dancing)

1779
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:03,210
(The mid-aged men are excited.)

1780
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:09,980
(While the onlookers are dancing,)

1781
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:12,210
(the players are busy
trying to break each other's chalk.)

1782
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,280
(Guarding his chalk)

1783
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,780
Attack So Min instead.

1784
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:20,190
(Dancing)

1785
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,690
(Right then, the marine boy
runs toward So Min.)

1786
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:26,460
(The music stopped.)

1787
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,800
All right.

1788
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,030
(Haha who finished jumping rope
10 times sets off first.)

1789
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,130
Darn it!

1790
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,130
- He's doing great.
- Race walk!

1791
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,030
(Haha relaxedly widened the gap...)

1792
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:37,400
(and arrived at the 4th course.)

1793
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,780
Do we have to roll forward
in that course too?

1794
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,210
No, you need to crawl.

1795
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,320
Darn it. Three. Come on, Suk Jin.

1796
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,980
Hey. Darn it.
What's wrong with this thing?

1797
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:48,150
Three, four, five.

1798
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:50,020
Suk Jin is horrible at it.

1799
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:51,920
(The marine boy falls behind.)

1800
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,630
- Gosh, I'm so tired.
- What was that?

1801
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:55,320
Gosh, this is exhausting!

1802
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:57,000
What's this?

1803
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
- It's so exhausting!
- How do we pass through?

1804
00:57:58,630 --> 00:57:59,730
Gosh, I'm so tired.

1805
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,530
How come she's so good at it?

1806
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,730
- Darn it.
- What is this?

1807
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,440
(His movement is a bit slow
for Hiking Master.)

1808
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,170
(While Hiking Master
is struggling...)

1809
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,570
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

1810
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,020
This is so tiring.

1811
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:17,920
(Grunting)

1812
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:20,090
My clothes...

1813
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,980
Suk Jin, hurry up!

1814
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:23,020
(The ocean lifeguard met a disaster
while wearing a life jacket.)

1815
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,090
My clothes...

1816
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,920
My clothes are killing me!

1817
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,920
My gosh. They have to
guard their chalks through that?

1818
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,530
- You have to protect it.
- Hurry up.

1819
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,800
(Attacking with toy hammers)

1820
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,210
(Groaning)

1821
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:42,300
(Getting a full body massage)

1822
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,480
They're hitting me for real.

1823
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,400
Hurry up.
They're hitting him so hard.

1824
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,440
- It's a relay race.
- Hurry up.

1825
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,050
- Hurry up, Suk Jin!
- Give it to me.

1826
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:51,280
- Is it there?
- It hurts for real.

1827
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:53,340
- Gosh, they hit me for real.
- Your chalk is really long.

1828
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,520
(Haha and Jae Suk
are currently in the first place.)

1829
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,780
(Ji Hyo enters the last course
as well.)

1830
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,690
(Focusing their hits on the chalk)

1831
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:01,820
Hey!

1832
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:03,420
- Where did it go?
- I'm sorry, Jong Kook.

1833
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:04,420
Hey!

1834
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,190
(I'm sorry, Jong Kook.)

1835
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:07,840
(A handful of chalk)

1836
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:10,360
(Their chalk was crushed
by the assassins.)

1837
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,670
We're in the first place.

1838
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:14,030
You need to guard that, at least.

1839
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,170
Suk Jin!

1840
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:18,780
Team "How Do You Play?"
is in the first place.

1841
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,480
My gosh.

1842
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,250
Darn these clothes!

1843
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:25,610
(So Min is at the last course.)

1844
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:27,320
Where do I go? What do I do?

1845
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,780
(The marine boy
pompously enters the last course.)

1846
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,250
(His chalk breaks into pieces.)

1847
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,360
- Hurry up.
- Wait.

1848
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,460
The yellow chalk.

1849
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:36,460
What is he doing?

1850
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
The yellow chalk.

1851
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,320
(He wastes his time
by looking for the broken chalk.)

1852
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,320
Where did it go?

1853
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:43,770
Here, Hyuk. Look at this.

1854
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:45,460
It's all broken.

1855
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,230
(He rolls forward fast.)

1856
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:48,980
He's good.

1857
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:51,500
He's like a ninja.

1858
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,710
(The slave hunter Dae Gil is back.)

1859
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:56,280
(Jae Suk, Jong Kook, Hyuk, Se Chan)

1860
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,420
(He enters the 3rd course
in no time.)

1861
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,750
Hyuk is so fast.

1862
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:05,980
(He begins to chase after the others
after jump-roping 10 times.)

1863
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,480
(The slave hunter catches up.)

1864
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,860
- Hurry up.
- That's good. Jae Suk, let's go.

1865
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:11,190
(So Min and Hyuk were in 2nd place.)

1866
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,500
Se Chan,

1867
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:15,270
(Dae Gil now chases after Jae Suk,
not Un Nyun.)

1868
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:16,590
Hyuk is fast.

1869
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,130
Hurry up.

1870
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:21,170
(He passes through
the obstacle right away.)

1871
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:24,570
(Jae Suk becomes nervous
upon seeing Dae Gil so close.)

1872
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:25,670
Hurry up.

1873
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:27,480
It hurts.

1874
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,650
Don't hit me there.

1875
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:29,920
Don't hit me there.

1876
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:34,360
(He passes quickly
as he defends himself.)

1877
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,550
They hit so hard.

1878
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:37,980
- Hey.
- We need to dance.

1879
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:40,550
Hurry up. You didn't arrive yet.

1880
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:42,690
(Attacking)

1881
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:46,130
(The weakest member
becomes the target.)

1882
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:47,690
Dance.

1883
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:48,940
(She averts the crisis
with her dance skills.)

1884
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,030
Shake your body.

1885
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,340
(It looks like Jong Kook is
on a treadmill.)

1886
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,380
Mine is short already.

1887
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,840
(They dance peacefully.)

1888
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,610
(Meanwhile)

1889
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,050
(Bok Ja takes the stage.)

1890
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:04,210
Hurry up.

1891
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:07,780
All right.

1892
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,460
(Bok Ja plays with the rhythm.)

1893
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:10,860
(Glancing over)

1894
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,030
(The music stops.)

1895
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:16,400
It stopped.

1896
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,630
Hurry up.

1897
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:18,770
(The relay race resumes.)

1898
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,570
Hey.

1899
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:24,500
(She hits her tailbone.)

1900
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,170
- What's wrong?
- You need to keep going.

1901
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:27,340
Where does it hurt?

1902
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,530
- Are you okay?
- I hit my tailbone.

1903
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:30,670
- You need to be careful.
- It hurts so much.

1904
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:31,780
You need to be careful.

1905
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:32,840
(She suddenly gets kicked.)

1906
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:35,250
It hurts so much.

1907
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,320
Chief Ji...

1908
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,980
Chief Ji rolled on his side.

1909
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:40,250
Are you letting Chief Ji
roll on his side?

1910
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:44,250
(Chief Ji does everything
with ease.)

1911
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:46,360
We make four laps, right?

1912
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,900
(Haha, Suk Jin, Ji Hyo, and So Min)

1913
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,920
Chief Ji rolled on his side.

1914
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:53,360
Suk Jin,
you need to come back fast.

1915
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,340
The length doesn't matter.

1916
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,730
(Stopping)

1917
01:01:56,730 --> 01:01:58,300
Suk Jin, hurry up.

1918
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,070
Eight.

1919
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,800
(Chief Ji's traditional costume,
the skirt is the problem.)

1920
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:06,800
The outfit...

1921
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,520
The outfit is too uncomfortable.

1922
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,920
(The life vest and skirt make
the worst combination.)

1923
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,050
(Panting)

1924
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,050
What's wrong with my outfit?

1925
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,690
(The life vest drags Suk Jin down.)

1926
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:19,980
Suk Jin's outfit isn't helping.

1927
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,400
(The life vest drags Suk Jin down.)

1928
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,860
What is this?

1929
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:24,960
(Bok Ja catches up with him.)

1930
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,030
(She catches his ankle.)

1931
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:28,090
Hey.

1932
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,530
Hey.

1933
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:31,500
(She grabs him tightly
as if he ran with her money.)

1934
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:34,170
(The match between the weaklings
takes place during the relay race.)

1935
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:38,570
(Haha leads despite getting hit
with toy hammers.)

1936
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:39,880
Hurry up.

1937
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,480
They hit my nose.

1938
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,520
(Only the last lap remains!)

1939
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,980
Team "How Do You Play?"
is doing too well.

1940
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,520
- Jong Kook, go.
- Okay.

1941
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,710
You need to go.

1942
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:50,880
(Jong Kook starts the last lap.)

1943
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:52,550
(Suk Jin, So Min, Jae Suk,
and Jong Kook)

1944
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:57,000
- Hey.
- No.

1945
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,360
- We are the last ones.
- No.

1946
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,960
(Music plays at that moment.)

1947
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:06,130
(So Min succeeded
to steal his shoe.)

1948
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:09,400
(Swaying)

1949
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,650
Give me my shoe.

1950
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:14,780
Suk Jin, what are you doing?

1951
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,380
(When the music comes on,)

1952
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:20,110
(Jae Suk quickly runs away.)

1953
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:28,190
(Director Yoo shakes his body
despite the danger.)

1954
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,820
(The music stops.)

1955
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,190
Suk Jin's chalk is too short.

1956
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:35,530
(The teams in the bottom ranks
still have one more lap to go.)

1957
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:36,690
Don't hit me too hard.

1958
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:41,480
(They are very behind
due to a dogfight.)

1959
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:44,000
- Here.
- Hyuk.

1960
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:49,880
(My goodness.)

1961
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,650
(Jae Suk, Jong Kook, Hyuk)

1962
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,020
(The slave hunter
chases after the others.)

1963
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:59,860
(He enters the 3rd course
in no time.)

1964
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:05,090
(The 1st and 2nd places are
still in the 4th course.)

1965
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:06,670
Ten.

1966
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:10,070
(He passes through
the 3rd course...)

1967
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:12,300
(and enters the 4th course.)

1968
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:16,800
(Dae Gil's instincts
come back to him.)

1969
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:20,070
(Only the last course remains!)

1970
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:22,320
(Jae Suk enters the last course.)

1971
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,440
Okay.

1972
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,190
Okay.

1973
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,860
(Jong Kook enters
the last course as well.)

1974
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,420
I am exhausted.

1975
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:33,360
(Dae Gil is right behind them.)

1976
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,690
- Where is Se Chan?
- Are we last?

1977
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,570
(Jae Suk and Jong Kook
run like crazy.)

1978
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:42,570
(The slave hunter
chases after them like crazy.)

1979
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:45,460
(Will Dae Gil succeed in
coming from behind?)

1980
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:59,120
(Which team will come in 1st?)

1981
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,750
- Where is Se Chan?
- Are we last?

1982
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:03,120
Jae Suk came in first.

1983
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:05,750
- We will come in last.
- Good job.

1984
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:07,330
- Jong Kook, good job.
- Okay.

1985
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,750
I am exhausted.

1986
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:09,930
(The slave hunter did his best,
but he came in 3rd.)

1987
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:11,230
Hyuk, turn in the chalk.

1988
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,730
Suk Jin.

1989
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:14,730
(Suk Jin and Se Chan came in last.)

1990
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:16,140
Se Chan, turn in the chalk.

1991
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:17,460
It's too short.

1992
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:19,430
Our chalk is long, right?

1993
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:22,680
- The yellow one is the shortest.
- Whose is the blue chalk?

1994
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,310
I didn't know
Jong Kook's chalk was so long.

1995
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:26,120
- I should have broken it.
- The blue one is really long.

1996
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,710
I had it in my sleeve.

1997
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,620
- Really?
- So you couldn't see it.

1998
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:31,950
- I held a short one on purpose...
- You held a fake one.

1999
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:33,350
to hide the long one.

2000
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:36,230
- He takes things too far.
- Jong Kook is ridiculous.

2001
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:38,390
- For goodness' sake.
- He uses all sorts of tricks.

2002
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:40,100
He is such an eyesore.

2003
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,370
The results are out.

2004
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:44,620
Who is the winner?

2005
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,870
Please.

2006
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:47,460
Seriously.

2007
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,640
One second determined...

2008
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:51,000
the results of the game.

2009
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,710
I will give you the final results
in the order of arrival.

2010
01:05:55,168 --> 01:05:55,792
You arrived in
8 minutes and 28 seconds.

2011
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,810
(Total time:
8 minutes and 28 seconds)

2012
01:05:57,810 --> 01:06:00,020
Your chalk was 16cm long.

2013
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:01,250
Okay.

2014
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,680
So the final record is
8 minutes and 12 seconds.

2015
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,980
(Final record:
8 minutes and 12 seconds)

2016
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:07,810
You arrived in
8 minutes and 35 seconds.

2017
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:10,330
But your chalk was 24cm long.

2018
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,230
With 8 minutes and 11 seconds,
you placed 1st.

2019
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,100
With 8 minutes and 12 seconds,
you placed 2nd.

2020
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,520
(They should have protected
the chalk.)

2021
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:19,640
Mother. We won.

2022
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,930
Good job, my son.

2023
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,910
With 8 minutes and 52 seconds,
Hyuk and So Min placed 3rd.

2024
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,930
We placed third.

2025
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:29,180
Then Suk Jin and Se Chan...

2026
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:31,850
He couldn't roll forward
because of his outfit.

2027
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:33,810
- I couldn't do anything.
- It dragged him down.

2028
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:35,640
I felt like someone was pulling me.

2029
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,210
Thus,

2030
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:39,160
the 1st place
will receive 40 dollars.

2031
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,620
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo
receive 40 dollars.)

2032
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:43,580
The 2nd place
will receive 20 dollars.

2033
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:44,980
(Jae Suk and Haha
receive 20 dollars.)

2034
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:47,620
The 3rd place
will receive 10 dollars.

2035
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:48,830
Thank you.

2036
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:52,460
The fourth place
will receive nothing.

2037
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,730
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

2038
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:57,270
We will be fine
as long as we don't place last.

2039
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:59,140
- You placed last.
- We placed last.

2040
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:00,680
We aren't done yet.

2041
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:02,000
We aren't done yet.

2042
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,500
Currently, Suk Jin is
at the bottom.

2043
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,580
Can we take this off?

2044
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:07,040
- Am I at the bottom?
- It's his flesh.

2045
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,710
You got your exercise.

2046
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:10,980
- Let's go and eat some eels.
- Okay.

2047
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,960
- Eels.
- Give me the money.

2048
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,020
- Seriously.
- Eels.

2049
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:16,660
This side is...

2050
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:17,890
My goodness.

2051
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,290
It's hot.

2052
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,120
- I am like a middle-aged man.
- You really are.

2053
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:23,600
If he hadn't become a celebrity...

2054
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:25,370
We should drink some makgeolli.

2055
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,200
He looks like a youth leader.

2056
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,000
- Please bring us all the dishes.
- Look at the colors.

2057
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,270
I am like a middle-aged man.

2058
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:33,330
Please give us the menu.

2059
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:35,810
Grilled eels,
stir-fried pork and wraps...

2060
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:37,040
- Eels.
- Eels.

2061
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,180
There is pork belly too.

2062
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,480
- Eels.
- Eels.

2063
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,910
Stir-fried pork is nice too.

2064
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:42,850
All right. Let's take a look.

2065
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:45,020
- Let's take a look.
- How much is the eel?

2066
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,160
Mister.

2067
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,290
- Mister.
- Mister, who are you?

2068
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:49,660
Your reflection in the mirror
startled you, right?

2069
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:52,020
Your reflection in the mirror
startled you, right?

2070
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:53,430
Do you run a restaurant
by the stream?

2071
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:56,620
What are you talking about?
I could go to Hongdae this way.

2072
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:59,500
People will throw rocks at you.

2073
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,930
Why would people throw rocks at me?
What are you talking about?

2074
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,100
Hongdae, my foot.

2075
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:06,430
Hold on. Do you want to eat eel?

2076
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,270
- Eels.
- I should eat eels...

2077
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:09,870
- since I can't eat them at home.
- Do you have money?

2078
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:11,140
I have money.

2079
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:13,210
We will split the cost anyway.

2080
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:15,040
I will get
stir-fried pork and wraps.

2081
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,750
Stir-fried pork and wraps.

2082
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:17,850
How about you, Hyuk?

2083
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:19,890
- I will get stir-fried pork too.
- Stir-fried pork?

2084
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:21,680
Won't you get grilled eels?

2085
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:23,250
Won't you?

2086
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,730
I like stir-fried pork.

2087
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,290
(I like stir-fried pork.)

2088
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:30,200
Eels.

2089
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:31,960
Won't you get grilled eels?

2090
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,370
Why don't we order
acorn jello as a side?

2091
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:35,540
"Acorn jello"?

2092
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:37,330
- "Acorn jello"?
- Youth leader.

2093
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:39,160
- "Acorn jello"?
- You mean "Acorn jelly"?

2094
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,230
Acorn jello.

2095
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:42,330
Se Chan, for goodness' sake.

2096
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:44,600
- Everyone.
- You keep looking in the mirror.

2097
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:47,050
Why do you keep looking
in the mirror while you talk?

2098
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:48,310
You look like a mess right now.

2099
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:49,310
Why do you keep
checking yourself out?

2100
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:52,420
- A mess? I can't believe you.
- Right.

2101
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,810
Why do you keep looking
in the mirror?

2102
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:55,480
- You have no sense of style.
- Why do you do that?

2103
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,720
You keep looking in the mirror.

2104
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,550
Jae Suk, you can't win
against Ji Hyo today.

2105
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:02,390
Ji Hyo is the epitome of style.

2106
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:04,300
(The fashionista, Ji Hyo)

2107
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,700
Ji Hyo's style is so luxurious.

2108
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:07,700
(It's the style
they have seen dozens of times.)

2109
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,710
- Her style is so luxurious.
- Seriously.

2110
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:11,510
She looks so classy.

2111
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:12,880
- She looks so classy.
- Classy.

2112
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,340
I am a classy woman.

2113
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:16,380
Let's just eat grilled eel.

2114
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:19,550
Then let's order 4 grilled eels
and 4 stir-fried pork.

2115
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:21,220
- Four.
- Acorn jelly.

2116
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:22,810
Two acorn jelly.

2117
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:23,920
Two acorn jelly. That's good.

2118
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,980
- Let's add two doenjang stew.
- Two doenjang stew.

2119
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,460
- Captain Um.
- Yes?

2120
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,180
Why don't we drink somaek?

2121
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:30,590
- How about makgeolli?
- Shall we make the cocktail?

2122
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:32,050
- What?
- Shall we make the cocktail?

2123
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:33,090
- Okay.
- Let's drink.

2124
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,920
- Coca-Cola.
- Camera crew, get out.

2125
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,720
Everyone should leave
except for Chan Hee.

2126
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,040
- Let's make the cocktail.
- Get out.

2127
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,060
- Let's mix beer and Sprite.
- Beer and Sprite.

2128
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:44,100
You can't even drink well.

2129
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,300
Beer and Sprite.

2130
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,710
Two people.

2131
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:48,100
Let's mix the drinks.

2132
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,710
- It's nice.
- Let's mix the drinks.

2133
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:51,450
- It will be tasty.
- Who is good at mixing?

2134
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:54,770
I run a small cheonggukjang place.

2135
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:56,420
Mix the drinks.

2136
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,760
She has about 1,000 identities.

2137
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,090
Do you keep notes?

2138
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:05,050
- Let's mix Sprite and Coca-Cola.
- Okay.

2139
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:07,890
You aren't good at mixing drinks.

2140
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:09,720
Who mixes drinks like that?

2141
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,870
Take a glass.

2142
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:14,230
- All right.
- I want a cocktail from Lady Jeon.

2143
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,910
- I saw you on YouTube.
- Really?

2144
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:18,230
You are Aunt Cocktail, right?

2145
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:19,340
(Aunt Bok Ja is a cocktail expert.)

2146
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,880
- Here.
- My goodness.

2147
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,080
Lady Song should drink first.

2148
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,120
- Thank you.
- Shake it up a bit more.

2149
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,380
(What?)

2150
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:29,950
Lady Song is fixing her makeup.

2151
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:31,090
My goodness.

2152
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:32,880
She is fixing her makeup
before lunch.

2153
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,260
(She is incredibly sophisticated.)

2154
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:35,310
She is good.

2155
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:36,550
Take the glass.

2156
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:37,550
She is good.

2157
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:39,390
- Let's enjoy the drink.
- Give me one.

2158
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,020
Let's drink.

2159
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:43,970
Now, the oldest member...

2160
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:45,560
should say something.

2161
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,090
- Make a toast.
- Make a toast.

2162
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:50,040
We don't have
many years left to live.

2163
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,260
What are you talking about?

2164
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,840
- Come on.
- You ruined it.

2165
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,730
- The drink won't taste good now.
- Life is short.

2166
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:57,970
- Our youth starts now.
- Our youth starts now.

2167
01:10:57,970 --> 01:10:59,720
I have one!

2168
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:02,080
- What is it?
- Even if it's disgusting,

2169
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:04,480
(Even if it's disgusting)

2170
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,510
let's live happily
as we did yesterday.

2171
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:07,680
Cheers!

2172
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,020
- He just spewed out words.
- What was that?

2173
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,550
What kind of toast was that?

2174
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:13,520
- Suk Jin.
- Which answer do you want?

2175
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,830
- What kind of ad-lib was that?
- Tell me.

2176
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:16,020
Which answer do you want?

2177
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,700
Your ad-lib was horrible.

2178
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,890
Tell me.

2179
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:20,000
- Let's live a beautiful life.
- A beautiful life.

2180
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,200
Let's live a beautiful life.

2181
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,630
Even if it's disgusting...

2182
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:23,760
(They give up on the toast
and enjoy the drink.)

2183
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:24,930
What is this?

2184
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:27,040
- It tastes like a cocktail.
- My goodness.

2185
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,770
(The taste is pretty satisfying.)

2186
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:30,770
- It's tasty.
- It tastes like a cocktail, right?

2187
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:32,300
(Lady Song is satisfied.)

2188
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:33,580
The Coca-Sprite is...

2189
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,010
- It's nice.
- Seriously.

2190
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:36,140
It tastes like a cocktail, right?

2191
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:37,640
- It does.
- It tastes like a cocktail.

2192
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,250
It tastes like a cocktail.

2193
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:41,850
It's refreshing.

2194
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:44,420
Ji Hyo is driving me crazy today.

2195
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:46,500
She seems real.

2196
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,220
Middle-aged women
always lift up their pinky fingers.

2197
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:50,720
Lady Song.

2198
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:55,340
(When a member calls her)

2199
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:58,600
(Yes?)

2200
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,800
(She is driving me crazy.)

2201
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,880
You are single, right?

2202
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:05,100
Yes, I am.

2203
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,880
- You aren't married.
- No.

2204
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,120
I see.

2205
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,140
What do you do?

2206
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:12,720
I look at properties.

2207
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:15,460
- I see.
- She is rich.

2208
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:16,850
She looks at properties.

2209
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,480
I am into different things.

2210
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,800
Do you have a boyfriend?

2211
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,660
Why? Are you interested in me?

2212
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:25,560
- He is interested in her.
- Aren't you married?

2213
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,130
- Mister.
- I mean...

2214
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:28,630
Don't be like that.

2215
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:30,430
- It has been a while...
- Ji Hyo's character seems real.

2216
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,630
since I became single.

2217
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:34,670
What?

2218
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:37,600
(He suddenly moves on with a skit.)

2219
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,750
- What?
- Single?

2220
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:39,880
What is wrong with you?

2221
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,640
Your wife is alive and well
in Jamwon-dong.

2222
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,880
What are you saying?

2223
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:44,980
It's a skit.

2224
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:46,460
Why did you kill off your wife?

2225
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:47,550
It's a skit.

2226
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:49,420
Your wife is alive and well.
Why did you kill her off?

2227
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:50,850
- She lives in Jamwon-dong.
- That's reality.

2228
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:53,200
- I will make a toast.
- A toast.

2229
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,000
- Ryu Su Jung.
- Ryu Su Jung.

2230
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,420
Ryu Su Jung.

2231
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:59,170
(Running Alpine Club
finally got a meaningful toast.)

2232
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:00,470
My goodness.

2233
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:02,700
- You liked that.
- The dishes are here.

2234
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,370
- President Yang.
- The dishes are here.

2235
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:05,730
All right. Stir-fried pork.

2236
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:08,510
Acorn jelly.

2237
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:09,580
This is grilled eel.

2238
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:10,970
Grilled eel.

2239
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:11,970
Stir-fried pork.

2240
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:14,050
- It looks delicious.
- Thank you for the food.

2241
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:16,680
- Acorn jelly.
- It's nice.

2242
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,340
Thank you for the food.

2243
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,590
(The members have a nice meal.)

2244
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:23,460
- Employee Ha.
- General Manager Yoo.

2245
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:25,130
Come on.

2246
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:28,720
You are seeing us on Sunday
as well as Saturday.

2247
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,800
This is a continuous story.

2248
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,040
- It's nice to have things overlap.
- It's nice, right?

2249
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:35,800
It won't be bad
to keep the same setting.

2250
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,230
- Part One, "How Do You Play?".
- You know...

2251
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:38,540
Part Two, Running Man.

2252
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,800
I am trying it
since no one else has done it.

2253
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,140
Your total is 206 dollars.

2254
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:44,450
Why is the total so high?

2255
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:47,380
- Did we order that much?
- There are only a few dishes.

2256
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:48,450
(They fill their stomachs...)

2257
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:49,720
(with a hearty meal.)

2258
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,920
Are the dishes that expensive?

2259
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:52,960
- We ate a lot.
- That was insane.

2260
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,160
This will decide on the results.

2261
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,220
- We will move to the last location.
- Okay.

2262
01:13:57,330 --> 01:13:59,920
Like I told you earlier,
the penalty will be very tedious.

2263
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,700
The meal cost 206 dollars.

2264
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:03,760
- That's a lot.
- We ate a lot.

2265
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,390
Let's play Choose a Flag
to decide who pays.

2266
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:08,730
The rules will be the same.

2267
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,670
- Hyuk will choose red.
- Hyuk, please go.

2268
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:14,130
I don't know what he will choose.

2269
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:18,950
(Red, yellow, green)

2270
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:20,770
Which color should I choose?

2271
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,090
(Red, yellow, green)

2272
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:25,640
I can't choose.

2273
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:27,350
Okay.

2274
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:30,050
(Red, yellow, green)

2275
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:31,330
Yellow.

2276
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:33,520
I don't know what to choose.

2277
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:39,890
(Red, yellow, green)

2278
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:41,700
(Director Yoo goes last.)

2279
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:42,930
They chose yellow.

2280
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:44,930
Yellow.

2281
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:48,430
I didn't know what to choose.

2282
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:50,300
Did only one person choose green?

2283
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,910
Is green the minority?

2284
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:53,250
- Who chose green?
- Haha.

2285
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:55,510
All right. Who chose green?

2286
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:56,750
Me!

2287
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:59,510
Everyone except for Haha
will pay 1-7th...

2288
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:00,850
of the total.

2289
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:01,850
How much is that?

2290
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:03,760
Pay 30 dollars each.

2291
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:06,160
Okay. I have no money now.

2292
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,660
- Here.
- Thirty dollars.

2293
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:09,800
- Okay.
- Okay.

2294
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,220
Okay.

2295
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:14,060
The last course
for Running Alpine Club...

2296
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:17,540
is the shooting location of BTS,
the world stars.

2297
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:18,630
- I see.
- Really?

2298
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:19,800
I really wanted to visit the place.

2299
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,270
Check out the forest trail and
the world stars' shooting location.

2300
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:23,340
BTS.

2301
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:26,510
You can enjoy it for ten minutes.

2302
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,950
This place is pretty.
I didn't know about this place.

2303
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:31,550
Now that I am old,

2304
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:33,090
I enjoy visiting such places
with my wife.

2305
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:34,590
It's nice.

2306
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:37,460
You know, this place is pretty.

2307
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:39,630
Where do you sell the merchandise?

2308
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:41,500
- I will shop for some items.
- Me too.

2309
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,720
Hyuk, this is a good photo of you.

2310
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,800
- This is a good photo of you.
- Seriously.

2311
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,000
It's a nice photo.

2312
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,040
Does anyone want
to buy my cushion? Isn't it cute?

2313
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,540
- I won't buy it.
- The mouth looks disgusting.

2314
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:53,600
I will buy this one.

2315
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,770
I'll take this one.

2316
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:56,910
How pretty!
What do you think of this woman?

2317
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,380
It's a nice photo.

2318
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:00,010
- I will buy it.
- I will buy my merchandise.

2319
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:01,220
I will buy it.

2320
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:03,250
It's my favorite snack,
a fish-shaped bun.

2321
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:05,420
- Fish-shaped buns and steamed buns.
- Fish-shaped buns are nice.

2322
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:07,120
- Steamed bun.
- Steamed bun.

2323
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,290
I will eat a steamed bun.

2324
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:09,590
It's so tasty.

2325
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:10,630
It's really tasty and hot.

2326
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:12,760
- I bought six fish-shaped buns.
- It's so tasty.

2327
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,850
(They fill their stomachs
with various snacks.)

2328
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:15,050
Are you eating again?

2329
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:16,590
BTS.

2330
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:18,720
I bought six fish-shaped buns.

2331
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,060
Didn't you buy too many?

2332
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:21,800
This is really nice.

2333
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:25,730
We will round up the total
before we end the race.

2334
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:28,230
- Okay.
- We bought so many items.

2335
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:29,750
- The total will be high.
- We bought so many items.

2336
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:32,250
I bought 40 fish-shaped buns.

2337
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:36,590
The total is 335.40 dollars.

2338
01:16:36,590 --> 01:16:38,510
- This is insane.
- What exactly did we buy?

2339
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:39,980
People will go bankrupt.

2340
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:41,620
- This is insane.
- I should be the minority.

2341
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:43,260
(They will choose a flag
to decide who pays.)

2342
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:45,420
You will receive the flags.

2343
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:46,890
Do we raise one?

2344
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,920
I will choose a random flag.

2345
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Me too.

2346
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,630
- I will put the flags behind me.
- I will choose without looking.

2347
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:53,970
- We shouldn't think.
- Should I use the same method?

2348
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:55,060
That's right.

2349
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:56,060
- Leave it up to luck.
- I should do that.

2350
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:57,430
- I should do that.
- Raise a random flag.

2351
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:59,410
I will raise a red one.
Let me tell you that in advance.

2352
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:00,630
- I don't know.
- I will raise a red one.

2353
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:01,730
- No.
- I will raise a red one.

2354
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:03,080
- I will raise a random one.
- Me too.

2355
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,170
- I will raise it.
- I don't know what it will be.

2356
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:05,210
- One.
- Raise a random one.

2357
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:06,840
- Two.
- Raise a random one.

2358
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:08,170
- Three.
- Okay.

2359
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:09,840
(The flags are raised.)

2360
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,880
- This one.
- Why are there so many?

2361
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:15,550
(Se Chan is the only one
who chose a green flag.)

2362
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:17,520
- Why are there so many?
- It's me! I chose a green one!

2363
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,050
(It's me! I chose a green one!)

2364
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:20,700
- What?
- Three.

2365
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,960
- Red.
- Why are there so many yellow ones?

2366
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:27,500
Seven members except for Se Chan
will split up the total.

2367
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:30,370
I can't believe I picked a red one.

2368
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:32,040
I picked a red one too.

2369
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,600
- Green.
- How did I raise a green one?

2370
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,800
I should have picked a green one.

2371
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:38,880
You paid 48 dollars each.

2372
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,670
- Did you say 48 dollars each?
- That's a lot.

2373
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:41,810
You paid 48 dollars each.

2374
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:44,050
I don't have that much left.

2375
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:48,180
The rankings of the day
will be announced now.

2376
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:50,480
Before that,
I will reveal the penalty.

2377
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,550
Please.

2378
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:55,350
I told you many times
that the penalty would be tedious.

2379
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:56,970
- That's right.
- This is bad.

2380
01:17:56,970 --> 01:17:58,720
You might hate us for this.

2381
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,060
"Tomb of the River"
was filmed in Gangneung.

2382
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:03,540
(Hyuk's movie, "Tomb of the River"
was filmed in Gangneung.)

2383
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,470
Take a photo of a road sign
that reads "Gangneung".

2384
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:07,630
- That's the worst.
- For goodness' sake.

2385
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:09,950
(Take a photo of a road sign
that reads "Gangneung".)

2386
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:11,010
- That's the worst.
- For goodness' sake.

2387
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:14,250
(They must find a road sign
that reads "Gangneung"!)

2388
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:15,510
- That will be so annoying.
- Hey!

2389
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:16,680
That's the worst.

2390
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,720
You will see it if you drive
toward Gangwon Province.

2391
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:22,960
(There are dozens of ways
to reach Gangneung.)

2392
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,260
(They must decide on a route
themselves.)

2393
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:28,160
(They might end up at Gangneung
if things go south.)

2394
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,220
- That will be so annoying.
- Hey!

2395
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:30,720
It won't be on our way to Seoul.

2396
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:33,760
Take a photo of any road signs
that read "Gangneung".

2397
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,540
- That's the worst.
- Must we get out of the car?

2398
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:36,630
Of course.

2399
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:39,210
We don't know
how long it would take.

2400
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:40,800
I really don't want to get
this penalty.

2401
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,930
Seriously.

2402
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:43,600
Wouldn't we find one
on our way to Seoul?

2403
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,640
- Right?
- If we don't find it...

2404
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,450
Wouldn't we find one
on our way to Seoul?

2405
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:49,270
If we don't find it,
we will be in trouble.

2406
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:50,510
Oh, my goodness.

2407
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:51,620
You are in a good mood, right?

2408
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:52,680
My goodness.

2409
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:55,660
- This is for Hyuk.
- That's right.

2410
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:57,160
- This is for Hyuk.
- You know,

2411
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,380
we might find one
at an intersection.

2412
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:00,720
You just need to find a road sign.

2413
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,020
The money we have left.

2414
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:04,220
Please. I want to win.

2415
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,090
I just spent 45 dollars.

2416
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:08,840
Number 1 and 2 are excluded.
Number 3 gets 1 ball.

2417
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,600
- Number 4 gets 2 balls.
- I see.

2418
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,040
- So number 8 gets 6 balls.
- The number of balls matters.

2419
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,130
Six balls?

2420
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:15,040
- Six balls...
- You'll definitely get a penalty.

2421
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,950
- Jae Suk is right.
- Even if you have many balls,

2422
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:18,710
you might not get the penalty.

2423
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:20,050
- All right.
- We don't know it yet.

2424
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:21,270
- Number one...
- It's So Min.

2425
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:22,340
will win a prize
and get exempted from the penalty.

2426
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,550
- That sounds cool.
- I want a prize.

2427
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:24,790
It's So Min.

2428
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:26,480
That's amazing.

2429
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,220
- So Min is good these days.
- She's amazing.

2430
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:29,290
So Min is on fire.

2431
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:30,660
All right. Number two.

2432
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,790
Se Chan.

2433
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,020
- Haha.
- What?

2434
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:34,460
- Me?
- What?

2435
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,630
Why? When did you save the money?

2436
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:37,630
What's going on?

2437
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:40,090
All right. Number three
is Jong Kook.

2438
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:41,870
Number four is Se Chan.

2439
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:44,130
- Why are you number 4?
- Number 5 is Ji Hyo.

2440
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:47,270
Number 6 is Jae Suk, number 7 is
Suk Jin, and number 8 is Hyuk.

2441
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:49,950
- Jang Hyuk?
- Hyuk, what did you do?

2442
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:51,380
You're number eight.

2443
01:19:51,450 --> 01:19:52,840
- Hyuk.
- He was the eighth the whole time.

2444
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:53,970
I bet you'll get a penalty.

2445
01:19:53,970 --> 01:19:55,970
- You and I are not going.
- Right.

2446
01:19:56,450 --> 01:19:59,720
The prize is
Gangneung's local specialties.

2447
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,120
This looks nice.

2448
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,380
- I'm so nervous.
- You'll pick two members, right?

2449
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,130
Yes. I'll pick one first.

2450
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:06,920
- We don't know it yet.
- It can't be me.

2451
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,020
- Two friends should go together.
- Please. I hope it's not me.

2452
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:10,920
I have only two balls.
It can't be me.

2453
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,220
Number 1 and 2 are exempted.

2454
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:13,630
The two friends should go together.

2455
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:15,800
- Please.
- No. That can't happen.

2456
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:17,840
- Jong Kook and Hyuk.
- It should never happen.

2457
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,470
(Will the two best friends
get picked together?)

2458
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:22,130
(Everyone wants to avoid
today's penalty.)

2459
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:23,130
Here we go.

2460
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:24,670
- Why are you looking at me?
- He's looking and Hyuk.

2461
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:26,470
- All right.
- It's me.

2462
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:28,050
The first member
to get the penalty is...

2463
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:31,290
(They must find a sign that says
Gangneung and take a picture.)

2464
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,600
- All right.
- It's me.

2465
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,160
The first member
to get the penalty is...

2466
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:44,070
(The member who might
end up going to Gangneung is...)

2467
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:46,140
- It's either you or me.
- The camera is looking at me.

2468
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:47,140
Congratulations.

2469
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:49,810
- It's Suk Jin.
- Oh no.

2470
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:51,480
- How many balls did you have?
- It's Suk Jin.

2471
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,780
(Chief Ji is getting the penalty.)

2472
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,150
How many balls did Suk Jin have?

2473
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:57,680
It's possible that I might
get away with this.

2474
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:58,870
- How many balls?
- I'm safe anyway.

2475
01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:01,540
I might still get picked,
but I'm safe for now.

2476
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:03,280
- It was either you or me.
- How many balls did you have?

2477
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,820
- I had 4.
- You had 4 balls?

2478
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:06,760
This is so thrilling.

2479
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:09,190
- All right.
- Please. Not me.

2480
01:21:09,190 --> 01:21:11,990
- We have one person left.
- Please. Don't pick me.

2481
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,790
Only one person.
Ma'am, please help me.

2482
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:16,270
Ma'am, please help me.

2483
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:17,790
"I'm Jang Hyuk."

2484
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,860
I shouldn't be with him.

2485
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:21,140
Ma'am, please help me.

2486
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:23,510
(Please...)

2487
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:25,510
All right. I picked a ball.

2488
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:26,680
(He picked a ball.)

2489
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,440
It's me.

2490
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,720
- I'll get the penalty.
- I'll announce the name.

2491
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,280
- Not me.
- It must be me.

2492
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:34,280
The one who will go to find
the road sign with Suk Jin.

2493
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:36,150
The member
of the Gangneung expedition is...

2494
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:38,720
- Congratulations.
- Hyuk?

2495
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:39,950
- Yang Se Chan.
- What?

2496
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,690
I can't believe this.

2497
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:42,950
(Yang Se Chan is
getting the penalty.)

2498
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:44,650
(What?)

2499
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:45,940
- Seriously?
- This is unbelievable.

2500
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:51,470
(Se Chan got picked
even though he had only 2 balls.)

2501
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:52,940
- He had only two balls.
- My goodness.

2502
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:54,530
I had only two balls.

2503
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:55,970
He had only two balls.

2504
01:21:55,970 --> 01:21:56,980
(I had only 2 balls.)

2505
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:58,680
- We made it.
- Hyuk.

2506
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,070
This is unbelievable.

2507
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:01,850
- He has only two balls.
- How is this possible?

2508
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,180
- He's the most unfortunate one.
- I didn't even imagine it...

2509
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:05,480
- because I had two balls.
- Listen.

2510
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,280
Let me just get soaking wet
with water and go home.

2511
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,610
I'll just get slapped by Jong Kook.

2512
01:22:09,610 --> 01:22:12,320
He'd go to Gangneung
looking like this today.

2513
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,980
Should you take the national highway
to find a sign?

2514
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:17,030
I'm sorry, but this isn't an outfit
for taking a photo.

2515
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:20,270
Alpinist Um Hong Gil...

2516
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:21,690
- and...
- Chief Ji.

2517
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,690
Chief Ji Suk Jin.

2518
01:22:23,690 --> 01:22:26,400
- Please take good photos.
- This is the worst.

2519
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,570
I don't know.

2520
01:22:27,570 --> 01:22:29,440
- Thank you for today.
- Thank you.

2521
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,070
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2522
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:33,040
- Thank you.
- I couldn't even imagine this.

2523
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,650
- It's unbelievable.
- I thought I'd be picked.

2524
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:38,070
(Laughing)

2525
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:40,980
- This is the worst.
- This is crazy.

2526
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,080
I'm so upset.

2527
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,280
Where would we find the sign?

2528
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:48,430
Sir, where do you think we can find
a sign that says Gangneung?

2529
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:50,450
- Can we find one on our way home?
- Would it be far from here?

2530
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:53,270
I guess we should go...

2531
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:55,030
to Hoengseong.

2532
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:57,140
- Hoengseong?
- Hoengseong?

2533
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:58,230
Wait.

2534
01:22:58,230 --> 01:22:59,860
We won't find one near here.

2535
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:01,770
We won't? How long would it take?

2536
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:03,810
It's about 50 to 60km
away from here.

2537
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:05,230
- Is it 50 to 60km away?
- Is it 50 to 60km away?

2538
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:07,370
All right. First...

2539
01:23:07,370 --> 01:23:09,510
(All right. First...)

2540
01:23:09,510 --> 01:23:11,820
We might find one in 20 or 30km.

2541
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,040
I think so. It should say Gangneung.

2542
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,190
Please head to Gangneung.

2543
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:18,110
We should look at the signs
on our way to Gangneung.

2544
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,690
I'm so doomed.

2545
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:21,280
I hope we will find one soon.

2546
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,320
Me too.

2547
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:25,230
We might find the sign
and say, "What's that?"

2548
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:27,230
We'll see. We might get lucky.

2549
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:30,140
Yangpyeong and Gapyeong.
We need something like this.

2550
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,570
So we just keep going
looking for Gangneung?

2551
01:23:32,570 --> 01:23:34,400
(So we just keep going
looking for Gangneung?)

2552
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,980
- What else can we do? I think...
- Okay.

2553
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:39,700
This penalty is so cruel.

2554
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:42,180
- This is the worst.
- It's ridiculous.

2555
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:44,820
I just feel at a loss.

2556
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:47,690
- My goodness.
- We just need to go to Gangneung.

2557
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:50,720
And we can't even rest on our way.
We should look for a sign.

2558
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,280
Gosh, this is...

2559
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,780
Why was the movie
filmed in Gangneung?

2560
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:54,980
- I know.
- It should've been filmed in Seoul.

2561
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:57,650
- I wish it was filmed in Songpa.
- Songpa or Shinsa sound good.

2562
01:23:57,650 --> 01:24:00,120
- Banpo would've been nice.
- It would've been entertaining.

2563
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,930
Gosh, why does it
have to be Gangneung?

2564
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:06,070
So what exactly should we do?

2565
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:09,400
Do we need to take a photo
of a sign that says Gangneung?

2566
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,810
Should it say Gangneung?

2567
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:13,150
(They must find a sign that says
Gangneung and take a photo.)

2568
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:15,440
What kind of signs are there?

2569
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,980
Would there be one
on the way to Incheon?

2570
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:19,220
Airplane!

2571
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,740
Gimpo airport...
No, it wouldn't work.

2572
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,720
- It's too far.
- Let's think the other way round.

2573
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,780
Is there a KTX station in Gangneung?

2574
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:27,530
(Is there a KTX station
in Gangneung?)

2575
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:28,820
- Is there?
- Gangneung...

2576
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:31,030
Do you know if there's
a KTX station in Gangneung?

2577
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,650
- Yes.
- Suk Jin.

2578
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:33,790
- There is.
- Really?

2579
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:36,830
The Gangneung Line starts
at Yangpyeong Station.

2580
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:39,660
- Then...
- But there should be a sign.

2581
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:41,310
There has to be a sign.

2582
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:44,830
Then how long does it take
to Yangpyeong Station?

2583
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:46,810
If there's no sign, we should...

2584
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:48,180
- It takes 40 minutes.
- Pardon?

2585
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:49,570
- It's 40 minutes.
- It's 30km away.

2586
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,480
- Is it 30km away?
- Darn it.

2587
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:52,780
(Even Yangpyeong Station
is 30km away.)

2588
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:54,720
Is the station on the way to Seoul?

2589
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,520
- Is it on the way to Seoul?
- Yes.

2590
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,580
Fortunately, is Yangpyeong Station
on the way to Seoul?

2591
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:01,620
- Really?
- I thought it was the other way.

2592
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:03,430
I don't think so.

2593
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:04,650
I think it's the opposite direction.

2594
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:06,260
Oh, it's the other way.

2595
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:08,120
(The driver sounds bright.)

2596
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:10,490
- Gosh, sir.
- Please.

2597
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:12,790
- "Oh, it's the other way."
- Oh, no.

2598
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,330
(They head to Yangpyeong Station
with the innocent driver.)

2599
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:19,510
You know what, Suk Jin?
We're even making a detour.

2600
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:20,650
- We're getting...
- The opposite direction?

2601
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:22,150
- farther away from Seoul.
- We're going backward.

2602
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:24,180
My goodness.

2603
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:26,580
(They are driving 40 minutes
toward Yangpyeong Station.)

2604
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,890
If we don't find the sign
at Yangpyeong Station...

2605
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:31,890
- We're here.
- Is this it?

2606
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:33,860
I see the sign
that says Yangpyeong Station.

2607
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:36,060
There's a train station. Please.

2608
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:37,600
- Should we get off here?
- Please.

2609
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:40,970
Please. The sign has to be there.

2610
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:44,160
My gosh. My outfit is too much.

2611
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:47,110
We have to find the word Gangneung.

2612
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:49,810
We must find the word Gangneung.

2613
01:25:50,530 --> 01:25:52,940
Please. I hope we will find it.

2614
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:55,180
Wondeok and Yongmun.

2615
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:57,910
- It's not here.
- Gangneung... KTX.

2616
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:00,020
Darn it.

2617
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:02,580
If we don't find the word...

2618
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:03,820
Cheongryangri.

2619
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:05,860
- Gangneung!
- Gosh, you startled me.

2620
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:06,890
Cheongryangri.

2621
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:08,480
(Gangneung, Donghae,
Andong, Jechoen)

2622
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:11,650
(They found Gangneung.)

2623
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:13,790
- That was too loud.
- Please excuse us.

2624
01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:15,070
(They let out a shout
and cover their mouths.)

2625
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:17,440
- I'm sorry.
- I was too excited.

2626
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:19,490
I'm sorry. Take a picture.

2627
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,470
In 1, 2, and 3.

2628
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:23,870
Done? This is great.

2629
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:25,680
It'd be better to take the KTX here.

2630
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,400
You should take the train here.

off their lame dance moves.)

01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:38,560
Sir.

2634
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:40,060
Drag him out.

2635
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:43,620
(Four street women are here
to meet them.)

2637

2643
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:20,400
Ready?

2644
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:22,600
Fight.

2645
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,690
