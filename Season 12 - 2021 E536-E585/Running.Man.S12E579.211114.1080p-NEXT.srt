Sir.

30
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,570
- A diaper?
- Sir.

31
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,870
It's not a diaper.

32
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,960
Isn't this a diaper?

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,210

I guess he started
a diaper business.

39
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,820
He will do a diaper commercial soon.

40
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,240

- Suk Jin, I want to button it up.
- It will be embarrassing.

42
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,150
I'm not supposed to button it up.

43
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,090
- Let's just give it a try.
- Don't do that.

44
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,790

- This isn't right.
- Let me see.

51
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,070
It's not bad.

52
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,960
This is how it's supposed to look.

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,160

- It looks cool.

54
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,870

- Mr. Diaper.
- This looks strange.

57
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,180
- Are you a cactus or what?
- Are you going hiking?

58
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,880
- What are you talking about?
- You look just like last week.

- No, it's for hiking.
- That's mountain clothes.

61

Excuse me. Are you Toegye Yi Hwang?

62
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,560

- Toegye Yi Hwang.
- Grandma.

64
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,350
- Grandma.
- I'm not your grandma.

65

He's Woong's grandma.

67
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,600
- It looks like a grandma's wig.
- You think?

68
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,000
I think I saw you before.

69

she's wearing a Halloween costume.

76
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,670
No one can beat her.

Gosh, I can't watch it.

82

used to be an idol trainee.

83
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,630
She's different.

84
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,530

when we talked about it.

178
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,550
- Why is she your sister?
- She's my sister.

179
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,570
- Hey, my brother.
- Aiki.

180
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,710
(Mr. Diaper wants to be
friends with Aiki.)

181
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,750
You're so cool.

182
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,920
- Hey.
- Aiki.

183
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,990
I've missed you.

184
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,880
- She's so cute.
- Seriously,

185
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,690
along with Honey J,

186
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,950
she's one of the busiest dancers...

187
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,000
- in Korea now.
- She's the busiest one.

188
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,700
- No one can beat her.
- She's matchless.

189
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,460
She's making a lot of money now.

190
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,530
- It's unbelievable.
- What are you talking about?

191
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,870
Were you with her?

192
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,960
That's all I want.

193
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,370
- It's all about money.
- Were you with her?

194
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,700
You're a money hugger.

195
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,010
Show me the money!

196
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,900
- Show me the money!
- Show me the money!

197
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,400
- Show me the money!
- Yes.

198
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,570
Who's next?

199
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,840
Here's the third leader.

200
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,210
- Yes!
- This is so exciting.

201
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,550
Look at Se Chan.

202
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,950
(The third leader who will
make them fall for dance is...)

203
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,280
Who is it?

204
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,490
Lee Jung!

205
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,860
- She looks so charismatic.

206
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,220
- Hey, Lee Jung!
- She's crazy.

207
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,670
Lee Jung!

208
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,500
- She's crazy.
- Lee Jung!

209
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,830
YGX!

210
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,200
She's fabulous.

211
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,550
She's so cool!

212
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,950
That's amazing.

213
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,620
I want to dance like her.

214
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,860
Me too.

215
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,890
(They can't hold back from dancing.)

216
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,550
She's unbelievable.

217
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,700
I told you.

218
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,720
This is fantastic.

219
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,900
(The youngest leader
of YGX, Lee Jung)

220
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,170
- Lee Jung!
- That was wonderful.

221
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,070
- That was amazing.
- Lee Jung!

222
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,230
- Lee Jung.
- Welcome.

223
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,830
- You're the best.
- Come over here.

224
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,950
(Lee Jung's fan meeting
has started.)

225
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,100
You are so cool.

226
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,280
(The guy from an alpine club
is really excited.)

227
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,710
- This is really...
- She's unbelievable.

228
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,950
- She's snazzy.
- She's fabulous.

229
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,520
It's early in the morning,
but she got her hair done already.

230
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,890
- Did you go to a beauty shop?
- Yes.

231
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,820
- I slept only an hour.
- My goodness.

232
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,120
That's amazing.

233
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,850
(Look at me.)

234
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,490
- Stop being so frivolous.
- What are you doing?

235
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,990
- My gosh.
- He loves them.

236
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,960
He's being so annoying today.

237
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,230
- It's because of them.
- What was that?

238
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,730
- That's enough.
- Do you think you're on their team?

239
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,730
- We're a team.
- You know what?

240
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,730
Haha looks like...

241
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,200
a retired hip-hop musician.

242
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,410
He's a retired hip-hop musician
who runs a store in Hongdae.

243
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,280
What are you talking about
dressed like that?

244
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,340
You're wearing a diaper!

245
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,020
You looked very...

246
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,450
- serious yesterday.
- You looked gentle yesterday.

247
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,660
- What did he do?
- What did you do yesterday?

248
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,660
- The gala show.
- What did you do yesterday.

249
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,890
- He was the MC.
- He hosted the gala show.

250
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,530
- Was he the MC?
- Yes.

251
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,750
I went there because I was paid.

252
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,300
You did it for money.

253
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,220
How much did you get? Chicken feed?

254
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,620
(How much did you get?
Chicken feed?)

255
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,800
He got 300 dollars.

256
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,270
- He got 300 dollars.
- Only 300?

257
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,070
Ms. Juliana is very humorous.

258
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,640
- Juliana.
- Juliana?

259
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,810
We have...

260
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,100
Juliana and her boyfriend here.

261
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,570
- All right!
- He's a grandma.

262
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,950
- Yes!
- Yes!

263
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,950
- I see.
- He's just a grandma.

264
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,190
- It's too shiny.
- All right.

265
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,480
The last leader is
Haha's best friend.

266
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
- Right.
- They are very close.

267
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,660
- Yes!
- Really?

268
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,790
- PROWDMON.
- All right.

269
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,800
Here's our last leader.

270
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,250
- Who is it?
- Here's the fourth leader.

271
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,770
Please come on out.

272
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,170
Hey.

273
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,270
- Hey.
- Who is it?

274
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,400
My goodness.

275
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,640
- Hey.
- Who is it?

276
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,570
- She's the oldest leader here.
- The oldest one?

277
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,640
She does look like a captain.

278
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,450
- She's also a professor.
- She's a professor.

279
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,870
My goodness.

280
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,950
It's like...

281
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,520
- What is she doing?
- I wonder how she'd look.

282
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,420
(Monika of PROWDMON)

283
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,580
How is she coming out?

284
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,340
There she is.

285
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,560
- My goodness.
- It's like a play.

286
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,890
She plays with music.

287
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,800
She's a professor.

288
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,060
She's so graceful.

289
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,930
She does play with music.

290
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,590
(She makes eye contact
with each member with her dance.)

291
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,640
Professor.

292
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,270
(She makes eye contact
with each member with her dance.)

293
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,410
She's beautiful.

294
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,310
She's going to Jong Kook.

295
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,180
- She's so cool.
- She really is.

296
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,210
She looks so graceful.

297
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,840
- He dances along.
- He's a retired hip-hop musician.

298
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,920
This is so cool.

299
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,560
This is amazing.

300
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,790
It's elegant.

301
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,850
She is elegant.

302
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,990
(Soft and light)

303
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,770
(I was worn down)

304
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,330
(I've been
hiding away all this time)

305
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,180
(You dance so freely)

306
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,050
(She describes the lyrics
with her dance moves.)

307
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,610
That was beautiful.

308
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,350
All together.

309
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,580
From the right.

310
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,720
- Are we supposed to sing?
- Your hand.

311
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,350
(They enjoy
the performance together.)

312
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,530
Left hand.

313
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,860
(Yi Hwang from Dongducheon
ruins it with the air trumpet.)

314
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,990
Both hands.

315
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,590
(Monika brings them together
into one.)

316
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,700
This is nice.

317
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,170
(Monika brings them together
into one.)

318
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,730
Shall we give a bow together?

319
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,830
(Shall we give a bow together?)

320
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,410
I love it. She's a teacher.

321
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,910
- She's a teacher.
- A teacher.

322
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,840
- Ms. Monika.
- Monika!

323
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,320
- Hello.
- She's Monika.

324
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,970
- Hello.
- Hello.

325
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,660
- Hello.
- Hello.

326
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,690
- You're so cool.
- That was amazing.

327
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,120
Like I said earlier,

328
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,060
they turned
the whole country on its head,

329
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,030
but there are people
who didn't watch their show.

330
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,860
- Right.
- Isn't that right?

331
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,440
- Sure.
- It can happen. So...

332
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,460
I'd like to tell you honestly.

333
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,230
Some of our members...

334
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,860
didn't watch your show.

335
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,310
- I see.
- That's true.

336
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,470
Among the members here?

337
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,810
- Among us?
- You know,

338
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,550
"Squid Game" is very popular now,

339
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,180
but some of us
haven't watched it yet.

340
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,570
- Right.
- That's true.

341
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,340
And some of us text me back
like a week later.

342
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,080
- It happens.
- Right.

343
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,750
Even though...

344
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,750
some of our members
didn't watch your show,

345
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,350
they will definitely...

346
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,800
fall for your charm today.

347
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,320
- You just watched the opening.
- That was crazy.

348
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,220
This is how
I'd like to address them.

349
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,770
In a word, they are
the best dancers in Korea.

350
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:40,900
Exactly.

351
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,860
And not just in Korea.

352
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,330
- They are global dancers.
- The best dancers in the world.

353
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,230
- They raised our nation's status.
- Some of them won first place...

354
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,940
- at international contests.
- They represent our country.

355
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,200
I watched it.

356
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,710
You won an international contest
with a tall girl.

357
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,110
- That's right.
- You were a duo.

358
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,710
- You won third place, right?
- Right.

359
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,650
- I saw you a lot too.
- Where?

360
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,710
On TikTok.

361
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,950
Oh, right.

362
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,560
- Yes!
- Brother!

363
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,290
Yes, my brother!

364
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,090
His video is always
in the recommended section.

365
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,430
- Right.
- He's TikTok Grandpa.

366
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,490
TikTok Grandpa?

367
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,120
He's famous on TikTok.

368
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,270
First, about Honey J...

369
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,910
Her real name is Jeong Ha Nee.

370
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,100
So she's called Honey J.

371
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,600
- Jeong Han...
- Jeong Ha Nee.

372
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,070
I see. Jeong Ha Nee.

373
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,500
- Jeong Ha Nee...
- What?

374
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,740
- Is it Jeong Ha Nee?
- Yes.

375
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,070
That sounds like a foreign name.

376
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,340
- What?
- Ha Nee.

377
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,450
Which means a west wind.

378
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,980
- It's a pure Korean word.
- Is it a Korean word?

379
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,110
- Is that your real name?
- Yes, it is.

380
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,660
- Your mom is...
- It's Ha Nee.

381
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,080
Your dad got you a nice name.

382
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,120
- My mom gave me the name.
- Your mom...

383
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,660
Excuse me.

384
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,900
This will be broadcast nationally.

385
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,990
Ha Nee. Jeong Ha Nee.

386
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,860
- Will you stop talking?
- Jeong Ha Nee. Honey J.

387
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,990
(The local MC is hosting
his own show.)

388
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,990
Actually,

389
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,940
Honey J coined
a lot of famous quotes...

390
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,540
- in "Street Woman Fighter".
- She did.

391
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,700
Monika too.
They are like quote makers.

392
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,650
- I see.
- My gosh.

393
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,070
- What did they say?
- Those who didn't watch the show...

394
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,450
seem very nervous now.

395
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,550
They are afraid
if you'd ask them about it.

396
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,710
- I think I know who they are.
- They're afraid.

397
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,160
- You know why I'm sitting here.
- A few of us...

398
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
(Quiet)

399
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,580
- A few of us...
- I'm here to help them.

400
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,190
- have shaky eyes.
- These three.

401
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,820
They look like
they're walking on eggshells.

402
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,400
- I see.
- I know what it is.

403
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,060
- Famous quotes?
- They are learning today.

404
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,930
I bet you've heard of this before.

405
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,960
- What?
- "Watch closely."

406
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,440
"This is a fight
between big sisters."

407
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,270
It was on the previews.

408
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,830
He engages only in real fights.

409
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,670
We fight without talking.

410
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,640
It's better to get a head start.

411
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,340
I'm not supposed to talk.

412
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,710
This is my second time
to meet with Honey J.

413
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,820
When you see her dance,

414
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,980
- she comes across as tough.
- She looks tough.

415
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,980
- But she's not like that.
- I know.

416
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,250
All the dancers
on "Street Woman Fighter"...

417
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,450
- They all are like crybabies.
- are like that.

418
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,290
It looks as if they would fight...

419
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,850
as soon as the cameras
are turned off, but...

420
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,400
I know. They all look really tough.

421
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,430
We're just like them.
It looks like we fight a lot,

422
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,320
- but we are actually close friends.
- But some of us actually fought.

423
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,770
- Isn't that true?
- Some of us.

424
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,000
He never loses a fight.

425
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,770
- We had some conflicts.
- Right.

426
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,100
Just a little conflict.

427
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,410
- It's no big deal.
- We've been together for 11 years.

428
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,950
- It can happen.
- It's inevitable.

429
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,870
- Sure.
- Suk Jin got mad like two times.

430
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,370
It did happen.

431
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,480
I wasn't going to see
Haha ever again.

432
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,660
Oh, right.
Didn't you have a fight, Haha?

433
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,450
Haha, you had a little trouble
with Jong Kook.

434
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,660
- No.
- No?

435
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,820
(Haha, you had a little trouble
with Jong Kook.)

436
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,390
(Actually, something happened
while shooting the last episode.)

437
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,950
- It's not like that.
- We can't call it trouble.

438
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,300
- Why?
- It was a misunderstanding.

439
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,960
It was just a misunderstanding.

440
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,670
(They were mad at each other
for a while for something childish.)

441
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,070
We can't call it trouble.

442
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,940
Haha was scolded by Jong Kook.

443
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,940
You guys are so close now.

444
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,940
- It was a misunderstanding.
- A misunderstanding?

445
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,600
I was surrounded by cameras,
and I had to do this.

446
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,650
(Unfortunately, they had to
clear it up in front of cameras.)

447
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,780
"I'm sorry."

448
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,570
Oh, no.

449
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,710
He got scolded by Jong Kook.

450
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,710
Okay.

451
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,740
All right.

452
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,250
Monika runs a large dance academy.

453
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,850
- Her business is going really well.
- Of course.

454
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,390
- And...
- Oh, she's a mogul?

455
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,900
- Absolutely.
- She rakes in the money in Hongdae.

456
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,450
- She's absolutely a mogul.
- Is she?

457
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,300
And Lee Jung teaches
at the academy too.

458
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,820
- She's an instructor.
- That's right.

459
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,040
- Oh, really?
- Honey J teaches there too.

460
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,170
- We both teach there.
- Honey J too?

461
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,670
- Honey J teaches there too.
- Yes.

462
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,830
I see that she's a mogul.

463
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,500
After "Street Woman Fighter",
some fans formed a club...

464
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,200
called People Seeking to be Scolded
by Monika.

465
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,300
- Yes. It's called PSM as well.
- Right.

466
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,680
- I scolded others on the show.
- Right.

467
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,770
I know that.

468
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,810
I guess people found it charming.

469
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,890
Indeed. You looked so cool.

470
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,660
So some people said
that if I scolded them,

471
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,930
they could pass
a civil service exam...

472
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,930
- or succeed in losing weight.
- It'd help them get it together.

473
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,930
- Exactly.
- That's right.

474
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,130
- They want her to scold them.
- Yes. Some people said that.

475
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,560
- Rather than being scolded by her,
- How does she scold others?

476
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,990
I recommend you get scolded
by Jong Kook.

477
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,490
- It'd help you stay alert.
- Jong Kook can be scary.

478
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,940
- He'd drive you bonkers.
- True.

479
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,110
He wouldn't stop.

480
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,840
Monika would scold you once,
and that'd be it.

481
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,030
- But Jong Kook wouldn't stop there.
- It'd last for a year.

482
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,530
He would keep scolding you
until you make progress.

483
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,880
- Am I right, Jong Kook?
- Yes. I'd never give up.

484
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,120
- Only if I care about that person.
- Of course.

485
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,780
Anyway, it's the same
for all our guests,

486
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,510
but especially Lee Jung...

487
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,090
choreographed many famous songs.

488
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,130
- Which ones?
- True.

489
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,690
They're like superstars
to us TV celebrities.

490
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,600
- Thank you for saying that.
- It's true.

491
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,050
Did you watch
"Street Woman Fighter"?

492
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,130
Yes, I did.

493
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,670
I watched the show.

494
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,930
He's not talking about "The Smurfs".

495
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,670
- Of course, I watched the show...
- Not "The Smurfs".

496
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,940
like all others in the country.

497
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,260
- Then do you know...
- "The Smurfs"?

498
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,530
the names of their dance teams?

499
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,610
- Their team names?
- Yes.

500
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,180
- YGX.
- Correct. What's Monika's?

501
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,770
Monika X.

502
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,310
- Don't they have an X at the end?
- At least add "Y" instead of "X".

503
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,080
- What's about mine?
- Honey X and Aiki X.

504
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,480
- My goodness.
- This is not "X-Man".

505
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,890
- I apologize on his behalf.
- "X-Man"?

506
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,010
(Suk Jin is seriously brazen.)

507
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,890
Anyway, since we're talking
about it,

508
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,450
Lee Jung, can you show us
a few of the dances you made?

509
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,600
- Sure thing.
- Great.

510
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,520
- Yes, I made that move.
- The dance moves she created.

511
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,670
- Let's give her a big hand.
- Yes!

512
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,790
(The hit song choreographer
Lee Jung's show time)

513
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,030
- Here we go.
- Yes.

514
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,640
She even walks like she's dancing.

515
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,200
- This is an amazing choreography.
- Absolutely.

516
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,260
- Watch her facial expressions.
- It's incredible.

517
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,610
She's amazing.

518
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,530
We should see her face.
I'll watch the show when it's aired.

519
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,160
(After warming up her body
with a powerful dance,)

520
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,050
(she goes straight to the climax.)

521
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,700
She's really good.

522
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,110
- Don't you just love her dance?
- Yes.

523
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,680
(This is how the choreographer
of the songs dances.)

524
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,210
- She moves her body so skillfully.
- Indeed.

525
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,950
- I'm impressed.
- It was amazing.

526
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,010
How does she dance like that?

527
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,890
I really love you guys.
All four of you.

528
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,690
She moves her body so skillfully
and freely.

529
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,420
Ji Hyo keeps saying
that she'll learn to dance.

530
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,280
- Right.
- She wants to go to her academy.

531
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,090
Then I think... Ji Hyo.

532
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,520
- Yes?
- Since the teachers are all here,

533
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,990
why don't you try to dance
to ITZY's song that she danced to...

534
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,600
- in your own style?
- Just go with your own flow.

535
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,790
Go with your own flow.

536
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,900
- She's Songzy.
- She's a good dancer.

537
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,260
Her stage name is Songzy.

538
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,410
- Songzy.
- Drop the beat!

539
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,940
- Ji Hyo knows some dance moves.
- That's right.

540
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,380
- She's improved a lot.
- True.

541
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,910
- She's interested in dance.
- She improved gradually.

542
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,540
- Oh, my. Look at her moves.
- She's starting to feel the rhythm.

543
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,950
Her moves are great.

544
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,310
She's about to do
the shoulder dance.

545
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,240
Five, six, seven, eight.

546
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,590
(Dancing)

547
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,310
She's doing it right.

548
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,020
(Exclaiming)

549
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,900
(Wriggling)

550
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,630
(I can't watch this.)

551
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,760
Isn't this right?

552
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,170
That's not bad at all.

553
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,170
(She interpreted the dance
in her own style.)

554
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,940
She's dancing really well so far.

555
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,940
That's great.

556
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,000
Look how she moves her shoulders.
This is crazy.

557
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,440
- Isn't this right?
- You're doing it right.

558
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,680
You're doing great.

559
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,650
- Ji Hyo, I think that's enough.
- I'm out of breath.

560
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,950
- It's okay. You did great.
- Wasn't it for a drinking game?

561
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,540
- It's time for evaluation.
- Let's hear what our guests think.

562
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,510
- Let's do that.
- They'll evaluate her dance.

563
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,250
- First of all... Can I go first?
- Yes. Please go ahead.

564
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,390
I really liked her performance.

565
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,130
As soon as the music was played,
from the first beat,

566
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,360
she danced right on beat.

567
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,630
- From the first beat?
- Yes.

568
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,930
- One, two, three, four. Like this.
- She danced on beat?

569
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,060
She's just trying to
make more money.

570
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,200
- That's not it.
- She's a dance mogul.

571
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,900
- That's not true. Let me finish.
- Hey!

572
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,600
- After the first four beats,
- Show some respect.

573
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,030
I thought she moved to simple beats
as beginners usually do,

574
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,410
but she subdivided the beats.
One and two. Three and four.

575
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,230
You see, that shows...

576
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,650
- that she has...
- Thank you.

577
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:04,970
such a good sense of rhythm.

578
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,310
- She's such a smooth talker.
- I knew it.

579
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,780
She has a good sense of rhythm.
I bet she listens to music often.

580
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,510
Next up is the leader of YGX...

581
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,750
- Lee Jung.
- She did a good job.

582
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,480
First of all, I'm the one
who made the dance.

583
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,160
It's amazing that she could copy
the dance right away.

584
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,760
My gosh. They're all in on this.

585
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,830
- Come on.
- They want to have it all.

586
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,260
Use some professional lingo.
You have a well-balanced body.

587
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,030
- I see how she signed with them.
- Exactly.

588
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,700
- Your upper and lower body...
- No wonder.

589
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,410
- are very well-proportioned.
- That was funny.

590
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,110
- She's good at doing isolation.
- "Isolation"?

591
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,810
- She's very good at it.
- "Isolation"?

592
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:41,810
- Yes.
- Indeed.

593
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,810
- She has a good sense of rhythm.
- That's so funny.

594
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,480
- They're hilarious.
- However...

595
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,250
They're all great dancers,
but they have different viewpoints.

596
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,830
- Let's hear what Aiki thinks.
- She's the master...

597
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,590
of short-form content.

598
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,050
What do you think
of her dance, Aiki?

599
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,720
She has a similar dance style
to someone I like.

600
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,760
- Who?
- Who?

601
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,940
(The dance style of someone
that Aiki likes?)

602
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,230
My mom.

603
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,200
Her mother?

604
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
(She saw some of her mother's
moves while Ji Hyo was dancing.)

605
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,270
I like her honesty.

606
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,300
Her dance performance reminded me
of my mom's dance.

607
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,450
I see what you mean.

608
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,650
That's a good one.

609
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,680
- I bet she's good at isolation too.
- She danced like Aiki's mother.

610
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,040
The next person to dance is
quite good at dancing.

611
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,480
- She's almost a pro.
- She learned to dance.

612
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,710
- She's a pro among us.
- Don't say that.

613
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,690
- She used to be a trainee.
- That's not true.

614
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,450
- She's a good dancer.
- I'm excited.

615
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,750
- So...
- That's not true.

616
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,860
- She actually came here to compete.
- No. That's not true.

617
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,370
- She's ready to compete with you.
- She's determined.

618
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,700
- Come on.
- She's determined to win.

619
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,930
- She's ready for a dance battle.
- She's a good dancer.

620
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,900
But her biggest weakness is
the weird dance style of her own.

621
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,700
- Look at her outfit.
- Is that so?

622
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,960
- She can't seem to change it.
- But she's talented in our eyes.

623
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,000
She's so good at dancing.

624
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,770
But I'm really embarrassed
to dance in front of them.

625
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,650
- You know this dance, right?
- I've seen her dance before.

626
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,700
- Just do it as you do before us.
- Please play something upbeat.

627
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,120
Director, please add some lights
for So Min just like the guests.

628
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,180
- Are you ready?
- What?

629
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,510
- Drop the beat.
- Show them what you've got.

630
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,120
- All right.
- Oh, yes.

631
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,930
("Hey Mama", the legendary
performance from SWF)

632
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,450
David Guetta.

633
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,860
(She starts dancing
as if she prepared for this.)

634
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,920
I can't watch this.

635
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,020
I bet she prepared for this.

636
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,870
This is so embarrassing.

637
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,960
(Sudden twerking)

638
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,930
(Toegye Yi Hwang hates
the sight of it.)

639
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,930
(The dancing queen continues
dancing in her own style.)

640
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,200
This is embarrassing.

641
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,780
This is hilarious.

642
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,240
(She's cleaning the stage.)

643
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,210
This is utterly embarrassing.

644
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,820
(She's going too far
as she's out of dance moves.)

645
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,210
That's enough. So Min.

646
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,360
(Stop it, So Min.)

647
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,480
- Drag her out.
- So Min.

648
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,950
- This is driving me nuts.
- "Stop it."

649
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,590
- I sincerely apologize.
- "We're all going to die..."

650
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,190
- "at this rate."
- I'm sorry you had to see that.

651
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,420
- Did you see her legs?
- Yes.

652
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,130
- I can't believe what I just saw.
- You saw that, right?

653
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,330
- That was shocking.
- Oh, my.

654
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,848
Everything else was okay.

655
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,990
But this move was shocking.

656
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,960
(Her twerking dance was shocking.)

657
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,930
I thought she needed to
go number two.

658
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,550
It wasn't like that. My body didn't
move as I wanted it to move.

659
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,700
- That wasn't what I wanted to do.
- She danced like this.

660
00:24:03,912 --> 00:24:04,744
Before we hear your comments,

661
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,380
let's watch her dance
to ITZY's song.

662
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,480
- So Min...
- All right.

663
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,680
- ITZY's song?
- prepared something for today.

664
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,560
- I didn't.
- Dance to ITZY's song.

665
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,920
- Ji Hyo did their signature moves.
- How...

666
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,060
- Okay.
- Don't do twerking again.

667
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,600
Just don't do that.

668
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,220
- Go to the restroom first.
- Just...

669
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,870
- Just don't do that.
- I'll kill you if you do it again.

670
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,540
- I'll trample on you.
- Don't do this, okay?

671
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,930
- Don't do it.
- I'll kick you like this.

672
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,010
- Go back to your seat.
- Don't do it.

673
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,400
- Stay quiet.
- Don't you dare.

674
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,470
- Just move your shoulders.
- They're just joking.

675
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,430
- So Min, be confident.
- So Min, just move your shoulders.

676
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,170
Since I'm dressed like a dancer,
I feel more confident.

677
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,670
- You really are a great dancer.
- So Min, we'll play ITZY's song.

678
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,050
- You're the best, So Min.
- This is great.

679
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,090
- You've got this.
- You can do this.

680
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,620
Are you ready? Drop the beat.

681
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,290
Let's go!

682
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,210
("Wannabe" by ITZY,
choreographed by Jeon So Min)

683
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,090
- Your facial expression matters...
- She'll add her own moves.

684
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,360
- in the beginning.
- She'll do something funny.

685
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,420
She turned around.

686
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,100
- So Min, face the camera.
- Oh, my.

687
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,570
(She's charismatic enough to give up
on getting a close-up shot.)

688
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,870
So Min, move to the front.

689
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,270
- It's time.
- You should go now.

690
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,960
- Do the shoulder dance.
- Five, six, seven, eight.

691
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,200
The shoulder dance.

692
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,010
(She starts doing
the shoulder dance easily.)

693
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,040
(Suddenly, she starts dancing
in her own style.)

694
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,670
Stick to the original dance.
Move your shoulders.

695
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:13,380
(She barely continues performing
with her own cheesy dance moves.)

696
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,580
(But she begins to repeat
her dance moves again.)

697
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,980
- That's great. Keep going.
- Oh, my.

698
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,640
- I told you she was good.
- No. Stop.

699
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,520
(She's twerking again.)

700
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:24,060
(The dance control squad
quickly stopped her.)

701
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,420
- Great job, So Min.
- That was so hilarious.

702
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,720
That was great.

703
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,800
- I really liked your performance.
- Let's hear what they think.

704
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,270
- We should do that.
- Yes.

705
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,340
- It was so funny.
- We're going to hear...

706
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,960
what you guys think.

707
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,200
- Okay. Professor, you go first.
- So Min is a great dancer.

708
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,610
As for the technical aspects
of her performance,

709
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,010
her shoulder dance looked great
because of her bone structure.

710
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,110
Her move was smooth and beautiful.

711
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,350
She's such a smooth talker.

712
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,620
She can convince anyone
to enroll in a dance class.

713
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,350
- People would be convinced.
- At least for three months.

714
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,820
- Three months.
- That's a great comment.

715
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,020
- They'd pay in advance.
- That's great.

716
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,090
Next, let's hear
what Lee Jung thinks.

717
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,090
(Lee Jung doesn't seem to know
what to say.)

718
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,300
- She doesn't know what to say.
- Exactly.

719
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,830
First of all, she's so pretty.

720
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,920
She's really pretty and tall.

721
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,660
- She has lean, long arms and legs.
- She has nothing to say.

722
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,370
- Say something about her dance.
- And her outfit is so pretty too.

723
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,400
You talked about "isolation" before.

724
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,110
To be honest, I saw some moves...

725
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,280
- that unexpectedly inspired me.
- Really?

726
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,810
- Her dance inspired you?
- Yes.

727
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,120
She just lied around on the floor.

728
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,440
- Are you sure?
- Really?

729
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,470
Could you please elaborate?

730
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,980
I got inspiration from her dance.

731
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,620
I could tell that she pretended
she was open-minded,

732
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,910
but she was actually
quite conservative.

733
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,020
- Oh, my.
- That's true.

734
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,790
- That's unbelievable.
- She could tell that?

735
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,060
- I can't believe it.
- How did you know?

736
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,860
I figured it out from a single move.

737
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,420
- Which one?
- When she did this move...

738
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,690
The pooping move?

739
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,530
Yes, the pooping move.

740
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,890
- We keep our legs straight.
- I see.

741
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,460
But she crossed her legs like this.

742
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,370
(Shy)

743
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,470
(She crossed her legs
while doing a sexy dance move.)

744
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,240
- How did you notice it? Amazing.
- I didn't even know that.

745
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,780
- Like this.
- I'm impressed.

746
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,440
She saw every detail
of the dance moves.

747
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,980
How did you notice it?

748
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,620
- She's incredible.
- How did she know?

749
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,450
- She crossed her legs like this.
- She's the best.

750
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,060
- I read her mind.
- You read her mind.

751
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,890
How did she read my mind
based on a dance move?

752
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,800
I guess it's something
you can't hide.

753
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,990
- I guess so.
- She expressed herself.

754
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,630
- Your dance shows your personality.
- That's true.

755
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,160
- We can see through you.
- I'm amazed.

756
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,200
May I have your attention, please?
Today,

757
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,270
the four leaders of
the best dance crews in the world...

758
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,880
will join the seven average humans.

759
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,080
It's Street Human Fighter.

760
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,700
(Street Human Fighter)

761
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,280
It's true that we're
average humans, but...

762
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,550
- It's SHF, not SWF.
- Street Human Fighter.

763
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,240
Through fierce
and ruthless competition,

764
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,120
we'll decide
the number one dance crew today.

765
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,260
(The number 1 dance crew will be
decided today.)

766
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,590
All right. Let's go!

767
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,450
(Everyone including Thug Dancer...)

768
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,150
(and Toegye Yi Hwang
will compete with one another.)

769
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,150
- I'm excited.
- I want to win.

770
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,270
- Me too. It's going to be a war.
- Okay.

771
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,460
The four guests will be
the leaders...

772
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,160
of the four dance crews
that you'll form.

773
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,160
After each mission ends,

774
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,540
the crews in 3rd and 4th places
will have a dance battle...

775
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,110
and receive different numbers
of penalty badges.

776
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,110
(They will receive penalty badges
according to the result.)

777
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,580
The winning crew will receive...

778
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,790
the trophy and amazing prizes.

779
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,980
(The winning crew will get
the trophy and prizes.)

780
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,290
The prizes must be amazing.

781
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,860
We prepared expensive prizes.

782
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,120
- Really?
- Oh, my.

783
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,590
Meanwhile, the crew in bottom place
with the most penalty badges...

784
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,830
- will get a penalty at the end.
- Of course.

785
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,950
(The crew in bottom place will
get a penalty.)

786
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,100
There will be only one crew...

787
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,370
to get the trophy
and prizes tonight.

788
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,700
Which crew will obtain...

789
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,700
the title of the number one
street dance crew?

790
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,580
- What?
- Ready. Fight.

791
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,080
- What was that?
- "Ready. Fight."

792
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,550
Did you just imitate Kang Daniel?

793
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,880
- What was that?
- "Ready. Fight."

794
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,380
- "Ready. Fight."
- Should we call you Choi Daniel?

795
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,820
- I guess you wanted to look cool.
- What was that?

796
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,590
All right.
It's time to form the crews.

797
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,620
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

798
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,150
- We prepared 7 sets of 4 cards.
- Okay.

799
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,070
Each of you will show the card
of the crew you want to join.

800
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,800
If more than 2 people pick the same
crew, the leader chooses 2 of them.

801
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,230
They will pick one of us,
not the other way around?

802
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,600
- We choose first.
- We need to be chosen.

803
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,960
No. I don't like this.

804
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,780
- I have to wait to be chosen again.
- You see...

805
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,340
- There's a dance style I pursue.
- I like all of them too.

806
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,440
- Oh, no.
- Although I'm close to her,

807
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,780
I'll stick to my preference.

808
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,550
- You have your own style?
- Yes.

809
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,380
You never know.

810
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,440
- Haha.
- Wait. I haven't made my choice.

811
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,680
Lift up one of the cards. One.

812
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,290
- Hold on. I haven't decided yet.
- Two.

813
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,880
If you can't decide, just leave.

814
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,180
- Just give me a second.
- "Just leave."

815
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,950
Time's up. One, two, three.

816
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,530
(Lee Jung's crew)

817
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,800
Lee Jung.

818
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,330
- He's acting like a 20 something.
- Here he goes again.

819
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,630
- My gosh.
- He's acting like a younger man.

820
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,370
That old fossil wants to pretend
to be a younger man.

821
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,810
- I can't believe him.
- I hate it when he acts like that.

822
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,310
I'll choose the crew to join.
One, two, three.

823
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,660
- Oh, my.
- Lee Jung's crew.

824
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,280
(Workout Dancer chose
Lee Jung's crew as well.)

825
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,010
- My goodness.
- Next up is Ji Hyo.

826
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,240
- I choose Aiki's crew.
- Aiki's crew.

827
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,910
- I choose Aiki's crew.
- Mom.

828
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,620
- She called me "Mom".
- Aiki will have a hard time.

829
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,710
- Okay.
- She called Ji Hyo "Mom".

830
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,820
I wanted to join Aiki's crew too,
but now that she joined the crew...

831
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,860
Why?

832
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,090
- I want to learn to dance properly.
- Monika's crew!

833
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,060
I grunted unintentionally.

834
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,530
"Oh, gosh."

835
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,950
It'll be a long day for you.

836
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,220
- Probably.
- It's my turn. I choose Honey J.

837
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,230
(Jae Suk chose Honey J's crew.)

838
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,870
- Honey J!
- Her "Mommae" dance is my style.

839
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,430
- Her "Mommae" dance.
- That's cool.

840
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,900
- I like her dance style.
- I love your body

841
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,610
I chose Honey J's crew.

842
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,810
I choose Honey J too.

843
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,780
(So Min chose Honey J's crew too.)

844
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,550
- She'll teach you properly.
- She picked Honey J's crew.

845
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,120
- Now, it's Toegye Yi Hwang's turn.
- It's hard to decide.

846
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
"Toegye Yi Hwang"?

847
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,620
Which crew do you punks think
I will choose?

848
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,720
- That's funny.
- Se Chan is a good dancer too.

849
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,260
- He's a good dancer too.
- Indeed.

850
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,030
I mean, he used to perform
on "SBS Inkigayo".

851
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,630
Don't say that.

852
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,270
- Okay. I choose Monika's crew.
- That's true.

853
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,100
(Se Chan chose Monika's crew.)

854
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,700
All right. We'll begin
the first round now.

855
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,010
(So the crews have been formed.
Now, Round 1 will begin.)

856
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,010
Don't we have to change our clothes?

857
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,010
- You have to change your clothes.
- Okay.

858
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,640
Se Chan is getting on my nerves
by dancing.

859
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,380
- Why is that so annoying?
- Come on. Bring it on.

860
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,280
- What is he doing?
- You see, actually...

861
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,090
- Honey J...
- Yes.

862
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,980
I was aware of her condition.

863
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,480
She wasn't feeling well
before we began the shoot.

864
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,380
- And her condition got worse.
- Yes.

865
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,360
- Although she wanted to go on,
- That's right.

866
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,960
but we thought that she should
go home to rest.

867
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
- Her health is more important.
- So I hope you can understand her.

868
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,100
- We all do.
- Yes.

869
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,990
- Health must come first.
- Absolutely.

870
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,610
- Of course.
- That's why she left.

871
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:13,080
It's not that serious though.
So please don't worry too much.

872
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,850
Honey J felt bad about leaving...

873
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,880
- without finishing the shoot.
- That's right.

874
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,170
Don't worry, Honey J.
And we hope you get well soon.

875
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,380
Get well soon.

876
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,680
Then should we join another team?

877
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,980
I was going to replace Honey J
as Honey Jae Suk.

878
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,090
- Honey Jae Suk?
- No way.

879
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,860
- You're not on their level.
- I was going to replace her.

880
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,950
- Aiki's crew has only one member...
- Right. You should join her crew.

881
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,300
Who should join her crew?

882
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,720
- Jae Suk, you join her crew.
- I should, right?

883
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,730
- Then I'll join Aiki's crew.
- That sounds reasonable. Okay.

884
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,340
Aiki, you have
the right to reject him.

885
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,340
- Pardon?
- She can reject you.

886
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,040
- Aiki can reject him.
- That's great.

887
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,430
- Do I have the right to refuse?
- Yes, of course.

888
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,880
You have the right to reject me.

889
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,470
Then let me decide
after So Min chooses her new crew.

890
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,470
Okay.

891
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,970
If she chooses Aiki's crew,
Aiki will have to choose between us.

892
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,120
I don't think So Min was going to
join Aiki's crew.

893
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,480
- Aiki.
- Oh, I see.

894
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,090
One, two, three.

895
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,120
I choose Aiki's crew.

896
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,180
(So Min chose Aiki's crew as well.)

897
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,180
All right. It's up to you.

898
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,130
Aiki, please pick one of them.

899
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,150
Well, I'm personally acquainted
with Hye In, so even if she...

900
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,460
Don't drop the honorifics.
She's our dance teacher.

901
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,870
- Hye In and I call each other.
- Be respectful to her.

902
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,130
- Hye In is Aiki's real name.
- Yes.

903
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,870
- I choose...
- Yes. Go ahead.

904
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,340
I...

905
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,930
- value actions more than words.
- Right.

906
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,740
- Instead of the talkative Jae Suk,
- Yes.

907
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,510
I'll choose So Min.

908
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,780
(She chose So Min.)

909
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,580
We'll show the power of women.

910
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,880
- That's great.
- Women can do it!

911
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,180
- The power of women!
- That's funny.

912
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,710
- That's really funny.
- He got rejected.

913
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,480
He's pretending that he's okay.

914
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,790
- He's upset.
- He's hiding his feeling.

915
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,290
- Nice, Aiki!
- That's funny.

916
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,260
- Hey.
- She hates a man who's all talk.

917
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,070
- She hates a man who's all talk.
- That was good.

918
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,070
- Let me just...
- Aiki is really funny.

919
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,700
It's not because of her choice.
I'm just feeling hot.

920
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,610
How about you form a one-person team
as Honey Jae Suk?

921
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,510
- I don't want to.
- What do you say?

922
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,010
- Jae Suk, you said...
- Right?

923
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:57,010
- that you wanted to join my crew.
- Yes.

924
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,440
- That's right.
- I remember that.

925
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,350
But in her crew...
I mean, I really like Lee Jung,

926
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,640
- Look who are sitting on her sides.
- but on her sides,

927
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,850
those two are...

928
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,020
- We can have four members.
- Exactly.

929
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,480
I really want to join her crew.

930
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,820
- Then...
- Okay.

931
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,590
- I'll join Monika's crew.
- Join our crew.

932
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,860
Monika, will you accept him?

933
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,650
- Well... I will...
- Yes?

934
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,360
- accept him. Join us, you poor man.
- Okay.

935
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,370
- Monika!
- It's better than joining them.

936
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,960
Hellucca, Monika.

937
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,960
(Hellucca, Monika.)

938
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,070
- Before we begin the first round...
- Yes.

939
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:27,580
As you know, all the contestants
on SWF had unique stage names.

940
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,280
The seven members have to decide
their stage names before we begin.

941
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,580
- Sounds fun.
- Okay.

942
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,550
Come up with your stage names.

943
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,020
We need a stage name as a dancer.

944
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,980
- Names that end with "Jung"?
- Sounds great.

945
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,680
- Like my name Lee Jung...
- I'll go by Velvet Dress Ok Jung.

946
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,410
That's a great name.

947
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,090
I'll go by Gym Jung.

948
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,590
(Lee Jung's crew: Velvet Dress Ok Jung,
Lee Jung, Gym Jung)

949
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,800
I hate his name Honey Jae Suk.

950
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,890
Your name is Get Off Work Yi Hwang.

951
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,870
- I'm Ai-dol.
- Come on.

952
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,370
- It should be Dol-ai as in lunatic.
- Maybe that's her intention.

953
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:54,600
Let me explain
about the first round...

954
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:57,370
- of this ruthless competition.
- Okay.

955
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,610
It's No Respect Underdog Quiz.

956
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,970
- Okay.
- Okay.

957
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,880
- I'll show no respect.
- No Respect Underdog Quiz.

958
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,410
The leader of each crew will
take turns competing.

959
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,590
And they'll point out an underdog
on each of the other crews.

960
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,380
The 3 players including the 2
that a leader chose...

961
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,090
- will have a quiz contest.
- A quiz contest?

962
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,760
That is, when it's Monika's turn,

963
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,150
she has to pick one
from each of the other crews.

964
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,150
- Got it.
- Yes.

965
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,470
There will be only three rounds.

966
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,360
I want to compete with Aiki
and Get Off Work Yi Hwang.

967
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,430
- Okay.
- I'm up for competing with anyone.

968
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,840
Listen to the question.

969
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,380
The first one to press the buzzer
gets to answer.

970
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,030
You get five points
if you get the question right.

971
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,680
- Five points?
- Great.

972
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,950
If you don't know
the correct answer,

973
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,550
- pick up the battle sign.
- I see.

974
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,990
If 2 or more out of the 3 players
pick up the sign,

975
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,760
Name Tag Elimination begins
right away.

976
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,930
- Name Tag Elimination?
- I see.

977
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,820
- Not a dance battle?
- If you take off a name tag,

978
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,950
- you get two points.
- Okay.

979
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,450
I'll probably pick up the sign
every time I play.

980
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:55,590
(They can get points even if they're
not good at quizzes.)

981
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,760
I'll pick up the sign
no matter what.

982
00:34:56,890 --> 00:35:00,990
One more thing. In order to make
Name Tag Elimination fair,

983
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,240
we'll replace the guys' names tags
with larger ones.

984
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,970
- Okay.
- Please replace them now.

985
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,970
Then we'll have a chance.

986
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,680
- But I lost when I had a small one.
- It's really big.

987
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,070
The first leader to play is...

988
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,780
Lee Jung.

989
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,990
- All right!
- Lee Jung!

990
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,860
- She's so cool.
- Lee Jung!

991
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,780
Lee Jung, please choose one person
that you think is an underdog...

992
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,680
from each of the other crews.

993
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,320
Point that person
and say, "I choose you."

994
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,820
The person that I think
is an underdog is...

995
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,720
- Go ahead.
- Come on.

996
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,820
(Come on!)

997
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,640
If she watched Running Man often,
she would know...

998
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,510
who the Empty Heads are.

999
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,800
(There are a few easy choices.)

1000
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,110
(Get Off Work Yi Hwang, Empty Head!)

1001
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,380
- We're all powerhouses here.
- There are a few empty heads.

1002
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,970
I'll first choose
Get Off Work Yi Hwang.

1003
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,240
(Get Off Work Yi Hwang
from Monika's crew.)

1004
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,970
All right.

1005
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,590
Look at him.

1006
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,950
- Okay!
- Next,

1007
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,360
I'll choose Ai-dol.

1008
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,220
All right, bring it on.

1009
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,130
Yes, okay. She chose Ai-dol.

1010
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,530
Come on!

1011
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,090
Get Off Work Yi Hwang, are you good?

1012
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,890
- Unbelievable.
- Go, Lee Jung.

1013
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,390
The first category...

1014
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,140
- is a quiz on people
- Okay, you've got this.

1015
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,240
- People!
- You'll see the photos...

1016
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,200
of two people...

1017
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,240
and guess their names.

1018
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,450
- Goodness.
- You can do this.

1019
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,380
You'll see one from either side.

1020
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,680
Oh, no.

1021
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,220
- Round one.
- Give us a foreigner.

1022
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,010
Losing against them
means you hit rock bottom.

1023
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,890
Must you put it like that?

1024
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,160
- Good luck.
- Let's go!

1025
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,530
Round one.

1026
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,450
Go!

1027
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,760
(The photos of round one)

1028
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,630
Of course, you know them.

1029
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,070
Three, two...

1030
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,970
- Audrey Hepburn.
- No!

1031
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,530
That's not her.

1032
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,800
She...

1033
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,180
- Please keep quiet.
- She's about my age.

1034
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,280
- I know who they are.
- She's about my age.

1035
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,050
- I don't know who she is.
- You can't give them any clues.

1036
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,700
- I only know the movie.
- You don't know her?

1037
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,780
- Then the other one...
- I don't know her.

1038
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,280
- Yes, but no.
- You know them, but not her?

1039
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,320
Isn't she Audrey Hepburn?

1040
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,550
- No.
- Of course not.

1041
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,950
I have never seen her in my life.

1042
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,320
- Really?
- Never.

1043
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,180
- It's understandable.
- She's about my age now.

1044
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,630
Really?
But I haven't seen her before.

1045
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,950
Se Chan and So Min should know her.

1046
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,260
Of course, they should.

1047
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,800
All I remember is the movie.

1048
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,130
Let me answer.

1049
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,220
Demi Moore.

1050
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,530
And the two on the right.

1051
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,590
The Wright brothers.

1052
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,030
- Okay!
- Nice!

1053
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,570
(Get Off Work Yi Hwang is correct.)

1054
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,570
He got this right?

1055
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,680
(Roaring)

1056
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,450
(He celebrates on
his invisible motorcycle.)

1057
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,950
Guys, let's go.

1058
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,010
Come on!

1059
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,570
(A delighted Honey Jae Suk
gets on behind him.)

1060
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,220
(They run wild
only after one round.)

1061
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,320
This is great.

1062
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,490
- Okay.
- I'm shocked.

1063
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,280
I knew the Wright brothers.
It wasn't even hard.

1064
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,220
Monika's crew
is in the lead with five points.

1065
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,430
I can't believe Empty Head
scored big time.

1066
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,160
Show them some trending celebrities.

1067
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,470
- Here are the next photos.
- If you don't know...

1068
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,200
Them...

1069
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,260
Who's that guy?

1070
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,510
Isn't he...

1071
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,510
- Just shout out names.
- Think Europe.

1072
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,880
- Shout out the names you know.
- He's...

1073
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,910
You know...

1074
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,840
I am sure you know who they are.

1075
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,820
Who is that on the left?

1076
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,180
Is he Steve Jobs?

1077
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,550
- He...
- Just shout out any name.

1078
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,890
Isn't he a very famous tailor?

1079
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,090
- Who could it be?
- Just shout out names.

1080
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,220
Oh, I know.

1081
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,590
Here's your clue.

1082
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,550
- He's in the film industry.
- That's right.

1083
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,390
- That's right.
- Aren't I right?

1084
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,070
- Okay.
- Yes, that's right.

1085
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,860
Steven Stielberg.

1086
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,990
- What?
- Seriously?

1087
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,490
Are you kidding me?

1088
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,070
- Who's Steven Stielberg?
- Isn't that his name?

1089
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,140
Was he wrong?

1090
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,660
- Stielberg.
- It's not Stielberg.

1091
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,740
- Stielberg.
- Steven...

1092
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,280
Steven Spielberg...

1093
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,470
and Shakespeare.

1094
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,300
What is Shakespeare's full name?

1095
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,720
You need to know that?

1096
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,610
He's Shakespeare.

1097
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:36,990
- He...
- Shakespeare.

1098
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,510
- How about Wolfgang?
- What is it?

1099
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,160
- Give the full name.
- Full name?

1100
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,590
Let me answer. Steven...

1101
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,130
- Stielberg.
- Incorrect.

1102
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,490
Seriously?

1103
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,550
Jung will answer.

1104
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,260
Steven Spielberg...

1105
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,800
and Wolfgang Shakespeare.

1106
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,970
She actually said, Wolfgang!

1107
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,070
Seriously?

1108
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,140
- Is that wrong?
- She heard you earlier.

1109
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,760
- Is that wrong?
- I was only kidding.

1110
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,800
- Is that wrong?
- That's Mozart's name.

1111
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,800
- Come on!
- I was trying to confuse So Min.

1112
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,240
Who is Bolbbalgan?

1113
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,470
Bolbbalgan?

1114
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,140
- Se Chan.
- Did you hear him just now?

1115
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,280
Bolbbalgan Shakespeare.

1116
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,820
He said Bolbbalgan.

1117
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,320
Bolbbalgan?

1118
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,010
Didn't you say it was Wolfgang?

1119
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,390
- What's his full name?
- I have no idea.

1120
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,180
- Do you need a clue?
- Yes.

1121
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,630
Give us the first letter.

1122
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,320
- It starts with a W.
- W!

1123
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,220
- Then I'm right.
- Let me answer.

1124
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,820
William Shakespeare.

1125
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,970
She heard you.

1126
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,860
- She heard you.
- That's too bad.

1127
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,510
Unbelievable.

1128
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,860
- It's coming to me now.
- W!

1129
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,200
I can't believe that
the young Lee Jung...

1130
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,950
thought Wolfgang
was the right answer.

1131
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:36,950
She was fooled.

1132
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,700
- I had no idea.
- You shouldn't have said it.

1133
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,780
- This was a minefield.
- I had no idea.

1134
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,910
Isn't Wolfgang
a name of a steakhouse?

1135
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,740
I can't believe
she stepped on that mine.

1136
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,680
Just so you know,

1137
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,260
Ji Hyo and Aiki...

1138
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,510
weren't saying a thing.

1139
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,820
Why aren't you helping her?

1140
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,180
They must be a stickler for rules.

1141
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,430
Is this because
you don't know the rules?

1142
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,720
- We're not supposed to help.
- That's right.

1143
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,590
Go, Ai-dol!

1144
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,300
- Ai-dol is in last place.
- You can do this.

1145
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,700
- Okay!
- Oh, no.

1146
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,140
- So Min is in last place.
- Go, Ai-dol!

1147
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,470
The next category is...

1148
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,760
Chinese idioms.

1149
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,470
Nice. Are we supposed
to say what they mean?

1150
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,930
You'll see two Chinese idioms...

1151
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,680
- which you'll read.
- Se Chan,

1152
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,570
- you've been studying up.
- Here we go.

1153
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,740
You studied these.

1154
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,220
- Here we go.
- You studied these.

1155
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,010
Of course, they don't know this.

1156
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,320
- I'm clueless right now.
- Don't you know these?

1157
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,410
- These...
- This one's easy.

1158
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,360
They're both easy.

1159
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,590
(Yelling)

1160
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,630
That wouldn't be ilseokyijo.

1161
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,590
There's no "yi."

1162
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,700
I know one of them.

1163
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,860
- Go ahead then.
- Ilseokyijo...

1164
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,470
and namnambuknyeo.

1165
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,660
One of them is wrong.

1166
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,110
Ilsacheonri...

1167
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,340
and namnambuknyeo.

1168
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,610
(Ilsacheonri, Namnambuknyeo)

1169
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,510
(Se Chan is correct once again.)

1170
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,110
- You...
- I'm seeing you differently.

1171
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,570
(The rise of Empty Head)

1172
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,970
Monika, help him along.

1173
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,450
(They celebrate with a move
from the 90s.)

1174
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,910
Receive and send.

1175
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,110
Okay.

1176
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,240
I made an educated guess.

1177
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,360
- That...
- Ilsacheonri.

1178
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,450
I can't believe that was it.

1179
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,930
How did you know it was ilsacheonri?

1180
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,450
I knew "il," so I guessed the rest.

1181
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,030
- Of course.
- I knew at least one of them.

1182
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,220
Ilsacheonri, ilseokyijo,

1183
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,200
or ilpamanpa.

1184
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,990
In this next round, Aiki is up.

1185
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,530
Please point out an underdog.

1186
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,430
- We at least got a lot of points.
- Aiki.

1187
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,860
- You were amazing.
- You did it.

1188
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,070
But I'm the worst at quizzes.

1189
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,380
Aiki, you're up.

1190
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,550
Come on.

1191
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,970
- Here we go.
- Go, Aiki.

1192
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,340
Choose me as your opponent.

1193
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,110
The underdog I'll go up against...

1194
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,220
- Sure.
- Go ahead.

1195
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:28,760
(Who will she choose
to compete against?)

1196
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,950
Se Chan, get out here!

1197
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,990
(Even after the first round,
he still seems like the dumbest.)

1198
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,030
But why?

1199
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,700
- Seriously?
- You're on a roll though.

1200
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,800
Haha, come on out!

1201
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,300
(She points to Haha
in Lee Jung's crew.)

1202
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,530
- Get out there.
- I...

1203
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,510
Compared to you two,
I'm as smart as Jae Suk.

1204
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,680
- As if.
- Se Chan, you're doing great.

1205
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,010
You're like the Quiz Master.

1206
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,110
- For now...
- Unbelievable.

1207
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,220
Compared to those two,
you're absolutely the smartest.

1208
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,140
You're the smartest.

1209
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,740
- Now...
- She saw...

1210
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,180
- right through Haha.
- But I carried my weight.

1211
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,950
- All right.
- Let's do this.

1212
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,680
- Here we go.
- You can win again.

1213
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,130
- The first category is people.
- Just be cautious.

1214
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,720
- I would've liked current affairs.
- People are the hardest to know.

1215
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,930
- Current affairs?
- Yes.

1216
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,930
Here...

1217
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,360
you go.

1218
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,160
- You know who they are.
- Him... I know him.

1219
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,200
But who's he?

1220
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,180
Beethoven!

1221
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,340
- No.
- That's not who he is.

1222
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,340
Macron.

1223
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,640
(Macron)

1224
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,910
- Shin...
- Lee Kwang Soo.

1225
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,390
(Macron, Lee Kwang Soo)

1226
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,550
Doesn't it look like him?

1227
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,820
It does.

1228
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,220
He does look like Kwang Soo.

1229
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,320
He looks like Kwang Soo.

1230
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,890
Macron.

1231
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,720
I doubt that's Freddie Mercury.

1232
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,930
He has short hair!

1233
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,200
But they look alike.

1234
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,090
- Isn't that Freddie Mercury?
- Your boyfriend is hilarious.

1235
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,630
He's witty, isn't he?

1236
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,570
- Who could it be?
- You all know these famous people.

1237
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,640
- Famous?
- They're famous?

1238
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,930
I have no idea.

1239
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,510
He got a perm.

1240
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,570
- A perm?
- Who could it be?

1241
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,700
Can we get a clue?

1242
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,140
He's not an artist.

1243
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,780
- Not an artist.
- Then a scientist.

1244
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,010
Macron.

1245
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,320
and Newton.

1246
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,720
What's his full name?

1247
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,990
- What?
- Hold on.

1248
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,180
(Hold on.)

1249
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,720
He barely knows Newton, and you...

1250
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,910
His name is Illegal, darn it!

1251
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,390
As in an illegal U-turn.

1252
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,280
(Illegal Newton?)

1253
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,030
- What?
- An illegal U-turn?

1254
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,160
Why am I supposed
to say the full name?

1255
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,360
It got me in the last round.

1256
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,490
Newton...

1257
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,430
It begins with an I.

1258
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,340
- I...
- Let me answer.

1259
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,410
- Haha?
- He knows.

1260
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,430
- He knows.
- He remembers.

1261
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,530
Three, two...

1262
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,340
Adams Newton.

1263
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,200
Macron and Acne Newton.

1264
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,780
- Go with iPhone.
- No, don't.

1265
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,680
Arsen Newton and Macron.

1266
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,280
- It's iPhone.
- No, it's not.

1267
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,550
- Macron.
- Yes?

1268
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,550
He said it was iPhone Newton.

1269
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,680
(He said it was iPhone Newton.)

1270
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,130
- Aiki would've been better.
- Yes, iPhone.

1271
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,820
- Okay, I got it.
- Haha?

1272
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,050
- Aisep Newton.
- What?

1273
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:49,490
- No, that's not it.
- Macron and Issaac.

1274
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,700
- No.
- That's not it.

1275
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,860
Macron and Aisop Newton.

1276
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,390
- No.
- I got it. It's Ice.

1277
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,030
Let me answer. Macron and Eisher.

1278
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,200
No, that's not it.

1279
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,740
Macron and Icy Newton.

1280
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,970
- No.
- Let me answer!

1281
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:05,240
Isaac Newton and Macron.

1282
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,680
- Okay!
- Nicely done.

1283
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,740
- Yes!
- It was Isaac.

1284
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,550
- I said Issaac.
- They sound similar.

1285
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,320
- It's Isaac.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1286
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,450
- I!
- I should've gone with combat.

1287
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,720
Tell me about it.

1288
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,720
- I've never heard of that name.
- That was a hard one.

1289
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,930
- Isaac was a hard one.
- I have never heard of that name.

1290
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,320
It's about time...

1291
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,300
you paid the show
for its classes and lessons.

1292
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,820
- What I know, I learned here.
- They come here to study.

1293
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,800
- That's right.
- Pay at least 50 dollars a month.

1294
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,200
Aiki hasn't been receiving...

1295
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,140
any help from her teammates.

1296
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,280
I'm sorry.

1297
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,240
The next category is Things.

1298
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,240
Things?

1299
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,640
- Get ready.
- They must be in English.

1300
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,470
Cue.

1301
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,950
What are those?

1302
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,050
That...

1303
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,160
- We always eat that with raw fish.
- Exactly.

1304
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,760
- What's that called?
- An open balloon.

1305
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,950
- An open balloon?
- Open?

1306
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,320
What is that called?

1307
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,800
- What do you call it?
- Radish sprouts...

1308
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,630
and an event balloon.

1309
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:59,070
(Incorrect)

1310
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,200
She's right about
the radish sprouts.

1311
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:01,760
And those balloons
are used at events.

1312
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,470
Okay, this must be a brain teaser.

1313
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,110
What balloon?

1314
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,930
(What balloon?)

1315
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,450
That was clever of you.

1316
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,470
- It should be the correct answer.
- Radish sprouts sound like "what."

1317
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:12,840
- What balloon?
- A brain teaser!

1318
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,380
This is in English.

1319
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,010
- It's an English term.
- English?

1320
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,110
- Really?
- I hate English spellings.

1321
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,320
Consider dance or dancing.

1322
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:22,660
Giant dancing?

1323
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,090
Air dancer.

1324
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,360
- Air dancer?
- Air dance.

1325
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,530
What on earth is that?

1326
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:28,590
Dancing air.

1327
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:30,030
What?

1328
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,130
What on earth is that?

1329
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,990
Wave air.

1330
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:36,530
Combat.

1331
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,860
What?

1332
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,160
A match.

1333
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,380
(They're having a match.)

1334
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:42,470
A match.

1335
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:45,510
That was funny.

1336
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,410
No!

1337
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,610
- Stop it.
- Rip it.

1338
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,050
- Aiki.
- Be careful.

1339
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,280
Let's get rid of him first.

1340
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,320
Let's get rid of him first, Aiki.

1341
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,280
- Why me?
- This is so messed up.

1342
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,390
- Haha.
- You can beat him.

1343
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:59,490
That's great.

1344
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:00,700
- Just lie down.
- That's good.

1345
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,700
(Laughing)

1346
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,760
- Haha, go easy on her.
- He doesn't go easy on her.

1347
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,990
He doesn't go easy on her.

1348
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:10,610
- He's too harsh on her.
- He's not easy on her.

1349
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,200
He's never easy on women.

1350
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,030
He's too harsh on her.

1351
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,610
- He's so...
- Aiki, you can do it!

1352
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,740
Aiki!

1353
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,720
He's too harsh on her.

1354
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,890
Aiki, put your legs around his neck.

1355
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,550
Hey!

1356
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,910
(She tries to capture Haha alive.)

1357
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:28,320
She got him.

1358
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,660
She can do that
because she's flexible.

1359
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,490
I really want to beat him.

1360
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:33,590
Please...

1361
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,700
- Get up, Aiki!
- She's good.

1362
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,390
Get up!

1363
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:39,860
- Why is she so strong?
- You're good!

1364
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,930
- You got it.
- You got him!

1365
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:42,640
Let's go, Aiki!

1366
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,240
- Aiki!
- Aiki, we hope you win!

1367
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,240
- She's very athletic.
- Get up!

1368
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,970
Get up, Aiki!

1369
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,030
(The match between the little ones
is more dynamic than they thought.)

1370
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,140
Hold on.

1371
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,510
(Screaming)

1372
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,280
(Aiki squeezes Haha's joints.)

1373
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,340
- Hey.
- Hey!

1374
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,240
- That's an armbar.
- Give up!

1375
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,220
- Give up.
- The game is getting dirty.

1376
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,430
- She's amazing.
- My gosh, she's...

1377
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:05,680
Hey, I can't breathe!

1378
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,890
- Give up.
- Use your feet.

1379
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,130
- Use your feet, Aiki.
- She's reaching for it.

1380
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,220
- She got it.
- There you go.

1381
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,970
That's it.

1382
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:15,430
Use the other hand also.

1383
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:17,030
- Poor Haha.
- Don't go easy on her!

1384
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:19,070
(Haha also grabs Aiki's name tag.)

1385
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,910
- Use the other hand!
- Rip her shirt!

1386
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:21,910
(Who is the winner of this tussle?)

1387
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:23,550
- Rip her shirt!
- Use the other hand!

1388
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,720
(Aiki wins!)

1389
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,610
- That was amazing.
- It's okay.

1390
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:31,820
She was amazing.

1391
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,950
Gosh, Haha.
You only embarrassed yourself.

1392
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:35,990
(His performance was horrible.)

1393
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,260
- She's really strong though.
- What was that?

1394
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,590
The only thing I'm good at
is using my strength.

1395
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,160
- Well done.
- She's really strong.

1396
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,990
- You're the best.
- That was incredible.

1397
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,030
- Let's have another one.
- That was a match in good faith.

1398
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,300
- Sorry about that.
- You fought well.

1399
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:49,970
Good work.

1400
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:52,160
- Now,
- We have to stick that back, right?

1401
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,680
Monika will point out...

1402
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,070
two underdogs.

1403
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:58,240
All right. Let's go, Monika!

1404
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,880
- She's good.
- Let's go, Director Monika!

1405
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,220
- Let's go, Professor Monika!
- Let's go!

1406
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,410
I think Aiki is...

1407
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,450
The person I can beat...

1408
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,390
is Ji Hyo.

1409
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:08,450
All right!

1410
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,180
- All right.
- Show it to them.

1411
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,820
- You can beat her.
- All right.

1412
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,800
- She's been studying recently.
- Let's go.

1413
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:16,360
- She's been studying.
- And...

1414
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:19,300
I heard there was
something going on...

1415
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,860
- between these two.
- Oh, really?

1416
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,110
No, that's not true.
There's nothing going on.

1417
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,430
I'll try to come in...

1418
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:25,430
- between them.
- All right!

1419
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:27,910
The person I can beat...

1420
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,110
- is Gym Jung.
- Gym Jung, let's go!

1421
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:33,050
Gym Jung!

1422
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:34,280
I'm Gym Jung!

1423
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,550
- Come on, Gym Jung.
- Yes, I'm Gym Jung.

1424
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:38,890
The race is neck and neck.

1425
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,680
- Let's go, Director Monika!
- Let's go!

1426
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,160
- Don't go easy on her.
- Let's go, big player.

1427
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,280
Aiki's crew is in last place.

1428
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,360
- All right.
- All right.

1429
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,720
Lee Jung's crew is in
the first place.

1430
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,550
- Yes!
- Let's win this, Monika.

1431
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,570
I've never beaten Lee Jung
in a battle.

1432
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,630
So I'll make sure
to beat her this time.

1433
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:55,070
All right.
Here comes the first question.

1434
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:57,840
(Courtesy of Andplus Mediaworks)

1435
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,880
I should get this.

1436
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,180
- I recognize her, but...
- She is...

1437
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,880
Billie Eilish, Sophie Marceau.

1438
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,910
She got it.

1439
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,340
- Yes!
- Yes!

1440
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:09,340
That was fast.

1441
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,280
- I know.
- Yes!

1442
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,390
- All right!
- Yes!

1443
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,660
Let's go!

1444
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,680
- I only recognized Sophie Marceau.
- Right.

1445
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,050
- I didn't know the other one.
- I only recognized Sophie Marceau.

1446
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:19,320
This is so exciting.

1447
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,530
- She got it at once.
- Let's go!

1448
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:24,990
Here comes the second question.

1449
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:29,800
That's...

1450
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,070
- How are we supposed to guess?
- Tell us their full names.

1451
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:32,970
- Let me answer. That's Trump's...
- The one on the left...

1452
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,970
(Surprised)

1453
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,050
Trump's wife.

1454
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,570
- Let me answer!
- Come on!

1455
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:39,610
You can't do that.

1456
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:40,820
Then you can call the other one
a tennis player.

1457
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:42,570
She is Trump's wife, isn't she?

1458
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:44,140
She is Trump's wife, but...

1459
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,510
- Trump's wife?
- Trump's wife? That was funny.

1460
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,390
Let me answer. Mrs. Trump.

1461
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:50,030
Mrs. Trump?

1462
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,130
You need to say her name.

1463
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:53,300
Jong Kook,
listen to their answers first.

1464
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,390
- As long as they don't call for it.
- Ask for a match,

1465
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,490
rip Monika's name tag,

1466
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:56,660
and get yours ripped by Ji Hyo.

1467
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,300
- And then hug her.
- I'm not sure of her name.

1468
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:00,140
Hug her.

1469
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,030
- He's going for it.
- Say whatever comes to your mind.

1470
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:03,340
He asked for a match.

1471
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,570
If one of you asks for it,
you'll have a match.

1472
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,430
They can have a match
if one more person asks for it.

1473
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,640
I have no idea.

1474
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,780
Gosh, this is...

1475
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,970
It's a match.

1476
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,610
- Are you asking for a match?
- She held it up.

1477
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,180
- No, I didn't...
- Go for it!

1478
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,340
It's a match.

1479
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,910
Darn it. What's happening?

1480
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:19,240
Did you ask for it?

1481
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,390
- Hold on.
- Just so you know,

1482
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:21,990
Monika is really competitive.

1483
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:24,550
Go for it, Ji Hyo.
Monika, go for it.

1484
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:25,660
(Is Monika, the competitive one,
attacking first?)

1485
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,990
He's so scary!

1486
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,590
- No...
- He's so scary!

1487
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,220
(Every guest dreams of ripping
Jong Kook's name tag.)

1488
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,490
This is...

1489
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,890
He's so scary!

1490
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,030
(Screaming)

1491
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,470
- What was that?
- She's got fast footwork.

1492
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,300
- She's got fast footwork.
- She does.

1493
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,140
- Just hug him.
- Gym Jung!

1494
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,010
Gym Jung!

1495
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,340
- Wait, I will...
- Hold on.

1496
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,470
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

1497
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:49,840
You're not even willing to
rip his name tag.

1498
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,840
- That's not true.
- My gosh.

1499
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,510
(She attacks him suddenly...)

1500
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,720
(while pretending
not to be interested in it.)

1501
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:58,550
She just went for it.

1502
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:00,030
She was really fast.

1503
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,300
That was really fast.

1504
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,430
- She's really quick.
- While I was talking here...

1505
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:04,890
Monika!

1506
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,660
Over here. Rip her name tag.

1507
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,260
Right. I need to rip her name tag.

1508
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,110
- I'm sorry.
- Ji Hyo is really strong.

1509
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,110
It's not that.

1510
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,840
- Because our team is losing...
- Exactly.

1511
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,410
- Because we're losing...
- You can do it, Ji Hyo!

1512
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:15,880
You're saying
you won't go easy on her, right?

1513
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,450
- Let's go, Ai-hyo.
- Please beat Ji Hyo.

1514
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,470
Shall we get started?

1515
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,410
Rip it! Go!

1516
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,220
- Let's go!
- Let's go, Ai-hyo!

1517
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,910
- That's it!
- Ai-hyo!

1518
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,550
You have a really strong grip.

1519
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:32,130
- Rip it! Rip it, Monika!
- Monika is strong too.

1520
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:33,630
- And she's fast too.
- Monika is fast.

1521
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:36,200
(Monika watches for a chance
with her speed.)

1522
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,860
- She's really fast.
- Don't show your back to her.

1523
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,160
She's fast.

1524
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,260
Everything she does
looks like a dance move.

1525
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,590
Monika, you'll lose all your energy
at this rate!

1526
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:42,800
Everything she does
looks like a dance move.

1527
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,410
- She's done.
- She's really fast.

1528
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:46,970
You need to rip it
for the game to be over.

1529
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:50,470
(Right then, Monika attacks her
after finding an opening.)

1530
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:54,050
(Will she beat Ji Hyo as well?)

1531
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,510
(Ripping)

1532
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,550
(Ai-hyo wins!)

1533
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,220
(Ai-hyo's power suppresses
Monika's speed.)

1534
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,950
She's indeed amazing.

1535
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,760
You can't win against her.

1536
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,930
You just can't.

1537
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,260
Monika was really fast too.

1538
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,700
- She was really fast.
- I know.

1539
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,360
- She's unrivaled.
- It was really fun though.

1540
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,140
- You did really well.
- It feels like we won though.

1541
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,410
It feels like
we got the most questions.

1542
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:20,340
All right, then.
I'll announce the results now.

1543
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,570
The crew in last place...

1544
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:24,950
has 11 points. It's Aiki's crew.

1545
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,300
(Aiki's crew comes in last
with 11 points.)

1546
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,010
- All right.
- Who won first place then? Us?

1547
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:29,570
- Did she get many questions right?
- She did, but you didn't.

1548
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:32,050
And the remaining teams
have only a one-point difference.

1549
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,090
Hold on.

1550
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,950
- They must've won.
- No!

1551
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:36,260
- I must beat Lee Jung.
- Monika did really well.

1552
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:37,990
- She ripped Monika's name tag.
- But she ripped Monika's name tag.

1553
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,050
Right.

1554
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:42,160
The crew that came in 1st place
with 25 points...

1555
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:43,260
It's us.

1556
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,260
This is nerve-racking.

1557
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,320
Congratulations.

1558
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,660
- It's Lee Jung's crew.
- Yes!

1559
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,470
(Lee Jung's crew wins 1st place.)

1560
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:55,140
I can't believe I lost
on this show as well.

1561
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:58,200
- Yes!
- Well done. Yes!

1562
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,050
I should be able to beat her here.

1563
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:02,780
It's because you didn't earn
any points.

1564
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,240
I did get some right though.

1565
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,490
So the first battle
of two losing teams...

1566
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:11,030
will be between Aiki's crew
and Monika's crew.

1567
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:12,220
- Yes!
- Bring it on!

1568
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:14,530
- Where are we having it?
- We only need to watch them.

1569
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:15,630
All right!

1570
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,130
Yes, we're watching it live.

1571
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,130
We won't go easy on you.

1572
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:21,570
Everyone. Let me tell you
the rules of the battle.

1573
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:23,140
The two losing crews
of the previous mission,

1574
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,340
Aiki's crew and Monika's crew,

1575
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,930
will have a dance battle
against each other...

1576
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,680
with the number of penalty badges
at stake.

1577
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,700
- All right!
- All right!

1578
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,200
The leaders
will go against each other.

1579
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,050
- The leaders will go first...
- And there will be a group battle.

1580
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:36,320
The winning crew, Lee Jung's crew,
will be fight judges.

1581
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,090
The winner from this battle
will receive one penalty badge.

1582
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,410
- The losing crew will get three.
- All right.

1583
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,280
So we're the judges.

1584
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,280
That's right.

1585
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:46,050
- I'm judging them.
- All right.

1586
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,200
Yes!

1587
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,300
(Lee Jung's crew is excited
that they get to judge.)

1588
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:50,430
I think we need to be more brazen.

1589
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:53,300
We need to be more confident.
They're very confident.

1590
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,340
They're very confident.

1591
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,430
- That's true.
- So we need to be more confident.

1592
00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:01,780
Also, we need to make a routine...

1593
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,200
to get the start on them.

1594
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,070
- Which way should we go first.
- We will...

1595
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,720
go from left to right.

1596
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,720
(Practicing the routine dance
that'll be used in the battle)

1597
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,910
I'm confident
because I'm a good dancer.

1598
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,860
Change your expression
after dancing for a bit.

1599
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:15,780
You can keep repeating it.

1600
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:17,280
Let's go to the judges' seat.

1601
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,490
- All right.
- This is the judges' seat?

1602
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,030
- BoA sits in the middle.
- Is this the judges' seat?

1603
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:22,220
- Hello, I'm the fight judge.
- All right.

1604
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:23,930
Aiki's crew, bring it on.

1605
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:26,530
(Aiki's crew
enters with confidence.)

1606
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:28,360
What do we do, Aiki?

1607
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,430
- Why?
- What?

1608
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,570
- They have too many people.
- No.

1609
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,030
The number of people doesn't matter.

1610
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,340
(Right then,)

1611
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,680
(Seok32 provokes them.)

1612
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,300
- Why are you hitting me?
- Why else?

1613
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,780
- Hey!
- Hey!

1614
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,240
(Brazen)

1615
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,510
- Don't mess with my sister.
- Yes!

1616
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,990
(The fight judges
like the provocation.)

1617
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,550
He's very aggressive. I like it.
I'll give him additional points.

1618
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,050
- I like it.
- He'll get additional points.

1619
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:50,680
He's very aggressive. I like it.
I'll give him additional points.

1620
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,950
- I like it.
- Hey.

1621
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,200
(Ai-dol fights back.)

1622
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,390
- They'll get additional points.
- I like it.

1623
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:57,220
I like that they're making it tense.

1624
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,260
Let me tell you
the judging criteria.

1625
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,800
The first criterion is newness.

1626
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:03,260
The second criterion is confidence.

1627
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,360
The third criterion is
how entertaining it is.

1628
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,510
Then we don't need to
show off our skills?

1629
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,300
Exactly.
You don't need to dance well.

1630
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,450
When do we show off our skills?

1631
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,910
Are you ready?

1632
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,680
Ready?

1633
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,720
(Judge Velvet Dress Ok Jung)

1634
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,010
- Newness, confidence, and...
- Fight.

1635
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:19,090
Hey!

1636
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,590
(The battle between the leaders
starts with Aiki's attack.)

1637
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:21,680
All right!

1638
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,320
Please...

1639
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,430
I really want to win.

1640
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,760
I really want to win!

1641
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,950
I think this battle alone
will be fun.

1642
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,260
Aiki's crew, bring it on.

1643
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,140
(Battle between two losing teams,
Aiki attacks first.)

1644
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,990
Hey, let's go!

1645
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:47,570
(Here comes Aiki.)

1646
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:50,240
(Get Off Work Yi Hwang's jaw drops.)

1647
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,840
We can just show this much
to get the start on them.

1648
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,170
She's really good.

1649
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,950
- All right.
- Yes!

1650
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,860
Yes!

1651
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,760
She danced more seriously
than I thought, so I was surprised.

1652
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,170
(Startled)

1653
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,530
Oh, my.

1654
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:18,670
(Making use of the floor
at her pleasure)

1655
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,740
- She's really good.
- This is unbelievable.

1656
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,740
She's awesome.

1657
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:25,880
(Provoking Monika
right in front of her)

1658
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:30,470
What is she doing? She's good.

1659
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,050
That was awesome!

1660
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,490
Hey, Monika.

1661
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,690
- Let's pretend we're discussing.
- We need to pretend?

1662
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:42,380
That was cool. Let's pretend
we're discussing how to judge them.

1663
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:43,760
You're doing well.

1664
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,450
Am I dancing to the same song?

1665
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:46,550
(Monika goes up against her.)

1666
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,670
- It's Monika!
- It's Monika!

1667
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:50,300
Hey, it's Monika!

1668
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,300
- Hey!
- Hey.

1669
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,760
(Stealing Jae Suk's hat
on the side)

1670
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,470
What are you, an archer?

1671
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:57,360
All right, calm down, everyone.

1672
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,780
(Judge Velvet Dress Ok Jung)

1673
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:01,150
You can't make me laugh.

1674
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,240
Newness, confidence,
and what was it again?

1675
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,280
How entertaining it is?

1676
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,280
(Monika, Newness, confidence,
and what was it again?)

1677
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,380
How entertaining it is?

1678
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,240
- You can do it. Make it fun.
- I need to make it entertaining?

1679
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,650
Monika!

1680
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:11,780
(Monika's attack that'll satisfy
the judging criteria)

1681
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,590
All right.
I'll make it entertaining.

1682
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:22,090
(Monika's shockingly
entertaining performance)

1683
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:32,670
(Showing off charming dance moves
to attract students for her classes)

1684
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:36,010
Hey! Let's go!

1685
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:37,780
I should dance well.

1686
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,450
Well done!

1687
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:50,690
(Next up is Aiki's crew.)

1688
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,260
- It's your turn!
- Yes.

1689
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,070
- What do I do?
- Get ready!

1690
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:56,860
- In 1, 2, 3, 4.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1691
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:00,840
Are you begging for money or what?

1692
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:02,470
Come on.

1693
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:05,570
That's adorable.

1694
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:06,840
They practiced in advance?

1695
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,240
The two of them looked like
Aiki's sidekicks.

1696
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,050
Shall we get ready too?

1697
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:12,240
- Yes, let's get ready.
- Here we go.

1698
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,950
- Come here.
- Yes.

1699
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:14,950
(The song changes.)

1700
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,690
- Here we go. Get ready.
- What's that?

1701
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:17,690
Get ready.

1702
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,280
(Here we go. Get ready.)

1703
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,450
(They get ready to start
following Monika's lead.)

1704
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:22,490
- They're so cute.
- Here we go.

1705
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:24,090
- All right.
- Go!

1706
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,920
Go!

1707
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,990
(Going this way and that way)

1708
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:29,490
- Go!
- They can't catch up.

1709
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,940
- What are they doing?
- Go!

1710
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:34,300
Go! Yes!

1711
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:36,300
It's all about
teasing your opponent.

1712
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,070
(Get Off Work Yi Hwang, It's all
about teasing your opponent.)

1713
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:40,780
(Aiki's crew doesn't back down.)

1714
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,150
- Show us your skills! Let's go!
- All right!

1715
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,570
(It's Get Off Work Yi Hwang's
turn to show off his skills.)

1716
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:46,510
Let's go! Show it to them!

1717
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,780
(Fancy)

1718
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,320
(Get Off Work Yi Hwang teases them
all he wants.)

1719
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,150
All right!

1720
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:57,220
(Right then)

1721
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:58,920
All right!

1722
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:01,570
(Diving between his legs)

1723
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:02,860
(Ai-dol instantly catches
everyone's eyes.)

1724
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,900
Go for it!

1725
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:06,490
- There you go!
- She just...

1726
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:08,010
How dare she provoke us?

1727
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:09,760
(Ai-dol's provocation
flusters everyone.)

1728
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,880
- How dare she provoke us?
- All right.

1729
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,740
(Next up is a mid-aged man
from an alpine club.)

1730
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:20,150
(The 90s vibe
comes naturally to him.)

1731
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,110
- All right! Come on, Seok Sam.
- Let's go!

1732
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:25,860
- The look in your eyes.
- Do your dance.

1733
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,280
- Do your dance.
- Be creative.

1734
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,450
(Seok32 takes his turn
when the corny part starts to play.)

1735
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,400
Do your dance.

1736
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,920
Do your dance!

1737
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:35,720
Don't do the ridiculous moves.

1738
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,200
(Right when Seok Sam
was showing a ridiculous move...)

1739
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:39,760
Don't do the ridiculous moves.

1740
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,840
(Ai-dol dives for the 2nd time.)

1741
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,970
Why does she keep diving
between our legs?

1742
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:45,570
What was that?

1743
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:47,130
- Hey, you!
- I was really startled.

1744
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:48,280
Isn't that a foul?

1745
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,880
- That was a foul, wasn't it?
- Why does she keep...

1746
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,740
- Why do you keep doing that?
- I was really into it.

1747
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,380
- Well done.
- She's our rising star.

1748
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,420
Well done, Ai-dol.

1749
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:56,420
- It was a total mess.
- It was chaotic.

1750
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,690
I told you to do your dance.

1751
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:01,650
- What? I was about to.
- Your dance.

1752
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:02,860
- She kept diving between my legs.
- You should've done your dance.

1753
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,860
I should've done this move.

1754
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:05,860
You should've done that.

1755
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:10,200
That was a battle between
two world-class crews.

1756
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,240
Let's hear
from the fight judges first.

1757
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,970
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1758
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:17,940
Well, that was
an amazing performance.

1759
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:19,630
Hey.

1760
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:22,550
When it comes to newness,

1761
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,780
I think they dominated it.

1762
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,780
Newness?

1763
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:30,280
(Aiki's crew got a favorable review
from Velvet Dress Ok Jung.)

1764
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,880
My gosh, he's got to be kidding me.

1765
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:35,260
I loved how you dived between their
legs and how confident you were.

1766
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,650
But I think this crew
did really well thanks to Monika.

1767
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:41,670
Se Chan was really entertaining,

1768
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:43,760
- and his moves...
- Entertaining?

1769
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,090
were really refined.

1770
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:49,840
But then again,
there were two who fell behind.

1771
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,070
(There were two who fell behind.)

1772
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:54,780
- Fall behind?
- How could you say that?

1773
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,510
- Why that little...
- What was that?

1774
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:59,010
Well, first of all,

1775
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:01,280
I didn't like how So Min
kept crawling under their legs.

1776
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,780
- Right?
- She interrupted them.

1777
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,280
It's rude to do that
in a dance battle.

1778
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,280
I liked Se Chan's frivolous moves.

1779
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,860
Are you saying that
because you're close to him?

1780
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:12,860
Thank you!

1781
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:15,700
Let me talk about Aiki first.

1782
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:18,260
It was really new.

1783
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,240
- I agree.
- Aiki proved why she's good.

1784
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,400
(Aiki proved why she's good.)

1785
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,530
She proved why she's good.

1786
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:29,280
There was nothing new
about this crew.

1787
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,950
They were all old.
They were like grim reapers.

1788
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,150
- Who are you to say that?
- You're the most boring one.

1789
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:35,380
Who are you to judge?

1790
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,780
- You're the most boring one.
- Darn you.

1791
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:37,950
Stand in line!

1792
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:39,320
(Stand in line!)

1793
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,450
- Attention.
- Attention.

1794
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:43,650
- How did he become such a fossil?
- He thinks he's something.

1795
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:46,030
- He's become such a fossil
- Don't lean on one leg!

1796
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:48,360
He became a fossil
after he turned 40.

1797
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,490
It wasn't new at all.

1798
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:51,090
Now, the fight judges...

1799
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:52,630
- will make their decisions.
- All right.

1800
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,840
Are you going to keep
speaking in that tone?

1801
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:57,130
What's with your tone?

1802
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,110
- This is nerve-racking.
- On the count of three...

1803
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:00,940
Fight judges, card...

1804
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,070
- Please!
- Do we reveal it at the same time?

1805
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,070
- Which crew should I pick?
- Open the card!

1806
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:07,220
(Depending on the result, they'll
get either 3 or 1 penalty badge.)

1807
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,240
Please!

1808
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:10,690
All right!

1809
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,860
(Monika's crew, Aiki's crew)

1810
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:13,860
(Aiki's crew 1, Monika's crew 1)

1811
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,260
- Seriously.
- Please!

1812
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,380
I even lifted my top.

1813
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:19,150
Open the card!

1814
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,860
(Monika's crew)

1815
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:25,260
(Monika's crew wins.)

1816
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,490
- Hey! Yes!
- Hey!

1817
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:28,860
- Hey!
- Hey!

1818
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:32,130
(Monika crew's petty members
show horrible manners.)

1819
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,470
Monika's crew who came in 2nd place
will take 1 penalty badge.

1820
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:38,650
- The losing crew will get three.
- Yes!

1821
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,050
- You said they looked like...
- You did really well, Aiki.

1822
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:41,380
grim reapers!

1823
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:44,650
You did really well. Can you
not be so serious about this?

1824
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:45,880
I'm really serious.

1825
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,190
- Monika's crew gets one,
- I really want to win!

1826
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:49,320
Aiki's crew gets three.

1827
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:51,760
- Stick it on your chest.
- All right.

1828
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,150
Gosh, what a bummer.

1829
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:55,170
We'll move on to the next game.

1830
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:56,260
- Yes!
- Okay!

1831
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,570
This time, you'll play Good Image.

1832
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:02,300
- Good image, good image
- Good image, good image

1833
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,110
It'll be played in the beat
of Strawberry Game.

1834
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,970
A member of an attacking team...

1835
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:10,900
will attack one of you with an image
and a number from 1 to 4.

1836
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:14,420
A member of the defending team
should respond to it...

1837
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:16,050
if they agree with the given image.

1838
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,780
But if the two defending teams
do not respond...

1839
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,190
or respond at the same time,

1840
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:21,720
both teams will lose points.

1841
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:24,090
You got the rules, right?

1842
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:25,860
(Their points will be deducted as
many as the members that responded.)

1843
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,030
It's a game between three teams.

1844
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:31,470
Aiki is upset for real.

1845
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:33,240
- Because they lost?
- Yes.

1846
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,260
We think it's unfair.

1847
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,400
- She's really upset.
- Because I'm really competitive.

1848
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,400
(Will competitive Aiki
avoid going last this time?)

1849
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,400
Let's start.

1850
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:40,570
The attacking team
can attack two teams, right?

1851
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:42,240
Yes, you can attack any team
of your choice.

1852
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,240
But if two people answer
at the same time,

1853
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,510
their points will be deducted as
many as the people that responded.

1854
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:45,780
What if no one responds?

1855
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,950
Then both teams
will get their points deducted.

1856
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,150
- That'll be good too.
- I got it.

1857
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,240
Then we must come up with a way
to attack two teams at once.

1858
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,690
You can't point at your team member
with your chin.

1859
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:55,650
You need to read the room.

1860
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:57,550
Let's start with Honey Jae Suk.

1861
01:03:57,550 --> 01:03:59,450
Okay, I'll go first.

1862
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:02,130
Honey

1863
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,570
- Image
- Image

1864
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:07,570
(They get started.)

1865
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:08,670
- Image
- Image

1866
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,130
- Image
- I

1867
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:13,200
- Good image, good image
- Good image, good image

1868
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,880
Hat, three.

1869
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,280
(Hat, three.)

1870
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:17,570
- Hat...
- Hat...

1871
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:19,670
Thank goodness.

1872
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:23,240
(Ai-hyo and Aiki
answered at the same time.)

1873
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,950
- Well done!
- Yes!

1874
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:26,190
- Yes.
- That was a good one.

1875
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:29,650
(Aiki's crew loses 2 points
from the start.)

1876
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:32,950
Thank goodness I held back.

1877
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:34,670
Both of you were wearing hats.

1878
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,670
- That was a practice round, right?
- No.

1879
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:38,170
- We began right away.
- Really?

1880
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:39,400
It was a good round.

1881
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,530
Aiki is angry for real.
Why don't we let her off this once?

1882
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:42,610
(I am not angry.)

1883
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:43,840
- Haha, it's your turn.
- Okay.

1884
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,570
(Velvet Dress Ok Jung will resume.)

1885
01:04:45,570 --> 01:04:46,740
There he goes.

1886
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,610
There he goes.

1887
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:49,740
I

1888
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:51,380
(Old Fossil Dancer
loves something like this the most.)

1889
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:54,010
(Other wild animals join in.)

1890
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,840
I

1891
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,240
(Panting)

1892
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,990
- Let's go.
- I

1893
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:00,610
Let's go.

1894
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:02,090
- Good image, good image
- Image

1895
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:03,590
- Good image, good image
- Good image, good image

1896
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,400
Children, two.

1897
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,130
(Children, two.)

1898
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:09,920
Hold on.

1899
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,070
- Hey.
- The end.

1900
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:12,340
"Children, two"?

1901
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,490
Both teams will lose a point.

1902
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:15,340
- People with two children.
- Two children.

1903
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,530
- People with two children.
- You said it like a swear word.

1904
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:18,840
It sounded strange.

1905
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,380
- It sounded strange.
- Why?

1906
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:21,610
He said it wrong.

1907
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:22,670
- It made no sense.
- His direction was wrong.

1908
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:23,700
- "Children, two"?
- What's wrong with it?

1909
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,780
- You could have children.
- He said it wrong.

1910
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:27,070
- It made no sense.
- His direction was wrong.

1911
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:28,220
- Children.
- Hold on.

1912
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:29,820
- People with children.
- Let's do this again.

1913
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:31,650
He said it like a swear word
at me and Suk Jin.

1914
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:33,490
It was fine. This is a game.

1915
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:34,690
- It wasn't fine.
- This is a game.

1916
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:38,900
- No!
- This is a game.

1917
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,220
- Hey.
- This is a game.

1918
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:41,700
- Don't use your muscles.
- Why are you making a fuss?

1919
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,030
- Don't push.
- This is a game.

1920
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:44,940
- I mean...
- Hey.

1921
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:46,200
I like this about him.

1922
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:48,300
- This is a game.
- I mean...

1923
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,400
Listen.

1924
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,670
- What was that?
- Hold on.

1925
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:52,400
- Aren't you your mother's child?
- I am my mother's child.

1926
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,970
- Aren't you your father's child?
- I am.

1927
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:55,050
How does it sound like a swear word?

1928
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,170
Aren't you your father's offspring?

1929
01:05:57,170 --> 01:05:58,740
- You are, right?
- That's right.

1930
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:00,650
- Anyone could have answered.
- He said it wrong.

1931
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:02,190
- They should lose a point.
- That's right.

1932
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:03,650
- Seriously.
- No way.

1933
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:04,920
- They messed up.
- No.

1934
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,150
It isn't a swear word.

1935
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,760
- You have the freedom to attack.
- What?

1936
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,860
You have the freedom to attack.

1937
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:11,320
That's right. You are
your mother and father's child.

1938
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:16,260
People are
their parent's children, you punk!

1939
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,860
- What?
- "You punk"?

1940
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:19,090
- "You punk"?
- What was that?

1941
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:20,940
- "You punk"?
- Why did you call us that?

1942
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:22,170
You are your parents' child.

1943
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:23,570
You are, okay?

1944
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:26,170
(He takes care of the three punks.)

1945
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:27,240
You are.

1946
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,970
- Don't say that to the older ones.
- I am so annoyed.

1947
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:30,170
We are our parents' children.

1948
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:32,220
That's right.
We are our parents' children.

1949
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:33,280
All of us are.

1950
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,740
I am so annoyed.

1951
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,840
This time, Seok Sam will go first.

1952
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,050
- Okay.
- Seok Sam.

1953
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:39,260
(Seok Sam will attack
after cooling down.)

1954
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:41,420
- Are you ready to attack?
- Yes.

1955
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,490
He doesn't have the energy
to stall for a long time.

1956
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:47,590
- Good image, good image
- Good image, good image

1957
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:50,970
Very good image

1958
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:53,360
Very good image

1959
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,840
Why do you think
you have a good image?

1960
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,110
Today

1961
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:59,780
Why do you think
you have a good image?

1962
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:02,200
- Here is the thing
- Why do you think

1963
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,740
You have a good image?

1964
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,550
I have a wife, I have a son

1965
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:07,950
(He barely manages to strike back.)

1966
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:09,550
You don't get along with your wife

1967
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:13,190
I get along with my wife

1968
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,880
If married couples
get along too well

1969
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,990
That's a bad thing

1970
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:21,130
(That's a bad thing.)

1971
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:22,820
(Seok Sam gives a life lesson.)

1972
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,530
- That's a bad thing
- Good image, good image

1973
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:27,740
(Seok Sam attacks
after the ad-libbing crisis.)

1974
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:29,570
Woman, two.

1975
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:31,240
Woman, woman.

1976
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:32,610
Protruding mouth, two.

1977
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:34,280
Protruding mouth, protruding mouth.

1978
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:35,780
Beggar, two.

1979
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,340
- B...
- Beggar, beggar.

1980
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:38,720
- Who else said it?
- No.

1981
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:41,150
(The beggar duo is out.)

1982
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:42,380
- No.
- All right.

1983
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:44,010
- I just laughed.
- She just laughed.

1984
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:45,010
- No.
- I just laughed.

1985
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:46,610
- She just laughed.
- She answered.

1986
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:48,380
- No.
- She answered.

1987
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:49,530
She really laughed.

1988
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:51,360
- She laughed.
- She answered.

1989
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,950
- I laughed.
- Haha answered to "Beggar".

1990
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:54,970
- I can't believe it.
- I heard it.

1991
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:57,170
- Beggar.
- I have no money, okay?

1992
01:07:57,170 --> 01:07:59,360
- Do you want to be a beggar?
- Let me off this once.

1993
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:00,940
- No.
- I really laughed.

1994
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:02,940
- She laughed.
- I heard it myself.

1995
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:04,530
- She really laughed.
- I heard it myself.

1996
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:05,900
That counts as an answer.

1997
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,030
- That's right.
- Come on.

1998
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:08,780
- Okay.
- You made it sound like an answer.

1999
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:10,110
- That counts as an answer.
- That's right.

2000
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:11,740
- I want to win!
- Okay.

2001
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:13,880
- Aiki takes on any titles.
- The last game matters the most.

2002
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:15,490
- Okay.
- Everything changes then.

2003
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:16,690
(Lee Jung's crew resumes.)

2004
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:20,920
(They get ready
to sing the Image Song.)

2005
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:23,450
- Gosh.
- Save your energy.

2006
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:26,450
- Good image, good image
- Good image, good image

2007
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:28,470
Ugly one, three.

2008
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:29,570
(Ugly one, three.)

2009
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:31,630
Ugly one, ugly one, ugly one.

2010
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:33,130
Hip-hop beggar, two.

2011
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:35,000
Hip-hop beggar, hip-hop beggar.

2012
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:37,160
(Aiki takes on "Hip-hop beggar".)

2013
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,300
Pants, four.

2014
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:43,870
Why did no one answer?

2015
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,210
(Her attack was successful!)

2016
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:46,320
For goodness' sake.

2017
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,450
Hip-hop beggar
was meant for Haha, not Aiki.

2018
01:08:48,450 --> 01:08:49,490
I am a beggar too.

2019
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:50,540
No!

2020
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:51,790
Hip-hop beggar was meant for Haha.

2021
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:52,790
- I am a beggar too.
- Why did you answer?

2022
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:55,750
Why did you answer?
Hip-hop beggar was meant for Haha.

2023
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:57,790
- I am a reggae beggar.
- It doesn't matter.

2024
01:08:57,790 --> 01:08:59,330
- I am a beggar.
- No.

2025
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:00,550
- For goodness' sake.
- Really?

2026
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:02,920
It was meant for Haha.

2027
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,220
- Hip-hop beggar.
- Are you a reggae beggar?

2028
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:05,370
He is a reggae beggar.

2029
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:07,630
- Monika should go first.
- Monika.

2030
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:09,110
(It's Monika's turn to attack.)

2031
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:10,830
Shake your body left and right

2032
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:12,370
- Shake your body left and right
- Shake your body left and right

2033
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:14,040
- Say ho
- Ho

2034
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,840
(Monika leads the dancers.)

2035
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,500
- Good
- Ho

2036
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,170
- Say ho
- Ho

2037
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:23,410
- Good
- Image

2038
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:24,540
Hold on.

2039
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,290
Mister, stop hitting my thigh.

2040
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:28,190
Mister.

2041
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:29,420
Mister.

2042
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,120
Stop hitting my thigh.

2043
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,700
- It hurts.
- We need to keep going.

2044
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:33,900
For goodness' sake.

2045
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,660
(Get Off Work Yi Hwang is
in danger of an injury.)

2046
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:37,330
Stop hitting my thigh.

2047
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,960
- It hurts.
- We need to keep going.

2048
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,370
Stop it. It hurts.

2049
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:42,210
We need to keep going with Monika.

2050
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:44,130
- It hurts.
- For goodness' sake.

2051
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:45,630
That was great.

2052
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:48,370
- That's the horse-riding dance.
- That's right.

2053
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:50,210
Aiki, why don't you go first
this time?

2054
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:51,540
- Me?
- Aiki.

2055
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,410
Okay.

2056
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:56,790
(Whispering)

2057
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:58,820
(Laughing)

2058
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,160
I swear.

2059
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,410
Okay.

2060
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:05,290
It will work.

2061
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,590
I

2062
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:09,760
(The intro begins
amidst the confusion.)

2063
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:14,960
- Good image, good image
- Good image, good image

2064
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:16,540
Good image, let's go

2065
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:19,870
Impotent, three.

2066
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:23,750
(My goodness.)

2067
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,010
Impotent, three.

2068
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:28,450
(They look around
without knowing what to do.)

2069
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,120
- Impotent, impotent, impotent.
- Impotent.

2070
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,380
(Suk Jin and Se Chan
answer together.)

2071
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:38,920
(Impotent men come forward
at the third turn.)

2072
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,220
I am sorry.

2073
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:43,660
(It's an attack that never fails.)

2074
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:44,960
I am sorry.

2075
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:46,790
- Hurry up.
- I am sorry.

2076
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:49,260
- For goodness' sake.
- I was going to answer.

2077
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,460
- Hey.
- Aren't you going to play?

2078
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,740
Since the last time,
"Impotent" has been mine.

2079
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,970
Then why didn't you answer
right away?

2080
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,170
I was torn.

2081
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,670
You confused the younger ones.

2082
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:58,710
Suk Jin.

2083
01:10:58,710 --> 01:11:00,010
It's not like that.

2084
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:01,370
(It took him two turns
to accept "Impotent".)

2085
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:02,880
- Why are you laughing?
- Suk Jin...

2086
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,160
answers so merrily
whenever "Impotent" comes up.

2087
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,080
- Impotent, four.
- What an attack.

2088
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:10,080
Why does our team get
the worst keywords?

2089
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,420
- Seriously.
- Why...

2090
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:12,790
- Why is that?
- Hey.

2091
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:13,790
Our team answered...

2092
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:16,220
to "Impotent", "Bad breath",
"Protruding mouth",

2093
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:17,960
and "Ugly one".

2094
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,570
Why does our team get
the worst keywords?

2095
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:22,210
- That's so funny.
- Give us an advantage.

2096
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:24,710
Advantage.

2097
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,370
Give us an advantage.

2098
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:28,450
- Advantage.
- It's too much.

2099
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:29,670
- Seriously.
- "Impotent" is...

2100
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:31,470
- his favorite keyword.
- Aiki.

2101
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:33,580
I am so annoyed.

2102
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:35,380
Now,

2103
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:38,750
this round will determine
the winning team.

2104
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:40,620
- Yes.
- This time,

2105
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:42,080
Seok32 will go first.

2106
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,220
Let's go.

2107
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,550
(Seok32's attack will be important.)

2108
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,090
Good image

2109
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:52,070
(He suddenly begins to sing.)

2110
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:55,460
- Good image
- That came out of nowhere.

2111
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:56,630
He is showing us his specialty.

2112
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:57,630
(Suk Jin gets ready to attack
with his old-fashioned beat.)

2113
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:58,970
Good.

2114
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:00,170
- Good.
- He is like an old singer.

2115
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:02,340
Good, good

2116
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:05,710
What's good? The image is

2117
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:08,210
- Good
- He is like Hwang Soo Gwan.

2118
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:10,380
- He sounds similar.
- Hwang Soo Gwan.

2119
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:13,910
- La la la
- I feel so peaceful.

2120
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:15,220
(The melodious intro
moves their hearts.)

2121
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:16,750
- Good image
- Image

2122
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:18,550
(He begins to attack
after his ridiculous specialty.)

2123
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:20,200
Sexy guy, three.

2124
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,370
Sexy guy, sexy guy, sexy guy.

2125
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:25,200
Impotent, two.

2126
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,290
Impotent, impotent.

2127
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:27,700
Sweatshirt, four.

2128
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:28,870
(Sweatshirt, four.)

2129
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:32,830
- Sweatshirt...
- We won.

2130
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:34,170
We won.

2131
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:36,370
We won.

2132
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:37,750
- We won.
- We won.

2133
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:38,840
You won.

2134
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:42,120
(Monika's crew
becomes the final winner!)

2135
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:44,080
We won.

2136
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,620
(6 people who were wearing
a sweatshirt failed to answer.)

2137
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:47,660
(She stomps her feet
because she is so competitive.)

2138
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:48,960
- We won.
- We won.

2139
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:49,960
Let's go.

2140
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,250
(They do the old-fashioned wave
to celebrate their victory.)

2141
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:54,200
- Okay.
- Sweatshirt.

2142
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,400
- All right.
- Okay.

2143
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,660
(Aiki's crew and Lee Jung's crew
enter the dance battle.)

2144
01:12:56,660 --> 01:13:00,870
Let's begin the second dance battle
between the two losing teams.

2145
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:01,940
This is driving me crazy.

2146
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:03,160
(Street Human Fighter)

2147
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:06,240
- Okay.
- This is the last dance battle.

2148
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:10,110
We can do it. I will show you
what a true leader is.

2149
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,120
We will win.

2150
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:13,750
We will win the battle.

2151
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:14,910
Let's go.

2152
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,340
I, Honey Jae Suk,

2153
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:18,620
- will host...
- Honey Jae Suk.

2154
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:19,860
- the dance battle.
- Let's go.

2155
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:22,660
- Let's choose who will go first.
- Okay.

2156
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,090
The team that gets this side
will go first.

2157
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,860
- You are a bit excited, right?
- Yes.

2158
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,500
That's not how you do it.

2159
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,240
(Rolling)

2160
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,210
What are you doing?

2161
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:37,130
- What?
- What?

2162
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:38,780
What are you doing?

2163
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,610
What are you doing?

2164
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:41,830
What? You spin the bottle.

2165
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:43,500
- You spin it like this.
- Yes.

2166
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,370
- Why did he roll it?
- Seriously.

2167
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:46,970
I will spin it.

2168
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:48,210
(He promises
to spin the bottle this time.)

2169
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:52,490
- It's spinning nicely.
- Of course.

2170
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:53,790
I think it will spin forever.

2171
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:55,220
That's how you spin it.

2172
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:57,490
Bam!

2173
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:58,590
Okay.

2174
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:00,500
(Aiki's crew will attack first.)

2175
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,960
You need to take the lead.

2176
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:04,000
- Okay.
- You can't make me laugh.

2177
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:07,260
She is simply cute. She is too cute.

2178
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,740
The leaders will go first.

2179
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:09,760
(Aiki versus Lee Jung)

2180
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:11,910
- Drop the beat!
- Drop the beat!

2181
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,410
(The all-rounder, Aiki goes first.)

2182
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:18,150
Aiki.

2183
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:20,120
You can do it.

2184
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,250
Hey.

2185
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,150
Dance in a cool way.
It's okay to do that.

2186
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:29,490
You are cool.

2187
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:31,420
Hey.

2188
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:33,290
It's cool.

2189
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:34,750
It's too cool.

2190
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,920
(Upon hearing Monika's words,)

2191
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:40,130
(she switches to a silly dance
for variety shows.)

2192
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:41,440
What?

2193
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,610
That's funny.

2194
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:44,160
(Swaying)

2195
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,500
She looks like a tube man.

2196
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,330
(She flaps her arms around
like a tube man.)

2197
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:49,970
She looks cute.

2198
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:51,780
Okay.

2199
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:52,820
Lee Jung.

2200
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:54,170
(Lee Jung's dance comes next.)

2201
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:55,510
This is fun.

2202
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:58,450
How will Lee Jung dance?

2203
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,510
Here it comes. Lee Jung.

2204
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:12,660
(She aggravates Aiki.)

2205
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,440
It isn't funny.

2206
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:16,960
It isn't funny. It looks cool.

2207
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:18,440
It just looks cool.

2208
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:20,040
I know. That's a bit dangerous.

2209
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:25,780
It looks cool.

2210
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,670
(Her dance is perfectly controlled.)

2211
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:30,840
(The tube man reappears.)

2212
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,860
She is a talented dancer.

2213
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:33,910
Lee Jung.

2214
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:36,330
It must be so nice
to be able to dance like that.

2215
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:38,660
(Jealous)

2216
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,830
(She shows her light steps
to the judges.)

2217
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:45,000
You should go again.

2218
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,440
She is so cool.

2219
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,240
Aiki, go again.

2220
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:52,130
Aiki, show us a cool dance.

2221
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:54,280
- Five, six, seven, go.
- A cool dance.

2222
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:04,620
That's so cool.

2223
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:11,550
That's so cool.

2224
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:14,700
(The leaders' battle ends
with the perfect finale.)

2225
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:15,760
The group battles.

2226
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,290
(Lee Jung's crew)

2227
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:19,700
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2228
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,040
Okay.

2229
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:39,010
(Lee Jung summons
the 1st-generation dancers.)

2230
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:46,500
(The old steps of the 90s)

2231
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,030
I really want to win.

2232
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:54,540
(Here comes a street fighter.)

2233
01:16:54,830 --> 01:16:57,330
(The thug wave)

2234
01:16:57,330 --> 01:17:01,040
(He is the original K-dancer
who took the 90s by storm.)

2235
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:03,870
He looks a bit broken.

2236
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:06,750
(The thug wave has
the end-of-the-century vibe.)

2237
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:08,840
He looks a bit sick.

2238
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:10,950
What is that?

2239
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,160
(Showing a b-boying move)

2240
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:21,660
(Is it my turn?)

2241
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:22,700
Haha, let's go.

2242
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:23,830
I will end them.

2243
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:29,940
(He fails to catch the hat.)

2244
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,280
(He does the usual dance
when his plan falls through.)

2245
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:35,800
No.

2246
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:37,210
That won't do.

2247
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:45,010
(He wraps up after doing
a meaningless dance.)

2248
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:46,620
It looks like he is in pain.

2249
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:47,990
It hurts.

2250
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:49,290
Everyone can dance well.

2251
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,920
Aiki's crew, you are up.

2252
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,290
(Is it Latin music?)

2253
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:57,160
(She suddenly transforms.)

2254
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:03,940
(The confident dancer is
in her element.)

2255
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:05,740
- Look at So Min.
- It's funny.

2256
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,540
Lie down.

2257
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:11,300
Lie down.

2258
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,280
Roll.

2259
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:16,620
(She gets the conveyor belt going.)

2260
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:17,690
What is that?

2261
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:21,050
(It's a unique dance
for Latin music.)

2262
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,620
Let's go.

2263
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:26,200
Good job.

2264
01:18:27,330 --> 01:18:29,260
(I don't even know.)

2265
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,760
(The confident dancer
gives a water show.)

2266
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:40,940
(The confident dancer's
good cheer explodes.)

2267
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,170
(Juliana shakes her body
like there is no tomorrow.)

2268
01:18:51,010 --> 01:18:52,010
(Sexy)

2269
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:53,990
- Hey, come on.
- Okay.

2270
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,420
Why are you trying so hard?

2271
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:02,590
(She wraps up
as she shakes off the water.)

2272
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:04,830
- You ripped up the stage.
- That was so funny.

2273
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:06,160
Give them a round of applause.

2274
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,790
She ripped up the stage.

2275
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:09,630
It was a neck-and-neck match.

2276
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:11,210
It was so satisfying.

2277
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:12,800
- Let's give them a big hand.
- They did so well.

2278
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:14,630
Seriously.

2279
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:17,170
Let's hear a few words
from the fight judges.

2280
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:18,450
All right.

2281
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:22,040
Firstly, I have been
in the dance scene for 20 years.

2282
01:19:22,210 --> 01:19:23,620
It was quite shocking.

2283
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:25,990
- He sounds so serious.
- The way she poured water...

2284
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:27,250
Aren't you going to listen?

2285
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:28,550
I am sorry.

2286
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,860
Everyone was doing something else.

2287
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:34,400
- We are judging the performances.
- I am sorry.

2288
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,530
- Why aren't you listening?
- I am sorry.

2289
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:36,660
- I am sorry.
- I am sorry.

2290
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:38,000
We are judging the performances.

2291
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,240
- I am so angry that I can't go on.
- Please go on.

2292
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:44,300
In the dance scene,
an act like pouring water...

2293
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:45,800
is unacceptable.

2294
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,300
- Isn't it what you like?
- Well,

2295
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,780
- it was funny.
- He loved it the most.

2296
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:53,170
Although it was funny,
I focused solely on the dance.

2297
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:55,710
- Didn't you cheer the loudest?
- You loved it.

2298
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:57,190
You cheered the loudest.

2299
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:59,080
It's a different matter.

2300
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,710
When So Min poured water, he went...

2301
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:03,530
(Seok Sam laughed the loudest
since it suited his tastes.)

2302
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:04,830
Cheering is a different matter.

2303
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,330
My score will be based on
the dance alone.

2304
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:09,960
- You will see the score soon.
- Okay.

2305
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,590
It won't be a high score
because of you.

2306
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:12,900
- I am sorry, but...
- Okay.

2307
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:14,740
(Aiki raises her hand.)

2308
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,260
- I am sorry,
- Okay.

2309
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,440
but she was...

2310
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:21,080
the sexiest today.

2311
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:24,300
(She was the sexiest today.)

2312
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:26,970
Hey, don't shake your body.

2313
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:28,990
Only those who have watched
the show would understand...

2314
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:30,840
- why Aiki said that.
- That's right.

2315
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,120
- Really?
- She did the best today.

2316
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,120
- I don't know the background.
- It's a heartwarming saying.

2317
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,380
You are cool.

2318
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:37,550
- You are cool.
- You are very cool.

2319
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:38,960
You are cool, Aiki.

2320
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,420
I told you
that I would focus on the dance.

2321
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:42,250
Mister, your time is up.

2322
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:43,460
She is a professional.

2323
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:46,000
Both teams did very well.

2324
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,570
- Gym Jung danced again.
- Jong Kook.

2325
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:50,370
- Give me bonus points.
- Seriously. He never danced before.

2326
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:51,830
Yes. It was very nice.

2327
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:54,080
We have nothing to say
about the two leaders.

2328
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,210
I love their styles of dance.

2329
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:57,170
It was insane when she did this.

2330
01:20:57,170 --> 01:20:58,800
I am talking right now.

2331
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,950
I am sorry.

2332
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:01,210
I am talking right now.

2333
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:02,750
They are attacking each other.

2334
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,840
Everyone becomes an old fossil
on that chair.

2335
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,380
I am talking right now.

2336
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:08,120
You should listen while we fight.

2337
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,190
Okay.

2338
01:21:09,190 --> 01:21:10,660
How dare you? Listen.

2339
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:12,620
- Go ahead.
- "Listen."

2340
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:14,620
- There should be bribes.
- All right.

2341
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:17,530
We need to judge this
as a variety show segment.

2342
01:21:17,530 --> 01:21:20,960
On variety shows,
we like such challenges.

2343
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,870
- That's right.
- She poured water on her head.

2344
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:25,540
- That's right.
- I can't accept that.

2345
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:28,540
- Water is for drinking.
- I saw something else.

2346
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:31,340
Do you know what?
Ji Hyo stood there and watched.

2347
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:33,670
Do you know what it means?

2348
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:36,650
She wanted to contribute,
but she couldn't go that far.

2349
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,840
I love such moments...

2350
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,690
on a variety show.

2351
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,990
Gym Jong Kook's performance
was nice,

2352
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:45,960
but we need to talk about Haha.

2353
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,220
Haha was so serious about this.

2354
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:48,620
I will give a single comment.

2355
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:50,870
- I will give 2... No, 1 word.
- Give us 1 word.

2356
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:53,940
Moronic.

2357
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,630
He tried to look cool.

2358
01:21:57,710 --> 01:22:00,330
Moronic! I didn't see that coming.

2359
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:02,450
That's the word I use often.

2360
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,670
- It was lousy.
- Lousy.

2361
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:07,950
- It didn't even look cool.
- He should have danced funnily.

2362
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:10,580
- That's all I have to say.
- Okay.

2363
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:13,490
Both teams had a member
who ruined the atmosphere.

2364
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:16,460
Lee Jung's crew had Haha.

2365
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:19,090
He pretended to know
something about hip-hop.

2366
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,500
- Hip-hop.
- He was an eyesore.

2367
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,290
- That's right.
- He pretended to be young.

2368
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:24,000
- Yes.
- He pretended to know...

2369
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,570
all about dancing.

2370
01:22:25,570 --> 01:22:27,940
That made me change the score a bit.

2371
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:31,160
And Aiki's crew had Ai-dol.

2372
01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:33,240
Despite being an actress,

2373
01:22:33,330 --> 01:22:35,840
she gave a water show
like a comedienne at a retreat.

2374
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:37,800
I think highly of it.

2375
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,280
That's right.

2376
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:42,790
I already have the winner
in my mind.

2377
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:43,820
Really?

2378
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:47,320
It was a neck-and-neck match,
but I chose a funnier performance.

2379
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:48,460
- Okay.
- Okay.

2380
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:50,880
- Shall we choose now?
- Okay.

2381
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:52,500
Fight judges.

2382
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,200
(The losing crew will receive
3 penalty badges.)

2383
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,460
Fight judges.

2384
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,330
- Open...
- Please.

2385
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:00,400
(What will be their decision?)

2386
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,960
- the card.
- Please.

2387
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,040
Open the card.

2388
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:04,260
Open the card.

2389
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,110
(Aiki's crew won.)

2390
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:07,500
Aiki's crew.

2391
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,540
- Aiki's crew.
- Aiki's crew.

2392
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:11,780
My friends.

2393
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,150
It couldn't be helped.

2394
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:15,040
- Oh, no.
- They were too funny.

2395
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,840
- They were too funny.
- Seriously.

2396
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:19,410
Gosh, was I too cool?

2397
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:20,620
We won.

2398
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:22,550
- We won.
- My goodness.

2399
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,160
I will reveal the final result.

2400
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:29,030
This is the order
by the number of penalty badges.

2401
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:30,330
(The order
by the number of penalty badges)

2402
01:23:30,330 --> 01:23:31,330
First place...

2403
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:34,260
is Monika's crew
with one penalty badge.

2404
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:35,940
(Monika's crew won.)

2405
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:38,160
- Monika's crew won.
- Thank you so much.

2406
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,740
It's nice to place first here.

2407
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:41,970
The prize consists of a trophy...

2408
01:23:41,970 --> 01:23:45,280
and the latest action camera
so that you can take...

2409
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,710
many good videos.

2410
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:48,280
Will you really give her
an action camera?

2411
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,820
It's something Monika really needs.

2412
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:51,620
- I love it.
- It's the best.

2413
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:52,990
Monika.

2414
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:56,080
(The winner of Street Human Fighter
is Monika.)

2415
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,290
That's incredible.

2416
01:23:57,290 --> 01:23:59,790
Mom, I won on Running Man!

2417
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,920
- Thank you. I love you.
- She has the best reactions.

2418
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:03,790
I am jealous of the trophy.

2419
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:07,700
One of the crews
will receive the penalty.

2420
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:08,760
(It's time to decide on the crew
that will receive the penalty.)

2421
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,370
The last place is...

2422
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:12,580
(Which crew placed last?)

2423
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,610
Aiki's crew
with four penalty badges.

2424
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:16,150
- Okay.
- You placed last.

2425
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:17,370
(Aiki's crew)

2426
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:18,610
We didn't place last.

2427
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,080
- Okay.
- It's okay.

2428
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,950
- It's okay.
- We dodged the bullet.

2429
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:23,490
We dodged the bullet.

2430
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:25,750
I had a lot of fun with you guys.

2431
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,710
I will reveal
the penalty of the day.

2432
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,380
For people who began to star in
variety shows,

2433
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:33,050
this penalty will give
both sweetness and spiciness.

2434
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,590
It's the fresh cream cannon.

2435
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:37,330
- What?
- There is a special rule.

2436
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:38,400
- What?
- A special rule?

2437
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,460
One of the fresh cream cannons...

2438
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,610
won't go off.

2439
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,630
And we will tell the leader, Aiki...

2440
01:24:46,210 --> 01:24:48,440
about one of the two cannons
that will go off.

2441
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,780
- Really?
- She can volunteer to take it.

2442
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:53,210
Then Aiki will assign
her team members.

2443
01:24:53,210 --> 01:24:55,780
- This one will go off.
- Okay.

2444
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:58,250
- This is one of the two cannons.
- Okay.

2445
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:00,660
One of the other two will go off,
and the rest won't go off.

2446
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:02,660
- She's torn.
- Aiki,

2447
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:04,660
assign your team members
to each cannon.

2448
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:07,900
Which color do you like?

2449
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,830
- I like yellow.
- Okay. You stand here.

2450
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:11,590
- What about you?
- I like pink.

2451
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:15,240
- Should we sit?
- We don't know it yet.

2452
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,630
Okay.

2453
01:25:16,630 --> 01:25:19,410
Monika, Lee Jung, and Aiki.

2454
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:20,800
Tell us how you liked our show
before the cannons go off.

2455
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:24,170
- Should I say it standing here?
- Yes, please.

2456
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:28,970
First, I'm so lucky that I'm not
standing here. Thank you.

2457
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:31,040
- Thank you.
- That's nice.

2458
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,960
After joining Running Man
as a guest,

2459
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,160
I realized that it was really fun.

2460
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,030
You should succeed
and join this show sometime.

2461
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:40,590
(You should succeed
and join this show sometime.)

2462
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,830
I agree. This is the most fun
TV show I've ever joined.

2463
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:48,330
I was so comfortable.
Thank you for having me here.

2464
01:25:48,330 --> 01:25:50,830
- Lee Jung.
- All right. Aiki.

2465
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:54,040
I had a lot of fun today.

2466
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,150
I just feel bad
that this is how it ends.

2467
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:00,080
But I believe this will
also be a fun memory.

2468
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:01,540
I had a great time.

2469
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:02,580
(I had a great time.)

2470
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:04,580
I hope Aiki's cannon won't go off.

2471
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:05,690
- Me too.
- I know.

2472
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:07,550
I'll show you
what a good leader is like.

2473
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:09,720
This looks good.
Just mind the angle.

2474
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,530
It will go off as I count to three.

2475
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:12,580
(Aiki assigned her team members
knowing the cannon to go off.)

2476
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:14,620
- One.
- Aiki, that's good.

2477
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:15,660
Two.

2478
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:19,090
(Who is the one to survive?)

2479
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,400
Three.

2480
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:23,330
- So Min's cannon didn't go off.
- Mine didn't go off.

2481
01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:24,830
(Aiki and Ji Hyo are
covered with fresh cream.)

2482
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:26,210
Mine didn't go off.

2483
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:29,870
Aiki chose number two
knowing that it would go off.

2484
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:32,370
- That's amazing.
- Why?

2485
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:34,120
She's so cool.

2486
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,510
(Moved)

2487
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:38,120
- Don't open your eyes.
- She's great.

2488
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:41,320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2489
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:42,990
Thank you.

2490
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:44,720
Here's the question.

2491
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:47,590
(What's the highway that connects
Asia and European countries?)

2492
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:49,330
(Look at him write down the answer.)

2493
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:51,570
(He's really smart.)

2494
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:52,940
(I'm so proud of him.)

2495
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:54,700
Se Chan knows the answer.

2496
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:56,210
He knows it too.

2497
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:58,710
(Darn it. I don't remember.)

2498
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:00,740
(This is what we focused on.)

2499
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:02,210
We kept talking about it.

2500
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:03,450
We talked about it.

2501
01:27:03,450 --> 01:27:04,950
We kept talking about it.

2502
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:06,340
Did he memorize that?

2503
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:08,080
You're the top student.

2504
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:09,210
Jae Suk.

2505
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:10,580
What? Hi-pass?

2506
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:12,040
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry, Jong Kook.

2507
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:13,360
- It's my fault.
- If Ji Hyo...

2508
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,120
(answered another couple
of questions...)

2509
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,750
(Why would you say that
when she's here?)

2510
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:18,960
(Noisy)

2511
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,660
(Darn Korean schools!)

2512
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:22,960
Turn it up!

2513
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,620
(What we want is...)

2514
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:29,460
(What's with
this overheated classroom?)

2515
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:31,240
(A few hours ago)

2516
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:32,500
(What do you think of the penalties
on Running Man?)

2517
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,870
(Running Man members
versus the production crew)

2518
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:37,610
(The winner will decide
the penalties for the future.)

2519
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:39,650
(The question is,
do we really need the penalty?)

2520
01:27:39,650 --> 01:27:40,780
Hurry.

2521
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:43,410
(They cooperate with each other
for the world without penalties.)

2522
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:45,950
(Running Man members
versus the production crew)

2523
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:49,160
(Is it the beginning
of slapstick comedy?)

2524
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:51,050
(We are the funny ones.)

2525
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:53,000
(Raising voices)

2526
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,620
(We need VAR.)

2527

(Running Man, Production Crew)

2528
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:57,160
(The two teams meet
under the giant water cannons.)

2529
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:59,570
(Who will lose the match and
get splashed by the water cannon?)
