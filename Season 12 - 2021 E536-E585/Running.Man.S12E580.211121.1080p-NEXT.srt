1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,000
(A fall morning
with a refreshing breeze)

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,410
(Chairs neatly arranged in rows)

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,050
(And there's a whiteboard
in the middle.)

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,240
(The elevator is coming up
right at the moment.)

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,710
- We're here.
- Gosh, what's that?

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,810
What is this?

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,220
Is it started already?

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,650
- I guess we should talk right away.
- What's this?

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,120
- What?
- Gosh, what is this for?

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,780
Hello.

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,620
- This is...
- Should we start talking now?

12
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,400
- What is this?
- Is it started already?

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,900
- I want to go home.
- What are we doing?

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,100
- Hello.
- What should we do now?

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,560
- Hello. What's this?
- We don't have a studio?

16
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,560
By any chance,

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,900
is this for my doping test?

18
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,040
What are we doing today?

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,830
Is this a press conference or what?

20
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,730
- Hey, that's...
- Is this for my doping test?

21
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,580
- Jong Kook is now...
- It's no joke.

22
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,300
- He's busy taking doping tests.
- Why?

23
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,940
He's an artist.

24
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,220
- Why does he need a doping test?
- I was going to let it slide...

25
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,910
as if it was no big deal.

26
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,320
You know me. I'm going
to throw a big tantrum.

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,450
Right.

28
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,320
- We know what you're like.
- You know what?

29
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,620
- It's just that...
- I'll take this to the end.

30
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,930
he doesn't know
much about Jong Kook.

31
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,000
- He picked the wrong person.
- Seriously.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,620
(The YouTuber who criticized
Kim Jong Kook finally apologized.)

33
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,090
(Greg Doucette ultimately takes down
all videos about Kim Jong Kook.)

34
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,120
By the way, Jong Kook, you...

35
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,390
- Stay quiet.
- I'm talking now.

36
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,530
(Let me talk.)

37
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,440
Stay quiet. We're not done yet.

38
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,470
- We need to talk.
- See?

39
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,940
We are still talking.

40
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,110
Just stay quiet.

41
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,340
(Slapping)

42
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,810
He's slapping him.

43
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,480
He probably needs a doping test.

44
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,220
- He needs one.
- He's acting strange.

45
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,080
Will you turn around
and take it off?

46
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,550
This one?

47
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,980
- What is this?
- This is how we begin.

48
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,390
(There's a mysterious whiteboard.)

49
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,810
- What's that?
- What?

50
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,030
(What does it say?)

51
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,000
What do you think of the penalties
on Running Man?

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,120
Penalties.

53
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,670
I guess they want an update.

54
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,000
I see.

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,230
Penalties on Running Man?

56
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,940
About penalties...

57
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,000
(The history of penalties
for the 11 years of Running Man)

58
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,200
(1st stage: The early years
since 2010)

59
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,050
(Cold and embarrassing
clothes like hot pants in winter)

60
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,050
- Let's go.
- Seriously, I can't.

61
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,750
(2nd stage: From 2015 to 2017)

62
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,590
(Terrifying and thrilling penalties
inside and outside of the country)

63
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,230
(3rd stage: From 2018 to 2019)

64
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,920
(The top 3 penalties including fresh
cream, water canon, and flogging.)

65
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,110
(4th stage: from 2020 until now)

66
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,730
(Tiresome penalties that they should
do after the shoot is over.)

67
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,240
- That sounds horrible.
- Gosh, it's so bothersome.

68
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,480
(For the members
who hate all those penalties...)

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,640
It's squeaking.

70
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,480
Penalties for the cast?

71
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,480
(The crew members prepared
this negotiation table.)

72
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,510
Penalties...

73
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,230
What Suk Jin and I did...

74
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,520
- last week...
- What?

75
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,800
It was the worst.

76
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,920
- What did you do?
- Honestly, it was the worst.

77
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,800
(The worst penalty
that Se Chan and Suk Jin got is...)

78
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,200
(Taking a photo of the signpost
that says Gangneung.)

79
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,110
(They had to find a signpost
of Gangneung in Yangpyeong.)

80
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,700
(They spent three hours,
but it was on TV for 3 minutes.)

81
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,510
(They spent a lot of time on it,
but it's not impressive at all.)

82
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,850
Including the time I spent
on my way home,

83
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,640
it took me four hours.

84
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,710
I didn't know what to do with it...

85
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,920
because we didn't know
where the signpost was.

86
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,230
If I was told to go to Gangneung,
I would've slept over.

87
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,390
But that wasn't the case.

88
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,450
Will you say something?

89
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,860
(Will you say something?)

90
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,390
(He forces Jae Suk
to say something.)

91
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,360
- Well...
- Aren't you ready...

92
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,990
Are you ready to listen yet?

93
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,460
Why is everyone
throwing a tantrum today?

94
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,990
- Why are you upset?
- What's wrong with you?

95
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,510
He's being really sensitive.
I can't say anything.

96
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,910
I'm just...

97
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,040
The thing is,

98
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,730
I'm listening to what you say.

99
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,550
You're not listening.
You are smacking your lips...

100
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,110
trying to get at me.

101
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,820
- I'm listening.
- You don't understand.

102
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,240
I think there are penalties...

103
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,320
that we hate...

104
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,290
and penalties that
our viewers want to see.

105
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,360
Exactly.

106
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,420
That's what we need to think about.

107
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,730
I'm sure the crew members
know exactly what we hate.

108
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,860
- They do.
- I hated the book report thing.

109
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,390
I know. It was so annoying.

110
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,990
- It was the worst.
- It's horrible.

111
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,670
I don't know what to write.

112
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,960
Anyway, we hate it
when we get to go home late.

113
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,480
I prefer things that end quickly.

114
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,540
Like a water canon.

115
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,730
Or something
that gives a little pain.

116
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,380
Fresh cream isn't so good.

117
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,610
- I got a text from Aiki earlier.
- What did she say?

118
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,360
That night, she couldn't get rid...

119
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,480
- of the smell of the shaving cream.
- Right.

120
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,420
- Did you get her number?
- I did.

121
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,860
(Ji Hyo got Aiki's number?)

122
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,210
- You did?
- Why?

123
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,180
We became intimate
as we showered together.

124
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,180
- Wow.
- Really?

125
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,820
- That rarely happens to her.
- Aiki's number?

126
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,170
Now you're trying
to start your social life.

127
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,360
- Ji Hyo.
- Finally.

128
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
Ji Hyo.

129
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,730
Why do you never shower with me?

130
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,540
- You?
- Why not me?

131
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,540
We showered together many times.

132
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,970
(We showered together many times.)

133
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,300
What kind of conversation is this?

134
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,850
What are they talking about?

135
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,050
Are you sad
that you didn't shower together?

136
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,300
Are you upset?

137
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,980
I see. It wasn't in the same room.

138
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,650
I thought they went
to a bathhouse together.

139
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,480
- It wasn't like that.
- We just washed off the cream.

140
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,660
You're not a man. Why do you want
to go to a bathhouse with her?

141
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,550
- Why are you sad about that?
- It will bring us closer together.

142
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,790
Why are you jealous?

143
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,590
- We can be more intimate.
- More intimate?

144
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,900
You should think about this
when we talk about penalties.

145
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,690
- What?
- If a penalty is too harsh,

146
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,240
we become too competitive...

147
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,600
- as we play games.
- It's not for fun.

148
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,840
It's not for fun.

149
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,360
We only care
about the result of the game.

150
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,710
- It can happen.
- He's right.

151
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,000
You know what I mean.

152
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,210
If we have a harsh penalty,

153
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,800
- We're already competitive.
- it might look...

154
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,000
- more thrilling,
- Right.

155
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,980
- but if it gets worse...
- We might get carried away.

156
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,310
In a word,

157
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,180
- the race itself won't be fun.
- That makes sense.

158
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,520
That's possible.

159
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,880
- Seriously...
- But if it's too soft,

160
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,160
- it's a little...
- It won't be intense.

161
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,290
We might not want to try hard...

162
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,990
when we play games or something.

163
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,170
We won't have a motivation.

164
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,600
When a penalty is too harsh,

165
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,360
- I can say, "Go easy on me."
- By the way,

166
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,100
I'm sorry to say this, but...

167
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,170
I know you're having a hard time
with the doping test, but...

168
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,230
- don't take this the wrong way.
- Okay.

169
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,800
Every time we have a harsh penalty,

170
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,150
the first person to respond is you.

171
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,610
You always say, "Okay."

172
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,310
"It's okay."

173
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,920
- "This isn't about the penalty."
- Exactly.

174
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,020
- "I can do this."
- I guess you're right.

175
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,290
- It can be a motivation.
- What about this?

176
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,960
Why don't we try
something that our viewers want...

177
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,230
It's too soon to propose a solution.

178
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,120
All right.

179
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,530
(It was too soon
to propose a solution.)

180
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,530
- Wait.
- What?

181
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,860
You are right.

182
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,840
Suk Jin talked
only for five seconds today.

183
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,490
Suk Jin, do you want
to switch seats with me?

184
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,970
- Hey.
- Just wait.

185
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,710
You know the process.

186
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,500
I need to hear what Ji Hyo thinks.

187
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,130
- She already spoke.
- No.

188
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,000
- We should go zigzag.
- I need their opinions.

189
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,740
You are taking his side.

190
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,920
What are you talking about?

191
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,370
We have a member who's
on another weekend variety show.

192
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,740
Where does "How Do You Play?"
stand on this issue?

193
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,550
- "How Do You Play?"?
- The opinion of "How Do You Play?"?

194
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,110
- The Saturday show?
- What is he talking about?

195
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,420
(Giggling)

196
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,960
We promised
that we wouldn't talk about it.

197
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,750
We need the opinion
of the Saturday show.

198
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,230
- What?
- He danced a lot...

199
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,690
- in the karaoke room.
- Does "How Do You Play?"...

200
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,470
He kept dancing without a break.

201
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,860
- He danced...
- He never stopped.

202
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,560
I just tried
what I did on Running Man.

203
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,340
You're supposed to do this
only on Running Man.

204
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,800
- Guys.
- Why did you do it on Saturday?

205
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,300
May I weigh in?

206
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,800
The thought of giving a penalty...

207
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,940
If you asked, "May I weigh in?",

208
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,150
then you should wait for our answer.

209
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,370
Exactly. You need our consent.

210
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,810
- Why did you not wait?
- All right.

211
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,980
We have something to talk about.

212
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,090
Do you think Suk Jin may speak?

213
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,960
- Hey, this...
- In three.

214
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,180
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

215
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,880
All right.
I'd like you to wait then.

216
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,480
(They all say no.)

217
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,730
What are you to say that?

218
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,550
He asked our opinions.

219
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,990
You asked it first.

220
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,730
- I did?
- It's you who asked it first.

221
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,970
You could've just said it.
Why did you ask?

222
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,560
I'm strong, you punk!

223
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,060
He's so childish.

224
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,060
The thing is,

225
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,430
I think the crew members are...

226
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,630
being obsessed with penalties.

227
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,910
Think of the episode
that was aired yesterday.

228
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,280
We enjoyed some free time
like a retreat.

229
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,610
With some short skits,

230
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,870
we had a lot of fun.

231
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,940
I don't think we need a penalty
in an episode like that.

232
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,310
It could've ended just like that.

233
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,520
Then are you saying
we shouldn't have a penalty?

234
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,660
- We need it.
- We need a penalty.

235
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,290
It's like sweet and salty food.

236
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,460
- Right.
- That's what I think.

237
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,750
- Sweet and salty?
- Sometimes it can be...

238
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,120
a special event.

239
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,470
- Sometimes, it can be huge.
- That's right.

240
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,120
- Or it can be trivial at times.
- Sure.

241
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,860
When we don't need a penalty,

242
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,100
- Exactly!
- we can skip it.

243
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,340
Only when it's useless.

244
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,360
I think the episode we shot
yesterday didn't need a penalty.

245
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,230
- Hang on. Jae Suk is talking.
- That's a bit...

246
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,210
- Hang on. Jae Suk is talking.
- That's a bit...

247
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,740
Will you stay quiet?

248
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,710
Jong Kook, I'm not older than him.

249
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,720
Suk Jin is older.

250
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,170
I get it.

251
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,310
Suk Jin is older than me.

252
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,940
I mean, you were talking.

253
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,020
This isn't about age.

254
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,680
You were leading the conversation,

255
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,050
- but he butted in.
- But Suk Jin is older.

256
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,030
I hate Jong Kook even more.

257
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,750
(So they suggested
various opinions on penalties.)

258
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,960
- Guys.
- Yes.

259
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,730
I appreciate your opinions
on penalties.

260
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,900
Like you said, you've been
on Running Man for 11 years,

261
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,300
so you must have
diverse opinions about penalties.

262
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,170
The crew members also
have their opinions,

263
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,980
and our viewers have theirs.

264
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,480
In order to put the opinions
together, we will have...

265
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,020
2021 Running Man
Penalty Negotiation today.

266
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,380
- Negotiation?
- Negotiation.

267
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,580
- Negotiation.
- What do we do?

268
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,810
Eight years ago,

269
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,210
you negotiated
with the crew members...

270
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,080
about missions during
the Year-End Settlement Race.

271
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,350
- That's right.
- I remember.

272
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,920
The crew members won,

273
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,590
but they got splashed because of the
youngest producer's mistake.

274
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,000
Right. The water bomb.

275
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,170
That was a long time ago.

276
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,400
I'll show you the video.

277
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,560
- The video.
- What was his name?

278
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,560
- I remember that.
- Right.

279
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,870
I know what this is.

280
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
Who was the producer?

281
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,870
(Episode 178 aired in December 2013)

282
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,410
(The members negotiated with
the crew members about missions.)

283
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,650
(The members have a feeling
that they lost.)

284
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,570
(They make their last speech
under the water bomb.)

285
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,250
(The team
whose running ball is picked wins.)

286
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,420
(Who are the winners?)

287
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,420
(Team Crew Members wins.)

288
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,890
Team Crew Members.

289
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,350
My goodness.

290
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,420
I can't believe this.

291
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,720
We lost.

292
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,030
What?

293
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,800
The crew members got splashed.

294
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,270
They were happy, but...

295
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,930
Isn't this the best scene ever?

296
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,830
Why? Whose mistake was that?

297
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,100
- It was our producer.
- The youngest producer.

298
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,330
Our producer?

299
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,430
The one over there.

300
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,800
The team whose ball
is picked wins the race.

301
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,750
But when the crew members'
ball was picked,

302
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,840
- He thought...
- he thought they lost.

303
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,990
It was a miscommunication.

304
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,420
(The director splashed water
on the crew members by mistake.)

305
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,050
(The members
sang together with joy.)

306
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,660
Look at that.

307
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,190
He made a big mistake.

308
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,550
He splashed water
on the crew members.

309
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,170
They went through a lot.

310
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,420
So you will have a negotiation...

311
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,740
- like you did back then.
- With the production crew?

312
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,270
You will have a race
against the production crew...

313
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,140
- for the water bomb penalty.
- Really?

314
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,800
- My gosh.
- That sounds harsh.

315
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,340
The production crew
might get splashed today.

316
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,670
- Today?
- Yes.

317
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,520
- Really?
- It's cold today.

318
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,310
After each mission,

319
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,340
you will get the penalty balls
based on the results.

320
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,850
The team whose ball
is picked will lose.

321
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,020
- The team whose ball is picked.
- You need fewer balls.

322
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,550
It's the production crew versus us.

323
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,720
If you win,

324
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,500
the directors will get splashed.

325
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,500
Starting from next week's episode
and until the end of this year,

326
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,740
you will get to decide
the penalty of each week.

327
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,040
- Really?
- Do we get to decide?

328
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,600
- For ourselves?
- Yes.

329
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,870
- We can pick something simple.
- That's right.

330
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,740
- Something easy.
- We can do that.

331
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,880
And if we win,

332
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,100
you'll get splashed.

333
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,120
And we will decide penalties
for you until the end of this year.

334
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,490
So you should try to get...

335
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,150
fewer penalty balls today.

336
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,710
Here's the mission
to decide the number...

337
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,390
of the first penalty balls.

338
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,030
You will perform the mission,

339
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,630
and its result will decide
the number of penalty balls.

340
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,420
The first mission to decide
the crew members' penalty balls...

341
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,590
- is blowing out candles.
- What?

342
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,870
You will take turns to try it.

343
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,800
You're supposed...

344
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,040
to blow out only 7
out of 10 candles at one go.

345
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,150
If you each succeed, the staff
gets one ball for each success.

346
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,410
- How would we do that?
- So...

347
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,650
if 3 members succeed
in blowing out 7 candles,

348
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,570
- we will get three penalty balls.
- At one go?

349
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,750
- Yes.
- Seven candles?

350
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,490
- That sounds difficult.
- Seven is too much.

351
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,710
At one go?

352
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,310
It's so tempting...

353
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,490
that we can decide
a penalty for ourselves.

354
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,220
We can pick something simple.

355
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,760
- Do you want me to go first?
- Yes.

356
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,300
(Se Chan tries
blowing out 7 candles.)

357
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,190
So Min, can you put your hand
up here to see if I can reach it?

358
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,630
- This isn't easy.
- Over here.

359
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,300
- Next to the third candle.
- Only if it was just thin paper.

360
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,190
No, we have to do this.

361
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,370
I can feel it, but it's too weak.

362
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,800
You should aim at this candle.
It's too low now.

363
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,470
Here I go. I'm ready.

364
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,780
(Here I go. I'm ready.)

365
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,410
- What?
- Blow the candles, please.

366
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,380
It looks as if she's waiting
for her boyfriend.

367
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,180
(Her boyfriend with a pouty mouth
prepared a candle event.)

368
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,250
I'm ready. Here we go.

369
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,520
(Will he succeed in putting out
7 out of 10 candles?)

370
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,130
- What?
- That was too weak.

371
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,920
- Oh, no.
- I knew the flame would come back.

372
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,630
(It looked like he succeeded.)

373
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,300
(But he failed.)

374
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,270
- Fail.
- You should've blown harder.

375
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,420
- Who wants to go next?
- They looked like they were off.

376
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,670
I'll try it.

377
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,060
- What a shame.
- I thought they were off.

378
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,600
- How did the flame come back?
- Don't blow for long.

379
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,770
Just blow hard at once.

380
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,700
- I have a question.
- Don't blow for long.

381
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,650
The rule is to use the air I inhale
in one breath, right?

382
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,920
- I'll block my nose. In one breath.
- Okay.

383
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,440
Jong Kook, why don't you wait
until we all do?

384
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,020
Right. He'll probably do well.

385
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,290
(The active singer seems confident
in controlling exhaling.)

386
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,790
Take a long breath, Jong Kook.

387
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,160
Aim carefully. You might blow
below the flames.

388
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,580
- Wait. Do it in one breath...
- That's not...

389
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,820
- Jong Kook, stop.
- Hey.

390
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,130
Jong Kook, hold on.

391
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,220
(Exhaling repeatedly)

392
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,800
- Stop. We need a doping test.
- You should do it in one breath.

393
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,270
It's okay as long as I use the air
I inhale in one breath.

394
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,900
- You can exhale only one time.
- Oh, in one go?

395
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,010
- I was mistaken.
- Give him another chance.

396
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,370
I mean... Gosh, I'm dizzy.

397
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,560
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- I thought...

398
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,070
- that I could...
- This isn't like you.

399
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,050
Wouldn't it be okay
as long as I don't inhale again?

400
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,780
- No, you should exhale only once.
- This isn't like you.

401
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,970
- You looked really sly.
- Jong Kook.

402
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,440
Taking a long breath helps
to blow out many candles.

403
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,920
Breathe longer than you think
you should.

404
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,120
(Spitting while blowing)

405
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,890
- That was just gross.
- Gosh, seriously.

406
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,950
Why would you spit?

407
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,720
Jong Kook, what's with you?

408
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,660
- He put out only 3 of them.
- He should've put out 7.

409
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,170
- What was that?
- Exactly.

410
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,770
- Why couldn't he blow harder?
- Oh, dear.

411
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,190
- Fail.
- So Min, you're up next.

412
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,930
- I tried to blow hard.
- I'll give it a try.

413
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,010
I used up all the air too quickly
because I blew hard.

414
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,510
- I think...
- Breathe out like the wind blows.

415
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,430
- that Se Chan's way was better.
- You shouldn't exhale quickly.

416
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,650
- Make sure to exhale hard.
- He's right. Exhale hard.

417
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,780
- You should do it in one breath.
- Blow at once like this.

418
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,670
- Blow at once.
- Right. I think that's better.

419
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,180
Don't get too close.
You might burn your nose hair.

420
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,180
Be careful. You might burn
your pleather jacket.

421
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,390
- You might burn another one.
- You don't want to burn it.

422
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,660
- I'm ready.
- Go ahead.

423
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,950
- I'll do my best.
- Don't get too close.

424
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,290
- Your hair might catch on fire.
- You might burn your nose hair.

425
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,400
- She failed. I get it now.
- Fail.

426
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,820
You should never slow down.

427
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,500
- You should keep blowing hard.
- Exactly.

428
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,770
- You shouldn't try to control it.
- I almost made it through.

429
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,830
I put out five candles.

430
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,770
- I'll go next. Gosh.
- You did a good job.

431
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,170
- Blow hard enough to put all out.
- So Min did a good job.

432
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,540
- I'll do it.
- Jae Suk, let me try this time.

433
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,700
- Sure. Go ahead.
- She wants to go first.

434
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,250
- She never volunteered to go first.
- Oh, my. I feel...

435
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,440
- Ji Hyo.
- Aim to put all out.

436
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,020
- I almost cried.
- Hey.

437
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,020
- She volunteered enthusiastically.
- Exactly.

438
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,840
She has never stopped me
to try something before me.

439
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,050
- Yes, this is her first time.
- She has changed.

440
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,350
Ji Hyo, I'm impressed.

441
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,790
- She's changed.
- Aim to blow out all ten of them.

442
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,680
(Ji Hyo volunteered to go next.
How many candles will she put out?)

443
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,536
- She made it!
- She put out seven of them!

444
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,960
(Ji Hyo succeeded in blowing out
7 candles.)

445
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,870
(Ji Hyo, great job!)

446
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,170
(Disappointed)

447
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,700
- Great job.
- What's wrong?

448
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,540
- Hey, you succeeded.
- You made it.

449
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,600
- You did well.
- You won.

450
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,910
I think she was going to
put all candles out.

451
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,780
- You made it.
- The goal is to put out seven.

452
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,310
- Really? Did I win?
- You made it.

453
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,890
- Oh, my. I made it.
- You succeeded.

454
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,550
- I thought I had to put all out.
- Did you think they were seven?

455
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,120
- Yes. That's what I thought.
- She was amazing.

456
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,260
She took us by surprise again.

457
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,350
- I guess...
- She pulled it off.

458
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,490
Ji Hyo, I see that you stopped me
for a reason.

459
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,530
- She's good at everything.
- That was amazing.

460
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,130
There's a lesson we should learn
from this.

461
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,690
Ji Hyo made it because she aimed
to put out all of them.

462
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,500
- One person succeeded so far.
- I thought I had to put all out.

463
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,900
- All of them, right?
- Ji Hyo, you're amazing.

464
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
It worked because she aimed
to put out all of them.

465
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,460
- Ji Hyo, great job.
- Yes? Thanks.

466
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,540
- Jae Suk, aim to put all out.
- She's incredible.

467
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,940
I'm sorry, but you already said it
several times.

468
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,020
- But it's important, you know.
- We all heard you.

469
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,920
Hey, don't forget to aim to put out
all of them.

470
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,050
See? You just repeated it again.

471
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,990
I wonder if it's hard for him
to aim properly.

472
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,890
- Maybe, because of his pouty mouth.
- Exactly.

473
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,490
- And his mouth is a bit crooked.
- Aim to put all out in one breath.

474
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,760
- I see that his mouth is crooked.
- Yes. Just a little bit.

475
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,630
- Shape your mouth like this.
- Jae Suk, blow them like this.

476
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,420
(Crooked)

477
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,400
(Slanted)

478
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,040
- Why?
- Because your mouth is crooked.

479
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,330
He has uneven teeth. That's all.

480
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,460
Uneven teeth won't affect
how I do this.

481
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,510
- Jae Suk, try this.
- I promise you.

482
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,540
He looks serious.

483
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,570
He acts so confidently,

484
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,510
but he's never
succeeded in the past 11 years.

485
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,020
- Am I not right?
- He acts like he knows everything.

486
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,670
- Right. He's so arrogant.
- Like an expert.

487
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,620
- "I'm a pro at this, you guys."
- Listen, guys. A game like this...

488
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,080
But once his turn comes,
he starts shaking.

489
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,210
He shakes like crazy.

490
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,160
- I saw him shaking there just now.
- He gets nervous.

491
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,630
Don't worry about it.
Just let it burn. What?

492
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,920
(He turned his cap around
like a cute little boy!)

493
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,000
- Just let it burn.
- Right.

494
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,900
- Jae Suk, get closer.
- That's enough.

495
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,460
- That's close enough.
- You can get closer than that.

496
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,460
(Will the playful Jae Suk succeed?)

497
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,552
- Yes!
- What's that?

498
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,450
- What's that?
- I can't believe this.

499
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,180
(Upset)

500
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,720
- What's that?
- I can't believe this.

501
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,550
- Look at this.
- That's impossible.

502
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,220
- What happened?
- It's because of your uneven teeth.

503
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,960
- It's because they're crooked.
- Right. Jae Suk.

504
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,420
- The air went around this one.
- Like a curveball.

505
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,040
- Then it hit the one behind it.
- Gosh.

506
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,960
- How come that one was skipped?
- The air curved around it.

507
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,460
- How did this happen?
- It can't be done.

508
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,410
I stopped breathing out
not to put out more than enough.

509
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,600
- It's because of his uneven teeth.
- This is unbelievable.

510
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,780
Hey, stop it already.

511
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,340
Jae Suk, shouldn't this
be considered a success?

512
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,600
Shouldn't this be considered
a success?

513
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,940
- You put out more than seven.
- That's right.

514
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,810
Gosh. What a shame.

515
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,050
He would've succeeded
had he had even teeth.

516
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,940
I almost succeeded.

517
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,990
Your mouth should be up here. Good.

518
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,290
Dong Hoon, get closer.

519
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,720
- That's good. Nice.
- Good.

520
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,990
Be careful not to burn
your mustache.

521
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,720
- Burn your mustache.
- I want him to burn it.

522
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,000
- Get closer and squat down.
- I'm telling you...

523
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,690
- One, two, three. Good. Closer.
- Haha.

524
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,900
If you slack off on this show,
I'll teach you a lesson.

525
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,670
He drives me crazy.
Gosh. I can't believe him.

526
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,430
- He must be so passionate there.
- Hey.

527
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,200
- He says the same thing there.
- Jae Suk.

528
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,470
He repeats the same thing
on both shows.

529
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,830
- I just warned him.
- I'm glad you did.

530
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,180
- He's on both shows just like me!
- Haha.

531
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,800
- Thank you, Jae Suk.
- I'll slap you in the face.

532
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,870
- Haha.
- Hey, Haha.

533
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,450
Haha, Mi Joo told me
that you had called her...

534
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,190
- to ask her to drink with you.
- That hurts my feelings.

535
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,380
- You never call us.
- You've never asked us that.

536
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,610
- It was a team dinner.
- We drank with the whole team.

537
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,850
- Was it a team dinner?
- We'll drink together tonight.

538
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,490
- Anyway, you called her...
- Was it really a team dinner?

539
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,490
Haha, you talk to her on the phone?
You never call me.

540
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,530
- Okay. I get it.
- You punk, we talked two days ago.

541
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,320
- He never calls you either, right?
- It's true.

542
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,500
- This is driving me nuts.
- What's wrong with you?

543
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,560
Did I call you or not?

544
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,440
- Focus on the game.
- Why would you yell at Se Chan?

545
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,210
What are you doing, old man?

546
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,900
(The old man who tried to do it
has been kicked out.)

547
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,980
Aim to put out all of them.

548
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,300
Get closer than that.

549
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,800
- I'm warning you. Stay focused.
- Get closer.

550
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,640
Get as close as you are
to "How Do You Play?".

551
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,980
- Get closer.
- As close as you are to MBC.

552
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,080
Get as close as you can.

553
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,790
- As close as you are to MBC.
- Get close, will you?

554
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,110
Go on. Closer.

555
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,190
- As close as you can get.
- Good.

556
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,820
If he were on "How Do You Play?",
he would put his lips on the flame.

557
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,430
(He would put his lips
on the flame.)

558
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,830
- You go first.
- Hey, stop.

559
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,090
- Haha, come back.
- What's the matter?

560
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,330
- Haha, stop.
- I can't put up with this anymore.

561
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,600
- Come on, Haha.
- Hey.

562
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,740
- It's okay.
- Let go of me!

563
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,440
- You can get through this.
- Go back there right now.

564
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,980
- You should overcome this.
- Be professional.

565
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,250
- What's the matter with you?
- What's wrong?

566
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,300
Overcome this.

567
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,340
- That wasn't professional. Okay?
- Get over it.

568
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,810
- That was hilarious.
- Gosh, that punk.

569
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,110
He's mentally weak.

570
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,260
- You can do this.
- Get close.

571
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,460
Good. That's perfect.

572
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,490
- Blow harder than you think.
- Exactly.

573
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,490
- Blow as hard as you can.
- Go ahead.

574
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,080
- I think he'll make it.
- Blow hard at once.

575
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,650
I wonder if he has
good lung capacity.

576
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,060
(He blew!)

577
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,200
- Oh, my.
- Great.

578
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,300
- Stop.
- Oh, I think...

579
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,560
(Did he succeed?)

580
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,270
(Did he fail?)

581
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,980
- Stop. Yes!
- Oh, I think...

582
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,840
(He succeeded in putting out
7 candles.)

583
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,980
(Shouting)

584
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,840
- Running Man!
- Good job.

585
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,410
Chief Director Choi Young In!

586
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,260
- Did you just drop the honorifics?
- Did you?

587
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,350
- Did he?
- Ma'am!

588
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,930
(I love SBS.)

589
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,850
- That was great. Good job.
- He made it.

590
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,150
- Great job.
- You made it.

591
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,320
Dong Hoon, you did a good job.

592
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,320
- That was great.
- My business partner, good job.

593
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,590
- Great job.
- He made it.

594
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,620
- You made it, Haha.
- That was good.

595
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,630
- Good job, Haha.
- That was funny.

596
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,090
- He proved us wrong.
- He did a great job.

597
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,600
By the way, I didn't think
I could make it.

598
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,130
- Under so much pressure...
- See?

599
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,130
- You made it as you stayed focused.
- You proved yourself.

600
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,180
He's the last one.
You obtained two so far.

601
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,400
(They got 2 penalty balls
thanks to Ji Hyo and Haha.)

602
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,810
- Great.
- What?

603
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,050
(And this is their last chance.
Will Suk Jin succeed?)

604
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,380
(He put out 8 candles!)

605
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,310
- You did great.
- He put out too many candles.

606
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,380
- But he did well.
- Yes.

607
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,030
- He put out eight candles.
- I see that he's very healthy.

608
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,190
- That was close.
- Oh, gosh.

609
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,350
- I almost made it.
- You did well.

610
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,760
- I guess I have bad lung capacity.
- Great job, Suk Jin.

611
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,800
As a result, the staff has
two penalty balls now.

612
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,940
Didn't we get three?

613
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,300
- Only two of us succeeded.
- Okay.

614
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,210
Now, you're going to play a game
to decide...

615
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,600
the number of penalty balls for you.

616
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,900
It'll probably be harder than this.

617
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,010
- I wish we'd gotten one more ball.
- Exactly.

618
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,140
The game you'll play to decide
your penalty balls is...

619
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,910
Tail Catching Game.

620
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,110
- What's that?
- Tail Catching Game?

621
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,750
- Whose tail do we catch?
- Starting here, the seven of you...

622
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,790
go in and come out of
the three waiting rooms.

623
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,960
- It's a simple game.
- Yes.

624
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,850
You have 30 seconds to finish.

625
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,760
- What? We have only 30 seconds?
- Before you leave,

626
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,200
the first one in the line
presses that button.

627
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,970
- It won't be easy.
- To start the stopwatch.

628
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,630
Then the 1st one opens the door,
and you all go into the 1st room.

629
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,830
The last one closes the door.
Next, you come back out of the room.

630
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,660
- And you move to the second room.
- I understand.

631
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,830
Close the door when all of you go in
and open it when you come out.

632
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,040
Then move to the third room.

633
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,280
When you come back here,
the last one...

634
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,110
stops the stopwatch.
That's how you measure time.

635
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,570
The first and the last ones play
the most important roles.

636
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,520
- I agree.
- The first and the last ones.

637
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,310
- I'm not confident.
- Everyone.

638
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,960
You can go ahead and look around
before we set up cameras.

639
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,110
- Look around the three rooms.
- Let's go.

640
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,990
I'm sure they made it hard
for us to move around in there.

641
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,230
- Wouldn't you agree?
- Of course.

642
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,430
- I think...
- By the way,

643
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,560
- do we have to hold one another?
- It's hard to finish in 30 seconds.

644
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,970
- We have only 30 seconds.
- Exactly. It'll be hard.

645
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,440
- We go into the room.
- We enter the room.

646
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,360
- Open the door. We all go in.
- All of us come in.

647
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,800
- Go on in, everyone.
- Close it when we're all in here.

648
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,370
- The last one comes in.
- How about we turn to the right?

649
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,440
- The last one.
- No, the first one should...

650
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,180
- stand here.
- Exactly. The first one stays here.

651
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,910
- The rest of us come in.
- Then the others come in.

652
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,110
The first one closes the door
and opens it right away.

653
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,050
The last one should close it
when we leave the room.

654
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,340
Like this.
You know what I mean, right?

655
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,960
- Got it.
- Okay. Stay close to one another.

656
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,760
- We don't have to close this door.
- You have to.

657
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,620
- Do we have to close it too?
- Yes, you have to close it too.

658
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,820
We have to close this door too?

659
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,650
- We have to close this door too.
- But have you tried this?

660
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,650
- Yes, we have.
- No way.

661
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,270
- And they shortened the time limit.
- How much time do we have?

662
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,470
- You have 30 seconds.
- We can do this.

663
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,940
If you succeed
at your first attempt,

664
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,860
- you won't get any penalty balls.
- Okay.

665
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,830
After your first try, you get
a penalty ball every time you fail.

666
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,330
- Okay.
- Remember who's in front of you.

667
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,050
Guys, let's succeed
at our first try.

668
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,140
- Let's finish it in one go.
- We've got this.

669
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,610
- This requires good teamwork.
- Okay.

670
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,950
We have to move fast.
Let's keep this door open.

671
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,140
- Let's show them what we've got.
- Here we go.

672
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,250
- Open it right away.
- Let's go.

673
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,580
- Get ready.
- Just a second.

674
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,760
Ready.

675
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,650
Suk Jin, you must run fast.

676
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,650
Don't push me, okay?

677
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,880
Push him. We need to move fast.

678
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,260
- One, two...
- Be careful not to fall down.

679
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,260
- We should run fast.
- Here we go. Ready. Get set.

680
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,650
(Go.)

681
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,620
- Let's go.
- Move. Hurry up.

682
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,800
Move fast.

683
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,160
- Let's go.
- Move. Hurry up.

684
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,860
- Move fast. Hurry.
- Let's go.

685
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,630
- Let's go. Hurry up.
- Let's go.

686
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,480
(Everyone entered the 1st room
in only 6 seconds.)

687
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,100
- Go on.
- Open the door.

688
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,140
(Jae Suk falls down.)

689
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,710
- Run.
- Get up. What are you doing?

690
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,610
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Gosh.

691
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,980
- Hurry up!
- I can't believe him.

692
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,140
- Where is he?
- Open the door!

693
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,760
(Time kept passing
until Jae Suk got back up.)

694
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,850
- Hurry up!
- Where are you?

695
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,960
- What are you doing? Run.
- Hurry up and come on in.

696
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,350
(They came out of the 2nd room,
and 20 seconds passed already.)

697
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,730
Hurry up. Move fast.

698
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,770
- Gosh.
- Run. Go.

699
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,470
- Keep going.
- I think we can make it.

700
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,330
- We can make it.
- Hurry.

701
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,440
Let's go.

702
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,830
- You should press the button.
- I know.

703
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,060
(They're moving from the 3rd room
to the finishing point.)

704
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,160
- You should press the button.
- Run. Hurry.

705
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,830
- Hurry up and come on in.
- Press it.

706
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,840
(Less than 1 second is remaining.)

707
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,050
(Jong Kook, the last runner, must
press the buzzer.)

708
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,550
- Hurry up and come on in.
- Press it.

709
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,050
(Their record is 29.61 seconds.)

710
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
(They succeeded
at their first attempt.)

711
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,620
- We made it.
- Why did you fall down?

712
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,390
- This is Running Man!
- Okay.

713
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,320
- We are Running Man!
- I'm excited.

714
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,060
- You know...
- I can't believe we did it.

715
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,590
- I even fell down once.
- We did it.

716
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,040
- I mean, Jong Kook wouldn't come.
- Amazing.

717
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,090
(Move fast. Hurry up.)

718
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,210
(Hurry up. Gosh.)

719
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,010
(Get up. What are you doing?)

720
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,250
(The average of the staff's records
was 33 seconds.)

721
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,720
(The cast members' record is
29.61 seconds.)

722
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,780
That was amazing.

723
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,340
- Awesome.
- We did a great job.

724
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,340
- That's how fast we are.
- With only 0.39 seconds remaining,

725
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,550
you barely made it.

726
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,690
- Yes!
- Okay!

727
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,850
Guys, we wouldn't have made it
if this was "How Do You Play?".

728
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,150
Great.

729
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,530
You did much better
than we expected.

730
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,270
We thought you'd fail
at least three times.

731
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,090
- We were so cool.
- We did an amazing job.

732
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,330
- Didn't we do well?
- Yes, you did.

733
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,940
Anyway, you didn't get
any penalty balls.

734
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,800
- I was so surprised.
- We did great. I was surprised too.

735
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,970
- I was so surprised.
- Now...

736
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,130
we'll move to another location
for your first mission.

737
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,980
Before that,
I have a question for you guys.

738
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,510
- Go ahead.
- Which three of you...

739
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,020
do you think have
the most common knowledge?

740
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,410
- Jae Suk,
- Jae Suk.

741
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,080
- Suk Jin, and Jong Kook.
- Suk Jin and Jong Kook.

742
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,990
I wouldn't say I'm in the top three.

743
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,460
Then who is the ace among the rest?

744
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,730
- It's definitely me.
- I don't want to admit it,

745
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,730
- but it's Haha.
- Haha is the ace.

746
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,960
You can put it to a national vote.

747
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,930
- I agree. It wouldn't be me.
- I understand.

748
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,540
We'll prepare the first mission
based on your answers.

749
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,470
- Okay.
- Change your clothes and come back.

750
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,660
- Will it be a quiz game?
- Let's go.

751
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,540
(Running Study Room is waiting
for the cast members.)

752
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,210
I guess we're going to study again.

753
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,780
Look at that. My gosh.

754
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,450
I hated going to the library
when I was in school.

755
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,840
- It makes me feel sick.
- Gosh.

756
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,250
I feel sick already.
I can't do this.

757
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,840
- I can't breathe.
- I won't play this game.

758
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,550
It never affected my life...

759
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,810
- although I didn't study.
- I won't do it. We have four.

760
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,050
We have four aces. Don't worry.

761
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,190
- Everyone.
- Yes?

762
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,320
I see we'll study. I'm frustrated.

763
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,650
- I asked you a question earlier.
- Are we going to take an exam?

764
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,960
- Three, one, and three people.
- Yes.

765
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,090
- I think we'll have a match.
- In your first mission,

766
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,200
the empty heads have to do well...

767
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,540
to give the staff
more penalty balls.

768
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,970
It's Running Man Quiz Championship.

769
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,470
- I knew it.
- You're the ace.

770
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,740
- Did they leave us out?
- Thirty minutes later,

771
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,100
the three empty heads will
play a quiz game.

772
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,220
The staff will get a penalty ball
for each question they get right.

773
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,520
And you'll get a penalty ball
for each question they get wrong.

774
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,910
Only when they all get it right,
it counts as the correct answer.

775
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,910
- All three of them?
- Yes.

776
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,050
- That's too much.
- But...

777
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,550
We'll give them
elementary school level questions.

778
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,150
- Is it for fifth grade?
- I hated social studies.

779
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,500
I hated all subjects.

780
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,890
- Elementary school level questions?
- However,

781
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,730
since Haha is the ace
of the empty heads,

782
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,560
they can use the Haha chance card
three times.

783
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,860
(Haha with a master's degree,
the ace of empty heads)

784
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,470
Thank you, Haha. You're so cool.

785
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,070
- When the three empty heads...
- He's the ace.

786
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,370
request for the Haha chance card
after hearing the keyword,

787
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,210
or if Haha thinks he can get
a correct answer,

788
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,310
- Haha gets to answer the question.
- That's great.

789
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,340
Then what are we going to do?

790
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,020
I'm sure you don't know...

791
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,640
- where to start with the quiz.
- Indeed.

792
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,150
For the next 30 minutes,
these three members will...

793
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,120
- give you a 1 on 1 lesson.
- Oh, I see.

794
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,460
Teach them what's in the book...

795
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,150
and predict the questions for them.

796
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,470
This is great. I'm glad
you let us be their tutors.

797
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,730
- A quiz on a variety show...
- I'm worried.

798
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,630
- I mean, the way of studying...
- Is it different?

799
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,830
for a variety show is different.

800
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,770
Also, we made the questions
just as you see in the book.

801
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,800
- I want to study alone.
- Just as it is written in the book?

802
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,340
- I wonder which one will teach me.
- Can't you make it confusing?

803
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,450
In brief, we're going to be
their private tutors.

804
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,250
- That's right.
- Now, you have to...

805
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,550
- It's difficult.
- Indeed.

806
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,880
- I didn't study social studies.
- Do you know the five duties?

807
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,250
I gave up on the subject
when I was six.

808
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,350
Three of you, choose your tutors.

809
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,050
- It's not that difficult.
- Will one of us study alone?

810
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,760
- Haha will study alone.
- Oh, I see.

811
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,890
I don't think any of them can
teach me.

812
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,090
- Let's begin.
- I gave up on all subjects.

813
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,470
If only one of you fails to get
the correct answer, you all fail.

814
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,470
- We can't let that happen.
- They all should know the answers.

815
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,360
- All of you should study hard.
- Absolutely.

816
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,200
- Right.
- Before deciding, Suk Jin is...

817
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,270
(She can't seem to continue.)

818
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,440
- I'll be a kind tutor.
- I don't want him to be my tutor.

819
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,630
- Why?
- Of course.

820
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,180
- It's because...
- I'll be a kind tutor.

821
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,370
- What's the reason?
- I'm pretty sure he'll get angry...

822
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,570
- the entire time.
- I won't get upset.

823
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,570
I won't lose my temper.

824
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,050
- I think he'll get upset.
- I won't.

825
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,340
Whoever it may be,

826
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,840
- Your student?
- I promise...

827
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,350
- I'll tell you only the key points.
- Let's draw lots.

828
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,880
I prefer that way.
I can learn the key points.

829
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,460
- Only the key points.
- I don't need anything else.

830
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,650
- I can't even memorize them.
- Let's hear Mr. Gym out.

831
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,850
- Mr. Gym.
- I'll hit you while teaching you.

832
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,050
Would you hit one of the ladies too?

833
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,970
Of course not.
That's why I choose you.

834
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,470
- But you know...
- His teaching method suits me.

835
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,160
I made my choice.
I'll teach Se Chan.

836
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,200
Okay.

837
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,400
- Jong Kook, choose your student.
- Your method suits me.

838
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,010
- Me?
- He'll probably choose Ji Hyo.

839
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,300
My goodness.

840
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,070
All right. Let's go.

841
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,720
(He made a brief
but romantic comment.)

842
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,250
(Cheering passionately)

843
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,880
- Why would you be so excited?
- Then...

844
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,250
- It didn't mean anything.
- I mean...

845
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,720
- I'm just teaching her.
- Trust me.

846
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,350
- I didn't mean it like that.
- He'll help me study. That's all.

847
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,350
Did you see Ji Hyo's reaction
when he chose her?

848
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,820
(Smiling happily)

849
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,090
- My goodness.
- So Min.

850
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,860
- I won't get angry at you.
- You guys are so funny.

851
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,800
- I promise you.
- Suk Jin is So Min's tutor.

852
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,160
- Why do you think I'll do that?
- Okay.

853
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,940
- I'll be a kind tutor.
- Let's go.

854
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,970
- I'll be gentle.
- Where should we sit?

855
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:47,970
- Where is our desk?
- Let's sit down.

856
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,980
- This is my desk.
- Shall we begin?

857
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,330
Teacher, what should I begin with?

858
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,510
Come and sit down.

859
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,010
You have a lot to cover.

860
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,550
It's too much. Where should I begin?

861
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,550
That's why we need to cover
only the key points.

862
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,350
You know what "national territory"
means, right?

863
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,350
- The land owned by our country?
- Correct. It means...

864
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,050
- the land that belongs to a nation.
- Yes.

865
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,260
- What's this?
- Which one?

866
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,460
It says to find our country's
national territory.

867
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,090
- This is Asia.
- Yes.

868
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,430
- Korea is in the Asian continent.
- Yes.

869
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,630
Exactly where are we?

870
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,040
Did you guys hear what he said?
"This is Asia."

871
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,210
(This is Asia.)

872
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,940
(The first thing he taught Se Chan
was the location of Asia.)

873
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,210
- Se Chan, do you understand?
- Yes, Jae Suk.

874
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,330
- This is Asia.
- Asia.

875
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,980
What are continents?

876
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,140
(What are continents?)

877
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,750
"A large mass of land on earth..."

878
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,840
These are continents.

879
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,140
- The whole land?
- Yes.

880
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,340
What is a peninsula?

881
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,340
(What is a peninsula?)

882
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,490
- The ocean?
- Yes.

883
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,610
It's surrounded by the ocean
on three sides.

884
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,880
- On three sides?
- Look at this.

885
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,350
- Yes.
- Korea is a peninsula.

886
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,320
- It's called the Korean Peninsula.
- The Korean Peninsula.

887
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,260
- You can memorize it that way.
- I see.

888
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,460
- Okay.
- South Korea is here.

889
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,560
Correct. Since these are easy,
let's start with them.

890
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,560
Jong Kook, do you think
this will be in the quiz?

891
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,940
"Administrative Districts Puzzle"?

892
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,330
Tell me if I'm right. Seoul is...

893
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,660
- Seoul Special City.
- It's the capital Special city.

894
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,240
- Daegu Special City,
- Right.

895
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,780
Busan Special City,
Gwangju Special City...

896
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,300
Wait. Isn't Busan
a metropolitan city?

897
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,450
Oh, right. Seoul Special City,

898
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,680
Busan Metropolitan City,
Daegu Metropolitan City.

899
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,880
That's correct. You're doing great.

900
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,760
- Here are the duties.
- Sorry?

901
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,960
"Let's learn about the duties
of citizens in the constitution."

902
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,990
- "Tax liability".
- Wait. Hold on.

903
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,030
- Stop. Take it easy.
- "Basic education".

904
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,960
- Sorry?
- Tax liability.

905
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
TEW.

906
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,160
- "TEW"?
- Tax, education,

907
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,330
- and work.
- It's not TEW. It should be WET.

908
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,560
- "WET"?
- WET.

909
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,100
- "Work, educate, and tax."
- Duty to work.

910
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,540
WET. "Work, educate, and tax."

911
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,980
- The fundamental duties...
- Listen to me.

912
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,300
written in the constitution...

913
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,100
- I'm your tutor.
- There's military duty too.

914
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,510
- Listen to me.
- There are five of them.

915
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,640
- Hold on. I'll give you...
- Military duty.

916
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,950
- expected questions.
- Okay.

917
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,640
- This will be in the quiz for sure.
- What is it?

918
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,840
This will definitely be in the quiz.

919
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,650
- You see, the constitution...
- Check this out.

920
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,350
What is latitude?

921
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,050
- What's latitude?
- Sorry? North of the equator...

922
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,880
is called north latitude
and south of it is south latitude.

923
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,050
Oh, this is what latitude means.
Look, Suk Jin.

924
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,930
- This is the earth.
- Memorize "prime meridian".

925
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,700
- That's latitude. That's longitude.
- Yes.

926
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,060
You need to memorize
what will likely be in the quiz.

927
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,770
The questions won't be that simple.

928
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,010
Memorize "prime meridian".

929
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,330
"The reference line for longitude"?

930
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,740
- Which line is it?
- "Prime meridian".

931
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,040
It's called "prime meridian".
Just memorize it.

932
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:08,300
Study what could be in the quiz.

933
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,250
Suk Jin,
you're supposed to teach me,

934
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,980
- not to study yourself.
- I'm telling you what to memorize.

935
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,020
What was it again?

936
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,290
What is the reference line
for the longitude?

937
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,790
Prime medium.

938
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,650
It's "meridian", not "medium".

939
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,530
- "Meridian".
- Prime meridian.

940
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,650
- Good. "Meridian".
- Prime meridian.

941
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,620
- "Meridian".
- "Meridian".

942
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,890
- Prime meridian.
- Prime meridian.

943
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,160
See? I'm giving you
expected questions.

944
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,470
- You gave me two questions so far.
- Yes.

945
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,270
"My parents and my siblings..."
Hold on.

946
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,270
(Meanwhile,
Ace Empty Head is studying alone.)

947
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,940
(He uses a notepad as well.)

948
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,680
Gyeongpodae Pavilion... And azaleas.

949
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,050
Azaleas and the sound of cicadas.

950
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,480
I don't have to memorize the rest.

951
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:51,150
(He absorbed the knowledge.)

952
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,720
That's all I need to know.

953
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,730
- The thing is...
- Check this out.

954
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,990
The Asian Highway.

955
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,590
The Asian Highway.

956
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,730
Are you going to ask about that?

957
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,890
The Asian Highway. Turkey and...

958
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,540
What is the line
that indicates the same temperature?

959
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,400
- An isotherm.
- That's right.

960
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,540
"Therm" in thermometer
and "therm" in isotherm.

961
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,130
- An isotherm.
- An isotherm.

962
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,540
My back is warm.

963
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,340
- The same temperature.
- An isotherm.

964
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,550
A line is drawn
to indicate the same temperature.

965
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,550
That is called an isotherm.

966
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,450
- This will surely be asked.
- What is it?

967
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,380
They will surely ask this.

968
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,260
High ground level house.

969
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,260
- What's that?
- Just look.

970
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,690
Why would a house
take on this shape?

971
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,380
- So that it won't be flooded?
- Exactly.

972
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,890
Compared to other areas...

973
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,560
- Because it rains in the summer?
- The house can be flooded.

974
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,430
- So on higher ground.
- Right. What is this called again?

975
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,890
A high ground level house.

976
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,300
What is the line that indicates...

977
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,060
the same temperature?

978
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,440
- An ondol?
- What is that line called?

979
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,480
The longitude?

980
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,280
- No, an isotherm.
- Oh, right.

981
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,640
(An isotherm)

982
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,810
- An isotherm.
- Right, an isotherm.

983
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,140
- An isotherm.
- That's right.

984
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,310
- An isotherm.
- Right.

985
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,140
- You know Bang Jeong Hwan, right?
- I don't.

986
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,140
(Admits proudly)

987
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,310
Bang Jeong Hwan. Who is he?

988
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,030
Please tell me.

989
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,380
He established Children's Day.

990
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,580
Mr. Bang Jeong Hwan.

991
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,730
Children's Day.

992
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,530
(May 5, Children's Day,
a day of innocent fun)

993
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,500
So that's his name. Children's Day.

994
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,330
Who wrote
"The Tale of Hong Gil Dong"?

995
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,500
(Who wrote
"The Tale of Hong Gil Dong"?)

996
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,060
- "The Tale of Hong Gil Dong".
- Hohyeonghoje.

997
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,400
(Hohyeonghoje!)

998
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,940
(Giggling)

999
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,570
Not being able to say
that his father is his father.

1000
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,550
Was that what you were getting at?

1001
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,640
That's not the case.
Hohyeonghoje means...

1002
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,610
a close friendship.

1003
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,750
That's what hohyeonghoje means.

1004
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,020
- You know...
- Bang Jeong Hwan, Children's Day.

1005
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,490
- "The Tale of Hong Gil Dong"...
- The writer.

1006
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,490
Who wrote it?

1007
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,290
- Heo Gyun.
- Right, Heo Gyun.

1008
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,430
Heo Gyun. It's like Heo Jun, right?

1009
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,700
Hey, an isotherm.

1010
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,320
- What's that?
- It's this.

1011
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,560
- The same temperature.
- The same temperature?

1012
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,660
The prefix "iso" means equal.

1013
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,160
- The same temperature...
- From 20 to 50 degrees.

1014
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,510
- I'm explaining what it is.
- An isotherm.

1015
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,630
The middle latitudes.
From 20 degrees to 50 degrees.

1016
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,300
- You have three minutes left.
- Say that again?

1017
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,870
- Three minutes.
- Hold on a second.

1018
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,250
Crude oil.

1019
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,750
Crude oil as in gasoline.

1020
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,480
I don't think my brain
can process more.

1021
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,840
No, don't think like that.

1022
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,080
The heavy chemical industry.

1023
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,550
I'm hungry.

1024
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,380
How can you even
think that right now?

1025
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,490
All three of them
must answer correctly.

1026
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,080
That's the catch here.

1027
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,820
- Those abandoned...
- Memorize what you wrote.

1028
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,590
The 5 rights and 5 duties.

1029
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,090
To be equal, to request...

1030
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,000
- To be equal, to request...
- Keep memorizing that.

1031
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,300
Please take your seats.

1032
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,060
I had to brush up on everything.

1033
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,970
Everybody...

1034
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,210
including the tutors.

1035
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,860
Your time is up.

1036
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,570
Please take your seats.

1037
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,870
- Sovereignty...
- Jong Kook!

1038
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,340
- Jong Kook!
- The land.

1039
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,180
- That's it.
- The land.

1040
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,570
Promise me you'll do well.

1041
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,640
My brain is packed with information.

1042
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,550
Please take your seats.

1043
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,310
- Your time is up.
- They'll ask what I didn't study.

1044
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,350
You can't possibly know everything.

1045
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,730
- However, you read the whole book.
- It would be impossible.

1046
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,820
No one can know all this.

1047
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,930
Article one.

1048
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,320
Article one.

1049
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,300
The Republic of Korea
shall be a democratic republic.

1050
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,820
The sovereignty of
the Republic of Korea...

1051
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,130
shall reside in the people,

1052
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,560
and all state authority
shall emanate from the people.

1053
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,160
Do you even know what you recited?

1054
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,330
I don't know.
Article one of the Constitution?

1055
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,070
We're doomed since
all three must answer correctly.

1056
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,280
Let your conscience
stop you from cheating.

1057
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,250
All right.

1058
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,050
I'll tell you the keyword first.

1059
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,290
Upon hearing that,

1060
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,960
Haha may use his chance cards
for 3 out of 15 questions.

1061
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,790
I forgot it all.

1062
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,150
- I forgot everything too.
- I...

1063
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,230
The first category is...

1064
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,530
Okay.

1065
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,530
Map.

1066
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,270
Yes, map. We studied a lot of them.

1067
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,700
- You knew a lot of the basics.
- I didn't study though.

1068
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,060
Here's the first question.

1069
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,160
Ji Hyo has basic knowledge
when it comes to maps.

1070
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,700
Her generation is used to maps.

1071
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,740
- On a climatic map...
- What?

1072
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,970
On a climatic map,

1073
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,850
what is the line that indicates
the same temperature?

1074
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,350
- We went over this!
- No clues are allowed.

1075
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,350
What is the line that indicates
the same temperature?

1076
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,680
We went over this!

1077
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,950
No clues are allowed.

1078
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,450
I'm sure they'll ask this.

1079
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,990
A line that indicates
the same temperature.

1080
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,890
- I said they'd ask this.
- What did you say?

1081
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,560
- Am I a genius or what?
- On a climatic map,

1082
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,390
what is the line that indicates
the same temperature?

1083
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,120
What did I tell you?

1084
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,470
- Can you please sit still?
- On a climatic map,

1085
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,930
what is the line that indicates
the same temperature?

1086
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,030
Toss it over to me
if you don't know.

1087
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,200
They lost their chance to do that.

1088
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,530
Can't they decide
after hearing the question?

1089
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,200
No, only after hearing the keyword.

1090
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,910
- Only So Min will know this.
- You'll get five seconds.

1091
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,580
- Is this correct?
- Five seconds.

1092
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,080
I reminded you...

1093
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,780
- right before you sat down.
- Five,

1094
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,720
- four...
- This was in the book.

1095
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,870
- Three...
- This...

1096
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,140
- Two...
- This one...

1097
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,490
- You know what it is, right?
- One!

1098
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,680
Please lift up your answers.

1099
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,120
It's an isotherm of course.

1100
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,350
- Please lift up your answers.
- An isotherm?

1101
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,560
- It's an isotherm of course.
- That's right.

1102
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,720
(Even Ssaebssaeb who was unsure
got it right.)

1103
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,390
- Ji Hyo...
- An isotherm?

1104
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,890
- Gosh.
- Ji Hyo wrote...

1105
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,990
the equator which is wrong.

1106
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,330
(Incorrect!)

1107
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,990
Is isotherm the right answer?

1108
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,200
- I reminded you before you sat.
- An isotherm!

1109
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,510
- But she got it wrong.
- What did I tell you?

1110
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,100
You didn't teach me this.

1111
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,870
- Ji Hyo, why...
- You said it'd be easy.

1112
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,280
We didn't go over the isotherm.

1113
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,640
- Why not?
- We just didn't.

1114
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
I didn't know.

1115
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,580
- An isotherm...
- We had to rush past it.

1116
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,870
But Mr. Gym...

1117
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,970
- Seriously?
- Sorry.

1118
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,910
- We didn't study that.
- How could you not?

1119
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,080
- We didn't study it.
- It was the obvious choice.

1120
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,560
I should've told you.

1121
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,120
- Check it out.
- Good job.

1122
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,220
- All right.
- I have isotherm written down.

1123
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,220
- Stop it, will you?
- Exactly.

1124
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,260
- Then...
- You're only a tutor for the day.

1125
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,830
The next category...

1126
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,390
is the law.

1127
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,240
- The law?
- This I can answer.

1128
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,470
- The law? You've got this.
- This I can answer.

1129
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,700
- I can answer it too.
- You've got this,

1130
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,830
- Ji Hyo.
- Hold on a second.

1131
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:15,240
- Without interferences of others...
- This I know.

1132
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,810
What do you call the authority
of a state to govern itself?

1133
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,240
- This I know.
- We studied this.

1134
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,490
Hold on a second.

1135
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,950
The right to make your own choices.

1136
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,410
- I kept telling you this.
- So Min,

1137
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,580
- you kept mentioning this.
- We all did.

1138
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,760
- Just a second.
- You can't give them clues.

1139
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,160
We went over this.

1140
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,450
- Just a second.
- You have five seconds!

1141
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,060
- This kept coming up.
- So Min, you did this, remember?

1142
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,120
It kept coming up.

1143
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,030
- I said it earlier.
- The right.

1144
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,060
I mentioned this.

1145
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,300
- Two...
- This...

1146
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,200
Just a second.
I'm sorry, but hold on.

1147
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,370
- This is an easy one.
- You can't say it out loud.

1148
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,530
- Three, two...
- Is this right?

1149
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,830
- Is it?
- One.

1150
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,470
- Lift up your answers.
- I taught her well.

1151
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,200
- Seriously?
- My gosh!

1152
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,850
- Lift up your answers.
- Restrictions?

1153
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,510
- He's a great tutor.
- Seriously?

1154
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,910
- Sovereignty.
- It's sovereignty.

1155
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,640
A right. Sovereignty.

1156
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,810
- Lift up your answers.
- Restrictions?

1157
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,810
He's a great tutor.

1158
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,450
- Seriously?
- My gosh!

1159
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,560
A right. Sovereignty.

1160
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,760
Sovereignty!

1161
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,950
- Se Chan, we went over this.
- Why didn't you answer instead?

1162
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,720
- You get three chances.
- Sovereignty!

1163
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,800
This they should know.
How can they not know this?

1164
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,370
- Se Chan, we went over this.
- I said it was a right.

1165
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,240
- Unbelievable.
- Sovereignty?

1166
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,740
- We went over it.
- But...

1167
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,030
- I apologize.
- The sovereignty...

1168
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,680
It's about time I intervened.

1169
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,830
I was thinking of the word hinge.

1170
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,450
The third category...

1171
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,280
is famous people.

1172
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,140
- I'm in!
- You've got this.

1173
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,810
We three should at least
get one question right.

1174
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:27,990
- Let's do this.
- You know the four names.

1175
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,390
We went over them all.

1176
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,390
Let it be those three.

1177
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,410
You've got this.

1178
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,990
I'm more worried about Se Chan.

1179
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,830
- Let's do this.
- You know the four names.

1180
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,850
- Let's answer this correctly.
- Here we go.

1181
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:40,120
- Against race discrimination...
- Okay, this is a done deal.

1182
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,990
(Okay!)

1183
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:46,370
- Ji Hyo, you know this.
- Who gave a speech about...

1184
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,260
humans having the same rights
regardless of skin color?

1185
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,870
- You mentioned this.
- She knows this.

1186
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,140
Martin Lucer King.

1187
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,180
It's "th" not "c."

1188
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,850
Martin Luther King.

1189
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,370
(The answer: Martin Luther King)

1190
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,240
- You said it yourself.
- I told you about this.

1191
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,780
- You said it yourself.
- You know this.

1192
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,550
- That's right.
- We went over this.

1193
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:03,990
Of course, they'd ask this.

1194
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,080
- Se Chan, I told you about him.
- All right.

1195
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,990
You even repeated the name.

1196
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,620
- You said it yourself.
- Ji Hyo knows this.

1197
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,390
- You're the best.
- What did I tell you?

1198
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,720
- You're the best.
- Of course, they'd ask about him.

1199
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,970
Two, three.

1200
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,260
- Martin Luther King.
- Nice!

1201
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,390
- Three.
- Is it Martin Luther King?

1202
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,160
- Nice!
- Nicely done!

1203
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,760
(The Three Empty Heads
all answer correctly!)

1204
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,410
(She remembered the "th" sound.)

1205
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,280
- Martin Luther King.
- Okay.

1206
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,910
So Min, how am I for a tutor?

1207
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,410
- I guessed every single one.
- It's as you said.

1208
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,740
- Right?
- Jae Suk guessed...

1209
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,350
the questions correctly too.

1210
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,010
Here's the next category.

1211
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,160
We can't afford
any more penalty balls.

1212
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,260
Here's the next question.

1213
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,720
The category is...

1214
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,890
index.

1215
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,620
What's an index?

1216
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,350
I studied this earlier.

1217
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,620
(Even the category
has them baffled.)

1218
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,890
- I think I can answer this.
- An index?

1219
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,370
- I don't know.
- Could it be...

1220
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,330
- Haha...
- He has better chances.

1221
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,700
- Yes, you have better chances.
- I agree.

1222
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,060
- You should answer this one.
- I'm pretty sure...

1223
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,640
that one of them
will answer incorrectly.

1224
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,530
Here we go.

1225
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,700
We should use Haha wisely.

1226
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,030
I knew all the answers up until now.

1227
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,850
A number of people living
in a unit of area...

1228
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,580
that measures its density.

1229
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,510
- You know this.
- We studied this, remember?

1230
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,720
One doesn't have to study
to know this.

1231
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,310
- Exactly.
- You know what this is.

1232
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,760
Use the words he just said.

1233
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,350
- The answer lies in the question.
- Exactly.

1234
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,560
Can you repeat the question?

1235
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,760
- The answer lies in the question.
- Exactly.

1236
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,850
- Can you repeat the question?
- The number of people...

1237
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,890
What measures the density of people
in a unit?

1238
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,760
- Haha, are you ready?
- Haha...

1239
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,120
Okay, he knows this.

1240
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,970
- It's hard to think of.
- But this...

1241
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,100
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

1242
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,510
- Yes!
- That's the one!

1243
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,660
That is correct.

1244
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,680
(Haha gets it right.)

1245
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,530
Who knew it'd be this easy?

1246
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,740
- The answer was in the question.
- I'm glad we turned to Haha.

1247
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,870
Here's the next question.

1248
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,780
To prevent...

1249
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,550
- houses from being flooded...
- I know this one.

1250
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,850
due to summer rain,

1251
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,060
this type of house was built
on higher ground.

1252
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,060
- Hold on.
- I think I know.

1253
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,300
- I wouldn't have known this.
- You studied this.

1254
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,430
You memorized this earlier.

1255
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,970
It's four syllables.
Give me a second.

1256
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,870
- I'll give you five seconds.
- Hold on!

1257
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,060
- It's four syllables.
- This is bad.

1258
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,060
Can I stick to three syllables?

1259
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,060
No, you should write down
the correct answer.

1260
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,100
Just three syllables?

1261
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,430
- If it's three syllables...
- Se Chan,

1262
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,180
- you know this one.
- He should write down the answer.

1263
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,010
I mentioned this.

1264
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,410
"Can I stick to three syllables?"

1265
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,220
- Then it wouldn't be the answer.
- I mentioned this.

1266
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,240
- All right.
- Let me try again.

1267
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,910
Don't you remember the photo?

1268
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,140
The house is on higher ground.

1269
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,660
- That's right.
- All right.

1270
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,260
- You repeated this.
- Three.

1271
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,450
Two...

1272
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,030
(Will they all have
the correct answer again?)

1273
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,200
One. Show us your answers.

1274
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,830
Is it high ground level house?

1275
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,390
(Se Chan got it right!)

1276
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,430
High ground level house.

1277
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,530
It's all right.

1278
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,370
- High ground?
- You did well.

1279
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,430
- That's where you build it.
- What's the answer?

1280
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,430
Isn't it high ground level site?

1281
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,810
Seriously?

1282
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,640
The answer is
high ground level house.

1283
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,680
(Only Se Chan gets it right
which means they fail.)

1284
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,350
(Jae Suk couldn't be prouder.)

1285
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,950
Is it a competition
between tutors too?

1286
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,080
How did he memorize that?

1287
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,080
- High ground level house...
- The tutors go head-to-head.

1288
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,390
How did I remember this?

1289
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,510
The tutors...

1290
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,120
I couldn't remember
the first syllable.

1291
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,720
(The tutors' moods shift
depending on the answers.)

1292
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,620
(Jae Suk is really proud of him.)

1293
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,800
It's okay. It's not the area
you focused on.

1294
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,100
Mr. Gym.

1295
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,240
Your student is falling behind.

1296
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,200
No, she's not!
Your student got it wrong too!

1297
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,600
No, at least she got
the first letter right.

1298
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,140
- I'm so proud of you.
- Your student memorized it herself.

1299
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,280
You managed to memorize it.

1300
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,850
But this doesn't look like
a team game.

1301
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,350
It looks like a battle
between the teachers.

1302
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,620
- But it's...
- No, that's not it.

1303
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,620
She learned it herself.

1304
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,620
- Mr. Gym.
- You didn't teach her that.

1305
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,810
It feels so rewarding
to be a teacher.

1306
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,760
When your student does well,

1307
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,810
- it makes me feel great.
- Why would you feel great?

1308
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,620
- You can do it!
- All three of them should get it.

1309
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,760
- He's doing so well.
- You're only thinking of him.

1310
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,950
- Ji Hyo has her own strengths.
- My student...

1311
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,330
My student memorized
the answer I told him.

1312
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,220
- Let's do this!
- And he got the answer.

1313
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,390
- Well done.
- I did memorize it.

1314
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,930
- Ji Hyo, it's okay.
- I should stop my family...

1315
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,490
from watching this episode.

1316
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,530
This is driving me crazy.

1317
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,100
Here's the sixth question.

1318
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:45,180
- The keyword is geography.
- Geography?

1319
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,470
- You're good with geography, right?
- You studied this area.

1320
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,600
- Yes, I am.
- You're good with geography.

1321
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,850
- Geography?
- She's good with geography.

1322
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:51,140
Se Chan, you covered everything.
You went over it all.

1323
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,970
- Geography? Bring it on.
- Let's do this.

1324
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,050
Let's do it.

1325
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:58,450
What is the highway that connects
Asia and Europe called?

1326
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,060
- See? We covered this.
- You know the answer, right?

1327
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,220
We covered it earlier.

1328
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,160
(What is the highway that connects
Asia and Europe called?)

1329
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,490
(Se Chan writes down the answer
as soon as he hears it.)

1330
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,470
We covered it earlier!

1331
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,530
- Se Chan! We covered this!
- We covered it earlier.

1332
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,140
My gosh, quizzes are fun...

1333
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,140
when you know the answer.

1334
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,700
- He just realized it.
- Quizzes are fun!

1335
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,970
- I mean...
- Hey.

1336
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,310
Oh, it's called the Asian Highway?

1337
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,550
- What's that?
- The Asian Highway.

1338
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,280
The answer
is in the question itself.

1339
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,120
- Can you repeat the question?
- Hold on.

1340
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,780
What is the highway that connects
Asia and Europe called?

1341
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,780
(The Asian Highway)

1342
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,510
I repeatedly told her this.

1343
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,890
- I kept telling this to her.
- She can't remember it.

1344
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,120
My gosh, Se Chan. You might
make it to SNU at this rate.

1345
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,430
- In 3, 2...
- What's the question again?

1346
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,560
- It connects Asia and Europe.
- Open.

1347
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,330
- No, that's not it.
- What was that?

1348
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,060
- What was that?
- Hey!

1349
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,330
What was that?

1350
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,080
(So Min didn't write anything,
and Se Chan forgot to add an N.)

1351
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,140
What was that?

1352
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,580
(What did Ji Hyo write?)

1353
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,310
- Ji Hyo.
- She wrote only highway.

1354
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,470
There's another word before it.

1355
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:59,810
- "High-pass"?
- "High-pass"?

1356
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,490
Ji Hyo.

1357
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,050
- Ji Hyo. She's...
- I wrote "highway" at first!

1358
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,850
- She got a lot funnier.
- What was that?

1359
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:06,280
- "High-pass"?
- Hey!

1360
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,330
- She got a lot funnier.
- What did she write?

1361
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,530
- You became a lot funnier.
- The answer is the Asian Highway?

1362
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:12,560
My gosh, she's...

1363
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,830
But isn't "high-pass"
too far-fetched?

1364
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,390
- Jong Kook.
- Wait.

1365
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:18,760
- My gosh.
- She got a lot funnier.

1366
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,240
- She's incredible.
- So is the answer "highway"?

1367
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,640
- I was right.
- It is highway.

1368
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,140
- I thought it was "Asia" highway.
- Oh, it's the Asian Highway?

1369
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,580
Se Chan is better than the others.

1370
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,580
It's my first time getting answers
quickly during a quiz.

1371
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,140
I even wrote the answer before
he finished reading the question.

1372
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,550
- Even before...
- Before the question ended.

1373
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,050
- I got the answer right away.
- Se Chan, do you see it now?

1374
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,810
- You wrote it like this.
- Do you see it now?

1375
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:39,390
This is why we must learn
from the first-tier teacher!

1376
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,620
- That's right.
- You remember the word "highway".

1377
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,720
Yes, but that's
all I could remember.

1378
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,160
But the answer is the Asian Highway.

1379
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,030
I'll open a study room
for variety shows.

1380
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,060
- You should!
- I'll open a study room.

1381
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,700
All right, then.
The next keyword is geography.

1382
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,870
- Geography?
- It's geography.

1383
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,530
- Haha should answer it.
- Haha, go for it.

1384
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,910
- All right.
- We need to get the right answer.

1385
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,200
- All right.
- You know the answer, right?

1386
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:58,600
- That's it!
- Correct.

1387
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,970
- All right!
- Good job.

1388
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,370
(He got an easy question and
manages to act as the top student.)

1389
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,470
- All right!
- That's not what I had in mind.

1390
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,510
Haha, you're contributing a lot.

1391
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,550
- Of course.
- You got most of the questions.

1392
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,390
- This is great.
- Get another one.

1393
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:09,780
It'll be great
if he gets one more question.

1394
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,160
Why is it so nerve-racking?

1395
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,220
Write down the five duties
of a citizen...

1396
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,180
under the constitution.

1397
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,990
- Ji Hyo, you got this.
- We covered the five duties.

1398
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:19,620
- Not the rights but duties, right?
- The five duties we memorized.

1399
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,300
- It's the duties, not rights.
- It's the duties.

1400
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,970
- Se Chan, it's the duties.
- It's the duties.

1401
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,470
My gosh, you're writing the answer
without hesitation.

1402
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,310
- You're a genius!
- I wrote it down...

1403
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:31,030
as soon as I heard the question.

1404
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,200
You're amazing.

1405
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,280
You're at the top of the class.

1406
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:38,510
- Quizzes are so fun!
- You're the master of study.

1407
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,780
I was indeed the master.

1408
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,410
- You have the brain for it.
- I can't remember one.

1409
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:43,550
- What? Why can't you remember one?
- I can't remember one.

1410
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,910
I helped you memorize...

1411
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:47,850
the duties in order.

1412
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,330
- I told you...
- You have to do this...

1413
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:50,830
- this will come out for sure.
- after this.

1414
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:52,760
Someone who does this
will have to do this too.

1415
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,160
- Ji Hyo, remember the last one?
- Hold on.

1416
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,470
I can't remember anything.

1417
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,330
Why can't you remember it?

1418
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,330
(He's also confronted
with teaching by rote.)

1419
00:44:58,330 --> 00:44:59,600
Why can't you remember it?

1420
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,700
- You must remember it.
- It's easy once you understand it.

1421
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,930
- It's the most basic thing.
- Right.

1422
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,550
In 1, 2, 3. Open.

1423
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,740
- Let's see.
- We talked about this earlier.

1424
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,720
(Taxation, national defense,
education, protect environment...)

1425
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,720
No, you don't get one's
money's worth with environment.

1426
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,180
- In 1, 2, 3. Open. Let's see.
- We talked about this earlier.

1427
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,810
(Taxation, national defense,
get one's money's worth with...)

1428
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:21,120
"Get one's money's worth"?

1429
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,530
No, you don't get one's
money's worth with environment.

1430
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:25,720
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry about that.

1431
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,300
- That one is fine.
- She wrote it wrong.

1432
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,720
- Please go back to your seat.
- Ji Hyo.

1433
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,890
- It's "protection".
- I got it.

1434
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:32,140
- How could you write that?
- I did well. I got it.

1435
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,640
- Get one's money's worth?
- No, that's not it.

1436
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,970
This is what happens
when you memorize the answers...

1437
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,310
in a short amount of time.

1438
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,080
You need to understand the question.

1439
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,280
No, this is...

1440
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,850
She couldn't go wrong with this.
She wrote it wrong.

1441
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:45,180
- She wrote it wrong.
- Since it's a meaningful question,

1442
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,510
we'll accept her answer.

1443
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,780
- Yes!
- Of course.

1444
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:52,410
Se Chan, you're incredible.

1445
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,930
- You're pretty smart.
- You should compliment others too.

1446
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,220
I should be...

1447
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,490
- complimenting mine first.
- They all wrote the answer.

1448
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,850
- Stop it, already!
- You should compliment everyone.

1449
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,200
She wrote,
"get one's money's worth".

1450
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,120
Compliment them too.
We're all in one team.

1451
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,970
- Okay.
- We're all in one team.

1452
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,330
- Yes, we are,
- That's right.

1453
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,660
but he's admirable.

1454
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,260
- Yes, he is, but...
- He knows...

1455
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,830
the five duties of a citizen.

1456
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,600
- She knows it too.
- I know.

1457
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,700
She knows it too.

1458
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,100
Se Chan knows the five duties.

1459
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,910
Ji Hyo knows it too.

1460
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,850
- So Min knows it too.
- So Min knows it.

1461
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:21,310
- They all know.
- Right.

1462
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:23,080
- You should be more understanding.
- They're so awesome.

1463
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,010
They all know
the five duties of a citizen.

1464
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,580
Now I finally understand how
my homeroom teacher must've felt.

1465
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:29,830
- We got them wrong.
- Right.

1466
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,330
Gosh, we got them wrong.

1467
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,200
The next keyword is industry.

1468
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,220
- I don't think...
- I don't think we covered it.

1469
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,390
- we covered it.
- It's about industries.

1470
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:39,100
- We didn't cover it either.
- We did cover it briefly.

1471
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,810
- It's about industries.
- We covered it.

1472
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,030
- The one I mentioned earlier!
- We did?

1473
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,970
We talked about the industries
in each city.

1474
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,310
(He remembers it.)

1475
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:46,700
- We did, right?
- Yes.

1476
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,200
- You remember it, right?
- Oh, this...

1477
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,870
- Let's make Haha answer it.
- Like the industry...

1478
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,080
Pohang is known for?

1479
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,810
- Let's have Haha answer it.
- Haha should do it.

1480
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,080
- We didn't cover this area.
- No, we didn't.

1481
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,580
- I'm not so confident though.
- It's your third time, right?

1482
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,990
- I think I know the question.
- It's an industry...

1483
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,890
that makes heavy products...

1484
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:01,890
or one that uses crude oil
to make various products.

1485
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:03,660
- I memorized it.
- Crude oil?

1486
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,100
(Industry that makes heavy products
or uses crude oil for many products)

1487
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,890
The question has a hint
of the answer.

1488
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:10,560
It says it makes heavy products.

1489
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,200
(Industry that makes heavy products
or uses crude oil for many products)

1490
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,470
- It makes heavy products.
- It uses Chinese characters.

1491
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:17,330
- I'll give you three seconds.
- Then it must have "heavy" in it.

1492
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:18,700
Heavy...

1493
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,700
- Three...
- Hold on.

1494
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,780
(The answer is
the heavy chemical industry.)

1495
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,050
(Right then, Se Chan
remembered something.)

1496
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,490
The heavy chemical industry.

1497
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,620
Heavy chemical
as in "Chinese restaurants".

1498
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,780
Yes, the heavy chemical industry.

1499
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:32,620
Just remember that petroleum...

1500
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,760
Jae Suk,
is it the heavy chemical industry?

1501
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,430
You can do it, Haha.

1502
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:38,490
The top student knows the answer.

1503
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:39,620
- You know the answer?
- Don't you know the answer, Ji Hyo?

1504
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,700
Ji Hyo, you know the answer, right?

1505
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,030
You know the answer?

1506
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,260
I forgot. What is it?

1507
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,330
(He confirms it.)

1508
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,030
This is the basics!

1509
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,830
My gosh.

1510
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,140
- Se Chan knows it all.
- This is crazy.

1511
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,140
I'm so proud of you.

1512
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,240
Haha, I'll give you three seconds.

1513
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,470
- Heavy... Darn it.
- Two, one. Time's up.

1514
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,720
- Did you write your answer?
- Hey.

1515
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,470
- What did you write?
- "Queen"?

1516
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,490
- Doesn't it begin with "heavy"?
- Her Majesty the Queen?

1517
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,490
- Doesn't it begin with "heavy"?
- Her Majesty the Queen?

1518
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,990
- "Chinese restaurant".
- Let's see Se Chan's answer.

1519
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,310
You brat!

1520
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,030
(Chinese restaurant industry?)

1521
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:10,160
- Hey.
- What's the answer?

1522
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:11,800
- It's "heavy chemical"!
- Hey!

1523
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,930
You shouldn't have acted
like you knew the answer.

1524
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,600
- Isn't it correct?
- It's "heavy chemical"!

1525
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,740
- It's "heavy chemical"!
- I only memorized the first part.

1526
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,600
- "Chinese restaurant".
- I only memorized that part.

1527
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,700
Why did you mention
Chinese restaurant?

1528
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,970
He called it
Chinese restaurant industry.

1529
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:28,870
(The side effects of the mnemonics
that the top student has been using)

1530
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:30,810
I only memorized the first part.

1531
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:33,280
That's the funniest thing.
Chinese restaurant industry.

1532
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,780
- He can only go so far.
- Oh, it's heavy chemical industry?

1533
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,740
- He can only go so far.
- Oh, it's heavy chemical industry.

1534
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:38,450
I didn't memorize the latter part.

1535
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:39,890
- I'm done with it, right?
- Yes.

1536
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,890
The next keyword is law.

1537
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:44,530
- Students, you can do it!
- Let's do it!

1538
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,950
- Ji Hyo, you learned it.
- I got this.

1539
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:50,330
The day the constitution
was promulgated.

1540
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:54,510
(The day the constitution
was promulgated)

1541
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:57,010
(The answer is Constitution Day.)

1542
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,830
The day the constitution
was promulgated.

1543
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,810
They knew the answer
before studying it.

1544
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,810
The day the constitution
was promulgated.

1545
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,620
You know the answer
even if you don't study it.

1546
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:11,890
(Se Chan also learned it
from Jae Suk.)

1547
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:13,010
The day the constitution
was promulgated.

1548
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:15,680
The word itself means
they enacted the constitution.

1549
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,600
- Oh, does it?
- Constitution Day.

1550
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:22,830
(Anyone can get the answer
if they don't think deeply.)

1551
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:23,870
This is... Hold on.

1552
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:25,030
You even memorized it.

1553
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:26,740
- This is...
- Three, two, one, open.

1554
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,030
(Will they be able
to get the answer?)

1555
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,330
Open.

1556
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:33,100
- No, that's not it.
- No? Isn't it Constitutional Day?

1557
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,100
(Constitutional Day,
the Day of Constitution)

1558
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,200
(Ji Hyo and So Min
got the wrong answer.)

1559
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,850
- No, that's not it.
- No? Isn't it Constitutional Day?

1560
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:40,680
(What did Se Chan write?)

1561
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,740
(Constitution Day)

1562
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,310
He got the answer.

1563
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:44,620
You got it?

1564
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,060
(He's the only one
who got the right answer.)

1565
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,180
It's Constitution Day, right?

1566
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,390
He got the answer?

1567
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,060
Jae Suk!

1568
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:51,890
He got the answer?

1569
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,720
You got the answer?

1570
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,490
- You must know this!
- You got the answer?

1571
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,260
You got the answer?

1572
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,990
The day the constitution
was enacted.

1573
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,160
- It's Constitution Day!
- He got the answer!

1574
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:05,200
- Dear viewers, he got the answer!
- But this is...

1575
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,430
I wasn't sure of the answer.

1576
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:09,140
- The day the constitution...
- I know.

1577
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,700
This has nothing to do with studies.

1578
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,410
- I really knew the answer.
- It's Constitution Day.

1579
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,080
See? I even wrote the first letter.

1580
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,550
- You did?
- You should've written it.

1581
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,120
- You should've written it.
- I didn't think that'd be it.

1582
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,890
It's a miracle, right?

1583
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,220
- Yes, Mr. Yoo.
- Right.

1584
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,280
Thank you so much.

1585
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,120
What's with Constitutional Day?
Gosh.

1586
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:27,720
- Will you stay quiet?
- But that's...

1587
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,160
The Day of Constitution
isn't any better.

1588
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,990
Is the Day of Constitution
isn't any better?

1589
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:32,800
- What I'm saying is...
- Mr. Gym.

1590
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,330
You can mock her only when
your student got the right answer.

1591
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:38,330
- It's about the constitution, so...
- Sir.

1592
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,080
This happens because you made them
memorize the answers...

1593
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,780
in a short term.
You have to make them understand.

1594
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:43,850
- They can't think of it.
- It's not about understanding them.

1595
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,680
You always get a day off
on Constitution Day!

1596
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,470
You must know
what Constitution Day is!

1597
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:48,910
What's so great about him?

1598
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:52,950
Look at him. He understood it.
That's how he remembered it.

1599
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:54,160
What I'm saying is...

1600
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,280
Right. I remember seeing teachers
fighting with each other.

1601
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,490
- With each other?
- Yes.

1602
00:50:58,490 --> 00:50:59,930
They fight because they think
their students are better.

1603
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,030
- How can they not know...
- You must know...

1604
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,030
what Constitution Day is?

1605
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:04,890
- what Constitution Day is.
- Exactly.

1606
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,140
It's Constitution Day, of all days.

1607
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,030
- The students...
- "Why are we getting a day off?"

1608
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,370
- No.
- "Because it's Constitution Day."

1609
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:10,970
It's Constitution Day.
"Why are we getting a day off?"

1610
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:12,810
"Mom, why are we getting a day off?"

1611
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:14,740
- "Because it's Constitution Day."
- What I'm saying is...

1612
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:15,740
Mr. Gym.

1613
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,120
The more you fight with each other,

1614
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,950
- I know you're right, but...
- the more suffocated we feel!

1615
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,720
You need to understand the question.

1616
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,780
- Why must you understand it?
- You don't even know...

1617
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,010
- what's in the constitution.
- Just forget it.

1618
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:27,760
- Forget it!
- Hey, mister.

1619
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,580
- Wait.
- Why are you assaulting a student?

1620
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,430
- It's not like you know everything.
- Hey!

1621
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:32,660
- Don't do this!
- What do you think you're doing?

1622
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,600
- Don't do that to the students.
- Get this man out of here.

1623
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,720
How are you any better than So Min?

1624
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:38,390
What did you say?

1625
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:39,800
How are you any better than So Min?

1626
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,060
He's really smart.

1627
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,810
- What do you mean he's smart?
- Just go!

1628
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:44,930
- Okay, let's sit down.
- Goodness.

1629
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:46,970
- Please sit down.
- Give us the next question.

1630
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,010
A teacher is tormenting a student.

1631
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,850
- You need to calm down.
- Mr. Ji.

1632
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:51,910
- Yes?
- Why do you keep pointing...

1633
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:53,010
your finger at my student?

1634
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,910
- It's because...
- I do that to everyone.

1635
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:56,120
Why would you point your finger...

1636
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,510
- at him?
- Look at this guy.

1637
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,890
- Why would you point your finger?
- Why did you poke me?

1638
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,310
Please don't fight!

1639
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:01,330
(Please don't fight!)

1640
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:04,330
- Please don't fight!
- How dare you?

1641
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,530
- Wait a minute.
- How dare you poke a teacher?

1642
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:07,830
Look at this guy.

1643
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:08,970
- How dare you throw my cap off?
- What about it?

1644
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,970
What's so great about him?

1645
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:13,030
- I know.
- The kids are okay with it.

1646
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,810
Why are you all making so much fuss?

1647
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:15,810
(Why are you
all making so much fuss?)

1648
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:17,970
Hold on. Who are you?

1649
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:20,410
- I'm the top student.
- The top student?

1650
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:22,850
What have you ever taught me?

1651
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,870
- Hey.
- I did it all by myself!

1652
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,370
What do you mean? You must've
gotten all three questions...

1653
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:29,280
- if you're a top student.
- Gosh, seriously.

1654
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,720
The next keyword
is general social studies.

1655
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:33,850
Social studies?

1656
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,800
It's the norm that all members
of a society...

1657
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,600
must follow in conscience.

1658
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,620
- Se Chan, you know this.
- This is...

1659
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,640
(The answer is ethics.)

1660
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,430
Se Chan, you know the answer.

1661
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,430
It's the norm that all members
of a society...

1662
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:52,510
must follow in conscience.

1663
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,870
It's about conscience.

1664
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,550
All right.

1665
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:56,910
(Se Chan and So Min wrote down
the answer without hesitating.)

1666
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:58,310
They must know the answer.

1667
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:00,370
In three,

1668
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,140
- two,
- You know the answer.

1669
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,140
(Ji Hyo is also writing something.
Will they get it right this time?)

1670
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,350
one. Open!

1671
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:06,890
- Is this the answer?
- I'm not sure about it.

1672
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:08,930
Ethics! It's correct!

1673
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:13,160
- Ethics.
- Ethics!

1674
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,030
- Legislation?
- What do you mean by legislation?

1675
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,530
- Ethics.
- Ethics!

1676
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:19,060
(Dropping his head)

1677
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:21,330
- It's ethics!
- How can you write legislation?

1678
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:22,740
- Well done!
- Was it supposed to be this one?

1679
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,530
- It was really easy.
- I got it.

1680
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,910
Yes! This is what I'm talking about.

1681
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,640
- This is what I'm talking about.
- This is what I'm talking about.

1682
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,370
- Our society is still ethical!
- This is it!

1683
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:32,510
- This is what I'm talking about.
- It was nothing difficult.

1684
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,490
- It's all my fault.
- I'm sorry, Jong Kook.

1685
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:38,350
So Min got the answer.

1686
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:39,810
- I...
- They asked all the questions...

1687
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:41,260
that Jae Suk picked.

1688
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,930
It's okay. It can happen.
I understand.

1689
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,030
Ji Hyo, your agency
must stop this episode...

1690
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,430
from airing.

1691
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:49,530
(Your agency must stop this episode
from airing.)

1692
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:53,300
To improve the average grade,

1693
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,510
To be honest...

1694
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,740
the teachers must
pay more attention.

1695
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,740
- That's not it.
- Are you a principal or something?

1696
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,140
- She got the answers too.
- No, I'm not.

1697
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,310
Why are you saying this
when she can hear it?

1698
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:02,450
- I think...
- You're a teacher.

1699
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:04,640
(Why are you saying this
when she can hear it?)

1700
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,050
Why are the teachers fighting again?

1701
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:08,640
We could go to the back
and talk quietly.

1702
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,410
Or you could've texted me.

1703
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,280
- Text?
- She could hear you.

1704
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,390
How could you say that
in front of her?

1705
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,950
- Did I mean to do that?
- I can't believe this guy.

1706
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:16,780
- She could hear you.
- Did I mean to let her hear it?

1707
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,950
She heard you.

1708
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,720
- I...
- Toegye Yi Hwang once said...

1709
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,120
you should watch what you say
because even cows can hear you.

1710
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,120
- He told you to be careful,
- Hold on.

1711
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,760
- but you were...
- Mr. Gym.

1712
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,330
Ji Hyo is old enough.
She's not a kid.

1713
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:29,430
That doesn't matter.
You shouldn't have said it...

1714
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,930
in front of her.
We could've stepped outside.

1715
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:34,030
Screw the education system of Korea!

1716
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,050
(Screw the education system
of Korea!)

1717
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:39,280
(A cry that echoed
through the classroom)

1718
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,140
Why that little punk... Hey!

1719
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:47,680
(They slowly get up on their desks.)

1720
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:50,720
Everyone, get up!

1721
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,220
(Everyone, get up!)

1722
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,560
Everyone, get up!

1723
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,620
(The voices of the students...)

1724
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:59,330
(that little Haha,
who's only 168cm tall, drew out.)

1725
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:02,430
(Everyone, get up!)

1726
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:05,370
Everyone, get up!

1727
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:13,370
(What we want)

1728
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:16,280
What we want

1729
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,890
(The students deliver what they want
in harmony)

1730
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:20,910
Nice.

1731
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,700
(The teachers were awakened
by the students' performance.)

1732
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:28,330
(Happiness doesn't come
from good grades.)

1733
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:30,620
- It was like a movie.
- It's okay.

1734
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,740
"Everyone, get up."

1735
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,830
- We...
- I'm sorry, but...

1736
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:36,370
We pushed the students to compete
in the college entrance exam.

1737
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:38,330
- This is the last question.
- Okay.

1738
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:39,330
Let's do this.

1739
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:40,430
Here's the last question.

1740
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:41,510
It's not easy
for all three of them...

1741
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:42,550
- to get the answer.
- Of course.

1742
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:44,640
What's the name
of the mountain range...

1743
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,510
that blocks
the cold northwesterly winds?

1744
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,950
- I don't know the answer.
- Hey!

1745
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,120
(What's the name
of the mountain range...)

1746
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,280
(that blocks
the cold northwesterly winds?)

1747
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:53,010
(Se Chan quickly writes down
the answer.)

1748
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:54,850
- Se Chan, we covered this.
- Look at him writing it down.

1749
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,030
Se Chan, we covered this!

1750
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:57,720
He writes it down
without any hesitation.

1751
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,390
He doesn't hesitate at all.

1752
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:00,450
It's like a movie.

1753
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,600
- Hey, Se Chan!
- He doesn't hesitate at all.

1754
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,560
- We covered this!
- What is it?

1755
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,660
We...

1756
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,930
- Hold on.
- I'll give you three seconds.

1757
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,060
Hey, think carefully.

1758
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,760
- The northwesterly winds?
- It...

1759
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,530
It blocks the winds.

1760
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:12,970
Think of it with common sense.

1761
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,600
Think of it with common sense!

1762
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,640
- It's common sense.
- You didn't cover this part,

1763
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,050
- but you can do it, So Min.
- Se Chan.

1764
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,680
(So Min is writing down something.)

1765
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,310
What's the name
of the mountain range...

1766
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,950
that blocks
the cold northwesterly winds?

1767
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,810
- You can do it!
- Remember the mountain range?

1768
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,760
- Just write one of the ranges.
- You can do it!

1769
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,850
I told you that was why
that area is warm.

1770
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:34,200
Ji Hyo, just write down
any mountain range you know.

1771
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,660
- The one you know.
- I can't remember it.

1772
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,700
- Just one of the mountain ranges.
- Mr. Gym.

1773
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,140
- I think I saw it.
- Stay quiet.

1774
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,700
Ji Hyo is getting pressured.

1775
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,760
I'm just sitting still here.

1776
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,930
But you're running your mouth.
That's why I'm saying this!

1777
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:46,970
(What did you say?)

1778
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,140
- Hold on.
- The teachers are fighting again.

1779
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,740
- I apologize.
- My gosh.

1780
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,510
I think I crossed the line.

1781
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:54,780
The kids are at ease,
but the teachers are too worked up.

1782
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,310
- All right, now. In 3, 2...
- Okay!

1783
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:58,950
- One.
- Just write down one that you know.

1784
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,120
- Open.
- All right.

1785
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,220
Think of it. Think of one.

1786
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,580
(Ji Hyo wrote
the Taebaek Mountain Range.)

1787
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:06,390
- I don't think this is the answer.
- Think of it. Think of one.

1788
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:07,930
- This is wrong, right?
- They got it.

1789
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:09,030
Correct!

1790
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,970
I told you! It's the mountain range
you know of!

1791
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:13,600
(All 3 of them got it.)

1792
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,140
- I didn't know.
- You did it!

1793
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,930
- You did it!
- I wasn't sure.

1794
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:18,080
I even wrote Hangyeryeong.

1795
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,240
She almost wrote Hangyeryeong
for the answer.

1796
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,080
I wrote the answer before he even
finished reading the question.

1797
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:24,140
Mr. Yoo. I wrote it before he even
finished reading the question.

1798
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,510
- You remembered it, right?
- I did.

1799
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,010
So Min even drew the mountain range!

1800
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,950
The only mountain range I know of
is Taebaek Mountain Range.

1801
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:32,280
So Min even drew
the mountain range, everyone!

1802
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,310
She drew the Taebaek Mountain Range.

1803
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:36,060
- What's it called again?
- "Sky Castle".

1804
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,850
She almost wrote Hangyeryeong
for the answer.

1805
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,160
Gosh, my throat hurts.

1806
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,220
She knows where it is.

1807
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,200
- She even knows where it is.
- Ji Hyo even knows...

1808
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,220
what Hangyeryeong is.

1809
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,930
- She knows what Hangyeryeong is?
- Yes!

1810
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,240
Well done!

1811
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,310
- Good job, So Min.
- Well done, Empty Heads!

1812
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:51,680
- We did pretty well.
- This wraps up the game.

1813
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,430
- We lost, but we fought well.
- We did.

1814
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:55,950
The cast gets 9 penalty balls,
and the staff gets 6 penalty balls.

1815
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:57,350
- Well done.
- Well done, Ji Hyo.

1816
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:00,050
We were going to lose anyway.

1817
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,140
(Lunchtime)

1818
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:04,280
Se Chan, please move
to the waiting room.

1819
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,620
- The top student.
- I'll be tactful.

1820
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:08,010
- Okay.
- He'd have gone to SNU...

1821
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:09,620
if he put his mind to his studies.

1822
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,260
It's not that easy to go to SNU.

1823
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:13,990
I'm just saying.

1824
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,930
What could it be?

1825
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:18,390
(The new top student
carefully steps out of the room.)

1826
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:22,910
(And the producer
is waiting for him.)

1827
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:25,510
(What kind of mission awaits him?)

1828
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:27,430
- All right.
- From now,

1829
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:30,870
we'll check how well you can
communicate through telepathy.

1830
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:31,870
Okay.

1831
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:34,680
Pick a member whom you think
won't be chosen by anyone...

1832
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,010
except for you.

1833
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:37,850
Someone whom I think won't be
chosen by anyone except me?

1834
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:39,490
You won't get additional
penalty balls...

1835
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:41,120
if the members you pick
do not overlap.

1836
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,490
- If they don't overlap?
- But...

1837
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:46,330
we'll give you penalty balls
as many as the unchosen members.

1838
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,930
You should pick a member
that only you will choose.

1839
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:52,760
(Each member should pick different
members, so they don't overlap.)

1840
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,970
(Se Chan, Jae Suk, Suk Jin,
Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, Haha, So Min)

1841
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:55,010
I'll pick...

1842
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,140
Jae Suk.

1843
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,140
- Do I take it with me?
- I'll pick this person.

1844
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:01,410
- You picked Haha.
- Yes.

1845
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,080
I'll pick her. Do I take it with me?

1846
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,310
- Then I'll pick Jong Kook.
- Okay. Take that with you.

1847
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:08,720
Of course, I'll pick Ji Hyo.

1848
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,310
- You can take that with you.
- All right.

1849
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:13,680
- I pick So Min.
- Take it with you.

1850
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,120
I think somehow no one picked her.

1851
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,120
Because So Min is going last...

1852
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,830
- It's okay. You did well.
- That's why I picked her.

1853
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:18,930
So far, it's good.

1854
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,430
I thought you'd avoid choosing
members that everyone would choose,

1855
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:23,760
so I picked one
that anyone would choose.

1856
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,030
- That's good thinking.
- So who did you pick?

1857
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:26,240
- You did well.
- I picked Suk Jin.

1858
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,060
(She picked Suk Jin.)

1859
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,510
(She avoided picking
an overlapping member.)

1860
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,240
You did really well.

1861
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,140
Well done.

1862
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,430
Only one of us was overlapped.

1863
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:37,050
Because you have a connection
with him...

1864
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:38,410
- She did really well.
- Well done.

1865
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:39,780
- Well done.
- Who did you pick?

1866
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,850
Only one of us was overlapped.

1867
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:42,010
What's the result?

1868
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,220
- Only one member.
- Only one member.

1869
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:44,510
We're incredible.

1870
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:45,890
- We did such a good job.
- We're good.

1871
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:47,510
We have wonderful teamwork.

1872
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:48,760
Our teamwork is really good.

1873
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,080
The staff gets six penalty balls,

1874
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,830
and the cast gets just one.

1875
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,220
- What will you do?
- We should...

1876
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,330
We should let them
experience the water bomb.

1877
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,470
- Bring in their meal.
- We all picked different people.

1878
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,510
It's incredible, isn't it?

1879
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:04,060
I guess it's another PPL.

1880
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,370
What's this? Thank you.

1881
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:08,240
It's so neat.

1882
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,600
- This is a meal box?
- It looks so good.

1883
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,220
This is amazing.

1884
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:15,050
- Look at the meat.
- It's solid.

1885
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:17,890
- I guess we mix it with rice.
- There's a pile of meat.

1886
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,660
We obviously
need to mix it with rice.

1887
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:22,030
Meal boxes
usually aren't this solid.

1888
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:23,030
There's wasabi too.

1889
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:25,390
- It'll be nice for a photo too.
- It's incredible.

1890
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:26,720
Is this even profitable?

1891
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,950
(Is this even profitable?)

1892
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:29,700
- Why would you worry about that?
- A PPL expert.

1893
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,640
You don't even know how much it is.

1894
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,530
(They caught the fraud red-handed.)

1895
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:34,640
How is it?

1896
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,060
You know how to cook.

1897
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:38,640
It's perfect for me.

1898
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:41,640
It'd be nice with octopus too.

1899
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,580
The yolk is a game-changer.

1900
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:44,870
It's so good.

1901
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:46,810
We don't need any other side dishes.

1902
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:50,620
It's our favorite.

1903
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,660
- What's this?
- It's table tennis.

1904
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:54,620
- Gosh, it's table tennis.
- Is it table tennis?

1905
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,160
- We love table tennis.
- I know.

1906
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,300
We love it.

1907
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,930
Will we go against
the production crew? What?

1908
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,970
I guess we will.
They took off their clothes.

1909
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:04,760
(The production crew changed
into group uniform.)

1910
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,870
Everyone,

1911
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:06,970
this is the last mission.

1912
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:09,330
The members and production crew
will compete against each other...

1913
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:11,330
- to see who is better.
- Better?

1914
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:13,180
It's the Variety Triathlon.

1915
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,580
- What could it be?
- Variety Triathlon?

1916
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,080
- The members...
- We will play foot volleyball too.

1917
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,470
and production crew
will compete against each other.

1918
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:21,310
- Okay.
- We will play your favorite sports,

1919
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:22,740
table tennis,

1920
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,010
badminton,

1921
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:25,280
and foot volleyball.

1922
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:26,580
- I see.
- Okay.

1923
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,720
Se Chan plays badminton
on a show these days.

1924
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,430
- "Racket Boys".
- Yes.

1925
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:31,490
I will show you.

1926
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:32,560
We need...

1927
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,160
two members for table tennis,

1928
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,560
two members for badminton,

1929
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,800
and four members
for foot volleyball.

1930
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,200
In short, only one member
will play twice.

1931
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,030
- That's right.
- The players can't overlap.

1932
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,200
The 1st team
to score 21 points wins.

1933
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,370
But the score combines points
from all three events.

1934
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:48,200
Once a team scores seven points,

1935
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,470
the event will change.

1936
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:50,510
(Once a team scores 7 points,
the event will change.)

1937
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:51,640
The score will keep going.

1938
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:53,910
If the 2nd team reaches 14 points,

1939
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:55,640
you will move on
to the last event, foot volleyball.

1940
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:57,120
Everyone needs to play.

1941
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:00,350
Thus, the 1st team
to score 21 points wins.

1942
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:02,060
The production team...

1943
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:04,720
will be represented
by people you are familiar with.

1944
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,660
They must have picked athletic ones.

1945
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,300
As for So Min and Ji Hyo's event,

1946
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,120
Seon Myung and Hyung In
will participate.

1947
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,530
They are bad at sports. That's good.

1948
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:13,700
- They are bad at sports.
- Thus,

1949
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,310
the losing team...

1950
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:17,060
will receive five penalty balls.

1951
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,180
- That's good. Five. Come on.
- Okay.

1952
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:20,470
I can take on Seon Myung.

1953
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,550
Write down which members
will participate in each event.

1954
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:25,140
Among the three, table tennis
would be the best for me.

1955
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,220
- That's right. Play table tennis.
- Play table tennis.

1956
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:28,390
I want to play table tennis too.

1957
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:29,780
- Jong Kook and Suk Jin...
- I want to play table tennis too.

1958
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,010
- are good at table tennis.
- Yes.

1959
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:32,390
- Shall we play badminton?
- Yes.

1960
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:33,680
- Badminton.
- I want to play badminton.

1961
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:36,680
Can I use my private racket?
I have it in the car.

1962
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,120
- You can bring it.
- Hey.

1963
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,350
Jae Suk, I have a good racket.

1964
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,700
- A good racket. It's light.
- Really?

1965
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,530
Let's begin the first event,

1966
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,890
- badminton.
- Okay.

1967
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,060
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go.

1968
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,260
You can do it, right?

1969
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,970
Let's do well this time.

1970
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:53,310
- Let's show them.
- I didn't see it coming.

1971
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,640
Let's avoid the penalty.

1972
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,870
- I don't want the penalty.
- Everyone.

1973
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:57,600
From the production crew,

1974
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,640
producer Kim Nam Joong
and cameraman Cho Sung Oh will play.

1975
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,180
- Nam Joong?
- Sung Oh?

1976
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,180
- They are good.
- Sung Oh is a professional.

1977
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,910
- Sung Oh is good.
- Is he good?

1978
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:07,720
Look at his body.
He looks like a table tennis player.

1979
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,120
Nam Joong is relaxed.

1980
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:11,490
Let's see how well they can play
before cameras.

1981
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:12,600
Go ahead and play.

1982
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,430
Let's begin a game
for the first serve.

1983
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:15,760
A game for the first serve.

1984
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,970
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1985
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:18,260
- Let's do this.
- Yes.

1986
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:19,990
- Let's go.
- I need to stand in the back.

1987
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,330
My goodness.

1988
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,910
- Let's go.
- I will move to the side.

1989
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,280
- It's a game for the 1st serve.
- The 1st serve.

1990
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:30,260
All right.

1991
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:31,820
There you go. That's it.

1992
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:33,720
- They are good.
- The sound is different.

1993
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:36,400
There you go. That's it. Warm up.

1994
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:37,570
- That's it.
- Okay.

1995
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:38,670
- Serve first.
- Warm up.

1996
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,130
(The production crew fails
to receive.)

1997
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:41,430
- Serve first.
- Let's begin.

1998
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:42,880
- Warm up.
- Hold on.

1999
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:44,110
They aren't good.

2000
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:45,150
Good job.

2001
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,200
All right.

2002
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,470
Seven points.

2003
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:49,280
- The game begins now.
- Let's make the score 7 to 0.

2004
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,240
- Play with seriousness.
- Okay.

2005
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:52,990
Hit it.

2006
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,380
- Gosh.
- It's okay.

2007
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:58,320
(The production crew
succeeded in scoring first.)

2008
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,490
- It's okay.
- Nice.

2009
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,150
- Okay. It's okay.
- Okay.

2010
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:04,130
- Play with seriousness.
- Okay.

2011
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:06,030
Okay.

2012
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:07,200
They look serious.

2013
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,400
(Suk Jin succeeds in
receiving the ball.)

2014
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,900
- Okay.
- Nice.

2015
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,510
- They look serious.
- Okay.

2016
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:14,110
- Nice.
- Okay.

2017
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:15,700
One point.

2018
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:17,570
Okay.

2019
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:18,970
They are no match for us.

2020
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,650
- They are no match for us.
- Play with seriousness.

2021
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:23,650
(Which team will get ahead?)

2022
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:26,340
- Okay.
- Okay.

2023
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:29,360
(Sung Oh made a careless mistake.)

2024
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,720
Let's go.

2025
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,180
(Team Running Man: 2 points,
Team Production Crew: 1 point)

2026
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:34,130
Feel the pressure.

2027
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:36,800
Just get it over the net.

2028
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:37,930
"Just get it over the net."

2029
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:43,400
- Okay.
- Okay.

2030
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,400
Nice.

2031
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:46,840
(He suddenly plays baseball.)

2032
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,570
- Hey.
- Let's go.

2033
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:51,340
- Hey.
- We are doing so well.

2034
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,570
You are sexy.

2035
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,240
Sung Oh, what is going on?

2036
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:56,340
Sung Oh is flustered.

2037
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:58,590
Other people
who played against you...

2038
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:00,010
couldn't receive your serve, right?

2039
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:01,510
We can receive it.

2040
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:02,990
- Okay.
- It's about the energy.

2041
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:04,630
- The members have strong energy,
- Is it our turn?

2042
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:05,930
so they are intimidated.

2043
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:07,630
- My goodness.
- They are intimidated.

2044
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,530
Production crew, please do better.

2045
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:10,990
- Go ahead.
- They are intimidated.

2046
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:12,490
My goodness.

2047
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:14,800
- The tables have turned.
- I will receive it.

2048
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:17,090
(He fails to make a serve
this time.)

2049
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:19,070
- Okay.
- Okay.

2050
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:21,630
- We won't go easy in you.
- Being in front of the cameras...

2051
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:22,970
- makes you nervous, right?
- Let's go.

2052
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:25,300
If you show us a specialty,
we will give you a point.

2053
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:26,900
- A specialty.
- You don't even know the order.

2054
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,820
- You are out of it.
- What is your problem?

2055
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,340
We move on to the next event
once we have seven points, right?

2056
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,990
- It's Suk Jin.
- The current score is 6 to 1.

2057
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:33,320
Can't you beat Suk Jin?

2058
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,450
My goodness.

2059
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:36,150
Okay.

2060
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:37,680
- Okay.
- That side.

2061
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:38,760
(They already lost 6 points.)

2062
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,990
(Will the production crew succeed in
turning the tables?)

2063
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:42,090
That was good.

2064
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:43,650
(Jong Kook smashes the ball!)

2065
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,170
(Their play is weak until the end.)

2066
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:50,760
(The members ridicule them.)

2067
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:51,930
You are no match for us.

2068
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,570
- You are no match for us.
- We are good.

2069
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,570
The set has ended.

2070
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:59,550
- Nice.
- The score is 7 to 1.

2071
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:01,150
- What was that?
- That was easy.

2072
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,950
The next event is badminton.

2073
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:04,280
Okay. Badminton.

2074
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,590
- Let's go.
- Jae Suk.

2075
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:06,680
Let's go.

2076
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,950
Na Dong Geun
of the operation team...

2077
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:11,720
and Kim Hyun Gi
of the setup team will play.

2078
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:13,450
They look like professionals.

2079
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:15,720
- Good luck.
- We have to win.

2080
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,400
- Good luck.
- Guys.

2081
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:19,030
Guys, we are cornered.
We have to win.

2082
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:20,470
Please do well.

2083
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:22,030
(Since the production crew is losing
with a score of 7 to 1,)

2084
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:23,400
(this is an important game.)

2085
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,510
Dong Geun.

2086
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,630
(They have a practice match
to warm up.)

2087
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,880
He is good.

2088
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,380
- Everyone is good.
- Seriously.

2089
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:34,840
I can't see the shuttlecock.

2090
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,550
- Everyone is good.
- Seriously.

2091
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:38,450
- He can use his wrist well.
- I can't see the shuttlecock.

2092
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:39,550
He is good.

2093
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:41,880
- He is really good.
- Look at Se Chan.

2094
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:44,990
How is he so good?

2095
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:47,650
- He is good.
- He is good.

2096
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,130
You must have played
badminton often.

2097
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,260
Let's go.

2098
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:51,760
He must be in a badminton club.

2099
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,720
He was in the production crew
for "Law of the Jungle".

2100
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,470
He is really good.

2101
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:56,990
Let's begin right away.

2102
01:06:57,970 --> 01:06:59,170
We scored seven points.

2103
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:01,470
We are in the lead by many points.
Don't let them catch up.

2104
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,900
Let's score seven points.

2105
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,150
- Hey.
- Let's go.

2106
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:08,240
His pose is different.

2107
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,680
(The fateful game begins.)

2108
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:13,510
- Se Chan is good.
- Here it comes.

2109
01:07:13,550 --> 01:07:14,610
He is really good.

2110
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:15,820
He is good.

2111
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:18,280
- He is good.
- What is Se Chan up to these days?

2112
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:20,360
- He is good.
- What is Se Chan up to these days?

2113
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:21,450
He is good.

2114
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:22,800
- This is no joke.
- He is good.

2115
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,130
I can't see the shuttlecock.

2116
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,760
(They watch like meerkats.)

2117
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:28,900
- This is no joke.
- He is good.

2118
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,170
I can't see the shuttlecock.

2119
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,010
For goodness' sake.

2120
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,360
I can't see the shuttlecock.

2121
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:35,300
For goodness' sake.

2122
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:36,510
Good job.

2123
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:38,240
(Nice!)

2124
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,300
He raised it too fast.

2125
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,470
- Good job.
- They are good.

2126
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:43,380
- You warmed up.
- Good job.

2127
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:45,550
You gave them a point, so it's okay.

2128
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:46,880
It's okay.

2129
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,110
I can't see the shuttlecock.
It's too fast.

2130
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:50,260
You know,

2131
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:54,320
- he has played it often.
- It seems that way.

2132
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,300
Seriously.

2133
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,900
(Smash)

2134
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:01,990
(Racket Boy's non-spin smash)

2135
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:03,070
Se Chan, that was great.

2136
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:04,740
- Okay.
- You are good.

2137
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:07,030
I see that you are smart
and athletic.

2138
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:09,740
He is like a hero...

2139
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:11,470
- in a comic book.
- He makes me jealous.

2140
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:13,150
- Seriously.
- I am so jealous.

2141
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:14,280
A hero in a comic book.

2142
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,280
- I want to win.
- Se Chan.

2143
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,650
- I lose all the time.
- Se Chan.

2144
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:18,820
(Team Running Man: 8 points,
Team Production Crew: 3 points)

2145
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:21,860
- Here I go.
- That's a proper pose.

2146
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:23,090
Look at his pose. He is an expert.

2147
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:29,050
(Racket Boy makes a mistake!)

2148
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:30,300
They are so good.

2149
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,090
(Cheering)

2150
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:34,130
They are good.

2151
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:36,100
Don't be so happy.
We went easy on you.

2152
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:37,860
- For goodness' sake.
- We went easy on them many times.

2153
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,860
How many times
do we need to do that?

2154
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,230
That part will get edited out.

2155
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:44,570
(The production crew
had to beg for a point.)

2156
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:45,740
The production crew
will get the water bomb.

2157
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:46,980
I know.

2158
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:48,880
They might turn the tables here.

2159
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:52,520
Jae Suk can't keep his eyes
on the shuttlecock.

2160
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,850
Okay.

2161
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:56,150
Okay.

2162
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:57,610
How did it happen
as soon as I said that?

2163
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:59,150
- It's okay, right?
- Jae Suk.

2164
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:00,450
Don't say something like that.

2165
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:02,100
- Okay.
- He can't keep his eyes on it.

2166
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,560
- Okay.
- Don't say that.

2167
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,230
Look at that.

2168
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,860
(A light tap)

2169
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:12,600
(A sudden drop shot)

2170
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,340
How could you be so sneaky?

2171
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:15,880
Seriously.

2172
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,270
You don't look that way.

2173
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:19,010
- I expected better from you.
- You were so sneaky.

2174
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,880
We need to win.

2175
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:23,310
Hold on. Go and change your pants.

2176
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,550
(So tight)

2177
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:26,690
They are too revealing.

2178
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,020
They should be illegal.

2179
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:32,130
- They are building teamwork.
- They finished warming up.

2180
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:33,690
You need to destroy them
before they do that.

2181
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:34,990
(This is an important round.)

2182
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:36,490
Okay.

2183
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:39,670
(He fails to receive it.)

2184
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:41,440
- That was fun.
- Dong Geun.

2185
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:43,190
- Good job.
- Dong Geun, what was that?

2186
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:45,470
- That was fun.
- Are you a spy?

2187
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:46,970
This is fun.

2188
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,380
- Go.
- What's the current score?

2189
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,440
It's 13 to 8.

2190
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,200
We have one point to go.

2191
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,440
(If Team Running Man
scores another point,)

2192
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,640
(they will switch over
to the next game.)

2193
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,270
- We have one point to go.
- Yes.

2194
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:58,920
(Team Production Crew is
on the edge of a cliff.)

2195
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,350
Come on.

2196
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:02,450
(Will the production crew be able
to overcome this crisis?)

2197
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:07,560
Okay.

2198
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,600
(Flailing)

2199
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,770
(The 2nd event, badminton ends.)

2200
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:13,800
- What was that?
- Nice.

2201
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,060
The event ended
with a score of 14 to 8.

2202
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:17,600
The next event is foot volleyball.

2203
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,060
- Okay.
- That's good.

2204
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:20,670
Let's finish them.

2205
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:21,980
It's light, right?

2206
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:24,230
- The next event is foot volleyball.
- Okay.

2207
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:27,200
- Okay.
- Our players are Kang Chan Hee,

2208
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:30,940
Lee Ju Yong, Choi Hyung In,
and Yoo Seon Myung.

2209
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,190
- Ju Yong and Chan Hee...
- Ju Yong has long legs.

2210
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,220
Ju Yong is good, right?

2211
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,480
I think so.

2212
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:39,350
(When the production crew had
a tug-of-war against the members,)

2213
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:42,150
(Ju Yong showed
his exceptional athletic skills.)

2214
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:45,320
The legend of the variety shows,
Kang Chan Hee will decide.

2215
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,390
(The living legend of Korean
variety shows, Kang Chan Hee)

2216
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:47,560
Seon Myung will play.

2217
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:49,340
(The experts of editing,
Choi Hyung In and Yoo Seon Myung)

2218
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,230
I won't joke around.

2219
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:53,440
- I won't be funny
- I will play with seriousness.

2220
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,730
- I will score right away.
- I won't be funny.

2221
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:56,900
I won't be funny.

2222
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:59,550
I can do better
than Seon Myung and Hyung In.

2223
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:02,050
It feels different to play
in front of the camera.

2224
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,070
- That's right.
- It feels different.

2225
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:04,070
Did he do well on "2 Days and 1 Night"?

2226
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:05,690
- We need to win this.
- Yes, he did.

2227
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:07,480
I will send it upward.
Then you can kick it.

2228
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,420
Who will receive it? Seon Myung.

2229
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,190
- It's better to send it over there.
- Seon Myung.

2230
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:13,930
There you go. Good job.

2231
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:16,020
(She sends it to space.)

2232
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,600
- We found one bad player.
- Okay.

2233
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,600
- We found one bad player.
- It's Hyung In.

2234
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,970
Okay. We have a chance.

2235
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:22,060
Seon Myung.

2236
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,810
- There you go.
- Okay.

2237
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:27,970
(So Min's producer
does the mask dance.)

2238
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:29,680
We found another bad player.

2239
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:31,180
We are set.

2240
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,550
- We are set. I was started.
- That team has two So Mins.

2241
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:37,570
- Two So Mins.
- I thought they were really good.

2242
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:39,280
- I thought they were athletic.
- Thank you.

2243
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,940
We are better.

2244
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:42,390
We didn't choose them
by their athletic skills.

2245
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:43,420
- Really?
- All right.

2246
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:45,020
I don't think they have played
foot volleyball before.

2247
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:46,090
Seon Myung.

2248
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:48,600
They weren't chosen
by their athletic skills.

2249
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,990
There you go.

2250
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,320
- Seon Myung.
- There you go.

2251
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,390
(She kicks the air.)

2252
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:56,060
- Seon Myung.
- You guys are cute.

2253
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,390
(Seon Myung is as bad as So Min.)

2254
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,470
- Seon Myung is enthusiastic.
- You guys are cute.

2255
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:01,980
- So Min.
- Head the ball.

2256
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:03,510
- There you go.
- Good job.

2257
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:05,180
- My goodness.
- You did well.

2258
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:07,480
- How are you so good?
- You are good.

2259
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,850
Come on.

2260
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:11,140
Stay in the middle.
I will be all the way in the back.

2261
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:12,520
(The practice game continues
to put the production crew on ease.)

2262
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:17,420
All right.

2263
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:18,650
What?

2264
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:19,730
All right.

2265
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:20,730
(A sudden attack)

2266
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:22,300
What was that?

2267
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,390
- Chan Hee.
- What was up with that cute foot?

2268
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:26,320
- What was up with that cute foot?
- Hold on.

2269
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,270
- What was up with that cute foot?
- What was that?

2270
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:30,770
- Don't act cute.
- Seriously.

2271
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:31,860
Don't intimidate them.

2272
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:32,940
Don't act cute.

2273
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:35,510
- Are you ready? Let's get started.
- Let's go.

2274
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:37,100
- Let's go.
- Make it funny.

2275
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:38,240
You are doing well.

2276
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,070
(The match starts
with Haha's serve.)

2277
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:41,940
Haha is good at receiving.

2278
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,880
Ju Yong.

2279
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,280
Haha.

2280
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:47,220
- You know...
- There you go.

2281
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:48,850
Okay.

2282
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:52,630
Hyung In, receive it. Let's go.

2283
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:55,150
(Grunting)

2284
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:56,190
(He painstakingly saved the ball.)

2285
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:57,800
Haha is good at defense.

2286
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:58,860
That's good.

2287
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:01,560
(My goodness.)

2288
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,670
Hold on.

2289
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:05,010
(He headed the ball backward.)

2290
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:07,230
- What was that?
- We will be funny, okay?

2291
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,680
He doesn't have anything
other than the cute foot.

2292
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,700
- You should have saved it.
- That was nice.

2293
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,050
Are you ready?

2294
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:14,070
All right.

2295
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:15,720
(The production crew lost 1 point
with the slapstick comedy.)

2296
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,810
Good job.

2297
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:17,980
Send it over the net.

2298
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,550
- Seon Myung.
- Seon Myung.

2299
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:22,590
Don't do it.

2300
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:24,060
(She kicks the air.)

2301
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:26,650
(Don't do it.)

2302
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:29,020
- Who told her not to do it?
- Hey.

2303
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:30,600
Why did you stop her?

2304
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,470
- Why did you stop her?
- It was Seon Myung's ball.

2305
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:33,860
Why didn't you kick the ball?

2306
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:35,690
Why didn't you kick the ball?

2307
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:37,690
Seon Myung is charming.

2308
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:38,810
The score is 15 to 8.

2309
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:40,030
She was like Bbakgu.

2310
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:41,100
I know.

2311
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:42,510
Here I go. This time...

2312
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:44,340
- Hyung In.
- Hyung In, receive the ball.

2313
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:45,640
(They target the younger producers.)

2314
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:46,980
Hyung In.

2315
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,270
- Hyung In.
- Hyung In.

2316
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:50,640
Hyung In.

2317
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,850
(Shouting)

2318
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:53,390
- Hyung In.
- Hyung In.

2319
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:54,980
(A knee kick)

2320
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,850
What was that?

2321
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:59,730
Was it a knee-jerk reaction?

2322
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:01,190
- The ball hit your knee.
- You will hurt your knee.

2323
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:02,760
You will hurt your knee.

2324
01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:04,230
She did this.

2325
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:05,800
(Teasing)

2326
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:07,670
Hyung In.

2327
01:14:08,270 --> 01:14:09,640
She is so funny.

2328
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:11,170
- We can't have a rally.
- We are good.

2329
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:13,360
- Here I go.
- Seriously.

2330
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,700
- Let's go.
- Good.

2331
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,700
That was a nice serve.

2332
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,940
- Nice.
- Hyung In.

2333
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:19,940
Send it over the net.

2334
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:21,310
Receive it.

2335
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:23,610
There you go. Good job.

2336
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:24,810
(My goodness.)

2337
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:26,240
- Hold on.
- Hyung In.

2338
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:29,350
Why are two members playing
by themselves?

2339
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:31,260
Your team is the same.

2340
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,690
- Mine.
- Seon Myung.

2341
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:34,430
- Seon Myung.
- Seon Myung.

2342
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:35,650
Hyung In.

2343
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,860
Hyung In.

2344
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:41,990
(My goodness.)

2345
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:48,230
My goodness.

2346
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:50,100
He learned slapstick comedy from us.

2347
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,270
(Chan Hee showed
unexpected slapstick comedy.)

2348
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,350
- This is fun.
- This is fun.

2349
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,380
- This is fun.
- This is so much fun.

2350
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,740
- Chan Hee.
- This is so much fun.

2351
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:00,610
- I am laughing so much.
- That was cute.

2352
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:01,780
Suk Jin.

2353
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,890
- Don't worry about comedy.
- You shouldn't laugh from now on.

2354
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:05,690
If he hadn't been
the main cameraman,

2355
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:07,650
- they would have dragged him out.
- Definitely.

2356
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:10,450
- Seriously.
- Here I go.

2357
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:12,690
Don't laugh
when Suk Jin does badly.

2358
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:13,730
That was a nice serve.

2359
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:16,360
- Seon Myung.
- Hold on.

2360
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:19,140
Two touches.

2361
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,470
- Seon Myung.
- Hold on.

2362
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:23,010
(The ball hits her twice.)

2363
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:26,510
We can't beat them
in terms of slapstick comedy.

2364
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,440
- We can't beat them.
- How did you form the team?

2365
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,740
(Their slapstick comedy beats
that of entertainers.)

2366
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:31,980
It's so hard.

2367
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:34,280
- It's okay.
- I practiced so hard.

2368
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:37,590
Do you know what's scary?
Do you know what she said?

2369
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:39,930
"I practiced so hard."

2370
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,800
She practiced.

2371
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,260
Hyung In,
why won't you receive the ball?

2372
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:45,600
- Here I go.
- Seon Myung.

2373
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,820
It's Seon Myung's ball.

2374
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:48,890
Hyung In.

2375
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,770
It's Hyung In's ball. Hyung In.

2376
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:51,810
- Hyung In.
- Hyung In.

2377
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,640
- Hyung In.
- Hyung In.

2378
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,030
(Double slapstick comedy)

2379
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,480
(The worst collaboration)

2380
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,590
- My goodness.
- Chan Hee.

2381
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:07,050
Hyung In was going to kick it.

2382
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:08,390
Why did you do that?

2383
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:11,890
They charge at the ball like a moth
when they hear their names.

2384
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,950
Chan Hee went...

2385
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,950
He charges at the ball
when he hears his name.

2386
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:20,360
- Shall we change the players?
- Let's just keep going.

2387
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,890
Shall we change the players?

2388
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:24,100
We can switch a player
with Suk Jin.

2389
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:25,560
I will play.

2390
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,470
Can we do that?
We will have Suk Jin play.

2391
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:29,100
I will play instead of Se Chan.

2392
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,200
- Okay.
- All right.

2393
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,730
- It's for balance.
- We still have an advantage.

2394
01:16:31,730 --> 01:16:34,100
- We are so much better.
- Let's go.

2395
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,440
Why did they even challenge us?

2396
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,270
Why did they even challenge us
to play these games?

2397
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:38,520
The back...

2398
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:41,310
- Chan Hee.
- They can switch the players.

2399
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:42,690
- Will you get it?
- Yes.

2400
01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:43,980
- They can stand...
- Go ahead.

2401
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:45,730
- and watch.
- There you go.

2402
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:46,980
- Who will receive it?
- Nice.

2403
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:48,650
Hyung In, come on out.

2404
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,190
Go backward.

2405
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,100
Receive it.

2406
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:54,190
(It hits the net.)

2407
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:55,270
Okay.

2408
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:56,800
That was...

2409
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,560
Did you become confident
upon seeing me enter the game?

2410
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:01,470
You suddenly improved.

2411
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:03,180
- The team seems easier now.
- Do we seem easier now?

2412
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:05,680
There is a balance now.

2413
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,850
- Seriously.
- There is finally a balance.

2414
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:08,740
- You should relax now.
- Yes.

2415
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:09,850
It's okay.

2416
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:11,310
Send the ball to Seon Myung.

2417
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,050
Is that a pass?

2418
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:14,280
- Go.
- Ji Hyo.

2419
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:15,590
- Did I say Ji Hyo?
- So Min.

2420
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:17,060
(The ball hits the net again!)

2421
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:18,280
- Did I say Ji Hyo?
- So Min.

2422
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,060
(So Min, a bad player,
loses a point.)

2423
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:21,650
I wanted to give you a chance
since we are leading.

2424
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:23,520
You know, Suk Jin...

2425
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:26,630
- Does he avoid the ball?
- He avoids the ball too much.

2426
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:28,770
He gives me the ball
when it's impossible to receive it.

2427
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,390
I will receive it this time.

2428
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:32,440
(Suk Jin avoids the ball
if it's beyond his abilities.)

2429
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,230
- Haha.
- That's a strong serve.

2430
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,600
Haha is a great player.

2431
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,440
- Go, So Min.
- So Min.

2432
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:40,940
- He got it.
- Hey.

2433
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,440
(Haha saved the ball
that was directed at the team!)

2434
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,850
Seon Myung.

2435
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:45,940
We won.

2436
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:49,950
(The unbelievable rally)

2437
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:53,730
(The slapstick comedy was
the grand finale.)

2438
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:56,690
(I can't believe it.)

2439
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:59,320
We won.

2440
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,990
(So Min's hopeless heading
resulted in a point.)

2441
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:02,360
What was that?

2442
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:03,990
I can't believe it.

2443
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:05,600
Did you guys plan it out?

2444
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:07,940
- So Min.
- Did you guys plan it out?

2445
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:10,010
Seon Myung, Ju Yong,

2446
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:12,350
and So Min,
did you guys plan it out?

2447
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:14,940
- The ball went from there...
- It was unbelievable.

2448
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:16,520
What was that?

2449
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,240
The back attack.

2450
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,280
- Seriously.
- The back attack was amazing.

2451
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,590
- Seon Myung, that was so funny.
- That was so funny.

2452
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:25,150
- That was so funny.
- That was so funny.

2453
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:26,690
That was unbelievably funny.

2454
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:28,650
Here I go.

2455
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:29,890
All right.

2456
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:30,950
Wait.

2457
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:31,990
Two points remain.

2458
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:33,670
Hyung In.

2459
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:34,800
Come on.

2460
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:35,860
Get it.

2461
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:37,170
Okay.

2462
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:38,390
Good job, Old Man.

2463
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,060
- All right.
- Go.

2464
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:41,100
(The production crew
barely scored 1 point.)

2465
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:42,480
- There you go.
- Receive it.

2466
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,570
Suk Jin.

2467
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:45,570
- Send it over the net.
- Head the ball.

2468
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:46,880
- So Min.
- Head the ball.

2469
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,010
- Hit it.
- There you go.

2470
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:50,980
Okay.

2471
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:52,780
Anything can happen.

2472
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:54,640
- I mean...
- Okay.

2473
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:56,980
(Anything can happen.)

2474
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,520
Anything can happen.

2475
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:01,130
- You need to pull yourself up.
- Let's go.

2476
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:02,630
- Let's go.
- There is a six-point difference.

2477
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:04,260
- That's a big difference.
- Let's stop playing around.

2478
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:05,690
Don't lose.

2479
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:07,630
One person should receive it.

2480
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:10,390
Let's go. All right.

2481
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:12,730
(She touches the ball.)

2482
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:15,200
(Go away.)

2483
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:17,510
- Hey.
- That was too much.

2484
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:19,880
- That was too much.
- Why did you use your hand?

2485
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,380
- You scored a point.
- What was that?

2486
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:22,640
You shouldn't be like that.

2487
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,180
Ju Yong.

2488
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:26,090
- That was too much.
- I didn't mean to do that.

2489
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:27,590
- I was too startled.
- Come on.

2490
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:29,760
You lost all the points.

2491
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,190
- Se Chan, go back in there.
- I was too startled.

2492
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:32,630
- Can I go back in there?
- We will lose at this rate.

2493
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:33,890
- Shouldn't he go back in there?
- I was too startled.

2494
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:35,630
I was too startled.

2495
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:37,820
Who will receive it?

2496
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:39,690
- What was that?
- Why did you just stand there?

2497
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:40,930
Send it over the net.

2498
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:42,060
Okay.

2499
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:43,470
It didn't touch. Ji Hyo.

2500
01:19:43,470 --> 01:19:44,470
Mine.

2501
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:46,100
There you go. No!

2502
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,840
- You should have left it.
- Seriously.

2503
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,380
- You should have left it.
- I hit it.

2504
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:50,840
Get a grip.
We will lose at this rate.

2505
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,940
Seriously. We have to win.

2506
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:55,440
- Just try to focus.
- All right.

2507
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,350
Focus. Be serious.

2508
01:19:57,610 --> 01:19:59,350
- What's the score?
- You're three points ahead.

2509
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:01,520
- Oh, no.
- Let's do this.

2510
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,060
(They are in the lead
only by 3 points.)

2511
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:04,590
- We can't make more mistakes.
- We might lose.

2512
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:06,480
We need one person
to receive the ball.

2513
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,630
- Stay calm.
- Calm?

2514
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:11,260
Don't panic.

2515
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:13,230
Don't panic.
They seem motivated now.

2516
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:14,230
(The members are about to snatch
defeat from the jaws of victory.)

2517
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,640
Don't panic.
They seem motivated now.

2518
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,170
(A strong service
in a tense atmosphere)

2519
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:19,670
It's out. No.

2520
01:20:20,030 --> 01:20:21,770
- I'll do it.
- Send it over.

2521
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:23,200
- Let me do it.
- Good. Just send it over.

2522
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,310
Just end it.

2523
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:26,140
Seon Myung, you do it.

2524
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:29,050
- Out.
- It went out.

2525
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:30,940
(He sent the ball to an empty spot,
but it went out.)

2526
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:32,350
The director seems flustered.

2527
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:34,220
Are they supposed to avoid the ball?

2528
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:35,850
Can't they touch the ball?

2529
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,890
- These two...
- It's our ball.

2530
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:39,480
These two are playing dodgeball.

2531
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,760
And the rest of them
are playing foot volleyball.

2532
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,130
It must be fun.

2533
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,450
You have one point left.

2534
01:20:44,450 --> 01:20:47,360
Don't do that. You need one person.
Haha should receive the ball.

2535
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:51,170
This is no joke.
I'll send over the ball.

2536
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:55,140
(This match will decide
who gets 5 penalty balls.)

2537
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:58,140
Kick it high.

2538
01:20:58,140 --> 01:20:59,700
(The fatal match begins.)

2539
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,240
Isn't it over?

2540
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:04,440
- There you go.
- Send it over.

2541
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:05,440
Catch it.

2542
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:07,240
- All right.
- Seon Myung.

2543
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,610
(Big Nose received the ball well.)

2544
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:09,650
- Done.
- Okay.

2545
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:10,690
- It's in.
- Nice.

2546
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:11,720
Good.

2547
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,520
- Nice.
- Good.

2548
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:17,730
(Reflecting)

2549
01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:21,320
(The grand finale)

2550
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,670
Are you all right?

2551
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:26,810
Are you okay?

2552
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,400
I wanted to try a back-header.

2553
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,980
That was funny.

2554
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:32,550
- I didn't do anything.
- My goodness.

2555
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:33,700
That was hilarious.

2556
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,270
I didn't even make you laugh.

2557
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:36,720
What was that?

2558
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:39,050
He's so good at variety shows.

2559
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:41,550
He's a master of slapstick comedy.

2560
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:43,950
Chan Hee showed
a lot of funny things today.

2561
01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:45,310
That was really fun.

2562
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:47,130
- He's outstanding.
- That was hilarious.

2563
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:49,560
- We're too good.
- We all are really good.

2564
01:21:50,450 --> 01:21:51,600
That was fun.

2565
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,970
You guys are better than we thought.

2566
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:55,320
Of course.

2567
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,800
- We are really good.
- You don't sound serious.

2568
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,640
So the production crew
got another five penalty balls.

2569
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:02,510
- Yes.
- Here is the final result.

2570
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:05,510
The cast has 10 balls,
and the staff has 19 balls.

2571
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,140
- It's possible that we win.
- This isn't bad.

2572
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:08,940
You have about a 30-percent chance.

2573
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,850
- Okay. Let's be strict.
- All right.

2574
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:13,110
- It's only once.
- Now we will draw the balls.

2575
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:14,420
- Okay.
- It's worth a shot.

2576
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:15,780
My goodness.

2577
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,610
- I'm nervous.
- They have so many balls.

2578
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:21,850
Seriously, if we lose here...

2579
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:24,560
- If we lose...
- We can still lose.

2580
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:26,600
There's Bo Pil.

2581
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,990
(The crew members are gathered
together under the water bomb.)

2582
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,860
Bo Pil, take off your watch.

2583
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:32,100
- My goodness.
- Stand behind the line.

2584
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,200
- Okay.
- Where?

2585
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,600
- The line in the front.
- Step back a little.

2586
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:36,640
Step back?

2587
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:37,810
Do you see the red sticker?

2588
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:39,400
- Of course.
- We will win anyway.

2589
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,200
- Sure.
- We won't get splashed.

2590
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,940
This isn't
our first time doing this.

2591
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:46,110
We have an announcer here
to play fairly.

2592
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:48,050
- Hello.
- Hello.

2593
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:50,420
This is 2021 Running Man
Penalty Negotiation.

2594
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:51,920
I'm here...

2595
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:54,890
to draw balls
and decide the winners.

2596
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:57,650
I'm the host, Lee In Kwon.
Nice to meet you.

2597
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,320
- In Kwon!
- Hello.

2598
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:02,270
He's an announcer.

2599
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:05,770
I wonder how you are feeling today.

2600
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:08,600
- Well...
- I guess we will get splashed.

2601
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:10,730
- No, we won't.
- We won't.

2602
01:23:10,730 --> 01:23:12,850
We will go home dry and soft today.

2603
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,240
I think they will make a mistake,
and we will get splashed.

2604
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,440
- Right. Don't make a mistake.
- Don't try anything silly.

2605
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,350
Don't make a mistake.
Mr. Announcer, you...

2606
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:22,350
- What? Mr. Announcer?
- Mr. Announcer?

2607
01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:23,980
- What was that?
- Mister?

2608
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:25,090
He's frowning.

2609
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:27,780
The team whose ball is picked
will get splashed, right?

2610
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:29,850
- Yes.
- The team with the selected ball.

2611
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:32,470
- That's right.
- Okay.

2612
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:36,360
Now I will announce
the result of today's race.

2613
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:40,440
The number of
the production crew's balls is...

2614
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,730
19 in total.

2615
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:46,400
And the number of the Running Man
members is ten.

2616
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,740
- It's good.
- We have a good chance to win.

2617
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:49,740
- The odds are in our favor.
- Definitely.

2618
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:50,740
Sure.

2619
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:53,550
All right then. Now I will put
the penalty balls in the machine.

2620
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:55,350
(Putting in the penalty balls)

2621
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:58,310
- Let's go!
- Let us see it, Mr. Lee.

2622
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:59,650
To make sure it's ten balls.

2623
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:00,690
You're not adding
more balls, are you?

2624
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:02,490
- They are ten balls.
- Okay.

2625
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:04,190
- Ten balls for the members.
- Trust him.

2626
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,430
(He starts putting
10 penalty balls in the machine.)

2627
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:08,430
We can't lose here.

2628
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:09,640
- I know.
- That would be horrible.

2629
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,230
The odds are against them.

2630
01:24:11,230 --> 01:24:12,230
It can't be helped.

2631
01:24:12,230 --> 01:24:13,510
This is all about probability.

2632
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:14,840
We can feel at ease.

2633
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,640
But we had a loser
with only one ball before.

2634
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:17,730
I lost when I had only two balls.

2635
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:19,240
- Right.
- It was last week.

2636
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:20,240
All right then.

2637
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,550
Now I will...

2638
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,550
Oh, dear.

2639
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:25,780
pick a ball.

2640
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:26,940
All right.

2641
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,780
- Turn on the machine.
- Give it a good shuffle.

2642
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:30,950
(10 balls versus 19 balls)

2643
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:33,450
Let's do this.

2644
01:24:33,890 --> 01:24:37,260
(Things have been going well
for the members since the morning.)

2645
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:39,970
(They messed up
the production crew's plans...)

2646
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:42,970
(with the power of unity.)

2647
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:45,270
(They were good at quizzes.)

2648
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:47,340
(They were good
at exchanging telepathy.)

2649
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:50,200
(The 7 members showed
outstanding teamwork.)

2650
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,510
(The 7 members seemed clumsy,)

2651
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:55,510
(but they were actually amazing.)

2652
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,940
(It was a mistake
to underestimate them.)

2653
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:02,780
(10 balls versus 19 balls)

2654
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:04,850
We will probably get splashed.

2655
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:06,650
- Because ten is a big number.
- It can happen.

2656
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:08,060
This isn't easy.

2657
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:09,060
(The balls will decide the result.)

2658
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:11,230
(If there's someone
to control variety shows,)

2659
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:14,490
(this is the time
when he should show up.)

2660
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,490
- Did he open it already?
- No.

2661
01:25:16,490 --> 01:25:17,600
So soon?

2662
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,340
- Is it open?
- Is it done?

2663
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,440
Is it out?

2664
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,440
In my hand...

2665
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:23,770
All right. Good.

2666
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:25,700
(It's finally selected.)

2667
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:26,940
- He's good.
- Did you see the ball?

2668
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:28,700
- It's okay.
- I didn't see it yet.

2669
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:29,940
Good.

2670
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:31,480
Take off your microphone
just in case.

2671
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:32,890
- Take off your microphone.
- Okay.

2672
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:33,940
- Take it off?
- Is it our ball?

2673
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:35,650
Just in case. We don't know it yet.

2674
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,850
- I guess they got a signal.
- Take this off?

2675
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:39,350
Just in case.

2676
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:41,480
Why do they want us
to take off the microphones?

2677
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:44,490
Hang on. You're not
manipulating the result, are you?

2678
01:25:44,490 --> 01:25:45,800
(They suspect In Kwon is
manipulating the result.)

2679
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,170
You're distracting us on purpose.

2680
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:48,360
No.

2681
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,730
I'm watching you.

2682
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:51,840
It's not like that. I'm telling you.

2683
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,510
He looks like a magician.
Aren't you Lee Eun Gyeol?

2684
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:55,100
- You're Lee Eun Gyeol, right?
- No.

2685
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,730
You look like him.

2686
01:25:56,730 --> 01:25:58,700
You have a dove
in your pocket, right?

2687
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:01,100
- I think you do.
- You seem strange.

2688
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:03,610
You don't have the hairstyle
of an announcer.

2689
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:05,240
(It looks like he hid a dove
in his permed hair.)

2690
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,610
Move a little forward.

2691
01:26:07,050 --> 01:26:08,310
Why?

2692
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:09,980
- It's okay.
- I think it's us.

2693
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,450
- Let's go.
- Don't worry.

2694
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:12,650
All right. Now...

2695
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:16,520
I will announce the result.

2696
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,060
It can't be us.

2697
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:19,890
The losing team...

2698
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,060
- is...
- The production crew.

2699
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:42,530
(The result is
about to be revealed.)

2700
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:44,820
The production crew.

2701
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:49,470
(The production crew loses.)

2702
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:53,030
(We won!)

2703
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:54,330
(Embarrassed)

2704
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:55,440
We won!

2705
01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:56,980
See? I told you.

2706
01:26:56,980 --> 01:27:00,070
(They get splashed
by the 500kg water bomb.)

2707
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:04,320
(Just like their colleagues
from 8 years ago,)

2708
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:08,190
(a bunch of directors get soaked.)

2709
01:27:09,610 --> 01:27:11,730
(They are elated.)

2710
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,060
(Tumbling)

2711
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:16,260
(The magician is shocked
by the amount of water.)

2712
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:18,770
- Yes!
- We won!

2713
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,360
(The cast won 2021 Running Man
Penalty Negotiation.)

2714
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,470
Dry and soft

2715
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:23,940
(Dry and soft)

2716
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:26,970
(We are going home
dry and soft today.)

2717
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:31,230
(The playful members' song stabs
the crew members' hearts.)

2718
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:33,350
You have good pronunciation.

2719
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:34,740
He's an announcer.

2720
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,110
I thought he was a magician.
