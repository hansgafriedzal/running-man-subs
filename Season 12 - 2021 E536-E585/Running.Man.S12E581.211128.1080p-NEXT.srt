1
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,960
(December 31, 1999)

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,590
The year 2000 is
less than two days away.

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,190
The new millennium will
begin in a few hours.

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:22,160
(People felt sad
about the end of the 20th century.)

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,440
(And they were excited and worried
about the new 21st century.)

6
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,510
(December 31, 1999)

7
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,020
(The year 2000, D-1)

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,520
(7 people of the new generation
are thrown into confusion)

9
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,930
(December 31, 1999)

10
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,360
(What is happening
on the threshold of a new century?)

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,270
(The new millennium is coming!
December 31, 1999)

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,890
Hello,

13
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,830
(A girl with twin buns
shows up looking shy.)

14
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,310
Hello.

15
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,930
Hello.

16
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,070
(The rest of the new generation
is coming in as well.)

17
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,350
We have a guest today.

18
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,740
Do we have a guest?

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,470
He's visiting Korea.

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,690
Michael Jackson, come on!

21
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,020
Michael Jackson.

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,410
(Ha Jackson is back.)

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,050
Good.

24
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,860
(It's good to see him again
after six months.)

25
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,330
He lost some of his belly fat.

26
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,270
He lost his belly fat.

27
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,270
(Episode 552: The Entering Class
of 1991 Is Back!)

28
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,390
(He looks
just like Michael Jackson.)

29
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,270
(Ha Jackson suddenly
showed up at Euljiro.)

30
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,300
He suddenly starts dancing.

31
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:40,270
(He became the King of Pop
thanks to his stylist's mistake.)

32
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,610
(He was mocked
for his bulging belly.)

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,320
(Now his costume is perfect
for the end of the century.)

34
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
He lost his belly fat.

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,460
It was funny
with your bulging belly.

36
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,460
- You look cool.
- That's too bad.

37
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,580
His belly is flat now.

38
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,750
This is against the rules.

39
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,220
That's not important.
The biggest issue is...

40
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,800
- Ji Hyo's short hair.
- Right.

41
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,070
I agree.

42
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,530
This is what I thought.
Ji Hyo finally decided...

43
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,800
to win Jong Kook's heart.

44
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,910
- She looks so handsome.
- You know "Coffee Prince".

45
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,080
She looks like Yoon Eun Hye
of "Coffee Prince".

46
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,710
- Really? Is that Yoon Eun Hye?
- Hey.

47
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,640
Well... This is...

48
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,370
- I think So Min has a point.
- I know.

49
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,110
Wasn't that because of Demi Moore?

50
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,950
No. It's Yoon Eun Hye
of "Coffee Prince".

51
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,310
That's nonsense. Stay quiet.

52
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,110
- Nonsense?
- It's definitely "Coffee Prince".

53
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,680
(So Min keeps babbling on,)

54
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,430
(and Ji Hyo loses her temper.)

55
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,760
My goodness. Hey.

56
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,150
You almost got hit.

57
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,490
She sounds really upset.

58
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,390
Now that Ji Hyo got
her hair cut short,

59
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,360
she's the most handsome one
among the members.

60
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,560
Right.

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,900
- I'm the best-looking one.
- Number 1, 2, and 3.

62
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,710
- No, that's not it.
- Michael, you stay out of it.

63
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,430
- You didn't make the cut.
- You're out.

64
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,550
- Seriously.
- This is what I said.

65
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,950
For people like Ji Hyo,
the hairstyle doesn't matter.

66
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,110
- Right.
- You know?

67
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,810
- She looks really handsome.
- I won't say who it is,

68
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,210
but the hairstyle is very important
for some of us.

69
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,420
I know who it is.

70
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,760
You definitely need good hair.

71
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,920
(Some of them need a good hairstyle
to look like a decent person.)

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,290
It's you.

73
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,180
Who is this guy?

74
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,930
Who on earth is he?

75
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,990
He's just ugly.

76
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,460
Are you an archer?

77
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,670
Who are you? Aren't you an archer?

78
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,890
Are you an alpinist?

79
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,300
They know nothing about fashion.

80
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,640
- So who are you?
- Jae Suk.

81
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,580
- I can't see your face.
- You don't know anything.

82
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,640
- You know nothing about fashion.
- Are you Jang Woo Hyuk or what?

83
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,310
I tried many different things.

84
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,420
Many different things?

85
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,310
Are you from
the movie, "Home Alone"?

86
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,390
"Home Alone"? Are you
talking about the thief?

87
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,390
No. This is fashion.

88
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,120
What? Who are you?

89
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,330
I'm Yangpa.

90
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,860
Yangpa?

91
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,930
I thought you were S.E.S.

92
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,360
- "Heart Beat Away"?
- I always look at you

93
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
(I always look at you from behind)

94
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,270
You sound pretentious when you sing.

95
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,300
- S.E.S.
- She's Yangpa.

96
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,430
- And you...
- What?

97
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,830
- Don't I look nice today?
- You look normal today.

98
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,210
- People said I looked nice today.
- You look cool.

99
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,010
- This is...
- You look like an old man.

100
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,420
No. My stylist found this
at a vintage shop.

101
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,740
Suk Jin, that's not important.

102
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,810
This is also vintage.

103
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,710
You started talking.

104
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,950
I'm just answering.

105
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,210
Don't go to the restroom
when we take a group photo.

106
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,680
- Right.
- What?

107
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,680
(The members posted a group photo
without Suk Jin last week.)

108
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,430
Why did you take it without me?

109
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,890
- Where were you, Prince?
- My gosh.

110
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,700
- Where were you?
- You took it without me.

111
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,890
Suk Jin, you know
why you left early.

112
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,270
- That's...
- It's because of So Min.

113
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,300
He was afraid I'd ask him
to drive me home.

114
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,740
He didn't want to drive So Min home.

115
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,110
I didn't even ask him.

116
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,280
Here's the thing.

117
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,180
We had dinner together,
and So Min sent her manager home.

118
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,070
When we got out of the restaurant,

119
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,110
we asked So Min,
"How will you go home?"

120
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,110
"I'll take a taxi."

121
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,920
We said, "Why would you
take a taxi?" And Suk Jin...

122
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,090
- He went straight home.
- He could've given her a ride,

123
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,290
but he just left.

124
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,510
He avoided my eyes.

125
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,320
You thought I went to the restroom,
but I just went home.

126
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,930
I left early. But I could've
taken a photo with you before that.

127
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,820
Why did you leave like that
when So Min needed a ride home?

128
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,900
- She goes your way.
- You and I are the only ones...

129
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,400
who can give her a ride.

130
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Then you give her a ride.

131
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,540
- I did.
- You are a warmhearted person.

132
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,360
- I gave her a ride.
- He took her home.

133
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,700
So it took me two
and a half hours to get home.

134
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,280
Did you go to Daejeon?

135
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,110
I was stuck in traffic.

136
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,010
It rained that day,
so traffic was bad.

137
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,440
It was okay, So Min.

138
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,090
- I had a lot of fun, Jae Suk.
- It can happen.

139
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,010
Who paid that day, by the way?

140
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,810
- Who paid for dinner?
- Suk Jin seemed hesitant.

141
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,820
Jae Suk paid.

142
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,990
"Jae Suk, you go ahead and pay."

143
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,030
You could've paid for that.

144
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,690
We just had sundae soup.

145
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,490
It's not like that. Jae Suk
arranged the meeting that day.

146
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,430
- But still...
- Jae Suk called us together.

147
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,990
- I...
- But you're the oldest one here.

148
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,670
I didn't want
to infringe on his right.

149
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,480
Jae Suk called us together,
but you were the oldest one there.

150
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,110
That doesn't matter. Hey.

151
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,800
When it comes to money,
he's the senior.

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,850
I know, but...

153
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,280
He's the richest one here.

154
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,220
We just had sundae soup.
It didn't even cost a lot.

155
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,790
Okay. I understand
that you saved money.

156
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,950
- I didn't save money.
- Why did you not take So Min home?

157
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,730
- About So Min...
- You say first.

158
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,730
I believed that Jae Suk
would give her a ride.

159
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,470
It would've been better
if you took a taxi home.

160
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,470
That's what I was going to do.

161
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,900
That was my plan.

162
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,170
He's the worst.

163
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,410
It was your choice.

164
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,800
It was your choice
that you sent your manager home.

165
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,200
- I was going to take a taxi.
- If you took a taxi,

166
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,930
he would've gone home in an hour.

167
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,300
Take a look
at the banner behind you.

168
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,370
- What?
- What is this?

169
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,920
- "The new millennium is coming."
- "The 21st century."

170
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,180
- The millennium!
- My gosh.

171
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,550
- I remember 1999.
- Me too.

172
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,310
Turbo released
the song, "Cyber Lover".

173
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,180
- Right. "Cyber Lover".
- "Cyber Lover".

174
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,180
- "Cyber Lover".
- "Cyber Lover".

175
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,190
Do you remember the time?

176
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,250
It was the end of the 20th century.

177
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,600
- It was like the end of the world.
- We thought we'd die.

178
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,490
- They foretold the end.
- And that wasn't it.

179
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,630
They also believed
that computers wouldn't recognize...

180
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,000
the year 2000.

181
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,840
- Right.
- The millennium bug.

182
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,500
We were told
not to access a computer.

183
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,930
- They said it would be crazy.
- Some people even withdrew money...

184
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,800
- from their bank accounts.
- Right. It was crazy.

185
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,420
Did you make your debut in 1999?

186
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,220
No, I debuted in 1991.

187
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,440
So it was a lot after your debut.

188
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,220
But that's when I started
doing many TV shows.

189
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,010
It was 1995...

190
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,750
- when he hosted my fan meeting.
- Your fan meeting.

191
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,190
But I don't remember him at all.

192
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,600
- Was it 1995?
- Not at all.

193
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,300
Seriously, I was...

194
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,620
- I remember only one thing.
- It was a stadium.

195
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,990
- What?
- In a corner of the waiting room,

196
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,200
you were getting an envelope
from the CEO of my agency.

197
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,430
(Polite)

198
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,910
I remember that we had an MC.

199
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,910
The CEO was like this. "Here."

200
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,740
And he was getting a white
envelope in front of the door.

201
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,680
- I remember the very scene.
- My goodness.

202
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,440
I felt bitter.

203
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,010
I was supposed
to introduce Jong Kook and leave.

204
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,220
"It's Turbo!"
And I was supposed to leave.

205
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,510
Jong Kook showed up.

206
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,180
The fans were roaring.

207
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,530
And outside the hall,
the CEO paid me like this. "Thanks."

208
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,100
(Thank you, sir.)

209
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,750
(Jae Suk's tears plopped down
on the thin white envelope.)

210
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,100
So he went through things like that.

211
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,690
- He did.
- I did.

212
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,800
Jae Suk did.

213
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,500
Today is December 31, 1999.

214
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,740
- My goodness.
- For the year 1999,

215
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,800
we have guests
who were born in 1999.

216
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,740
- Born in 1999?
- People who were born in 1999?

217
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,310
- In 1999?
- I see.

218
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,180
We have guests
who were born in 1999.

219
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,350
Please come on out.

220
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,850
Hello.

221
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,090
(SAN of ATEEZ,
Arin of OH MY GIRL, Jin Ji Hee)

222
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,380
- Ji Hee.
- Bbangkku Ttongkku.

223
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,090
Arin is here. And there's SAN.

224
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,620
(They are excited to see
the guests born in 1999.)

225
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,360
- Hello.
- Come over here.

226
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,550
Welcome.

227
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,820
(The little girl who caused...)

228
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,690
(the Bbangkku Ttongkku craze
12 years ago...)

229
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,700
(has grown
into this pretty actress.)

230
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,410
(The hottest drama of 2021,
"The Penthouse",)

231
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,280
(Jin Ji Hee showed
her professional acting skills.)

232
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,550
(The popular girl group, OH MY GIRL)

233
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,380
(Arin is the youngest member
with her refreshing charm.)

234
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,430
(The 2022 World Tour Concert
of ATEEZ is sold out.)

235
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,790
(ATEEZ's concerts are selling out
around the world.)

236
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,720
(The rising global
K-pop star band, ATEEZ)

237
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,400
(ATEEZ's performer
and lead vocalist, SAN)

238
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,540
(The trio born in 1999)

239
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,800
- Come here.
- Welcome.

240
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,560
- All right.
- Hey.

241
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,230
ATEEZ.

242
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,830
Look at her.

243
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,230
She's grown a lot.

244
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,550
- Ji Hee, you are...
- Hello.

245
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,780
I can't believe this.

246
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,020
I really liked her
when she was little.

247
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,650
- Me too.
- Seriously.

248
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,390
- I saw her on the news.
- I saw you on MBC.

249
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,480
I really liked you.

250
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,660
- This is great. Ji Hee...
- Hello.

251
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,020
This is undone.

252
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,050
- I opened it on purpose.
- You did?

253
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,820
I was surprised to see that.

254
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,030
I thought it was undone.

255
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,000
- This is the point.
- It's fashion.

256
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,690
- That's what we used to do.
- In the 1990s?

257
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,460
- My goodness.
- So we have...

258
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,930
Ji Hee here.

259
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,230
We also have Arin and SAN.

260
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,200
They all were born in 1999.

261
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,700
- Really?
- My gosh.

262
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,410
- I don't want to say...
- She was really cute.

263
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,910
- what happened in 1999.
- And her acting was the best.

264
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,380
It was crazy in 1999.

265
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,750
So Ji Hee is...

266
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,290
- 23 years old now.
- What?

267
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,760
- That's unbelievable.
- But...

268
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,290
I can't believe that.

269
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,450
It's been 19 years since her debut.

270
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,290
She debuted before some of you.

271
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,630
She debuted before me.

272
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,800
- She made her debut before I did.
- It's been 19 years?

273
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,530
She made her debut
in a TV drama in 2003.

274
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,770
- It was "Yellow Handkerchief".
- Right.

275
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,960
- Is that right?
- Yes.

276
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,770
So is this...

277
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,170
your first time
on Running Man, Ji Hee?

278
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,010
- Yes. This is...
- It feels like...

279
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,970
- you were here before.
- Right.

280
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,940
I wanted to join you,
but I wasn't invited.

281
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,070
I see.

282
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,440
I can't believe...

283
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,550
Ji Hee is 23 already.

284
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,660
- It's hard to believe.
- How old were you in the sitcom?

285
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,080
I was 11 back then.

286
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,290
I was 11 and 12.

287
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,390
- Were you 11 back then?
- Yes.

288
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,890
You wanted to join our show...

289
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,630
- when you were an eighth-grader?
- Of course.

290
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,000
It was her wish.

291
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,630
- Right.
- As an eighth-grader.

292
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,730
"Ji Hee's wish
is to join Running Man."

293
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,060
(The 14-year-old Ji Hee's dream:
Joining Running Man)

294
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,140
- That's cute.
- I know.

295
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,060
That was her dream
when she was in middle school.

296
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,930
- And she's 23 now.
- It comes true when you're 23.

297
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,510
- She's a Running Man kid.
- I grew up watching Running Man.

298
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,570
(Her dream from 9 years ago
is finally coming true today.)

299
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,250
So how do you feel to be here?

300
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,420
Gosh, stop it.

301
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,440
(He suddenly asks her
about how she feels.)

302
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,620
- He's being ridiculous.
- Stop it.

303
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,050
It's so old-fashioned.

304
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,790
- Oh, dear.
- Stop it, Mr. Vintage.

305
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,890
What's wrong with him?

306
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,630
He's being condescending again.

307
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,450
- This is amazing.
- Do you find it amazing?

308
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,000
Ji Hee recently finished her drama,

309
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,500
"The Penthouse 3".

310
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,730
How are you doing these days?

311
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,770
I go to school
and prepare for the school play.

312
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,330
- You're a college student.
- Right.

313
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,280
- That sounds nice.
- She's so young.

314
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,730
It sounds really fun.

315
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,600
- It must be fun.
- I'm a college senior.

316
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,280
- Are you a senior?
- Yes.

317
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,440
You know what?

318
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,020
He didn't graduate from college.

319
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,440
He's envious.

320
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,080
- He's a college dropout.
- But I went to college...

321
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,390
for four years.

322
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,030
As a freshman.

323
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,320
I took only the first semester.

324
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,300
I went to college for four years
as a freshman.

325
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,900
And I went
to a college retreat every year.

326
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,090
If that's the case...

327
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,960
He just went to school for fun.

328
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,590
- He deserves an honorary diploma.
- I liked to hang out with friends.

329
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,830
- So I went to every retreat.
- That sounds fun.

330
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,910
So did you drink makgeolli
on the campus lawn?

331
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,140
What?

332
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,150
Hey, that's not
what college students do now.

333
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,880
What are you talking about?

334
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,810
- That was a long time ago.
- That's ridiculous.

335
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,180
He doesn't know
about what young people do.

336
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,250
- Haha.
- That was a long time ago.

337
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,440
Did he go to college?

338
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,550
- Sure.
- Come here.

339
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,650
Did you hear that?

340
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,210
- "Did he go to college?"
- You did?

341
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,220
Hey, Jong Kook.

342
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,820
My goodness.

343
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,550
"Did he go to college?"

344
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,690
Arin says she's a Running Man kid.

345
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,870
Really?

346
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,030
- Is that true?
- Yes.

347
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,190
I really wanted to try
tearing off a name tag.

348
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,930
I said that in many interviews.

349
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,430
- You did?
- Yes. I'm...

350
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,600
just like Jin Hee...

351
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,910
- Jin Hee...
- It's Ji Hee.

352
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,100
(Jin Hee?)

353
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,680
(Embarrassed)

354
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,920
Arin, it can happen.

355
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,890
- Ms. Ji Hee... I mean, Ji Hee...
- It's Ji Hee.

356
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,450
- She's Jin Ji Hee.
- I see.

357
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,980
I know it's confusing.

358
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,350
They are not close.

359
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,180
During the opening,

360
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,590
Arin said the wrong name.

361
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,300
- It's awkward.
- It's like...

362
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,460
- they fell into a pit.
- Right. It's awkward now.

363
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,370
- I'm sorry.
- It's really okay.

364
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,770
SAN can barely hear...

365
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,140
what Arin and Ji Hee are saying.

366
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,180
He's worried
about his own interview.

367
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,910
- He's feeling nervous.
- Right.

368
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,070
- Because he's nervous?
- Yes.

369
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,250
This is the face
of the 21st century.

370
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,700
- He's different.
- He looks sophisticated.

371
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,710
- It's the urban type.
- I know.

372
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,180
Standing next to him,

373
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,480
- Jae Suk looks like a squid.
- He's totally different.

374
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,390
It's like a squid is
standing next to him.

375
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,350
- SAN looks so cool.
- Hey.

376
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,660
- He looks like a baby octopus.
- Seriously,

377
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,050
- This is a mudflat.
- You guys.

378
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,630
Se Chan, Suk Jin, and you...

379
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,930
look like dried white baits.

380
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,130
Dried white baits?

381
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,370
So we have SAN here.

382
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,670
- He's a member of ATEEZ.
- ATEEZ.

383
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,960
He belongs to ATEEZ.

384
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,400
We did an album together.

385
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,060
- Oh, right.
- That's true.

386
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,430
They recently worked with Jong Kook.

387
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,100
- They did a collaboration.
- They did an album together.

388
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,470
(Jong Kook appeared
in the music video...)

389
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,070
(for "The Black Cat Nero" by ATEEZ.)

390
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,150
(They also released
a collaboration album together...)

391
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,290
(with the song,
"Be My Lover" recently.)

392
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,720
(Jong Kook has
a special bond with SAN.)

393
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,820
Look. He's got broad shoulders.

394
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,350
He does have broad shoulders.

395
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,450
I've been taking
your protein supplements.

396
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,720
- He is pleased.
- I told him...

397
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,370
that his face needs a nice build.

398
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,910
I can tell...

399
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,430
- Jong Kook cares for him a lot.
- Sure.

400
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,780
- His eyes...
- Jong Kook can't hide it.

401
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,880
By the way, your outfit is...

402
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,680
You look like a dump truck driver
in an American film.

403
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,050
- I know what you mean.
- You know it.

404
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,620
- A guy who arm-wrestles.
- And beer.

405
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,390
- He always drinks beer.
- He drinks beer.

406
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,350
- I drive a truck.
- He goes to a bar at night.

407
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,890
- And I carry around a rifle.
- Right.

408
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,160
And he's divorced.

409
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,720
He has a son.

410
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,220
His wife died.

411
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,550
- She died?
- That's what he looks like.

412
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,690
That's enough.

413
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,960
You look good
with your boyfriend today.

414
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,130
We're a couple.

415
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,270
(Excited)

416
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,430
They are clapping.

417
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,140
(Clapping)

418
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,670
They are clapping.

419
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,570
They are idol artists.

420
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,140
So they give reactions all the time.

421
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,780
They look good together, don't they?

422
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,440
Yes. They look lovely.

423
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,750
They are idol artists,
so they just clap their hands.

424
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,210
They are of the same age,
but they're different from Ji Hee.

425
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,440
They are a little different.

426
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,850
I want to be like them.

427
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,520
- Ji Hee claps when she wants to.
- Right.

428
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,680
But SAN and Arin
just clap no matter what.

429
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,030
- Right.
- Am I right?

430
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,630
All right.

431
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,690
Today, with the 99 kids
who were born in 1999,

432
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,230
we will have the Prophets of
the End of the Century Race.

433
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,410
Today is the last day of 1999
when Nostradamus predicted...

434
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,380
the Earth would come to an end.

435
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,470
If you guys manage to survive today,

436
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,470
you will be able to see
the new millennium safely.

437
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,120
(If they survive today, they will
see the new millennium safely.)

438
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,380
But in here...

439
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,890
(But in here...)

440
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,020
(In here?)

441
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,420
We have two people who
try to stop you from doing so.

442
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,850
I knew it.

443
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,430
- They are two prophets,
- I had this feeling.

444
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,050
Nostra and Damus.

445
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,800
(There are two prophets,
Nostra and Damus.)

446
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,460
A French prophet from the 16th
century, Nostradamus has revived.

447
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,930
He predicted World War I and II,
and even the end of the world.

448
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,880
This is what Nostradamus predicted.

449
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,300
He said the world would come to an
end right before the 21st century.

450
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,340
(Nostradamus predicted the Earth
would come to an end in 1999.)

451
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,520
They are the new prophets...

452
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,620
who foretold the end of the world
and shocked Running Man.

453
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,580
They are named Nostra and Damus.

454
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,260
In here,

455
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,950
we have two prophets,
Nostra and Damus.

456
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,690
My gosh.

457
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,870
Jong Kook is starting it again.

458
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,930
(Jong Kook is starting it again.)

459
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,640
- He's staring at me.
- Do you think it's him?

460
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,430
- Stop it.
- I got him.

461
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,410
We have Nostra and Damus in here.

462
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,100
- You...
- Nostra and Damus?

463
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,300
You are overreacting.

464
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,970
- It's not like that.
- All right.

465
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,650
I know I look strange.

466
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,940
I'm the only one
who looks strange here.

467
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,180
Today, you will
accumulate prize money...

468
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,310
after each mission.

469
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,680
If you manage to single out
Nostra and Damus through a vote,

470
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,450
you will get the prize money
you accumulated during the race.

471
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,130
The two people...

472
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,690
who are picked by the final vote,

473
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,300
whether they are
citizens or prophets,

474
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,930
will get a penalty.

475
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,170
I see.

476
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,640
And the prize money
that the rest of you get...

477
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,700
will vary depending on whether
the prophets are arrested or not.

478
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,010
So two of you will be arrested.

479
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,620
(The rules of Judgment Stand)

480
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,290
If both Nostra
and Damus are arrested,

481
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,980
the rest of the members will get
the prize money they accumulated.

482
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,050
(The citizens get their prize money
if Nostra and Damus are arrested.)

483
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,450
If only one of them is arrested,

484
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,550
you will get only half
of your prize money.

485
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,050
(They get only half of their money
if only one of them is arrested.)

486
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,900
If you fail to arrest both of them,

487
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,220
you won't get your prize money.

488
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,670
(If they fail to arrest them,
only the prophets get the money.)

489
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,170
There will be three teams
in each round.

490
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,880
The teams will be decided randomly
for each mission.

491
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,910
(The teams will be decided randomly
for each mission.)

492
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,440
Before each mission,
the prophets will...

493
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,010
predict the ranking of the teams.

494
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,770
They will predict...

495
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,390
who will be in
1st, 2nd, and 3rd places.

496
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,660
And their team always
has to be the third.

497
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,680
That means they will try...

498
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,180
- They have to be the 3rd.
- to make their team the 3rd.

499
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,020
We will be able to see that.

500
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,160
This is tricky.

501
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,520
- I'm worried about you, Se Chan.
- So one member in a team...

502
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,790
- I'm not. Trust me.
- It sounds so difficult.

503
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,960
- You're done for.
- It'll be too difficult for you.

504
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,790
- That team must be in the last.
- I told you, I'm not the one.

505
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,230
If their predictions turn out right,
they'll get a big prize.

506
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,840
- I guess they know about the games.
- We'll inform them.

507
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,650
But when their predictions
turn out wrong,

508
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,120
the citizens will get a chance
to decide who they are.

509
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,150
He's in trouble.

510
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,180
- That's how you can find...
- It'll be hard for him.

511
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,890
- Nostra and Damus hidden among you.
- Got it.

512
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,660
We'll begin the first mission.

513
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,450
It's a gun shooting game.

514
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,630
- What? A gun shooting game?
- Yes, that's the first mission.

515
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,680
It's a simple game.

516
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,430
We'll draw names to decide the teams
for that game now.

517
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,190
Suk Jin looks quite nervous.

518
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,830
Suk Jin has been acting
a little weird.

519
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,400
- He stuttered too.
- Oh, right.

520
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,640
- He always stutters though.
- Maybe he's Nostra,

521
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,070
- and Se Chan is Damus.
- But Suk Jin got much smoother.

522
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,000
Now, I'll draw the three names...

523
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,200
- on the 1st team for the 1st game.
- Okay.

524
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,240
(The teams for the 1st game
will be decided.)

525
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,080
- Se Chan, Suk Jin, and So Min.
- Oh, okay.

526
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
(Team 1: Se chan, Suk Jin, So Min)

527
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,970
- Oh, the 3 of us?
- The 3 of us.

528
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,320
- What does that mean?
- Okay.

529
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,440
- We're on the same team.
- Right.

530
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,950
SAN, Arin, Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo.

531
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,450
And the rest three of you are
on Team Three.

532
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,950
- Ji Hee is on our team.
- Oh, yes. I'm excited.

533
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,330
- Awesome.
- Ji Hee and "How Do You Play?".

534
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,400
Before I tell you the rules
of the first game,

535
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,330
the prophets will make
their predictions.

536
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,430
They want us to put on a blindfold.

537
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,640
- A blindfold?
- Put on a blindfold.

538
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,460
(So everyone put on a blindfold.)

539
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,840
Keep a distance from one another
so you won't touch one another.

540
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,680
All right. Everyone.

541
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,740
The prophets will predict
the result of the game.

542
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:01,210
Only Nostra and Damus,
pull down your blindfolds slightly.

543
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,180
First, predict the ranking
of the team of Se Chan, So Min,

544
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,890
and Suk Jin, and show us
by raising your fingers.

545
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,190
(Each of them predicts
the ranking of Team 1.)

546
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,330
Next, show the ranking of the team
of Haha, Jae Suk, and Ji Hee...

547
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,570
that you predict using your fingers.

548
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,230
(And they predict
the ranking of Team 2.)

549
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,870
Now, predict the ranking
of the team...

550
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,730
of Ji Hyo, Arin, SAN, and Jong Kook.

551
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,200
(They predicted the rankings
of all 3 teams.)

552
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,640
It's over.

553
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,080
- You may take off the blindfold.
- Okay.

554
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,380
Well...

555
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,120
I think that Suk Jin is
one of the prophets.

556
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,680
- Why?
- It's because...

557
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,440
- Why?
- Are you wearing cologne?

558
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,860
- Yes. Why?
- Whenever he moved,

559
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,250
I could smell his cologne.

560
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,780
(Whenever he moved,
I could smell his cologne.)

561
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,830
- Suk Jin, come on.
- He got caught.

562
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,520
- I think he got caught.
- You're not, are you?

563
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,960
- Really?
- Of course not.

564
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,520
- You're not, are you?
- I smelled it whenever he moved.

565
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,990
- We caught one.
- Even that can be suspicious?

566
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,870
- This is so funny.
- Nostra and Damus are so lucky.

567
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,430
- Everyone thinks I'm one of them.
- It's hilarious.

568
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,910
- I could smell it.
- By the way...

569
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,200
- It's too easy.
- They must be happy.

570
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,200
Suk Jin, why do you keep blushing?

571
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,240
You're not one of them, are you?

572
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,320
Now, please move with your team.

573
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,890
- Yes.
- I act suspicious when I'm not.

574
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,710
You know that I act suspicious
when I'm not, right?

575
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,950
All right. We'll begin
the first game now.

576
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,430
- Okay.
- The first mission requires...

577
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,490
a good strategy
for getting a bigger prize.

578
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,860
It's Cyber Balloon Lover.

579
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,430
You'll play a survival game
divided into three teams.

580
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,840
You can find pouches with a badge...

581
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,840
with the number 99 on it
at different places.

582
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,170
Each badge is worth ten dollars.

583
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,970
You can either find
as many badges as you can...

584
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,650
or you can shoot the last balloon
out of five balloons...

585
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,150
on the back of a member
of another team to get one badge.

586
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,210
Also, each team has
its headquarters.

587
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,980
Your team is out if you lose...

588
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,560
all the balloons
at the headquarters.

589
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,330
Even if you lose all the balloons
on your back,

590
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,900
you can refill balloons at your
headquarters to go back to fight.

591
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,630
But your team may be eliminated soon
as fewer balloons will be left.

592
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,170
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

593
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,530
Don't forget that Nostra and Damus
will do anything...

594
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,640
- to make their teams lose.
- Oh, right.

595
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,140
- It'll be easy to tell.
- I think it'll be difficult.

596
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,200
Hey, Damus.

597
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,700
- No.
- Hey, Damus.

598
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,200
No, I'm not Damus.

599
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,350
- Were the three of you on Team One?
- Yes.

600
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,080
- This way, please.
- Got it.

601
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,420
That must be our...
Oh, I see balloons.

602
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,940
- Is that our headquarters?
- That's pretty.

603
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,560
It's like someone prepared
a surprise event.

604
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,820
- A surprise event?
- Right? Look at those balloons.

605
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,430
- Right. I see what you mean.
- Se Chan.

606
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,990
When did you prepare all that?

607
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,990
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

608
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,290
You should tell her
how you feel now.

609
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:28,960
You've waited long enough.

610
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,760
Okay. I filled the trunk of my car
with balloons.

611
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,600
- That's so pretty.
- Oh, my.

612
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,030
- I guess it's been a long time
- How pretty.

613
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,610
Whose are those red balloons?

614
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,470
- The red balloons belong...
- I see the red balloons.

615
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,850
to the "How Do You Play?" team
and Ji Hee.

616
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,470
- The "How Do You Play?" team?
- Oh, I see.

617
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,080
You mean those two?

618
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,920
- Oh, I see.
- I'm speechless.

619
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,210
- Oh, the "How Do You Play?" team?
- Gosh, seriously.

620
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,450
- The "How Do You Play?" team?
- Exactly.

621
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,180
I can't believe this.

622
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,390
- Gosh.
- Come on.

623
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,890
(They're putting on a balloon vest
at their headquarters.)

624
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,720
- You've never done this, right?
- No, I haven't.

625
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,070
There's nothing special
about this game.

626
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,230
Haven't you played a shooting game
like this with your parents?

627
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,140
Don't you play games like this
with your friends?

628
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,260
- I've tried it on my school trip.
- On your school trip?

629
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,030
You can wear the glasses as well
if you want.

630
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,430
- Sorry?
- The glasses.

631
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,180
That won't be necessary.

632
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,410
- You get scared easily, you know.
- Gosh.

633
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,180
Why that little...

634
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,210
(Protective glasses are prepared
for the scaredy-cats.)

635
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,710
The director of Running Man.

636
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,710
I hate the director of Running Man.

637
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,120
- Where are those glasses?
- Right?

638
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,560
Gosh, I'm worried.

639
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,590
(So all 3 teams settled
at their own headquarters.)

640
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,690
- It won't be easy.
- Who should guard the headquarters?

641
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,660
- I think...
- The strong one should do that.

642
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,960
You think so? I agree...

643
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,140
that since you two are the guests,

644
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,730
you should move around
more than I do.

645
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,810
Suk Jin, I'll guard
our headquarters.

646
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,380
- Will you do that?
- Yes, I'll do it.

647
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,080
Z-KIRI, will you be the guard?

648
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,650
(Z-KIRI, will you be the guard?)

649
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,210
Let's take turns
guarding our headquarters.

650
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,210
Come back when you get tired.

651
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,890
- Good. Let's do that.
- To take a break?

652
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,920
- Got it.
- I'll be the first to guard here.

653
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,710
- Okay. Keep our balloons safe.
- Okay.

654
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,360
The race will begin now.

655
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,830
- Okay. I'll stay here.
- Five.

656
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,750
- You'll be here?
- Four.

657
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,830
- Three.
- So Min, keep all of them safe.

658
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,460
- Two.
- I'm scared.

659
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,830
- This spot here...
- We've got this!

660
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,930
- We'll get going.
- Go!

661
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,930
How shall I teach them a lesson?

662
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,180
Let's find some 99 badges.

663
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,930
What could those pouches look like?
Okay. I found one.

664
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,850
Did you find one? Okay.

665
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,970
(Se Chan found a pouch
with a 99 badge.)

666
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,010
- I did well, right?
- Yes, you did well.

667
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,320
- Oh, there it is.
- Where?

668
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,680
I've become better
at finding hidden things like this.

669
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,040
I'm impressed.
You're really good at finding it.

670
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,750
- You're so good at it.
- It used to be hard before.

671
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,420
But it became easy.

672
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,160
I think there's another one
around here.

673
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,220
(They get 10 dollars
for each 99 badge they find.)

674
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,250
Do you think we should attack
the other teams first?

675
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,520
I like that idea.

676
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,630
(Team Black's attackers are
moving forward boldly.)

677
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,290
Arin, you should find pouches too.

678
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,640
(Ji Hyo luckily found a pouch
while walking.)

679
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,840
(Arin took her advice
and tried hard to find a pouch.)

680
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,580
Where should I put it?

681
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,110
(While she was celebrating
finding her first badge...)

682
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,420
Great. I see two weaklings here.

683
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,820
What? How dare you...

684
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,210
- call us weaklings?
- Don't shoot first. SAN is coming.

685
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,350
- SAN, you look so enthusiastic.
- What? How dare you...

686
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:05,210
(At that moment,
SAN started running toward them.)

687
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
Look at SAN.

688
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,950
Your balloons will pop
once you show your enthusiasm.

689
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:10,990
(A male idol singer who's trying to
prove himself is always ruthless.)

690
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,100
- SAN, you look enthusiastic.
- Hey, this is...

691
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,990
(The scaredy-cats who were watching
decided to join the fight.)

692
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,460
(He gets excited
every time he holds a toy gun.)

693
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,910
Ji Hee, follow me. Hurry.

694
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,080
(SAN got surrounded by his enemies
in an instant.)

695
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,620
(He's trying to protect his balloons
with big movements.)

696
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,150
(During the brief confrontation...)

697
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,320
(Jae Suk runs with a smirk
on his face.)

698
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,180
(Pop)

699
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,590
(Bull's eye)

700
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,330
- Oh, gosh.
- Nice.

701
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,600
(He never misses the target.)

702
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,130
- Oh, gosh.
- Nice.

703
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,640
SAN has only one balloon left.

704
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,840
(SAN has only one balloon left.)

705
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,960
(Team Black is
pushed over the edge.)

706
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,030
I'm out.

707
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,030
(Team Black is
pushed over the edge.)

708
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,680
Go away!

709
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,530
No.

710
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,180
(Pop)

711
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:09,090
(Screaming repeatedly)

712
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,160
I can't go near her
because my ears hurt.

713
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,680
I can't get close to her
because she keeps screaming.

714
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,130
Oh, gosh. Help me.

715
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,250
(The new technique of building
a shield by screaming)

716
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,520
My ears hurt so much.

717
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
(Screaming)

718
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,170
- She has some balloons left.
- No!

719
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,190
- I didn't shoot. You...
- No!

720
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,530
(While they are having
a fierce battle...)

721
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,810
(Haha leaves the headquarters!)

722
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,840
Okay.

723
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,200
Suk Jin, give me time to reload.
I'm out of bullets.

724
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Darn it.

725
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,200
(As Ji Hyo retreats temporarily,)

726
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,770
(Haha runs toward her.)

727
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,090
(He popped all Ji Hyo's balloons.)

728
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,250
(That's when...)

729
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,280
Hey, stop!

730
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,210
(This is my chance.)

731
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,720
(Se Chan is running
into Team Red's headquarters.)

732
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,690
Oh, no. That's our headquarters.

733
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,220
Hey, stop!

734
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,660
(Team Red's headquarters are empty
as Haha left there.)

735
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,540
(Se Chan's Camera)

736
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,580
(Shooting every balloon)

737
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,640
No!

738
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,640
(He popped 9 balloons
at an insane speed.)

739
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,940
Get him!

740
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,290
(He's leaving quickly
after the sudden attack.)

741
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,880
Give us our balloons back.

742
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:29,850
(Team Red lost 9 balloons
in a flash.)

743
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,030
Give me more bullets.

744
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,500
- Ji Hee.
- Yes?

745
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,120
- Give me more bullets.
- I don't know where they are.

746
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
- How did it go?
- I popped a lot of their balloons.

747
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,810
- How many balloons do I have left?
- I have one left.

748
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,400
- What about me?
- You have two left.

749
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,480
Sorry? What did you say?

750
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,780
(While they were checking
each other's remaining balloons...)

751
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,550
What's this?

752
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,370
What? Hey, you have a red balloon
on your back.

753
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,670
Leave it.

754
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,710
(He brought a red balloon
as a trophy unintentionally.)

755
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,880
- How did it get on your back?
- I have no idea.

756
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,990
Jong Kook, I need to refill
my balloons.

757
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,060
Why did you guys... Gosh.

758
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,730
It wasn't like that.
The other teams...

759
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,560
I think you should go there.

760
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,460
- Really? Why?
- It's because...

761
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,360
they call us weaklings
and think we're an easy target.

762
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,070
Oh, gosh. Go and put balloons
on your back. You lost all of them?

763
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,960
- Yes, I lost all of them.
- Gosh. How did that happen?

764
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,460
Oh, dear. I'm drooling.

765
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,870
Shouldn't we attack them?

766
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,480
(Meanwhile, the high frequency
attacker barely survived.)

767
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,170
(She tries to attack Big Nose.)

768
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,870
(They look like a father
and his daughter playing a game.)

769
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,320
(Pop)

770
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,140
You have only one balloon left.
I'll let you go.

771
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,140
(You have only one balloon left.
I'll let you go.)

772
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,350
(I'll let you go.)

773
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,610
- I'll let you go.
- Gosh.

774
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,850
(Suk Jin let Arin go
when she had 1 balloon left.)

775
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,590
- There. The red one.
- Oh, wait.

776
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,120
- Sorry?
- The red one.

777
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:38,800
(He could've shot her last balloon
as she could refill her balloons.)

778
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,270
(What was Suk Jin's intention?)

779
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,010
- We're in the middle.
- We're sandwiched between them.

780
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,980
- We're at a disadvantage.
- How about we attack them together?

781
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,840
- Are you at a disadvantage?
- Of course.

782
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,780
- Our headquarters is in the middle.
- Did you lose many balloons?

783
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,370
We can be attacked easily
since we're in the middle.

784
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,780
- Please help us.
- Shall we help Ji Hee's team?

785
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,020
Are we all going to attack them?

786
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,850
(Okay.)

787
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,880
Let's go. Haha.

788
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,850
- Yes?
- Stay here to guard our balloons.

789
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,090
We'll go and attack
their headquarters.

790
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,330
Now, we're allies. We certainly are.

791
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,420
This means we're allies.

792
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:15,000
(While they're walking
toward Team White's headquarters...)

793
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,840
What are you doing?

794
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,240
(They meet the warrior
of the end of the century.)

795
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,700
- Look at So Min.
- Of course we should attack them.

796
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,080
(She started shooting.)

797
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,350
Hey. That hurts.

798
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,710
I'm sorry.

799
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,610
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

800
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,450
I see So Min over there.

801
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,590
Ji Hee, come over here.

802
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,560
(Ji Hee joins him without hesitating
as the weakest has been spotted.)

803
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,530
(Team Red is getting closer
to Team White's headquarters.)

804
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,330
Suk Jin, when will you come?

805
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,860
(While they are confronting
the cyber warrior...)

806
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,600
(Ha Jackson runs to ambush them.)

807
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,370
Be careful! Guard the headquarters!

808
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,670
(Team White's headquarters seems
too easy to attack.)

809
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,350
Keep the headquarters safe!

810
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,250
(Ha Jackson is trying to sneak in
along the byway.)

811
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,610
Okay. Haha is going up there.

812
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,140
Hey, he's coming.
SAN is running toward us.

813
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,250
(SAN of Team Black spots Haha
and starts running.)

814
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,790
(Hey, he's coming.
SAN is running toward us.)

815
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,950
- Suk Jin, behind you.
- What?

816
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
How dare you?

817
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,150
Oh, no. What should we do?

818
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,650
What do we do?

819
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,890
(Jae Suk and Ji Hee join them
to keep the momentum going.)

820
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:25,270
(While watching them,
Jong Kook gives a hand signal.)

821
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:30,600
(And Arin starts running
in the opposite direction.)

822
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,140
(She sneaks into
Team Red's headquarters.)

823
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,640
(At the moment,
all members of Red Team...)

824
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,710
(are attacking Team White.)

825
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,050
Come on, Se Chan.

826
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,880
Hey, Se Chan.

827
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,060
Oh, gosh.

828
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,650
(Arin of Team Black uses the moment
to attack their headquarters.)

829
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,260
I must hurry. Let's go.

830
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,350
(Arin of Team Black uses the moment
to attack their headquarters.)

831
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,730
(She has a chance to eliminate
the whole team.)

832
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,130
Stop it!

833
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,160
We lost all our balloons.

834
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,430
This is bad.

835
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,810
(Arin continues attacking
with no one around her.)

836
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,280
(What?)

837
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,750
(However...)

838
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,640
(Giggling)

839
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,260
(She sat down
after popping only 3 balloons.)

840
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,420
(That's not all.
She picks up bullets...)

841
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,270
(and leaves there
without shooting the balloons.)

842
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:32,000
(Her behavior seems unreasonable
as no one is chasing after her.)

843
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,160
I should hide.

844
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,280
(She suddenly hides herself
when she has a great chance.)

845
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,810
(The 3 members of Team Red
have no idea.)

846
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,080
Okay!

847
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,440
Hey.

848
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,940
(Jae Suk is returning
as if he started worrying.)

849
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,050
Okay.

850
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,110
(Jae Suk is returning
as if he started worrying.)

851
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,110
(But Arin is still hiding.)

852
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,760
(Pop)

853
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,490
What was that?

854
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,260
(Arin's last balloon popped.)

855
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,800
(Arin popped only a few balloons
so Jae Suk wouldn't notice.)

856
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,190
Arin, what are you doing there?

857
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,430
I was just taking a break.

858
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,630
(I was just taking a break.)

859
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,510
You didn't come here
to pop our balloons, did you?

860
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,400
I walked around here.

861
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,130
I was about to leave.

862
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,370
(At that moment...)

863
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,780
(SAN appears with a serious look
on his face.)

864
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,950
(He meets Jae Suk.)

865
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,350
(SAN wants to get back at him
for his attack earlier.)

866
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:34,070
(If he pops all the balloons here,
Team Red will be out.)

867
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,860
I'm out. Gosh.

868
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,340
(Right then,
Jae Suk ran out of bullets.)

869
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,340
- What? Arin.
- Yes?

870
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,130
You popped too few balloons.

871
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,670
(You popped too few balloons.)

872
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,550
- What happened?
- I did my best.

873
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,710
Hurry up and come.

874
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,050
(Here goes the troubleshooter.)

875
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,250
- Hey.
- What's happening there?

876
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,410
(Ji Hee saw what happened
at her headquarters too.)

877
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,230
No! Oh, my gosh.

878
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,950
Keep shooting.

879
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,730
(Team Red has only 4 balloons left
until they get eliminated.)

880
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,620
- This one won't pop.
- Hey, stop.

881
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,920
That's not fair. You can't do that.

882
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,860
Gosh. I have no bullets. Gosh.

883
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,660
- Hurry up!
- Jae Suk, you're out.

884
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,540
(Things are getting worse.
Jae Suk is out.)

885
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,570
- Hurry!
- Why won't it pop?

886
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,540
- Come on.
- No!

887
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,580
Hurry up.

888
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,580
(This is the last red balloon.)

889
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,780
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hurry up and come.

890
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,900
SAN.

891
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,010
- We agreed not to do this.
- I mean...

892
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,520
I ran out of bullets.

893
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,410
- Team Red is out!
- Darn.

894
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:31,060
(Team Red is out.)

895
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,290
Gosh. Where did Haha go?

896
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,650
- I ran out of bullets.
- That went well.

897
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,150
Gosh. I had no bullets left.

898
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,120
You guys let your guard down.
Haha went there too.

899
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,270
Exactly. Why would he leave here?

900
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,270
(Team Red lost because they left
the headquarters attended.)

901
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,890
One of us should've stayed
to guard our balloons.

902
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,010
- I had no bullets left.
- Is Haha one of the prophets?

903
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,070
(Is Haha one of the prophets?)

904
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:50,510
(The man who caused the defeat
is coming back.)

905
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,170
- Isn't Haha suspicious?
- I think so too.

906
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,810
- You asked him to guard here.
- Why did he leave here?

907
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,940
I heard you saying that to him.

908
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,940
(He was asked to guard
the headquarters.)

909
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,940
(Could Haha who left his position
be 1 of the prophets?)

910
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,940
What happened?

911
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,590
(Could Haha who left his position
be one of the prophets?)

912
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,820
- Hey.
- Haha won't even come here.

913
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,820
Come over here.

914
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,420
Why? He just told me,
"Come over here."

915
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,150
- Come over here.
- "Come over here."

916
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
Me?

917
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,650
Hey, the cast member
of "How Do You Play?", come here.

918
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,070
- Me?
- Yes, you.

919
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,100
Why?

920
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,390
Why did you leave the headquarters?

921
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,270
You know that I helped you
attack that team.

922
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,270
(He joined the battle
when he wasn't even asked to.)

923
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,280
We're out, Haha.

924
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,170
Darn it.

925
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,810
(Could Haha who left
the headquarters...)

926
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:31,350
(be 1 of the 2 prophets,
Nostra and Damus?)

927
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,820
Okay. Hang it.

928
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,940
You might lose them all
if you keep them in your pocket.

929
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,820
I can't believe I couldn't pop
a single balloon.

930
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,490
We should pop
Jong Kook's balloons first.

931
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,030
Whose balloons should we pop?

932
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,760
Hey, we... Red ones.

933
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,060
Let's work together.

934
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,690
What do you mean?
We got eliminated, Suk Jin.

935
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,360
We were the weakest.

936
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,770
- The location of our headquarters.
- That's true.

937
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,840
Gosh, I'm so upset. He runs so fast.

938
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,130
I bet he thinks
that he's really cool.

939
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,170
(He runs so fast. I bet he thinks
that he's really cool.)

940
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,640
(I'm so cool.)

941
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,940
(SAN never smiles
as if he were a secret spy.)

942
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,750
- I'm out.
- Are you okay?

943
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,990
(He's proud of himself
after eliminating another person.)

944
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,760
He looked as if he was fighting
on a battlefield.

945
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,450
Look at his face.
He looks so serious.

946
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,760
He looked as if he thought
this was a real war.

947
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,350
- SAN.
- Yes?

948
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,150
You think that you're really cool,
don't you?

949
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,620
I think so.

950
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,620
(I think so.)

951
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,860
- I feel that way sometimes too.
- I know you do.

952
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:28,610
Sometimes you find yourself so cool
while holding a toy water gun.

953
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,670
- True. I do feel that way.
- I know, right?

954
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,900
Once you feel that way
about yourself, it lasts long.

955
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,980
(The secret spy's movements
became more skillful.)

956
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,650
SAN, you're merciless.

957
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,690
Gosh, he's back.

958
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,690
(Swoosh)

959
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,580
Hey, look how SAN is biting
a bullet.

960
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,980
My goodness. What's that?

961
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,150
I've never seen
anything like that before.

962
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,520
- Is that really necessary?
- I mean...

963
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,360
Why is he biting that bullet?

964
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,560
- Why?
- What is he doing?

965
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,230
- What's with him?
- My gosh. What is he doing?

966
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,960
(When Arin who's on his team
is being attacked,)

967
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,330
(he appears
like the male lead of a movie.)

968
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,980
Oh, my goodness. Did you see
how he just protected Arin?

969
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,540
What a hero.

970
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,750
I wish I could... Why didn't I think
of biting a bullet?

971
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,790
(While everyone is enjoying
watching SAN's actions...)

972
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,080
Hey, go to the headquarters!

973
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,130
(The fitness lover is running
toward Team White's headquarters.)

974
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,960
Go and protect our headquarters.

975
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:28,830
To the headquarters!

976
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,270
(The weak ones went after him
too late.)

977
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,540
Go!

978
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,630
No!

979
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,630
(No!)

980
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,830
Wait. Where is the balloon?

981
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,110
Darn it.

982
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,310
Where is it?

983
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,670
No!

984
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,920
(No!)

985
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,440
No!

986
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,580
(Team White's headquarters cleared)

987
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,750
Gosh. No.

988
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,690
Our headquarters have been attacked.

989
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,690
That's it. The game is over.

990
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,330
Why?

991
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,900
Good job.

992
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,170
(The game is over.)

993
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,940
What's important is...

994
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,230
that we must find Nostra and Damus.

995
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Who did the worst in the game?

996
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,000
- I think one of them is on my team.
- They probably lost on purpose.

997
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,610
Right. Haha. Oh, gosh.

998
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,610
- Me?
- One of them must be on my team.

999
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,170
Jae Suk, I did my best.

1000
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,150
(Who could be Nostra and Damus?)

1001
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,980
I didn't find many pouches.

1002
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,360
Me neither. I should've found
more pouches.

1003
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,980
By the way, Team Red's headquarters
were located in the worst place.

1004
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,560
- It was the worst place.
- True.

1005
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,150
It's true that you were unlucky
with the location. But also...

1006
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,770
Haha's actions made no sense at all.

1007
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,420
- They made no sense.
- What do you mean?

1008
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,540
I was demolishing
their headquarters.

1009
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,770
It was wrong of you.

1010
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,210
You can't leave
your headquarters unguarded.

1011
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,230
- But they...
- That's enough.

1012
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:46,150
Those who didn't try hard
must be the prophets.

1013
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,110
Haha let me aim at his back.

1014
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,270
- Me?
- I get it now.

1015
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,580
- Haha and Suk Jin both.
- I agree.

1016
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,750
Me?

1017
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,020
- No, Suk Jin.
- You mean me?

1018
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,190
- It's not me.
- But I did my best.

1019
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,250
That's just the vibe I got.

1020
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,190
- But Se Chan...
- Did I not try hard enough?

1021
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,580
- No.
- Se Chan acted weirdly too.

1022
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,250
- Se Chan too...
- But I moved around like crazy.

1023
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,270
You saying that
makes me doubt you more.

1024
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,790
He let me aim at his back for free.

1025
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,830
He only moved around like crazy...

1026
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,000
because he didn't mind
his balloons getting popped.

1027
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,610
You know what I mean, right?

1028
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,810
- So on purpose...
- He put himself in danger.

1029
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,710
There's no point
in arguing with him.

1030
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,310
The team who survived longer...

1031
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,520
will receive 50 dollars each.

1032
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,250
And the winning team
will get 100 dollars each.

1033
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,190
In teams, you will announce
how much you have.

1034
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,480
We have 14.

1035
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,650
- That's the same for you all.
- That's 140 dollars.

1036
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,190
- And the red team?
- We have seven.

1037
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,400
Can you let us have ten?

1038
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,920
- Seven...
- We were at a disadvantage.

1039
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,900
We collected 13...

1040
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,730
- and received ten.
- How much is that in total?

1041
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,540
- In total, we have 23.
- Right, 23.

1042
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,500
- No way.
- That's a huge imbalance.

1043
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,040
- We should do better this time.
- Sure.

1044
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,000
Nostra and Damus...

1045
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,400
predicted how
the first game would go.

1046
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,080
If their predictions were correct,

1047
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,810
Nostra and Damus would earn...

1048
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,380
a total of 460 dollars each.

1049
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,080
The double of what
the winning team has.

1050
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,420
First, Nostra...

1051
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,630
(Nostra's prediction
is revealed first.)

1052
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,330
Nostra's prediction...

1053
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,650
came true.

1054
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,670
(Nostra's prediction came true.)

1055
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,460
Then,

1056
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,360
it has to be one of them.

1057
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,690
- Nostra is a member of our team.
- The team had to come last.

1058
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,730
That means Nostra is on that team.

1059
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,710
- Nostra is a member of our team.
- It has to be Haha.

1060
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,630
The team had to come last.

1061
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,540
- Nostra is a member of our team.
- No way.

1062
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,080
It really isn't me.
I bet my life on it.

1063
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,900
- It's one of them.
- One of them is Nostra.

1064
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,350
- My gosh.
- I get it now.

1065
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,610
- No wonder we lost.
- Exactly.

1066
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,380
Meanwhile, Damus...

1067
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,020
This is unbelievable.

1068
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,420
(Nostra's prediction came true.
So what about Damus'?)

1069
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,960
There are two prophets.

1070
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,250
Meanwhile, Damus...

1071
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,360
(Damus' prediction...)

1072
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,670
- Damus' prediction didn't come true.
- I knew it.

1073
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,690
(Damus' prediction
didn't come true!)

1074
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,900
- There's one on each team.
- Yes, one on each team.

1075
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,040
- Se Chan and...
- There's one on each team.

1076
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,230
It has to be Se Chan and HaHa.

1077
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,940
- Unbelievable.
- Why do you think it's me though?

1078
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,210
You left the headquarters
to attack others.

1079
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,480
But I did that to win.

1080
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,810
- Hey.
- Look. SAN, don't.

1081
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,610
Just leave him be.
It's over for him.

1082
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,850
"It's over for him."
That's hilarious.

1083
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,710
What do you mean it's over?
Are you kidding me?

1084
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,860
- It's okay.
- Jong Kook knows it's you.

1085
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,580
- He says it's me and you.
- I know who it is.

1086
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,630
- Just know that it's him.
- Got it.

1087
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,880
(Detective Kim won't even
let him explain himself.)

1088
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,920
Since Damus' prediction
didn't come true,

1089
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,730
the citizens will
choose four people...

1090
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,290
(The citizens can choose 4 people
to be on the Judgment Stand.)

1091
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:27,230
to be on the Judgment Stand.

1092
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,310
I will tell you
if Damus is among them.

1093
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,310
Haha should be one of them.

1094
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,940
He's Nostra, so not him.

1095
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,610
His prediction came true, remember?

1096
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,770
You've got to be kidding me.

1097
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:40,020
I tried my best, you know.

1098
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,710
- Did you hear him?
- Four is a big number.

1099
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,710
He can't even speak properly.

1100
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,960
What do you mean?
I'm saying it's not me.

1101
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,130
- How is it not you?
- Ji Hee...

1102
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,230
What else can I say
when it's not me?

1103
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,170
(Only those who have been suspected
by Jong Kook before understand.)

1104
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,500
I did my best.

1105
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,270
You said that twice already.

1106
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,310
(You said "I did my best" twice!)

1107
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,960
I did my best!

1108
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,330
I know how it feels
to be suspected by him.

1109
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,080
I...

1110
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,540
was the first one
to guard our headquarters.

1111
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,190
I'm sorry that you're here
working this job...

1112
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,710
when you should clearly
be at a funeral.

1113
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,750
Are you a frozen corpse then?

1114
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,250
- We...
- Should I stick a talisman on you?

1115
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,920
- Even though he's grieving...
- Unbelievable.

1116
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,830
I'm grateful that
he made the time to be here.

1117
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,920
- I didn't get any sleep.
- Exactly.

1118
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,790
Shouldn't it be one of the four?

1119
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,190
- Isn't it Arin?
- Exactly.

1120
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,770
- I think it's her.
- I don't think so.

1121
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,630
She did try her best.

1122
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,500
Besides, she tried
not to get eliminated.

1123
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,130
It's proof that...

1124
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,080
- she wanted to win.
- Of course.

1125
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,750
- She didn't make herself a target.
- Who made you a detective?

1126
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,650
Just choose the four
you suspect the most then.

1127
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,080
(Just choose the four
you suspect the most then.)

1128
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,770
- Why bother...
- The prosecutor...

1129
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,150
Is this the Kim Jong Kook Game?

1130
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,790
SAN also tried his best.
Look at him sweating.

1131
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,860
So it can't be him.

1132
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,060
- And Arin tried to stay safe.
- SAN...

1133
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,230
was absorbed in how good he looked.

1134
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,750
In other words,
he fell in love with himself.

1135
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,400
- So on our team...
- He was loving how he looked.

1136
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,540
From our team, I suspect Ji Hee.

1137
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,600
It's not me.

1138
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,560
- It can be her.
- Why are you...

1139
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,710
- suspecting me?
- Be honest with me.

1140
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,310
- Ji Hee.
- You should always remember...

1141
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,770
- that you can be suspected.
- Earlier,

1142
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,710
you said you'd guard
the headquarters.

1143
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,500
- You weren't there though.
- What?

1144
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,810
- Haha said he'd take over!
- Hold on a second.

1145
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,480
We can check the recording.

1146
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:20,920
You said you'd guard
the headquarters,

1147
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,350
so I went to attack.

1148
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,560
(Haha's claim)

1149
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,860
(He only ran out because Ji Hee said
she'd guard the headquarters.)

1150
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,190
(Ji Hee volunteered to guard
the headquarters like Haha.)

1151
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,560
I attacked the other team...

1152
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,130
and you followed, right?

1153
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,020
I'm being framed, you know.

1154
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,330
From what I can tell,

1155
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,290
Ji Hee also tried hard
not to be a target.

1156
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,960
Se Chan's awfully quiet
which can only mean...

1157
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,710
- that he's guilty of something.
- No way.

1158
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,210
- I'm sure of it.
- It really isn't me.

1159
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,810
Let's have him on the stand.

1160
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,110
It can also be you, you know.

1161
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,000
- And discuss this with the guests.
- How about this then?

1162
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,610
Since we're sure
that Haha is Nostra,

1163
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,810
let's put him on the stand
to increase our chances.

1164
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,690
- Haha and Se Chan.
- Me too?

1165
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:54,940
Yes, go ahead.

1166
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,860
- Seok Sam too.
- Also...

1167
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,980
- Ji Hee too.
- Come on.

1168
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,730
- Why me?
- But it isn't me.

1169
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,250
Who's to say you're not Damus?

1170
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,750
- Ji Hee... Wait a second.
- Okay, Ji Hee too.

1171
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,520
- Ji Hee too.
- No, that's not the way to go.

1172
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,920
- I'll go up there.
- Isn't it you?

1173
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,000
- I'll go up there.
- No, that's not necessary.

1174
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,190
Only that way
will we increase our chances!

1175
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,810
(Only that way
will we increase our chances!)

1176
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,000
Please don't argue.

1177
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,270
Me going up there...

1178
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,770
is how we increase our chances.

1179
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,540
But you're one of my suspects.

1180
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,810
- Me?
- Of course.

1181
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,480
- Me?
- You never know.

1182
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,670
No, don't go up there.

1183
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,770
- Just don't.
- Not you.

1184
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,080
- How can you go up there?
- You can't.

1185
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,190
- But I must go up there to...
- No, don't.

1186
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,750
Don't overpower us
with your strength!

1187
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,710
- Just don't.
- You're being coercive.

1188
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,290
But that's the way.

1189
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,230
- There's no need.
- Me going up there...

1190
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,920
is how we increase our chances.

1191
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,460
Why are you naming suspects
right from the beginning?

1192
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,690
It's only making me suspect you too.

1193
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,290
- But me going up there...
- Can he do this?

1194
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,020
You're only pushing this...

1195
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,900
to cover up your crimes.

1196
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,000
- Mister.
- You're not making any sense.

1197
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,060
- Hey, mister.
- What?

1198
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,270
In front of us...

1199
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,500
- That hurts.
- Hey, mister.

1200
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,770
- Okay, fine. Then...
- Can you...

1201
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,980
move your tractor?

1202
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,500
Then let's put SAN on the stand.

1203
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,270
- No, not SAN.
- Not him.

1204
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,540
It won't mean a thing.

1205
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,020
- But SAN isn't Damus.
- Just hear me out.

1206
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,710
Who we know isn't Damus
should be on the stand...

1207
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,080
so that when one of them
is revealed as Damus,

1208
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,580
- we'll know by deduction.
- Then let me go up there.

1209
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,880
You're a suspect yourself, you know.

1210
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,020
I'll go up there, since it isn't me.

1211
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,230
You're a suspect yourself.

1212
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,330
- Se Chan will go up there.
- It isn't me, but still.

1213
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,790
- And SAN.
- This is unbelievable.

1214
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:14,060
This will only increase our chances.

1215
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,520
And you as well.

1216
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,690
- Why bother...
- I shouldn't go up there.

1217
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,540
- We need one more.
- Jong Kook.

1218
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,900
Can you please
make this a group decision?

1219
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,540
Can't you see
we're deciding as a team?

1220
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,670
I call this the Kim Jong Kook Game.

1221
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:26,850
Just do what you want then.

1222
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:28,770
- Are you kidding me.
- If you think about it...

1223
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,270
- What about our opinion?
- This sure is fun!

1224
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:32,980
What will it be?
Will you do whatever you want?

1225
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,420
Should I step aside?

1226
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,520
No, that's not what I meant.

1227
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,710
You can choose these four
if you agree with him.

1228
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:38,880
- Sure.
- Let it be these four.

1229
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,060
- Suk Jin, come on.
- Me?

1230
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:41,420
Why should I be on the stand?

1231
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,360
Mister, you're also a prime suspect.

1232
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,020
- But...
- After how hard I tried?

1233
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,060
- I suspect you as well.
- What?

1234
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,500
(Could it be any more tiring?)

1235
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,630
Guys!

1236
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,360
(Ji Hee watches them.)

1237
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,940
I can tell it's Haha for sure now.

1238
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,040
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook
is certain that Haha is Nostra.)

1239
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,940
- But I tried my best.
- I can tell for sure.

1240
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,400
- It has to be one of them.
- Unbelievable.

1241
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,310
I will be shocked
if Damus isn't one of them.

1242
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,040
- Yes, that would be shocking.
- That could be the case.

1243
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,190
Listen up.

1244
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,710
Out of the four
on the Judgment Stand...

1245
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,460
(Suk Jin and Se Chan
are being suspected as Damus.)

1246
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,730
Damus...

1247
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,020
It's not one of us.

1248
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,290
(SAN was put up there
to increase the odds.)

1249
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,460
Damus...

1250
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:19,900
It's not one of us.

1251
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,700
(Is Damus among these 4?)

1252
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:28,410
- He is among you.
- See what I mean?

1253
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,700
(One of them is Damus.)

1254
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,370
- We've got this.
- I was sure of it.

1255
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,640
- Hold on a second.
- Jong Kook.

1256
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,350
- SAN, step out of the way.
- Jong Kook...

1257
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:37,020
Haha isn't Damus either.

1258
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,080
- It's not me.
- But...

1259
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,560
It's not me either!

1260
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,390
It really isn't me this time around.

1261
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:43,520
Look at him. Isn't he acting weird?

1262
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,580
- I mean it.
- Damus!

1263
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,930
- Suk Jin's acting strange.
- It really isn't me.

1264
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:47,390
- Shut It Damus.
- Unbelievable.

1265
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,390
I'm sure of it.

1266
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:52,830
(Suspects for Nostra:
Haha, Jae Suk, Ji Hee)

1267
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:55,430
(Suspects for Damus,
Suk Jin, Se Chan, Haha, SAN)

1268
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,830
- No way.
- It isn't me.

1269
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:59,080
I know that it's not Suk Jin...

1270
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,040
because I tried to smell
the cologne off him.

1271
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,200
The scent was sour though.

1272
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,850
He doesn't have cologne on.
I smelled something sour.

1273
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:06,020
You...

1274
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,580
- You...
- You're right.

1275
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,620
- He smells sour.
- That's the scent...

1276
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,040
- from my vintage clothes.
- There's that sour smell again.

1277
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,680
- A sour smell?
- Mr. Sour.

1278
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,220
- Mr. Sour is hilarious.
- That's your new nickname.

1279
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:17,790
You'll now head
to the next location.

1280
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,290
(With the pool of suspects,
they head to the next location.)

1281
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:20,390
Off we go!

1282
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:22,770
(They board the bus to move out.)

1283
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:24,520
- Are you sure?
- Look at you two conversing.

1284
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:25,890
- I...
- Is there a connection here?

1285
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,830
What could you be talking about?

1286
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,200
We're supposed to sit
with our teammates.

1287
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,240
(While chatting,
they take their seats.)

1288
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:33,740
(They're sitting together.)

1289
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:38,810
Ji Hyo, the hair looks good on you
the more I see it.

1290
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,890
Of course, it does. The pretty ones
look good with anything.

1291
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:44,390
- They look good with anything.
- Yes, they do.

1292
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:46,020
Why do you keep making hearts?

1293
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,850
Why are you two sitting together?

1294
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:50,080
- Because we're a team.
- We're on the same team.

1295
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,600
I'm not kidding when I say this.

1296
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,970
- I'm actually very serious.
- About what?

1297
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,120
- Okay. Tell us.
- What is it?

1298
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,970
I don't approve
of colleagues dating.

1299
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,010
What about you?
You married Na Kyung Eun.

1300
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,560
That's right. He did.

1301
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,930
- Hey!
- How could he say that about her?

1302
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,140
- How could he say that about her?
- That's right.

1303
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,740
How dare you shake up
my family that's doing well?

1304
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,270
- How dare you shake up my family?
- I'm really sorry.

1305
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,790
- He dated someone at the workplace.
- I'm sorry.

1306
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:17,410
- All right.
- Let's get going.

1307
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:18,580
- Ji Hee.
- Yes?

1308
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,760
How many siblings do you have?

1309
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,560
- I'm an only child.
- Oh, you are?

1310
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,580
- I guessed correctly.
- It's nice to be an only child.

1311
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,580
How did you know?

1312
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,060
- I had a feeling.
- You speak like you did as a child.

1313
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,760
- Oh, really?
- She still has it.

1314
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,930
Your blood type is O, right?

1315
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,370
- No, it's AB.
- Okay. It's AB, right?

1316
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,660
Your blood type is AB? That's nice.

1317
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,660
Your blood type is AB too?

1318
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,470
Arin, your blood type is B, right?

1319
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:36,200
- No, it's O.
- I see.

1320
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,160
- SAN, yours is B, right?
- His is A.

1321
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,930
- Mine is B.
- All right.

1322
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,600
- Mine is B too.
- Me too.

1323
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,640
Your MBTI is ENFP, right?

1324
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,640
No, it's INFP.

1325
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,770
Oh, yours starts with an I?

1326
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,910
- Mine is ENFP.
- Is it?

1327
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:50,990
What does it mean?
What's an I and an E?

1328
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:52,220
- I is introverted,
- Introverts...

1329
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,490
- and E is extroverted.
- and extroverts.

1330
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:55,560
Oh, is that so? I is for introverts?

1331
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,020
- Yes.
- What's yours, Ji Hee?

1332
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,450
- Guess what mine is.
- Ji Hee is...

1333
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,350
- Hers is I.
- That's right.

1334
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,660
- Hers starts with an I.
- Ji Hee's starts with an I.

1335
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:02,660
Mine starts an I.

1336
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,100
What's the difference
between an I and an E?

1337
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,100
I is...

1338
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,870
- What's the difference?
- I just asked that.

1339
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:09,060
- What does an I stand for?
- Introverts.

1340
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,600
- What about an E?
- Extroverts.

1341
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,180
- What about an I?
- Introverts!

1342
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,040
(Introverts!)

1343
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,580
Why did you all snap at him?

1344
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,120
How many times
do we have to tell him?

1345
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,890
- You didn't test yours, right?
- No.

1346
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,410
I don't think so. Did I?

1347
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,850
I did mine too,
but I can't remember it.

1348
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,890
- Jong Kook, yours is INFJ.
- Maybe mine is the same as yours.

1349
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,020
- What?
- Yours is INFJ.

1350
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,160
Ji Hyo remembers it.

1351
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,930
It's because mine is the same
as yours.

1352
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:34,660
No, Jong Kook's starts with a D.

1353
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,470
- What does it stand for?
- Protein man.

1354
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:37,660
(Protein man)

1355
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,270
No, it starts with an F.

1356
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:40,970
- Protein man.
- Protein man.

1357
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:42,410
- Protein man.
- That starts with a P.

1358
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,770
- Doesn't it start with a P?
- It's not an F.

1359
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:47,930
(He was too confident when he said
protein starts with an F.)

1360
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:49,200
- Protein man.
- That starts with a P.

1361
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,950
(Doesn't protein start with a P?)

1362
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,680
My gosh.

1363
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,470
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey.

1364
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,950
- Are you serious?
- Then is it "frotein"?

1365
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:58,580
My gosh.

1366
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,080
How can you be so ignorant?

1367
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,760
Protein starts with a P.

1368
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,760
How could you say it starts...

1369
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,560
- with an F?
- Doesn't protein start with a P?

1370
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,930
Don't Koreans start it with an F?

1371
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,560
Here he goes again.
Hey, Michael Jackson.

1372
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,270
- Hey, Jackson.
- It starts with a P.

1373
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,930
- P?
- Aren't you hungry, Michael?

1374
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:14,930
I'm hungry.

1375
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,740
- You're hungry?
- Okay.

1376
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,870
What is this again?

1377
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:21,100
Oh, no. We'll have to
use our bodies.

1378
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,580
- We'll have to use our bodies.
- Oh, no.

1379
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,310
We'll now select your teams
for your next mission.

1380
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:27,310
Okay.

1381
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:31,540
The first team
is Se Chan, SAN, and So Min.

1382
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:34,760
The second team is Haha,
Suk Jin, Ji Hyo, and Arin.

1383
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,430
The third team
is Jong Kook, Jae Suk, and Ji Hee.

1384
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,450
(Team Green: Se Chan, So Min, SAN)

1385
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:40,850
(Team Blue: Suk Jin, Ji Hyo,
Haha, Arin)

1386
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,270
(Team Yellow: Jae Suk,
Jong Kook, Ji Hee)

1387
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,160
Before the final mission,

1388
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,890
you'll play a pre-mission
to acquire additional ballots.

1389
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,270
- What is it?
- It's recommended by Haha.

1390
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:51,200
It's called Balloon World Cup.

1391
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,830
This one is really fun.

1392
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:53,910
Haha recommended it,

1393
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:54,970
- saying it's really fun.
- It's really fun.

1394
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:55,970
How do you play it?

1395
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:57,640
- What's this game?
- You'll see.

1396
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,640
(Actual message exchange with Haha)

1397
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,640
It's fun.

1398
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,580
(They don't even play this
on "How Do You Play?".)

1399
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,410
Two players from each team
will play against the other team.

1400
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:08,290
You'll hold each other's hands
as you play the game.

1401
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,660
Within the given three minutes,

1402
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,160
each team will take turns
to hit the balloon...

1403
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,120
and keep it afloat.

1404
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,830
And you'll take turns
to hit the balloon.

1405
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,270
The team
that drops the balloon loses.

1406
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:25,540
You can't hit the balloon
toward the ground.

1407
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,310
- You must...
- Hit it upward.

1408
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,310
You must hit it
so that it stays afloat.

1409
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:31,180
- I can lightly tap it, right?
- Yes, you can do that.

1410
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:34,580
You can make it difficult
for the other team to hit it.

1411
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,640
This is a pre-mission...

1412
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,450
that has additional ballots
at stake,

1413
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,120
so it's better for Nostra and Damus
to win as well.

1414
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,430
- Is that so?
- Is that so?

1415
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:46,100
- Let's go. Let's play this!
- Let's win!

1416
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,020
- Please decide who will go first.
- Okay.

1417
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,160
- Jong Kook, why don't you...
- Yes?

1418
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,890
You should play with Ji Hee.

1419
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:53,270
- Shall we?
- I'll do my best.

1420
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,370
Let's do it.

1421
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:56,930
We must win our first round,
so shall I play with SAN?

1422
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:58,160
Wouldn't that be better?

1423
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,680
Do you want to play with SAN?

1424
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,680
(Staring)

1425
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,850
Do you want to play with SAN?

1426
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,270
What? I'll let you play with SAN.

1427
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:06,680
Se Chan keeps telling me...

1428
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,490
to play with SAN
when he doesn't even mean it.

1429
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:10,390
- Stop it.
- Why are you doing this?

1430
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,790
You can play with SAN.

1431
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:13,080
Why don't you
play rock-paper-scissors?

1432
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,220
(Why don't you
play rock-paper-scissors?)

1433
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,990
All right.
Team Yellow will go first.

1434
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,890
Okay. Ji Hee
and Jong Kook, go ahead.

1435
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,560
I'll play with Suk Jin.

1436
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,520
All right. The rest of you,

1437
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,970
- please step out of the ring.
- You must win this time.

1438
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:25,870
If the balloon goes that way,
you should hit it.

1439
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:27,560
I think it'll be over soon.

1440
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,410
- You won't play dirty, will you?
- Of course not.

1441
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,560
Because that team...

1442
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,540
Right. Jong Kook
can even carry Ji Hee and play it.

1443
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,580
Oh, my.

1444
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,600
All right.

1445
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,180
- All right.
- They look relaxed.

1446
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,740
- What was that?
- Ji Hee, you shouldn't touch it.

1447
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,040
(They touched the balloon twice.)

1448
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,390
- What was that?
- Ji Hee, you shouldn't touch it.

1449
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:43,910
- Ji Hee touched it again.
- We came this way.

1450
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:44,990
They touched it twice.

1451
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,850
- Come on, Jong Kook.
- Were you startled?

1452
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,220
- We won.
- She touched it.

1453
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,490
- We won, right?
- It's okay!

1454
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:51,850
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

1455
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:54,060
It's okay. Let's play.

1456
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:56,930
It falls faster than you think.

1457
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:59,390
- That's it.
- Hit it!

1458
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,270
(Falling)

1459
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,270
(The old man jumped a bit too late.)

1460
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,430
All right.

1461
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,140
Didn't he hit it to the ground?

1462
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,680
No, I hit it sideways.

1463
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,540
- He hit it horizontally.
- Oh, horizontally?

1464
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,310
He listens to the PD well.

1465
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:14,310
(He listens to the PD well.)

1466
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:17,950
- He could've complained more.
- That's right.

1467
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,580
- It's okay.
- But he went,

1468
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,910
"Oh, horizontally?"

1469
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,180
He's amazing.

1470
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,160
(In the meantime, the game resumes.)

1471
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:26,560
That's so sly of you.

1472
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,290
- That's so sly of you.
- Come on.

1473
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:30,060
- That was great.
- Good save.

1474
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,390
- He saved it.
- Run!

1475
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,910
(He loses his temper
when he's blocked by Jong Kook.)

1476
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:37,770
What was that?

1477
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:39,310
- Hey!
- "Move."

1478
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,970
- What was that?
- Move when I hit you.

1479
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:42,410
I was just standing still.

1480
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:43,680
- Jong Kook...
- You should've moved.

1481
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,770
- I even got hit.
- You should've let him hit it.

1482
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,310
- Ji Hee.
- Okay, we lost.

1483
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:49,580
- We lost.
- Why aren't you playing?

1484
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,790
- I've been working really hard.
- She will hit it.

1485
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:53,490
"Why aren't you playing?"

1486
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:54,680
I was really quick.

1487
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,160
- Were you?
- Yes.

1488
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,350
- Why don't you start the game?
- Shall I?

1489
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,430
Hit it.

1490
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:02,270
That's not Geum Bo Ra, is it?

1491
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,560
Is that Geum Bo Ra?

1492
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,540
(No wonder
her hairstyle looked familiar.)

1493
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,540
- She does look like her.
- I see it.

1494
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,740
- I see it.
- I see it.

1495
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,140
- I see Geum Bo Ra in her.
- I see it.

1496
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,580
- No.
- Just a bit.

1497
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,080
- I'm Song Ji Hyo.
- Here we go.

1498
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,470
(Team Yellow 2, Team Blue 1)

1499
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,370
- There you go.
- That's it.

1500
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:20,370
I'll hit it.

1501
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:24,540
Hey. He hit it toward the ground.

1502
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,020
(Throwing)

1503
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,290
(He hit it toward the ground.)

1504
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,580
- He hit it toward the ground.
- Did I?

1505
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,680
- I guess my hand slipped.
- He hit it toward the ground.

1506
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,760
I couldn't see.

1507
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,350
- Hit it upward.
- Got it.

1508
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,450
- Upward.
- I'll throw it.

1509
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,160
Okay. Are you throwing it
to the back?

1510
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,200
- Got it.
- There you go.

1511
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:39,600
It's okay. I got it.

1512
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:41,390
- That's it.
- That was so cool.

1513
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:42,740
That was so cool.

1514
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:45,510
- That was so cool.
- Suk Jin!

1515
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:47,010
Move!

1516
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,180
(Mr. Move appears again.)

1517
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,270
- He pushed Ji Hee.
- "Move."

1518
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,310
"Move."

1519
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:54,470
(Mr. Move was blinded by winning.)

1520
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,640
(They ended up colliding
with each other.)

1521
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,680
Hold on. Are you okay?

1522
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,180
- How could you push her?
- Why did you push her?

1523
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,390
- What was that?
- How could you push Ji Hee?

1524
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,490
You threw her.

1525
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:04,760
How could you do that to her?

1526
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,790
- I'm sorry.
- What was that?

1527
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,450
- How could you push her?
- I was only playing hard.

1528
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,870
- Are you okay?
- I didn't mean it.

1529
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:10,370
- Suk Jin is ruthless.
- I'm okay.

1530
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:11,370
- I'm okay.
- Are you?

1531
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:12,370
- I'm okay.
- I'm sorry.

1532
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:13,560
I was playing too hard.

1533
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,770
You should take it easy.

1534
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:16,140
How could you push her like that?

1535
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,770
I can't take it easy.
I should work hard.

1536
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:19,080
I know that you should, but...

1537
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,680
He threw her to the ground.

1538
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,080
- Do you want a beating?
- What?

1539
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,970
Do you want a beating?

1540
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:25,850
- Do you want a piece of me?
- He's scary.

1541
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:28,270
Gosh, what a Bbangkku Ttongkku.

1542
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,850
Suk Jin's team is leading.

1543
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:30,990
- We're winning?
- They're winning?

1544
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:33,160
- Jong Kook, we can't lose.
- Aren't we winning?

1545
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,680
Mister, you're too much.

1546
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,160
- Let's play.
- I'm sorry.

1547
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:38,350
Okay. Let's play.
I should hit it upward, right?

1548
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,830
I should hit it upward, right?

1549
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,470
There. I hit it.

1550
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,470
(Surprisingly, he actually hit it.)

1551
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,890
I hit it.

1552
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:49,830
- We won!
- Play it like a big guy.

1553
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:51,640
- I hit it.
- That was so sneaky of you.

1554
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,270
- Yes!
- I hit it.

1555
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:54,930
- He's so sneaky.
- I hit it.

1556
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:55,970
That's so sly of him.

1557
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,470
- You have 20 seconds.
- Okay.

1558
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:58,910
Let's play.

1559
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:03,390
Suk Jin is good at this.

1560
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,890
He's pretty good.

1561
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:06,120
(Suk Jin finally found a game
he's good at.)

1562
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,330
- Good.
- There you go.

1563
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,950
- Nice one.
- Hit it!

1564
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:12,200
Hit it!

1565
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:14,950
- Nice one.
- Hit it!

1566
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:16,160
- Hit it!
- That was a good one.

1567
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:21,370
(Ji Hyo scores with the last touch.)

1568
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:24,970
It's okay.

1569
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,540
Game over.

1570
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,930
- Is it over?
- Yes, it's over.

1571
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,740
- It's over?
- He's really good.

1572
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,410
Good job.

1573
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,950
You're really good.

1574
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:34,870
- That was close.
- We're pretty good.

1575
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,080
Round 1 is over.
Let's move on to Round 2.

1576
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,180
- Are you right-handed?
- It's SAN and So Min.

1577
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,160
Who is Jae Suk playing with?

1578
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:43,290
I'll play with Jong Kook.

1579
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:44,660
All right!

1580
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,260
- That's too harsh.
- Let's crush them!

1581
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,450
- Let's go.
- Good luck!

1582
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,770
- That's too harsh.
- Let's finish them.

1583
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:52,100
- Let's destroy them!
- Okay!

1584
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,790
Hold on. I think you should
give SAN some bullets to bite.

1585
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,560
He should get some bullets.

1586
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,040
- Okay?
- I think we have a chance.

1587
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,140
(SAN became the star
of a thriller again.)

1588
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,640
- All right. Let's go.
- I'll start.

1589
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,640
Take it easy.

1590
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,470
All right.

1591
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,740
All right.

1592
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,140
That was good.

1593
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:10,740
- You're relaxed.
- We got this.

1594
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,020
There you go.

1595
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,060
(Sliding)

1596
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,560
There you go.

1597
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,790
(A cool guy who doesn't back down
by a sneaky attack)

1598
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,760
(It's time for the cool guy
of the old days to receive it.)

1599
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,770
- Take it easy.
- Are you okay?

1600
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:24,370
- All right!
- Yes!

1601
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:26,770
- Okay. That was great.
- Okay!

1602
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,470
They're so sneaky.

1603
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:29,740
All right. Here we go.

1604
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,930
- All right.
- All right. Here we go.

1605
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:33,970
They're so sneaky.

1606
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,330
Wait for it.

1607
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,010
- They're both good.
- Take it easy.

1608
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,350
- Take it easy.
- Wait until it falls. No.

1609
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:39,680
- Take it easy.
- Hit it when it falls.

1610
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,770
Like him. Hit it when it falls.

1611
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,450
- Hit it when it falls. Wait for it.
- Here we go.

1612
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,520
No, hit it lightly when it falls.

1613
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,350
Gosh, seriously.

1614
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:49,930
(Tap)

1615
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,930
- Gosh, seriously.
- That was...

1616
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:54,330
Play it like a big guy.

1617
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:56,120
(They're okay with anything
as long as they win.)

1618
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,620
That was...

1619
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,560
- All right! That was great.
- All right!

1620
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,160
- SAN.
- You're so sneaky!

1621
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,430
- Okay!
- Okay!

1622
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:03,910
You're so cool!

1623
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:05,600
- Let's play.
- What's so cool about them?

1624
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,240
- This is wrong.
- Seriously.

1625
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,240
That's not cool.

1626
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,970
Those who play dirty
have an advantage.

1627
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,640
It's a battle to see
who plays dirtier.

1628
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:13,270
Here we go.

1629
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,490
They can't even use a VAR.

1630
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:18,740
Isn't that too low?
You can't sit from the beginning.

1631
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:21,260
- Wait for it.
- Yes, we should hit it!

1632
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,990
Wait for it.

1633
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,890
- Go for it. Get your hand ready.
- Touch it.

1634
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:25,890
(Team Green attacks boldly
when the other team is being sly.)

1635
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:27,060
- He saved it.
- So Min, get ready.

1636
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,160
So Min, get your hand ready.

1637
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:31,100
So Min, your hand.

1638
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:33,240
That was too high.
Hit it to that side.

1639
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,140
- Go for it!
- We got it.

1640
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,240
- All right! Nice.
- He hit it toward the ground.

1641
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,680
- He hit it toward the ground.
- No, I didn't.

1642
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,080
(VAR verifying)

1643
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,580
- He hit it toward the ground.
- No, I didn't.

1644
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,600
- He didn't hit it to the ground.
- He did.

1645
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,350
- He hit it toward the ground.
- The angle was toward the ground.

1646
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:47,770
- It went below their legs.
- Check the angle.

1647
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,020
They said he hit it downward.

1648
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,810
- He hit it downward.
- Okay.

1649
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:52,020
- It fell to the ground.
- That's right.

1650
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,390
What was that?

1651
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:54,810
- All right.
- That was sly.

1652
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:55,890
All right. Let's play.

1653
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,180
If they play slyly,
put your hand under the balloon.

1654
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,160
- How?
- I was talking to them.

1655
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,200
Not you.

1656
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,060
- Which team is he on?
- You shouldn't give them tips.

1657
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:06,060
Put your hand under the balloon
when they play slyly.

1658
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,640
- Okay.
- Try putting it.

1659
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:08,930
- Here we go.
- I'm sorry,

1660
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:10,240
but you look intimidated.

1661
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,540
Wait for it.

1662
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:15,640
(Hitting both their faces)

1663
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,350
It was a rebound. All right!

1664
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:20,680
- Hey, you shouldn't have.
- How sneaky of you.

1665
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,680
- That was so sneaky.
- Okay!

1666
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:24,450
- All right.
- They're Jiring at you.

1667
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,490
- Come on.
- Come on, seriously.

1668
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,660
- Is it your turn?
- That was so sneaky.

1669
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,890
(Jong Kook finds teasing So Min
most fun.)

1670
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:33,060
You never go easy...

1671
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:35,160
- on So Min.
- I never do.

1672
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,290
Of course not.

1673
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,830
- Let's go!
- Go!

1674
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,790
- Are you that desperate to win?
- That's a good one.

1675
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:43,240
- That's good. It's a no-look...
- What is that?

1676
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,160
- It's a no-look throw.
- Wait a minute.

1677
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,370
A no-look throw. Good one.

1678
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:48,430
Wait for it. There you go.

1679
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,680
- Okay.
- Wait for it.

1680
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,870
(Getting dragged)

1681
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:54,810
(Jong Kook drags his teammate
who is out of it.)

1682
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:56,790
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- Nice!

1683
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:59,520
(The sly players lose a point.)

1684
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,620
You should've followed me!

1685
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,790
Why did you just lie there?

1686
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,350
- You should've followed me!
- Jong Kook.

1687
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,600
- Okay.
- Seriously.

1688
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,990
- I think it's our turn.
- Pull yourself together.

1689
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:10,720
- Follow me!
- Okay. Let's play.

1690
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,970
Let's play. Okay, I'll hit it.

1691
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:13,600
- That's it.
- Can I hit it?

1692
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,970
Go ahead.

1693
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:18,160
(So Min announces her attack
as though she's determined.)

1694
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,080
- What? What is it?
- What?

1695
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,240
- Okay.
- Let's play.

1696
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:24,180
You should receive it well
when it rebounds.

1697
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,580
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

1698
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,370
(The tiger moth
is ready on standby.)

1699
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,120
Oh, gosh.

1700
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:32,660
- Get ready.
- Oh, gosh.

1701
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,350
Hey, that was...

1702
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,620
(The tiger moth succeeds
in getting her revenge.)

1703
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,930
She hit it toward the ground.

1704
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:40,120
- No, she hit it upward.
- No, it went upward.

1705
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,060
- She hit it upward.
- She hit it upward.

1706
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,430
But Jae Suk's protruding mouth
hit it.

1707
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:44,470
She hit it upward.

1708
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:45,770
Are you going to keep this up?

1709
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,870
- Okay, fine.
- She's going to keep this up.

1710
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:49,160
- Okay, fine.
- Okay, fine.

1711
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,060
- So Min, keep playing.
- Fine.

1712
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,140
- Go for it.
- Go, So Min.

1713
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,410
- You should hit it.
- So Min.

1714
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:54,540
SAN.

1715
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,680
- I should stay away from it.
- Keep your face lifted, will you?

1716
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,010
- SAN.
- So that it won't fall.

1717
00:58:58,370 --> 00:58:59,470
I should stay away from it.

1718
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:01,270
I'm sorry.

1719
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:03,120
- No, it's okay.
- Go for it.

1720
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,910
Come closer. You should come closer.

1721
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:08,260
There you go. Come closer.

1722
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:11,890
Hey.

1723
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:12,930
- Okay!
- Okay!

1724
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,950
- Hit it.
- Good!

1725
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,890
- Nice one!
- They let go of their hands.

1726
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:19,470
(Jae Suk let go
of Jong Kook's hand.)

1727
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,660
They let go of their hands.

1728
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:22,870
Jae Suk let go of his hand.

1729
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:25,060
- Team Yellow loses a point.
- Okay!

1730
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:27,080
You should've gotten up
and held my hand.

1731
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,370
You let go of my hand!

1732
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:29,870
Game over.

1733
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,680
- Is it over?
- Oh, gosh.

1734
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,180
- We won.
- I bet we won.

1735
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,270
Let's move on to the last round.

1736
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,720
Wait for it. You got it.

1737
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,020
It's out.

1738
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,490
Wait for it. There you go. Nice!

1739
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:41,890
Team Green takes first place
for winning twice in a row.

1740
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:43,290
- Yes!
- They won?

1741
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:44,760
- We're in the first place?
- Yes.

1742
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,060
We'll give you additional ballots
to the three of you.

1743
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,160
- All right.
- It was fun.

1744
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,620
- But you were really cool.
- I can't believe they won.

1745
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,870
- Good job.
- That was close.

1746
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:53,560
- You were good.
- We beat Jong Kook.

1747
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,770
We beat Jong Kook.

1748
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:58,330
- Jae Suk got hit in the face.
- Good job.

1749
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:00,430
Ms. Geum Bo Ra was really good too.

1750
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,370
Ms. Geum Bo Ra?

1751
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:03,870
- Let me see.
- Okay.

1752
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:05,510
- Hello.
- I see it.

1753
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,970
- I see it.
- She's really beautiful too.

1754
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:10,640
All right. We'll now play
the final mission.

1755
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,790
The final mission is called
Millennium Joys and Sorrows.

1756
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:17,080
A total of 6 players,
2 from each team, will play.

1757
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,890
You'll get on top
of the slippery slope behind you.

1758
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:24,270
Then stick your name tag
on the spot on top of the slope.

1759
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,600
- It's pretty simple.
- We just have to go up.

1760
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,770
The team that sticks
all of their name tags first wins.

1761
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:30,970
The team that comes in second...

1762
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:32,540
will win if they get just one of
their name tags up there.

1763
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,200
All right. Decide who will go first.

1764
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,850
Two for Round One
and two for Round Two.

1765
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:38,640
Jong Kook and Ji Hee will go first,
then Ji Hee and I will go next.

1766
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,770
Okay, let's do that.

1767
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,770
- SAN and I will play.
- And then?

1768
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,680
Then...

1769
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,720
(Studying their faces)

1770
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,390
Then So Min and I will go second.

1771
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:47,520
Why would you play twice?

1772
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,810
Wouldn't it be better
for SAN to play one more time?

1773
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,180
- It's okay.
- What?

1774
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,020
- Should we do that?
- Why would you play twice?

1775
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,350
- Then SAN will go.
- Yes, let SAN play.

1776
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:55,350
- It'd be better for him to go.
- Damus.

1777
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:56,700
- Is it because you're Damus?
- No, I'm not!

1778
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:57,700
You're Damus.

1779
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:58,720
SAN can go twice.

1780
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,490
- That'd be better.
- I'll show you that I'm not Damus.

1781
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,970
- You must win.
- I know.

1782
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:03,660
Suk Jin and I will go.

1783
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:05,560
- Why?
- Why?

1784
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,680
- Why not?
- Are you Nostra?

1785
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,370
- Are you Damus?
- Does he have to win or lose?

1786
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:10,580
- He has to lose.
- He should lose.

1787
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:12,620
- Oh, is that why?
- No, not at all.

1788
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:15,180
He might push me down
when I try to climb up.

1789
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:16,790
I'm really not Nostra or Damus.

1790
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:17,790
- What's wrong with you?
- Of course.

1791
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:20,680
Let's predict the ranking
one last time.

1792
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:22,490
Thank you, Ji Hee.

1793
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:24,490
(Nostra and Damus will predict
each team's ranking.)

1794
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:26,660
Haha, I'll win first place.

1795
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:27,950
- Sorry?
- I'll win first place.

1796
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:30,060
If I think you'll win first place,
I should put down the blindfold...

1797
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,770
- and do this?
- That's right.

1798
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,270
He's given up.

1799
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:35,470
- No, one of them is a prophet.
- We're just joking around.

1800
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:39,740
All right. Nostra and Damus,
put down your blindfold.

1801
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,470
Predict the ranking.

1802
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:46,970
(Nostra and Damus are predicting
the ranking for the last mission.)

1803
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:48,970
(They're done
with their prediction.)

1804
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:51,990
Let's start Round One.

1805
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:53,020
Take off your blindfold.

1806
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:56,680
(Ji Hyo looks at Suk Jin
as though she finds him suspicious.)

1807
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:57,680
What is it?

1808
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,390
I kept hearing you move about
next to me.

1809
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:00,390
- I know.
- I just scratched myself.

1810
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:01,430
I heard someone rustling.

1811
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:02,770
I heard it too.

1812
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:04,490
I scratched myself to be suspected.

1813
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,060
- Right.
- I did it to be suspected.

1814
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:09,330
Anyway, Suk Jin
smelled sour earlier.

1815
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,270
- He's definitely not it.
- I'm really not it either.

1816
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,970
- I scratched to be suspected.
- You are...

1817
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,600
- They wrote our names?
- so weak-hearted.

1818
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,470
I kept hearing sounds from his side.

1819
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:18,010
I know. Something was rustling.

1820
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,470
- I'll do it.
- Isn't it Ji Hee?

1821
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:21,620
Arin.

1822
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:23,350
Arin.

1823
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:26,160
Why does no one suspect Arin?

1824
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:28,450
Because no one can.

1825
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:32,080
Six players for Round One,
please gather here.

1826
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,350
- We won't fall.
- I'm so nervous.

1827
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,200
You can do it!
Se Chan, do you want me to go first?

1828
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,520
- My gosh.
- Let's go!

1829
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,770
Jong Kook, this is slippery.

1830
01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:40,060
Of course, it is.
How are we supposed to go up?

1831
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,870
- It's so scary.
- Ji Hee.

1832
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:43,060
You should just sprint up there.

1833
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,370
- Everyone.
- We can't hold on to these, right?

1834
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:48,430
You can't, but if you find it
too difficult, I'll allow it.

1835
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:50,680
- Do you see towels in the middle?
- How are we supposed to go up?

1836
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,540
You can make use of the towel.

1837
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,080
- Which one?
- Make use of what?

1838
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,890
- The towels.
- Oh, we can wipe as we go up?

1839
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:56,990
You want us to
make use of the towels?

1840
01:02:56,990 --> 01:03:00,760
The team that sticks
two name tags first will win.

1841
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,160
- Ours or other teams'?
- Your own.

1842
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,620
You and I should take
each other's name tags off.

1843
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,850
We're supposed to remove ours
and stick it up there, right?

1844
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:07,720
Ji Hyo, Arin.

1845
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,990
- Get ready.
- Let's do this.

1846
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:10,060
You can do it!

1847
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,120
Get set.

1848
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:12,470
- Okay.
- Go!

1849
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:13,870
- They can't go up.
- We can't go up.

1850
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:15,060
Don't hold on to the rails.

1851
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,640
(Exclaiming)

1852
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:19,740
Gosh, this is... Hold on.

1853
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:21,600
- They can't even stand on it.
- This is...

1854
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,870
This is impossible.

1855
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:24,770
You can't even do a run-up.

1856
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,350
You should run up from there.

1857
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:30,640
(Shouting)

1858
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,910
This game is fair for everyone.

1859
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,490
- It's impossible.
- It's really fair.

1860
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:37,560
This is...

1861
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,990
(Running)

1862
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:43,270
(A gym-goer suddenly
runs on a treadmill.)

1863
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:45,330
- Hold on. We should make a path.
- Hey.

1864
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:48,160
No matter how hard I run,
I can't go up.

1865
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,240
- Shall we go up together?
- Sure.

1866
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,330
Hold on.

1867
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,810
Push her.

1868
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:54,740
- Push her and support her.
- Let's go!

1869
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,180
How are we supposed to go up?

1870
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,740
Let's start from there.

1871
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:01,140
- Let's run from here.
- Let's run up.

1872
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,810
- Over here. Hold on to it.
- One,

1873
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:04,140
- two...
- Ji Hee. There you go.

1874
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,240
- Ji Hee...
- Go!

1875
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,180
- Look at them.
- Let's go!

1876
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,890
- Go!
- It's working.

1877
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:09,990
- It's working.
- He's going up.

1878
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:13,290
This is impossible.

1879
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:14,430
Let's try one more time.

1880
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,970
(Right then, Ji Hee hangs on to
the plastic and climbs up.)

1881
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:20,430
- That's great, Ji Hee!
- She's going up.

1882
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:21,490
She's going up.

1883
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,370
- It's working.
- There you go!

1884
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,640
Good job, Ji Hee! Keep going.

1885
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,010
I can't do it!

1886
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:28,370
(Screaming)

1887
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:29,870
Keep going!

1888
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:32,350
(Collecting Ji Hee)

1889
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:34,020
No. Ji Hee, I got it.

1890
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,370
Come on. We can do it.

1891
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:36,680
It's so slippery.

1892
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,680
(Mr. Gym gives it a try
instead of Ji Hee who failed.)

1893
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:41,450
Ji Hee, let's do this. No.

1894
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:43,620
Hold on to me. Who are you?

1895
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:45,580
Ji Hee.

1896
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:47,350
(Arin is hanging on to
the member of another team.)

1897
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:48,890
You should go up now.

1898
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:51,600
Ji Hee.

1899
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,620
(The game is getting dirty.)

1900
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,160
Ji Hee!

1901
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:55,970
Ji Hee!

1902
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:57,270
(Right then)

1903
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:58,370
Look at SAN.

1904
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,770
(The cool guy SAN
faces the slope head on.)

1905
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:03,370
(Impressed)

1906
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:05,510
- SAN.
- He made it.

1907
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:06,520
He failed.

1908
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,470
SAN is pretty good.

1909
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:10,740
- Ji Hee!
- Hold on.

1910
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,890
- Ji Hee, grab me and get up there.
- Hold on.

1911
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:14,290
- Ji Hee.
- Hurry up!

1912
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:15,890
You should hang on to me.

1913
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:17,720
- I think we can just run up.
- Ji Hee.

1914
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,120
Ji Hee, hold on to him
and climb up the slope.

1915
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,870
- Hold on to me.
- There you go.

1916
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:24,560
- Hold on to me.
- That's it!

1917
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:25,620
- Jong Kook!
- Ji Hee.

1918
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:27,390
Someone is pulling me from behind.

1919
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:29,040
You're almost there, Ji Hee.

1920
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:32,540
(It's a mess.)

1921
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:37,040
It's slippery.

1922
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,100
(He ends up demonstrating
a feat of super strength.)

1923
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,200
What's he doing?

1924
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,180
(He's 1st to reach the base camp.)

1925
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:43,020
Get up here.

1926
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:45,450
Try to get up there.

1927
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:47,310
- What is my team doing?
- My goodness.

1928
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:48,760
- We can never get up there.
- Everyone.

1929
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,290
You're allowed to hold the bar
on each side.

1930
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:51,450
(They're allowed to hold the bar
on each side.)

1931
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:56,930
We're allowed to hold onto this?

1932
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:58,830
SAN. Why do you hold it like that?

1933
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,240
(He didn't get far for showing off.)

1934
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:04,100
We're allowed to hold onto this?

1935
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,640
This?

1936
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:07,510
This? Come on.

1937
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:09,330
This is slippery.

1938
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:10,870
This is worse.

1939
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:15,640
- This isn't working.
- Se Chan.

1940
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:17,240
- I can't go up. What do I do?
- I can't do it.

1941
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:21,490
(He's falling.)

1942
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:22,620
Yes!

1943
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:23,930
(My goodness.)

1944
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:25,560
My goodness.

1945
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:29,060
Yes! Get down even more.

1946
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,330
That was close.

1947
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:36,560
He did it.

1948
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:37,700
(SAN succeeded in
hanging in the middle.)

1949
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:38,870
He got it.

1950
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,080
SAN...

1951
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:44,510
(Jong Kook gets rid of SAN
with a petty gesture.)

1952
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:45,910
Jong Kook!

1953
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,540
(Laughing)

1954
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:48,680
SAN.

1955
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,450
What am I supposed to do?

1956
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,220
This is almost impossible.

1957
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,160
This is getting slipperier.

1958
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:58,790
(Ji Hee goes up slowly.)

1959
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:02,700
- He did it.
- He did it.

1960
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:04,660
- There's nothing to hold.
- Push her.

1961
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,890
- Hold onto her.
- Grab Ji Hee.

1962
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,060
(Everyone from Team Yellow
reaches the 2nd floor.)

1963
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,370
- She got it.
- Come on, Ji Hee.

1964
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:10,700
Good job. That was good.

1965
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:11,870
We got it.

1966
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:14,970
- I should've eaten more.
- I'm stuck here.

1967
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:18,100
- This is so hard.
- They keep going up.

1968
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,680
- Ji Hyo. Come here for a second.
- We have to stop them.

1969
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:21,180
This is funny.

1970
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,890
(Panting)

1971
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,290
- Push SAN.
- Keep going up, SAN.

1972
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:27,720
Please.

1973
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:30,350
- He's strong.
- Right?

1974
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:32,160
- He's young.
- He's jumping around...

1975
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,220
- all day long.
- SAN. Hold onto me.

1976
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:36,520
By the way, why did you...

1977
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,720
only send Arin and Ji Hyo?

1978
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,100
- Why?
- I know.

1979
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,330
One of you should be there.

1980
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:44,240
I know. It should've been one of us.

1981
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:46,410
Please.

1982
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:47,470
Please!

1983
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:51,870
- Arin made it.
- That's crazy.

1984
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:54,020
Arin made it, Jong Kook.

1985
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,990
(Arin and Ji Hyo made it
to the 2nd floor.)

1986
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:00,020
SAN. Come here.

1987
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,680
Gosh.

1988
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,990
(Jong Kook reaches the peak first.)

1989
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:05,490
Jong Kook made it.

1990
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:06,700
Okay!

1991
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:07,790
It's impossible.

1992
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:09,450
Ms. Geum.

1993
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:10,870
Stop Jin Ji Hee.

1994
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:12,660
Ji Hyo.

1995
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:13,890
How will I get up there?

1996
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,890
You're pulling me from both sides.

1997
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,970
- Send her down.
- You're still okay.

1998
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,540
- Rip her name tag.
- Arin.

1999
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:26,140
(Ji Hee's name tag goes down.)

2000
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:27,350
Oh, that's a good idea. Thank you.

2001
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:29,350
- Thank you.
- Do the same on her.

2002
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,810
Send Ji Hee down.

2003
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:36,480
Hey!

2004
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:38,980
Jong Kook.

2005
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:41,100
Yes. You got it.

2006
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,290
Yes. That's what you need to do.

2007
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:44,160
- He made it in the end.
- SAN.

2008
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,730
- What about me?
- He made it.

2009
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:47,270
- SAN.
- He leaps.

2010
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,860
- He leaps so much.
- Like a frog.

2011
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:51,530
Throw it. That's right.

2012
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,640
It's okay. It's your turn to go up.

2013
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,510
Please.

2014
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:59,150
- No. Don't.
- Se Chan. What are you doing?

2015
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,240
Se Chan. What are you doing?

2016
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,820
He's like Captain Um Hong Gil.

2017
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,980
- Captain Um.
- Captain Um.

2018
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:09,220
(He tries to go up while panting.)

2019
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,950
- You must hold onto it.
- Hey.

2020
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:13,820
It's amazing.
Captain Um's partner is SAN.

2021
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,490
SAN. Wait for me.

2022
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:20,030
If you don't make it in a minute,
the rank is determined.

2023
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:21,900
Yes. I dare you to come.

2024
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:25,140
- I'll block them.
- Yes.

2025
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:28,530
The team with more people
in the middle place second.

2026
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:29,700
- No.
- SAN. Take this.

2027
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:30,870
Hurry up.

2028
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:32,540
- You have 40 seconds left.
- SAN.

2029
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:33,820
Hold this please.

2030
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:35,820
- SAN.
- No.

2031
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:39,040
- Hold it please.
- Good.

2032
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:41,820
- Hold it please.
- Good.

2033
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:42,890
(What will happen to Team Green?)

2034
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:44,890
He got it. My goodness.

2035
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,900
(He fails to climb up.)

2036
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:50,990
First place goes
to Jong Kook's team.

2037
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:53,490
Okay. It's over.

2038
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:54,790
Second place goes to Ji Hyo's team.

2039
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:57,070
Third place goes to Se Chan's team.

2040
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,160
Well done.

2041
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,940
Did Se Chan try hard?

2042
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,510
I think he didn't go up on purpose.

2043
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,850
Suk Jin. I tried
until the mic broke.

2044
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,240
- It's Jae Suk and Jong Kook.
- Jae Suk and Jong Kook.

2045
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:09,180
- Okay.
- Okay.

2046
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:10,850
Good luck.

2047
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:13,480
Jong Kook. Let's finish it at once.

2048
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,820
Get ready, set, go.

2049
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,150
- What was that?
- Hurry.

2050
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:18,560
Hurry up.

2051
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:20,950
- Yes. You got it.
- Hold onto it.

2052
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,860
- Oh, that was good.
- Watch carefully.

2053
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:25,600
- It's slippery.
- Now, now.

2054
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,470
(Falling)

2055
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:29,860
- So Min.
- What's wrong with you?

2056
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:31,110
What's wrong, So Min?

2057
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:33,980
Gosh.

2058
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,200
- Hey.
- How do I get up there?

2059
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:38,850
Hey.

2060
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:40,570
(Many famous dirty players joined
this round.)

2061
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:44,540
- It doesn't work at all.
- So Min.

2062
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:47,320
- It doesn't work at all.
- So Min.

2063
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,410
(A collision occurs.)

2064
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:50,730
- Hey. Be careful.
- So Min.

2065
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:53,450
- Why did you go in there?
- You can't do that, So Min.

2066
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:54,730
- So Min.
- So Min.

2067
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:56,620
So Min.
You're not allowed to do that.

2068
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,100
(No one plays fair as expected.)

2069
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,230
It's so funny.

2070
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:01,070
How do I do it? Wait.

2071
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:03,440
I can't go up at all.
What should I do?

2072
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:05,530
- I can't hold on to it.
- It's slippery.

2073
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,480
- Now.
- Go up at once.

2074
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:09,480
- Do you want me to push you?
- Hey. Look at him.

2075
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,780
SAN. Stop Jae Suk.

2076
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,040
Stop him.

2077
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,320
- Both of them are going up.
- Good job.

2078
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,650
You're doing great.

2079
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:18,580
Gosh.

2080
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:20,280
(Jong Kook reaches
the 2nd floor first.)

2081
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,650
Jong Kook.

2082
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,060
- Help me.
- You got it.

2083
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,360
- Jae Suk.
- Help me.

2084
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,150
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

2085
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:28,600
Hurry up.

2086
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,790
It's all thanks to you.

2087
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:31,490
(Jae Suk makes it
thanks to Jong Kook.)

2088
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,400
(Grunting)

2089
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:38,530
Wait.

2090
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:40,610
(Jae Suk pushes Suk Jin
who struggled to go up.)

2091
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:41,730
Are you alone?

2092
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,110
I almost had it.

2093
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:47,780
I almost had it.

2094
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:49,370
- He made it again.
- How did you do it?

2095
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,690
- How does he do that?
- My gosh.

2096
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:53,610
(Jong Kook is 1st
to reach the top again.)

2097
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:55,020
I did it.

2098
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,190
How do you get up there?

2099
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,530
Hey. I can't lose like this.

2100
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:00,360
What is this?

2101
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:02,120
Haha.

2102
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,290
You said that was not
how I should play.

2103
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:06,470
Grab my leg.

2104
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,140
My team reached the top.

2105
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:10,330
- We got it.
- My goodness.

2106
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:12,140
- We did it.
- We got it.

2107
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,530
- It's over.
- We did it.

2108
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:16,440
- How did they do that?
- Get down here.

2109
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:17,650
- Okay!
- How did they do it?

2110
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:20,020
We don't have a second place yet.

2111
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,320
- We don't have a second place yet.
- We did it.

2112
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,150
- How did you do it?
- We did it.

2113
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:26,390
- How do I do it?
- I can't get any higher.

2114
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,780
- It's so hard.
- Suk Jin. You're good.

2115
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:31,150
- My goodness.
- Hold me.

2116
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:35,260
How do you go up?

2117
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:36,770
(Grunting)

2118
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:40,770
(The steep slope makes them grunt.)

2119
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:42,530
How do I get up there?

2120
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,200
Are they drunk by any chance?

2121
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:48,730
They look like they're crawling home
after drinking.

2122
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:51,850
Excuse me. You drank too much.

2123
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:53,820
Wait.

2124
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:58,540
- How did they do that?
- Get down here.

2125
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,780
How did you do that?

2126
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:01,220
Hey!

2127
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:03,690
How did you get up there?

2128
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,760
How did that old man get up there?

2129
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:08,530
(They're amazed
by how hale Suk Jin is.)

2130
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:09,790
I can't do it at all.

2131
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:11,270
Here.

2132
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:13,120
(Then the old hiker sends
a rope down.)

2133
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,490
Here. Reach it.

2134
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:15,530
(Then the old hiker sends
a rope down.)

2135
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,660
Grab it please.

2136
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:19,110
I'm holding back with my jaw.

2137
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:20,370
(I can reach it.)

2138
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,510
- We're in first place anyway.
- Here.

2139
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:24,700
(1st place hikers are watching.)

2140
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,820
I'm holding back with my jaw.

2141
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:27,850
(Twitching)

2142
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:29,980
Oh, I'm sorry, Suk Jin.

2143
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,220
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

2144
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:32,740
Oh, I'm sorry, Suk Jin.

2145
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:33,950
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

2146
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:35,610
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

2147
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:37,320
- I slipped.
- My goodness.

2148
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,760
I'm sorry, Suk Jin.

2149
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,620
(Jae Suk slides
and kicks Suk Jin.)

2150
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:44,400
- I'm sorry. I slipped.
- Suk Jin.

2151
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,620
- My goodness.
- I slipped.

2152
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:47,360
- Come back up.
- I slipped.

2153
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,770
- Hey!
- I slipped.

2154
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,400
I slipped. I'm serious.

2155
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:52,200
- I'm sorry.
- Suk Jin.

2156
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:53,480
I slipped.

2157
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,140
I slipped. I'm done anyway.

2158
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,180
Good job.

2159
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:57,510
It was so hard to get up there.

2160
01:13:57,870 --> 01:13:59,510
- No.
- I slipped.

2161
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:01,220
I'm really sorry.

2162
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:03,220
- Gosh.
- Yes. Jae Suk looks sorry.

2163
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,540
It was so hard to get up there.

2164
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:06,890
- Yoo Jae Suk. Seriously.
- I mean it.

2165
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:09,110
- It was a mistake.
- It was a mistake.

2166
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:11,320
- I have no energy left.
- I slipped.

2167
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,390
He's right.

2168
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:14,430
What are you doing?

2169
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,620
Are you a worm or what?

2170
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,160
I want to move, but I can't.

2171
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,270
- You have a minute.
- It was so hard to get up there.

2172
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,970
The person who makes it
to the second floor places second.

2173
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:24,270
You have to get up there first.

2174
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:26,360
Haha. The person who reaches it
places second.

2175
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,640
No! Haha!

2176
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,440
- Get there first.
- Just a bit more.

2177
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,350
- He did it.
- He got it.

2178
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:35,480
We're last.

2179
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:37,650
My.

2180
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:39,740
Go away, you punk.

2181
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:41,060
(Go away, you punk.)

2182
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,320
- SAN. Push him.
- It was so hard to get here.

2183
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:46,820
Wait.

2184
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,950
- Give it to So Min.
- So Min is doing it.

2185
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,070
- So Min's coming.
- She's so cool.

2186
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:53,270
The old man is coming.

2187
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:55,660
Look at the old man.

2188
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:57,400
The old man is coming to catch her.

2189
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,510
(The old hiker hasn't given up yet.)

2190
01:14:58,510 --> 01:15:00,400
- So Min.
- Look behind you.

2191
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,140
There's an old man behind you.

2192
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,070
So Min. Look at the old man.

2193
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:05,680
Help her, SAN.

2194
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:07,610
Hold her hand. That's right.

2195
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:09,440
(Everyone from Team Green
makes it to the 2nd floor.)

2196
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,480
Yoo Jae Suk. That punk.

2197
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:12,940
I'm going to kill him.

2198
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:14,150
(I'm going to kill him.)

2199
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:15,360
Sorry, Suk Jin.

2200
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:17,190
(The game ends.)

2201
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:18,360
Okay.

2202
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:23,400
Second place goes to SAN,
So Min, and Se Chan.

2203
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,970
(Team Green places 2nd.
Team Blue places 3rd.)

2204
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:26,360
You predicted us placing the bottom.

2205
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:28,160
Haha.

2206
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,190
(Did Haha not go up on purpose
to place 3rd?)

2207
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:30,310
That's funny.

2208
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:32,440
I'm so tired.

2209
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,530
So, all the missions with 99 kids
are over.

2210
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:37,700
- Okay.
- We have to catch them.

2211
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:40,240
The 21st century is about to come.

2212
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,870
- First place goes to them.
- Yes.

2213
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:45,110
Second place goes to the team
that sent more people up.

2214
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:47,410
Third place goes to Team Blue.

2215
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,150
- Yes.
- Yes.

2216
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:52,650
Nostra and Damus...

2217
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:55,620
(Did Nostra and Damus succeed
to predict the result?)

2218
01:15:58,530 --> 01:15:59,820
failed to predict the result.

2219
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:02,230
(They both failed.)

2220
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:04,230
Right. He tried to place second,
but he couldn't.

2221
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:06,200
- They failed.
- He placed third.

2222
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,330
You're totally wrong.

2223
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,810
Now,

2224
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:12,780
we'll have a vote
to arrest Nostra and Damus.

2225
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:14,070
Each of you...

2226
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:17,240
will tell the producer over there.

2227
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,350
- Okay.
- Okay.

2228
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:21,560
They have an extra vote
from earlier.

2229
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:23,480
That means you can pick two people.

2230
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:25,060
And...

2231
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,430
you can buy an extra vote...

2232
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:29,600
with your own money if you want.

2233
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:31,690
If we buy it,
we can't take money home.

2234
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:34,440
That's right. You can use
your prize money to buy the vote.

2235
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,790
That's up to you.

2236
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:38,900
But you never know...

2237
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,230
if Nostra and Damus buy
a lot of votes.

2238
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:43,070
Oh, that's right.
They could buy the votes.

2239
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:46,240
- They might vote for someone else.
- That's right.

2240
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,110
You probably know by now.

2241
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:50,390
"Kim Jong Kook Game" begins.

2242
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:51,390
Let's listen to him.

2243
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:53,240
No, I won't say anything today.

2244
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:54,360
- Really?
- Yes.

2245
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,260
I'm sure you're all thinking
the same, so I won't say anything.

2246
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:00,030
Se Chan.
Why don't you say something?

2247
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,490
- Everyone is suspecting you.
- Yes.

2248
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:04,320
I know everyone is suspecting me.

2249
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,320
Everyone suspected me
when I was with Suk Jin.

2250
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,070
So I have no choice
but to point at Suk Jin.

2251
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:11,270
But Jong Kook is driving it on me.

2252
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:14,070
So I have nothing to say
even though I know the truth.

2253
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:16,070
If it's not me, who else?

2254
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:17,740
How come it's not her or him?

2255
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:19,540
(Ji Hee and SAN)

2256
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:20,910
- I've tried so hard.
- So...

2257
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:23,370
we think it's not them
based on the situation.

2258
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:26,440
It's not me, but I'm thinking
what if it's not him.

2259
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:29,260
- It's not me.
- You've become kind, Suk Jin.

2260
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:32,360
- I think it's Suk Jin.
- It's Ji Hee.

2261
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,600
But he did so well.

2262
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:35,360
It's not me.

2263
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:38,360
Ji Hee is suspicious.

2264
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:41,270
Ji Hee and I were on the list.

2265
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,530
- Yes.
- You were on the list.

2266
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:45,610
I don't think Ji Hee is Damus.

2267
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:46,610
(Haha and Ji Hee)

2268
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:48,070
Then she's Nostra.

2269
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:49,680
(Then she's Nostra.)

2270
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,650
- Me?
- You can't say it's not possible.

2271
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:53,150
There is a possibility.

2272
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:54,940
Why are you driving it on me?

2273
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:56,110
Because it's not me.

2274
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:57,520
- It's between you and me.
- It's not me.

2275
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:58,720
It's really not me.

2276
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,450
You kept holding onto it
and didn't go up.

2277
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:02,650
I have no idea.

2278
01:18:02,650 --> 01:18:04,930
Please vote.

2279
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,580
How much do I have?

2280
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:09,320
- You currently have 410 dollars.
- I see.

2281
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:13,230
You have 1 vote,
and you can buy up to 4 votes.

2282
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:15,940
I'll use it all.

2283
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:18,330
Two on Haha and three on Se Chan.

2284
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:19,440
- Okay.
- Yes.

2285
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:22,330
One for Haha and...

2286
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:25,650
- Ji Hee.
- Okay.

2287
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:27,020
I...

2288
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:30,020
vote for Haha...

2289
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:32,440
- and Haha.
- Okay.

2290
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:35,390
How's the voting going?

2291
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:36,650
(It's Haha's turn to vote.)

2292
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:39,930
You can buy up to five votes.

2293
01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:41,430
I can buy up to five votes?

2294
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:43,100
You have 510 dollars.

2295
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:46,970
Can you tell me...

2296
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:48,970
- how the voting is going?
- Haha.

2297
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:50,730
- Really?
- Are you asking him for advice?

2298
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,270
(Are you asking him for advice?)

2299
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:56,230
Are you asking him for advice?

2300
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:57,870
(He looks small today.)

2301
01:18:57,870 --> 01:19:00,040
- Stop it.
- "Stop it".

2302
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,020
(Haha is asking for advice
because...)

2303
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:05,390
You are new prophets...

2304
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:08,580
who will predict the end
and shake Running Man today.

2305
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:10,980
You are Nostra and Damus.

2306
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,450
You'll now predict the ranking.

2307
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:15,120
(Then he began predicting
the ranking.)

2308
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:18,620
(Nostra Haha carefully...)

2309
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:25,530
(predicted the ranking.)

2310
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:29,510
Haha, Jae Suk, and Ji Hee.

2311
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:31,700
(Haha predicted
his own team last...)

2312
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:34,280
(and Jong Kook's team 1st.)

2313
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,740
(Nostra carries out his plan
to make his prophecy real.)

2314
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:38,650
- I'll protect it at first.
- Okay.

2315
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:40,520
(He said he'd protect
the headquarter,)

2316
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,360
(but he went to have fun.)

2317
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:43,930
It's not working.

2318
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,560
(So,)

2319
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,900
(Nostra's prophecy came true.)

2320
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:53,120
(Nostra took a risk
to make his prophecy come true.)

2321
01:19:53,570 --> 01:19:56,690
(He won 460 dollars in secret.)

2322
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:00,330
(He struggled in the last mission.)

2323
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:05,180
(Haha was Nostra.)

2324
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:08,440
(Nostra is bitten by vipers
and asks for advice.)

2325
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,180
Nostra.

2326
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,020
Hey, Nostra. Stop it.

2327
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:13,540
Nostra

2328
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:15,820
Oh, my love Nostra

2329
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:18,560
(A song for Nostra who went through
a lot today because of Jong Kook)

2330
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:21,530
(Haha never gives up...)

2331
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:24,730
(and votes carefully.)

2332
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:26,120
You have 200 dollars.

2333
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:27,330
I'll buy votes with all I have.

2334
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:28,990
You can buy two.

2335
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:30,530
- Yes. I get four in total.
- Four.

2336
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:32,010
Who do you vote for?

2337
01:20:32,570 --> 01:20:35,530
(Everyone votes for the person
they suspect.)

2338
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,310
Okay.

2339
01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:41,110
(Will they be able to arrest
Nostra and Damus?)

2340
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:43,650
Everyone. I have the result.

2341
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:44,650
You do?

2342
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:47,360
I'll announce two people
who received most votes.

2343
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,360
We'll decide the penalty,
then tell you who they are.

2344
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,450
I'll first announce the person
who received the most votes.

2345
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:56,620
- He received 13 votes.
- Received 13?

2346
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:59,930
(Did Haha receive the most votes?)

2347
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:02,990
(Or is it Se Chan who Detective Kim
suspected from the beginning?)

2348
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:05,640
(Or could it be Suk Jin or Ji Hee?)

2349
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:08,700
(Who will become
the final candidate?)

2350
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,870
- It's Suk Jin.
- What?

2351
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:12,110
(Suk Jin)

2352
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:13,310
What?

2353
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:14,870
Me?

2354
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:18,980
(It was neither of them,)

2355
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:20,860
(but Suk Jin.)

2356
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:22,150
They both voted for him.

2357
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:23,280
I'm telling you it's him.

2358
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,580
- I think they both voted for him.
- They must've bought the votes.

2359
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:26,030
The other person is...

2360
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:27,030
(Who else received the most votes?)

2361
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:29,650
It was one vote difference.

2362
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:31,160
- Haha.
- It's Haha.

2363
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,160
(Haha received 9 votes.)

2364
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,530
- But...
- How many votes did Se Chan get?

2365
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:35,860
He received eight votes.

2366
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:37,230
I'm telling you it's not me.

2367
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:38,730
But he's...

2368
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:41,070
I think he's Damus.

2369
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:42,230
(Nostra Haha is already arrested.)

2370
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:45,740
(Then who's Damus?)

2371
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,720
Let's decide the penalty first.

2372
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,870
Who receives the penalty?

2373
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:51,240
You two. It's been determined.

2374
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,150
It's been determined.

2375
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:54,760
It's over.

2376
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,720
- I'm sorry.
- Whether it's you or not.

2377
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,190
- Whether it's me or not?
- I'm sorry.

2378
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:00,790
- And you get no prize money.
- For the penalty,

2379
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:03,650
slide down here.

2380
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:06,790
Forward, backward, and sideways.

2381
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:08,070
That's funny.

2382
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:09,360
That's funny.

2383
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,940
- My goodness.
- That's hilarious.

2384
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:13,230
Hey. I can't believe you.

2385
01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:15,310
You voted me for Nostra and Damus?

2386
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:16,730
- They both voted for me.
- All right.

2387
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:20,110
I'll reveal who Nostra is.

2388
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,940
- We did it.
- You're with me.

2389
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:23,370
Nostra is...

2390
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:25,020
(Nostra is...)

2391
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:27,560
- It's Haha.
- I'll kill you.

2392
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,760
- It's Haha.
- I'll kill you.

2393
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:34,190
I'll kill you.

2394
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:37,030
I knew he was Nostra.

2395
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:38,730
(Throwing)

2396
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:41,990
(He was caught by Detective Kim
and couldn't avoid suspicion.)

2397
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:43,440
He's obvious.

2398
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,010
I can tell by looking at his face.
He's in trouble.

2399
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:48,010
Now, there's Damus left.

2400
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:49,640
- Damus.
- Damus is Suk Jin.

2401
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,680
First, Suk Jin...

2402
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:53,820
is...

2403
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:55,040
(Suk Jin became the candidate
at the end.)

2404
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:58,240
(1st prediction time)

2405
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:02,860
(Suk Jin became suspicious
due to his cologne.)

2406
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:06,760
(Suk Jin might forget
that he's Damus.)

2407
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:10,030
(People kept suspecting Suk Jin
even in the car.)

2408
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:12,160
(2nd prediction time)

2409
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:17,330
(People suspected Suk Jin even more
due to the sound he made.)

2410
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:21,940
(Is Suk Jin Damus?)

2411
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:24,010
Is he just a resident of Seocho-gu
or what?

2412
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:25,700
He's a loach of Jamwon-dong.

2413
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:27,370
- Hugh Grant.
- The loach of Jamwon-dong.

2414
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:28,370
(Or is he just a loach
of Jamwon-dong?)

2415
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:32,780
(Is Suk Jin Damus?)

2416
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,060
- He is not Damus.
- I knew it.

2417
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:46,560
- Obviously not.
- Damus is...

2418
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,860
(Suk Jin is not Damus.)

2419
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:49,730
- Obviously not.
- Damus is...

2420
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:52,230
(Damus is...)

2421
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:53,730
Se Chan.

2422
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:55,570
- See?
- I knew it.

2423
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:58,250
(Se Chan survived dramatically
at the end.)

2424
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:00,050
Shut It Damus.

2425
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:05,850
You are Nostra and Damus.

2426
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:08,520
- Who's Damus? Me?
- Shut It Damus.

2427
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,520
I'm Damus obviously.

2428
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,650
- Shut It Damus.
- I'm Damus.

2429
01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:14,260
- I'm Damus.
- Yes.

2430
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:18,670
(Damus Se Chan felt confident.)

2431
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,970
(But he got bitten by the viper
in the opening.)

2432
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:25,860
(In the end)

2433
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:32,140
(Shut It Damus focused
on avoiding suspicion.)

2434
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:34,470
(Then...)

2435
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:37,250
(he kept talking
about how hard he tried.)

2436
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:40,720
(He made the innocent guests
believe him like that.)

2437
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:44,560
(Then he accused Suk Jin
of being the prophet.)

2438
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,320
(That's how the naive 99 kids...)

2439
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,020
(voted for Suk Jin.)

2440
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:51,890
(Shut It Damus spent all his money
to vote for Suk Jin.)

2441
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:53,360
It was Yang Se Chan.

2442
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,860
- I knew it.
- See? I told you.

2443
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:56,640
- It was so obvious.
- My gosh.

2444
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,670
I told you the answer
from the beginning.

2445
01:24:58,670 --> 01:25:00,670
- I said it was Se Chan.
- At the beginning...

2446
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:01,730
- Seriously?
- I had no idea.

2447
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:03,730
- Did you two plan it together?
- It was Se Chan.

2448
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:05,880
- I hate this.
- It was hard at the beginning.

2449
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,140
As soon as we began the mission,

2450
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:09,140
Se Chan was like this.

2451
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,220
(He acted awkwardly.)

2452
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:11,920
He was like this,
so I caught him right away.

2453
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:13,940
I didn't do anything.

2454
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:15,590
- It was...
- It wasn't usual.

2455
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:16,650
It was like...

2456
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:18,760
he was doing things...

2457
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:21,220
- by instinct.
- He's so good at this.

2458
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:23,650
So the citizens will get
their prize money.

2459
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:25,270
- To be honest...
- This is funny.

2460
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:28,170
If Jong Kook behaves like that
when I'm a spy,

2461
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:29,730
I'll want to go straight home.

2462
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:31,500
- Jae Suk.
- It's torturous.

2463
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,230
- I can't even eat.
- Ji Hee gets 95 dollars.

2464
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:34,860
- Okay.
- Thank you.

2465
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:36,140
SAN.

2466
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:38,570
- You get 175 dollars.
- That's a lot.

2467
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:39,640
(150 for Jae Suk, 100 for So Min,
5 dollars for Ji Hyo and Jong Kook)

2468
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,570
And Arin gets no money.

2469
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:43,520
- No money?
- She spent all her money.

2470
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,310
I just did it because of you.

2471
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:48,220
So we will wire the prize money.

2472
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:49,850
You two should go up then.

2473
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:53,650
(The penalty decided by the members
is going down the soapy slide.)

2474
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:54,720
It's so slippery.

2475
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,520
(They chose a penalty that is
more bothersome and humiliating.)

2476
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:57,520
Here comes the soapy water.

2477
01:25:58,150 --> 01:26:02,530
(They enjoy the penalty
splashing soapy water.)

2478
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:03,840
Okay.

2479
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:05,560
Thank you.

2480
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2481
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,230
(We'd like to thank the 99 kids
for saving the world.)

2482
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:11,100
- Haha is it.
- This is funny.

2483
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:14,600
(Se Chan's birthday party)

2484
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:17,520
(Se Chan is here to be a good son
with a fancy birthday party.)

2485
01:26:17,850 --> 01:26:21,440
(And the variety parents are
waiting for Se Chan.)

2486
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:25,430
(Thank you, Mother and Father.)

2487
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:27,220
(A thick bundle of money)

2488
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:28,260
(Here.)

2489
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:30,560
(He treats his variety show parents
with good money.)

2490
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:33,970
(He dreams of a perfect
variety show family like that.)

2491
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:36,500
(I guess I've spoiled him.)

2492
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,470
(He hit you as if you were
his parents' enemy.)

2493
01:26:38,470 --> 01:26:40,210
(He gave up being a good son.)

2494
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:41,730
He pretends he doesn't like me.

2495
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:43,570
(The parents blinded by money
speak ill of their son...)

2496
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:44,640
(and hit him.)

2497
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:45,850
(Did he get his teeth straightened?)

2498
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:47,140
(He will turn 60 soon.)

2499
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:49,140
(You're not good at soccer.)

2500
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:51,440
(Like father, like son.
The family criticizes each other.)

2501
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,020
(Will the son's birthday party
end successfully?)

2502
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:54,440
(The Variety Show Family,
Yang Se Chan the Good Son)
