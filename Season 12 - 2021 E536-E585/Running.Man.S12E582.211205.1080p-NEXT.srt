00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,640
(A wedding hall in Seoul)

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,680
Hello.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,400
Hello. Hi.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,900
- Hi.
- Hello.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,720
- Why do we have three cushions?
- What are we doing today?

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,540
- What is going on?
- Why are there three cushions?

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,680
I haven't been on the same team
with So Min for quite a while.

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,350
Se Chan is not here.

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,880
It feels like I'm a big senior.

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,390
Guys, do you think Se Chan
has improved in a variety show...

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,190
compared to when
he first joined Running Man?

12
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,300
Se Chan? Of course, he has.

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,300
He has improved.

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,390
He was daunted at first.
So he couldn't even talk.

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,570
I know. He was too nice.

16
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,870
When So Min was playing
an active role, he was just quiet.

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,940
I know.

18
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,700
When So Min won
the Best Rookie Award... Of course,

19
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,910
- Se Chan congratulated her.
- Right.

20
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,980
But he got really drunk that day.

21
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,480
I felt really bad for him.

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,220
We felt bad watching him.

23
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,810
Right. But now, he throws
a tantrum sometimes.

24
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,860
I know.

25
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,790
I don't even remember how many
times he slapped me in the face.

26
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,690
He is a lot better now.

27
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,190
So Se Chan is not here.

28
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,900
But I don't think he's good
enough to be the protagonist.

29
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,270
He hasn't improved that much.

30
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,630
He's not that good.

31
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,410
So Min and Se Chan
joined our show together.

32
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,270
So Min adapted right away.

33
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,000
But it took Se Chan
about a year to adapt to our show.

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,200
He's on fire now.

35
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
He's a slow starter.

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,750
Se Chan needed more time to adapt...

37
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,520
because he's shy of strangers.

38
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,020
- Exactly.
- He's very shy.

39
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,980
Those who are shy need more time.

40
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,780
- Right.
- So it took me about ten years.

41
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,780
You?

42
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,190
- It took me a long time.
- You don't feel nervous anymore.

43
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,360
- I don't.
- It took him about ten years.

44
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,950
Honestly, he didn't
get adjusted at first.

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,300
Everyone needs some time to adjust.

46
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,800
Then I tore down the wall.

47
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,030
(Then I tore down the wall.)

48
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,200
It was like the reunification of
East Germany and West Germany.

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,110
I'm a lot older than him, so we
don't usually meet on variety shows.

50
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,500
But I offered my hand first.

51
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,280
Are you showing off
what you've done for him?

52
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,840
It's not like that.
I'm a lot older than him.

53
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,690
I made my debut way before he did.

54
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,920
He must've been afraid of me.

55
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,860
But I broke it down.

56
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,030
I treated him like my friend.
There was this game...

57
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,300
where we hit each other
with a cushion.

58
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,500
I tried to be considerate
playing the game.

59
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,090
I told Se Chan to hit me first.

60
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,640
(He told Se Chan
to hit him first playing the game.)

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,400
(He thinks that's how he broke down
the wall between him and Se Chan.)

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,510
(He sounds like an old fossil.)

63
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,080
I just told him to hit me harder.

64
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,140
That's how we got the great scene.

65
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,020
(No one remembers the great scene.)

66
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,050
Seriously, this is
what I can never become.

67
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,790
I can never become an old fossil.

68
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,680
So why isn't Se Chan here yet?

69
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,600
December 8,
which is 3 days from now...

70
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,360
is Se Chan's birthday.

71
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,360
We can't celebrate
the members' birthday every time.

72
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,200
So what?

73
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,990
So we prepared this race today.

74
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,670
It's called Filial Son
Yang Se Chan Race.

75
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,960
Filial Son Yang Se Chan Race.

76
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,200
Se Chan was a newborn baby
on a variety show,

77
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,170
and you have raised him with love
like his parents.

78
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,240
That's true.

79
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,670
When Se Chan first
joined our show, I was...

80
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,020
- You gave birth to him.
- Seriously,

81
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,610
I embraced him.

82
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,710
So your son, Se Chan will...

83
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,210
choose the parents
he wants to do his filial duty...

84
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,950
and visit their room.

85
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,630
But he can visit only one couple.

86
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,070
And the parents chosen by Se Chan...

87
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,360
will get some spending money.

88
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,330
It's done. Get ready.

89
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,040
- This is a little...
- Get ready to greet him.

90
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,140
- It's a done deal.
- Sure.

91
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,360
- This is done.
- Get ready.

92
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,360
- He must come to my room.
- Right.

93
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,080
- He knows that too.
- Sure.

94
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,010
I know
everyone has been nice to him.

95
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,080
But...

96
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,640
Jong Kook raised him.

97
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,020
- He even breastfed Se Chan.
- Sure.

98
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,350
- And he made baby food for him.
- Sure.

99
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,680
- I even breastfed him.
- You did.

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,980
- I know that.
- Of course.

101
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,950
But now he knows
what's funny on variety shows.

102
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,820
So I'm afraid
he might play some pranks.

103
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,890
- He can't do that this time.
- He can't.

104
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,260
- That's not right.
- This isn't the right time.

105
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,980
You can throw a tantrum
if he doesn't come.

106
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,490
He'd say, "Gosh, Jong Kook."

107
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,270
"Please."

108
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,860
- "I get it."
- "This is a variety show."

109
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,730
- "I know. I get it."
- "I understand."

110
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,570
- "I know what you mean. Okay."
- "It's fun."

111
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,200
- "Good."
- "Go to your dad then."

112
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,430
"Se Chan, you can't do this."

113
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,170
It feels strange today.

114
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,080
- This is strange.
- You're tired, aren't you?

115
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,240
I'm very tired.

116
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,550
(It is tiring just to think
of the parents' nagging.)

117
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,610
It's true that we've raised Se Chan.

118
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,320
You're like his dad.

119
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,520
Of course.

120
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,680
Son!

121
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,490
- I should go get him.
- Hey, stay here.

122
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,550
I've never fathered a punk like him.

123
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,930
Honey.

124
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,390
Hang on a moment.

125
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,000
"Honey?"

126
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,440
- You're my husband.
- Right.

127
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,810
He has a protruding mouth.
He takes after you.

128
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,640
- All right. I get it.
- He's our son.

129
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,100
- I know. Don't push him too hard.
- And, honey...

130
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,080
While raising Se Chan,

131
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,880
I just thought...

132
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,910
I'd send him
to someone else for a while.

133
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,150
(Flustered)

134
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,560
Do we really have to go that far?

135
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,500
Is it necessary?

136
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,660
Actually, there was something
going on between Se Chan and you.

137
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,570
Right. Actually,

138
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,960
I'm his variety show wife.

139
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,180
- What?
- On variety shows...

140
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,080
I'm not like his variety show mom.

141
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,180
I'm more like his variety show wife.
So it might be uncomfortable.

142
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,640
His variety show wife?

143
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,470
(While the variety show parents and
variety show wife are waiting...)

144
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,950
(A fancy banner is greeting
Se Chan downstairs.)

145
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,630
(The Empty Head biography
to praise him)

146
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,350
(Empty)

147
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,570
(With the grand music,)

148
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,070
(the star of the day shows up.)

149
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,740
What is going on?

150
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,660
(His gum has dried up from shyness.)

151
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,940
(There's a drum and fife band.)

152
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,010
Why are you doing this?

153
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,450
(The drum and fife band plays
instruments without touching them.)

154
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,450
(Playing drums in the air)

155
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,620
They are our production crew.

156
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,450
They're not playing for real.

157
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,830
(The fake band consists of writers,
producers, and floor directors.)

158
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,390
(The band is hired without pay.)

159
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,700
What?

160
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,930
(The band is hired without pay.)

161
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,130
Halt!

162
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,200
(Off the beat)

163
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,700
Why is the music still playing?

164
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,310
(The band can play
only when there's music.)

165
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,310
I thought you spent some money
on this, but that's not true.

166
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,600
Thank you anyway. What's all this?

167
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,410
- Blow the candle.
- Thank you.

168
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,950
My goodness.

169
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,040
Thank you.

170
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,210
Gosh, I'm startled.

171
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,560
It hurts.

172
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,350
Thank you.

173
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,060
Thank you so much.

174
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,950

(1986, The day
when Se Chan was born)

176
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,660
You may leave now.

(The fake band leaves.)

178
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,240
They don't seem sincere at all.

179
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,200
- On your birthday,
- Yes.

180
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,900
you're supposed
to thank your parents...

181
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,940
who gave birth to you
and have raised you.

182
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,520
Your variety show parents who gave
birth to you with their hearts...

183
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,410
and have raised you
are waiting upstairs.

184
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,620
My variety show parents?

185
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,190
You should choose one couple
who you want to do filial duty...

186
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,930
and visit them.

187
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,220
- Only one couple?
- Yes.

188
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,700
The first couple is
Jae Suk and So Min.

189
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,630
The second is Jong Kook and Haha.

190
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,070
And the third is
Suk Jin and Ji Hyo.

191
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,370
There are stories
behind each couple.

192
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,140
Should I pick only one couple?

193
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,640
Why? Can't I choose all of them?

194
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,380
This is a lot of pressure.

195
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,840
And Jong Kook will be mad
if I don't pick him.

196
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,490
(He is going to chew
on Se Chan all day.)

197
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,890
Gosh, I'm in trouble now.

198
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,490
My goodness.

199
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,350
This is driving me crazy.

200
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,200
They will be disappointed.

201
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,200
They feel disappointed for real.

202
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,930
You don't have to be so anxious.

203
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,390
- He'll definitely come.
- I'm not anxious.

204
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,660
I'm fine.

205
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,940
I'm not nervous at all.

206
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,700
You seem nervous.

207
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,700
- Right.
- No, I'm not.

208
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,940
- You might chew your nails soon.
- No.

209
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,250
This isn't fun. I don't know
why we are doing this.

210
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,820
See? You look anxious.

211
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,540
I understand...

212
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,390
that he can hesitate. He's a pro.

213
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,410
I understand.

214
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,350
- But if he doesn't come in here...
- Gosh.

215
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,780
That means he doesn't want
to see Jong Kook again.

216
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,390
It means he wants
to disown Jong Kook.

217
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,760
Good.

218
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,830
- You're good at cornering him.
- I know.

219
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,370
You are forcing him into a corner.

220
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,520
(He's a good decoy.)

221
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,590
I knew it.

222
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,640
Honey.

223
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,370
What's wrong with our son?

224
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,140
He's not even here
to see his parents.

225
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,330
I don't know.

226
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,750
(Ms. Jeon is so into her character.)

227
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,900
My son...

228
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,040
He won't be here.

229
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,320
Honestly, I don't
expect him to come.

230
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,470
He won't come here.

231
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,410
- You still want him to come.
- But he's not a human being...

232
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,620
if he doesn't come.

233
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,550
(The son is heading
to his particular parents groaning.)

234
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,730
(He's visiting his parents
with a lot of worries.)

235
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,320
- Son.
- Son.

236
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,520
Son.

237
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,370
I'm annoyed
that we're feeling nervous.

238
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,530
I know.

239
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,740
- This is just obvious.
- Son.

240
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,840
Hey, Se Chan.

241
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,010
I'm his warm...

242
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,640
variety show parent.

243
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,740
And I'm sitting right here.

244
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,880
(Which parents does Se Chan
want to do his filial duty to?)

245
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,070
There you go.

246
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,720
- Come on in.
- Gosh.

247
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,890
(Touched)

248
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,180
You've raised me...

249
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,650
(You've raised me...)

250
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,490
- and guided me.
- Right.

251
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,020
- That's why I could come this far.
- Of course.

252
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,230
- You two.
- Okay.

253
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,890
Please blow the candle
to celebrate my birthday.

254
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,560
- All right.
- Okay.

255
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,660
- Let's celebrate his birthday.
- Okay.

256
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,840
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

257
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,740
Thank you...

258
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,800
- for having raised me.
- My gosh.

259
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,030
Thank you.

260
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,670
- How nice.
- I wasn't even worried.

261
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,220
- Thank you.
- My son.

262
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,720
Dad and Mom.

263
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,890
You are the parents I must visit.

264
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,810
I should do my filial duty.

265
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,390
- Of course.
- I know.

266
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,860
- Now...
- Thank you for having raised me.

267
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,860
(Disappointed)

268
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,360
Oh, Jong Kook...

269
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,130
He worked with Jong Kook.

270
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,190
- What?
- He chose Jong Kook and Haha.

271
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,660
See? I knew it.

272
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,160
What...

273
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,400
- He didn't even show his face here.
- I can't believe this.

274
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
He's unbelievable.

275
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,880
The thing is,

276
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,750
he has no understanding
of the overall rules...

277
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,040
and today's theme.

278
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,990
We have everything ready.

279
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,890
I know. So Min and I have
developed the situation.

280
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,150
And he ruined everything.

281
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,180
All he needed to do was
come in and play along.

282
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,760
- He could've at least peeped in.
- I know.

283
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,920
My goodness.

284
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,970
- Gosh.
- He's hopeless.

285
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,340
He hasn't changed at all
for the past five years.

286
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,690
- He's a hopeless case.
- Se Chan hasn't improved.

287
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,840
He's just...

288
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,510
- Jae Suk, he hasn't improved.
- That's true.

289
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,560
He should learn more.

290
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,840
If only he were
half as good as So Min.

291
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,480
- Darn it.
- Darn it.

292
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,750
- I don't have a son.
- Let's go.

293
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,110
- I don't have a son.
- I don't need him.

294
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,750
- Let's go, So Min.
- Honey, let's make one.

295
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,090
What?

296
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,990
If you didn't come...

297
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,650
Actually, we kind of imagined...

298
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,050
what it would be like.

299
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,180
It would've been horrible.

300
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,280
It was horrible.

301
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,650
That's what I thought
as I passed by here.

302
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,690
If I chose someone else,

303
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,160
I knew
things would've been terrible.

304
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,130
You've grown up very well.

305
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,030
Actually, you grew up yourself.

306
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,270
That's not true.

307
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,930
I could come this far
thanks to you, Mom and Dad.

308
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,170
Thank you.

309
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,030
- You look great in that hat.
- Thank you.

310
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,210
All right. Go ahead and make a bow.

311
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,300
Okay.

312
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,410
- Stay healthy.
- Okay.

313
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,220
My goodness. My son, Se Chan.

314
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,810
- Se Chan is...
- I'm so proud of you.

315
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,310
Will you cheer me up a little?

316
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,890
Sure. There you go.

317
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,820
That's my boy.

318
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,820
- Hey.
- My gosh.

319
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,770
- I'm so proud of him.
- Thank you.

320
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,660
- He's doing well on many TV shows.
- Right.

321
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,140
You turned out so well.

322
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,100
It reminded me of the old days.

323
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,470
What did you think of?

324
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,070
The time when I was struggling.

325
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,210
The time when I felt lonely.

326
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,640
- When you first joined this show?
- Yes.

327
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,540
- Who did I have back then?
- Who did you have?

328
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,850
My gosh.

329
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,540
- I had Jong Kook.
- This is so touching.

330
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,090
- A lot of videos flashed...
- I know.

331
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,180
- before my eyes.
- The time in New Zealand.

332
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,420
(The parents' love flashed
before his eyes.)

333
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,260
You encouraged me and praised me.

334
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,630
Nevis.

335
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,860
- Swing!
- Swing!

336
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,500
(His variety show parents raised him
getting penalties together.)

337
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,470
I remember all that.

338
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,660
Actually, it's us
who received your help.

339
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,800
That's not true, Mom.

340
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,170
We did a lot of things together.

341
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,480
I didn't realize it,
but we did a lot of things together.

342
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,940
- Dad, thank you for everything.
- That's my son.

343
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,170
(Proud)

344
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,350
- My gosh.
- Hello.

345
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,390
Hello.

346
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,140
I mean, our son is...

347
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,910
- Wait.
- My son is...

348
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,520
- It's you.
- Who are they?

349
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,990
- They are our production crew.
- My gosh.

350
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,320
- Really? I didn't know.
- I thought they were...

351
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,500
actual musicians.

352
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,600
Hello.

353
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,020
Get close to each other.

354
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,270
(Taking a picture
to save the memory)

355
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,190
One, two, three.

356
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,740
(Staring)

357
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,840
Hey, are you a tour guide
or something?

358
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,560
(1986, The day
when Se Chan was born)

359
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,510
- It's nice to meet you all.
- I feel like I'm at a theme park.

360
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,270
- Don't you recognize them?
- They're our staff members.

361
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,270
- They're our staff members.
- He didn't recognize them.

362
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,750
- Min Hee and everyone on the team.
- He greeted them like strangers.

363
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,020
- Suk Jin.
- Look.

364
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,620
They're all our staff members.

365
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,760
- You must be disappointed.
- What did he say earlier?

366
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,130
"It's nice to meet you all."

367
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,760
(He said hello politely
as if he had never met them before.)

368
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,860
- He's the worst.
- Come on, Suk Jin.

369
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,730
Oh, my. I thought a band came
from some kind of school.

370
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,290
- My gosh. Really?
- You're the worst.

371
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,640
Now, the star of the day Se Chan...

372
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,480
and his variety show parents will
come out.

373
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,770
- His variety show parents.
- I'm really disappointed.

374
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,250
- Exactly.
- This is ridiculous.

375
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,670
- Let's go.
- Gosh.

376
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,480
- Look how disappointed they are.
- I can't believe this.

377
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,140
- Hey, how could you?
- I had no choice.

378
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,490
- Nonsense.
- It was an obvious choice.

379
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,020
- How could you do that to me?
- Of course, he chose us.

380
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,650
- It was so predictable.
- Suk Jin seems so disappointed.

381
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,690
I had no choice.

382
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,470
- You know that.
- I can't believe you.

383
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,130
- Jae Suk, you know, right?
- But still...

384
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,160
Sir, you know why I did that.

385
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,660
- I didn't even get nervous.
- I mean...

386
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,640
- You all know. Don't be upset.
- When I heard about it,

387
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,140
- I thought it was obvious.
- Suk Jin, you know me.

388
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,940
- You see...
- Why are they your parents?

389
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,440
- Why? Tell us the reason.
- Of course...

390
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,440
- I practically gave birth to him.
- Of course, we're his parents.

391
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,770
- And I raised him too.
- Tell us the reason.

392
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,910
- I raised him until he was seven.
- Why?

393
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,390
- We fed him since he was a baby.
- Yes, we did.

394
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,490
I realized that I had
so many good memories with them.

395
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,990
- We made a lot of good memories.
- Yes.

396
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,730
- I'm so disappointed.
- Suk Jin talked about memories.

397
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,960
- Like what? Tell me.
- What good memories?

398
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,470
- This is what I said.
- What is it?

399
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,060
- "Whenever he had a hard time..."
- Where did we go together?

400
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,270
- Where did you go with him?
- Gosh, you punk.

401
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,240
Are you Charlie Chaplin or what?

402
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,060
Where did you take him
when he had a hard time?

403
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,430
- I'm really disappointed.
- My dear baby.

404
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,930
- My sweet child.
- I'm upset too.

405
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,850
- My baby.
- You grew up so well.

406
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,510
Look at his shoulders.
He's just like me.

407
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,910
- Look at his shoulders.
- You're smart and athletic.

408
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,180
- My teacher taught me well.
- Thank you, sir.

409
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,850
- Anyway...
- He's my teacher.

410
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,860
I'm the one who helped them all
grow as entertainers.

411
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,360
- That's true.
- Hey, he's your grandfather.

412
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,760
- He's your variety show grandpa.
- Grandpa.

413
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,020
- He's my variety show grandfather.
- I raised them all.

414
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,630
- It's true that he's your grandpa.
- True.

415
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,730
- I admit that he's our elder.
- That's right.

416
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,770
- But he's not your parent.
- We're all in the same family.

417
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:05,710
Today, Se Chan will treat
his six variety show parents...

418
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,710
to celebrate his birthday.
It's Filial Son Yang Se Chan Race.

419
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,250
It's a special episode.

420
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,620
The successful son Se Chan will
receive R money of 1,000 dollars.

421
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,810
(The grown-up son Se Chan will
receive R money of 1,000 dollars.)

422
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,750
(The bills have been specially made
to celebrate Se Chan's birthday.)

423
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,810
Those bills look so tacky.

424
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:24,590
Se Chan, you can give
any of your parents an allowance...

425
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,860
- whenever you want.
- Really?

426
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,920
The tally of the allowances
and the money the parents get...

427
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,270
from the missions will decide
the parents' rankings.

428
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,800
The top 2 will get a prize,
and the bottom 2 will get a penalty.

429
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,300
Se Chan, give me an allowance
before we begin.

430
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,340
(The allowance that Se Chan gives
will play a big part.)

431
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,240
Please wait a little while, Mom.

432
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,350
Se Chan, you'll be exempt
from a penalty...

433
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,070
- since you're the birthday boy.
- Oh, I won't get a penalty?

434
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,140
- I'm jealous.
- But the money you have left...

435
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,590
at the end will decide
the prize you'll receive.

436
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,020
- The money I have left?
- The more money, the better prize.

437
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,760
- Try to save as much as you can.
- I see.

438
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,260
Se Chan, you can choose the parents
to team up with before each mission.

439
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,290
- Before the mission?
- Yes.

440
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,420
Will I get some information
about the mission?

441
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,650
- Yes.
- Right. Got it.

442
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,020
Also, after each mission,
we'll give you lottery tickets...

443
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,500
with different chances of winning.

444
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,430
You may win 200 dollars
if you win the lottery.

445
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,900
(The odds of winning are different
according to their rankings.)

446
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,710
(If all 3 faces are the same,
they win 200 dollars.)

447
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,070
In brief, you can get money...

448
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,770
- by winning the lottery...
- Yes.

449
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,440
- Or I give you an allowance.
- I see. Okay.

450
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,140
There's one more way
to get more money.

451
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,170
If you get upset at your son...

452
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,220
or if you need more money...

453
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,310
- On the notepad in the mission bag,
- Yes.

454
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:32,860
you can write five bad things
about your son Se Chan...

455
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,320
(If they hand in a note
with 5 bad things about Se Chan...)

456
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,730
and hand it in to the cameraman,
and you'll get a lottery ticket.

457
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,030
- Oh, okay. Got it.
- What?

458
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,390
- What if I catch them?
- There are no bad things about him.

459
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,530
Will there be a disadvantage?

460
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,740
No, but you probably won't give
that person a lot of money.

461
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,900
I can write
more than five things, right?

462
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,250
- Five will be enough.
- I can think of ten things now.

463
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,350
He already thought of doing it.

464
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,210
- It started already? Okay.
- Why would you talk badly of him?

465
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,750
- Any trivial things would work.
- Okay.

466
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,310
If I get about 50 lottery tickets...

467
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,280
- You'll write 250 bad things?
- I'll win a few times...

468
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,460
if I get 50 lottery tickets.

469
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,630
The parents that Se Chan chose will
receive 50 dollars now.

470
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,790
(Jong Kook and Haha got 50 dollars
as they were chosen by Se Chan.)

471
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,020
Come on. Take the money. It's yours.

472
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,790
- How can I take your money?
- I can't spend this money.

473
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,700
- Gosh. I'm so upset.
- Thank you.

474
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,410
Also, Se Chan will choose
the penalty as the birthday boy.

475
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,970
- I'll choose the penalty?
- That's great.

476
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,410
- I'm worried.
- I'll pick one that's a hassle.

477
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,410
Choose something
that's done at once.

478
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,300
Since you're all here,
we'll begin the first mission.

479
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,450
- Yes.
- Okay.

480
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,650
The first mission is a simple game.

481
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,990
It's a heartwarming game
that Se Chan...

482
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,190
and his parents who are like
his friends can enjoy together.

483
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,050
It's Head Smack Mafia Game.

484
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,260
- What game is it?
- Head Smack Mafia Game?

485
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,290
In this game,
Se Chan will play individually.

486
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,400
- By myself? Okay.
- Yes.

487
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,620
- It's a match between four teams.
- I see.

488
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,590
All seven of you can play the game
at the same time.

489
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,130
The mafia will be chosen randomly.

490
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,440
Next, you will put on a blindfold,
and only the mafia will take it off.

491
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,680
The mafia will hit the back
of the head of one citizen...

492
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,710
except for the one
on his or her team.

493
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,770
(The mafia hits the back
of a citizen's head.)

494
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,070
(The mafia will hit the back
of the head.)

495
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,720
If the citizens find the mafia,
they get a point.

496
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,810
- If they fail, the mafia wins.
- Got it.

497
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,520
The mafia can't hit the person
on his or her team.

498
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,700
And if you're on the mafia's team,
you have to help the mafia...

499
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,700
because it's a team game.

500
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,430
I have a feeling
that I will get hit.

501
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,130
There's only one note
with "Mafia" written on it.

502
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,270
- There's only one mafia?
- Yes.

503
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,800
Check if you're the mafia or not,
and then put on a blindfold.

504
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,910
I want to be the mafia.

505
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Me too.

506
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,980
I'll just hit hard
since anyone will know it's me.

507
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,010
- That doesn't matter.
- I'm sure...

508
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,610
I'll know that it's Jong Kook
if he hits me.

509
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,680
Right. It'll be obvious.

510
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,580
- We'll get a chance to pay back.
- That'd be great.

511
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,420
That's possible
since there will be three rounds.

512
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,660
Here are blindfolds for you.

513
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,460
Now, let's...

514
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,160
Should I take it off?

515
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,260
(Snorting)

516
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,760
You should put it on.

517
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,320
- He said he'd take it off.
- I mean...

518
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,430
(He said he'd take it off
even before he put it on.)

519
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,500
Why...

520
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,240
He said, "Should I take it off?"

521
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,710
- What is wrong with you?
- He's always distracted on set.

522
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,870
Please start walking in place.

523
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,150
(Head Smack Mafia Game begins
as they start walking in place.)

524
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,880
Mafia, take off
your blindfold quietly...

525
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,050
and hit one of the citizens.

526
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,850
- I think that we may...
- I have a good feeling.

527
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,320
- The back of my head.
- I don't hear So Min walking.

528
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,020
- I'm here.
- Mafia, you can move now.

529
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,170
(The mafia is moving quietly
among the blindfolded citizens.)

530
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,560
(And...)

531
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,560
(The mafia stopped behind someone.)

532
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,250
(Hitting hard)

533
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,720
(The mafia chose Jong Kook.)

534
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,650
- I'm 100 percent sure who that was.
- You can take off your blindfold.

535
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,610
I'm 100 percent sure.

536
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,310
- Did the mafia hit someone already?
- I know who it was.

537
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,050
- I heard a loud bang.
- Exactly.

538
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,050
I'm 100 percent sure who it was.

539
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,280
I heard the noise too.

540
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,580
- It was quite loud.
- Indeed. I heard that too.

541
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,290
I'm 100 percent sure.

542
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,730
- The sound... You know who it was?
- I'm 100 percent sure.

543
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,320
- The feeling...
- Someone on this side.

544
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,900
- Could you tell whose hand it was?
- Yes. I could tell.

545
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,700
- On this side?
- Who was it? Who got hit?

546
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,770
- Why do you think so?
- What?

547
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,240
- I got hit.
- Oh, it was you?

548
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,100
- I heard the noise.
- It was so loud.

549
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,600
- It was loud.
- I thought a watermelon was broken.

550
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,180
Now, start guessing
who the mafia is.

551
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,570
- Hey, why on this side?
- Why is that?

552
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,650
- It came from this side.
- Why?

553
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,040
I felt someone approaching me.

554
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,250
I thought, "Someone is coming."
Then I got hit.

555
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,420
- No. Listen to me.
- But...

556
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,520
- the mafia could've come this way.
- That's possible, but...

557
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,460
The mafia could've stopped here
to hit you.

558
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,580
But I started feeling the presence
from a distance.

559
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,320
- I guess it was you.
- Was it Jae Suk?

560
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,660
- I'm sure it was him.
- I felt that person approaching.

561
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,590
- No. It wasn't me, obviously.
- What?

562
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,170
I think that it was him.

563
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,520
- Let me see your hand.
- No, it wasn't me.

564
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,670
- Your palm is red.
- It was really loud.

565
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,240
- No.
- Especially your fingertips.

566
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,470
- You're wrong.
- Look.

567
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,300
I'm sure it felt different
from my hand.

568
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,130
When it hit my head... Wait.
It feels different.

569
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,240
Right?

570
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,800
- See? I told you so.
- Put yours on my head.

571
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,250
Put it on my head.

572
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,300
(Detective Kim began
an investigation.)

573
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,450
- Put your hand on my head.
- Here.

574
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,810
A little higher.

575
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,310
- Oh, that's where you got hit.
- You punk.

576
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,690
You punk.

577
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,580
Me? What makes you think it was me?

578
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,850
Jong Kook, it wasn't me.

579
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,760
- Trust me. I'm a citizen.
- It's you, right?

580
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,460
- Jong Kook, I didn't hit you.
- That's shocking.

581
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,550
- How could you hit your father?
- Hold on a second.

582
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,500
- I could never do that.
- Hang on.

583
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,430
- It should be on the news.
- I can't make my footsteps silent.

584
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,670
How could you hit your own father?

585
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,130
Since I compared how it felt
when their hands touched my head,

586
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,630
- I realized it was this punk.
- No.

587
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,270
- It wasn't me. Trust me.
- What?

588
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,910
- I would never have...
- It was definitely him.

589
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,870
- dared to hit him. No way.
- Hang on.

590
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,100
- I'm not stupid.
- It was him. I'm sure of it.

591
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,770
Jong Kook, listen.
Here's what I think.

592
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,080
Before I heard the smacking noise,

593
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,250
I heard something falling off.

594
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,610
I must've spoiled you.
Enough, you brat!

595
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,080
- I heard glasses falling off.
- How could you?

596
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,460
You said he came from your left.
So it was 1 of these 2.

597
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,200
- It was one of them.
- No.

598
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,230
Well, actually... I don't know.

599
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,700
- Jae Suk is suspicious too.
- Come on.

600
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,000
- He was closest to Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook, it must've been him.

601
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,560
- And I heard the rattling sound...
- Jae Suk must be the one.

602
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,100
- from his glasses.
- Really?

603
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,240
- No, I'm not the one.
- I heard him taking it off.

604
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,410
- And Jong Kook.
- I was standing next to you, but...

605
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,740
- I heard him taking it off.
- Wait.

606
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,870
- You sounded suspicious.
- I was...

607
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,450
- Hold on.
- He got caught.

608
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,450
I'm a citizen.

609
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,340
It's possible that it was him.
Do you want to hear what I think?

610
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,380
- I'm a citizen.
- Okay.

611
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,150
- You see, Jae Suk...
- He asked for his permission.

612
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,810
- can't see without his glasses.
- True.

613
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,050
So he probably had no choice
but to hit the one next to him.

614
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,620
- When I got hit, it felt...
- Suk Jin.

615
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,160
- It felt...
- See? Guess who it was.

616
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,350
Guess who it was.

617
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,700
Who hit you?

618
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,620
There's no way
you can figure it out.

619
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,120
I'm sure that it was
1 of the 2 of them.

620
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,560
- It's hard to tell.
- It felt...

621
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,000
I have no idea.

622
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,740
Actually, to be honest...

623
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,130
- Was the hand thick?
- No, it wasn't.

624
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,440
- Then it was 1 of the 2 girls.
- It might've been Ji Hyo.

625
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,100
- Jong Kook.
- It was either Ji Hyo or...

626
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,540
- It felt...
- Let them touch your head too.

627
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,680
- The back of your head.
- Right. Her hand...

628
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,250
Wait. Open your hand.

629
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
Put it on my head.

630
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,040
- Ji Hyo can hit hard.
- I think it was her.

631
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,380
- Ji Hyo can hit hard.
- She's quite strong.

632
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,580
Jong Kook, listen to me.

633
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,760
- I only heard the hitting sound.
- Okay.

634
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,120
- And that sound...
- The smacking sound.

635
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,160
It was loud.

636
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,560
(It was a sharp, clear
smacking sound.)

637
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,900
It didn't sound like a big hand.

638
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,290
I know. It was a small hand.

639
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,590
- Do you see what I mean?
- I have big hands.

640
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,000
I put your hands on my head, right?

641
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,670
- Yes.
- Yours were bigger than I thought.

642
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,710
- My hand...
- It didn't sound like a big hand.

643
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,870
- It was smaller than a man's hand.
- I have big hands too.

644
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,030
- Right. This wasn't it.
- You see...

645
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,600
It didn't sound like someone
with big hands hit you.

646
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,650
- Gosh, this punk.
- Why do you keep suspecting me?

647
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,180
- Why only me?
- Let me think.

648
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,480
- Why did you tilt your head?
- Hold on.

649
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,420
- My hands are bigger than average.
- I need to point something out.

650
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,380
Someone on this side came
and hit the left side of my head?

651
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,960
- That'd be too predictable.
- True.

652
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,320
But maybe the mafia wanted me
to think that way.

653
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,190
- He would've stopped on that side.
- I think it was one on this side.

654
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,700
- That's what I said.
- Jong Kook.

655
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,200
- It was a small hand. I'm sure...
- I told you so.

656
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,060
- that it was a small hand.
- I'll be honest with you.

657
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,670
- Ji Hyo has the smallest hands.
- I honestly think it was Ji Hyo.

658
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,500
- What's suspicious is...
- Jong Kook, listen.

659
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,970
- So Min or Ji Hyo.
- Gosh. I'm not...

660
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,100
- She's acting.
- I mean, Ji Hyo or Se Chan.

661
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,300
- Gosh. I told you it wasn't me.
- So Min is suspicious too.

662
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,300
Right. So Min.

663
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,910
- Let me see your hand.
- It's So Min or Se Chan.

664
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,180
I'm absolutely not the one.

665
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,110
Her hand feels similar too.

666
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,840
- Really? I have thin hands.
- Yes.

667
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,810
- But think about this. So Min...
- Yes.

668
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,550
- is wearing perfume.
- Oh, right.

669
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,990
- So if she swung her arm here,
- I guess I should be careful.

670
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,550
- and hit the back of your head...
- I would've smelled it.

671
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,160
But you didn't, did you?

672
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,590
Hear me out, Jong Kook.
I saw something.

673
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,790
When I took off my blindfold,
So Min's face was so red.

674
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,940
So I thought that it was So Min.

675
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,270
What's with that look on her face?

676
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,670
- She's the last to take it off.
- I thought it was So Min.

677
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,240
That's not true.
I took it off right away.

678
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,770
So Min, if you are a citizen,

679
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,510
you must not do anything suspicious.

680
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,910
- He's right.
- Can you prove your innocence?

681
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,810
- You can't fake blushing.
- I'm not the mafia.

682
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,370
- Are you the mafia?
- No, I'm not.

683
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,750
- Then what are you?
- I'm a citizen.

684
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,310
- Did you see the word on the note?
- Yes.

685
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,490
- Show us.
- Show us.

686
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,050
I don't have it now.
I put it back in the box.

687
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,660
Even if you didn't smell it,
I could've smelled it.

688
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,690
True.

689
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,230
- But you didn't smell it.
- No.

690
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,000
Why is he saying this?

691
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,230
- You're the mafia. That's why.
- What?

692
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,830
- Jae Suk smelled So Min's perfume.
- Right.

693
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,590
- Right?
- How?

694
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,940
- He smelled it, but he lied...
- Because she's on his team...

695
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,530
- because she was on his team.
- Exactly.

696
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,240
- That's why he defended her.
- That's right.

697
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,910
- He wouldn't have said it...
- It might not be true.

698
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,570
- if he could smell it.
- True.

699
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,040
I might have smelled her perfume,
you know.

700
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,980
- That's true.
- Would I have smelled it?

701
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,220
So Min, come here
and hit him lightly.

702
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,380
- Come and hit him.
- If she came...

703
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,190
- Where?
- On this side.

704
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,280
See if you can smell her perfume.

705
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,190
- How?
- Just hit me.

706
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,880
- Should I hit him hard?
- The scent is quite strong.

707
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,400
See? You would've smelled it.
Her perfume has a unique scent.

708
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,770
- So it wasn't her.
- I see now. You're right.

709
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,500
It has a unique scent.
You smelled it too, right?

710
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,790
- You can still smell it.
- You're right.

711
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,830
(You can't smell her perfume there.)

712
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,100
- You can still smell it.
- You're right.

713
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,300
- Maybe he's not sensitive to...
- You can't smell it there.

714
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,480
- It would be weird if you can.
- What is he doing?

715
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,310
- What are you doing, Suk Jin?
- Suk Jin.

716
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,450
What are you doing?

717
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,840
- So Min...
- Why would you smell your wrist?

718
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,990
- That's creepy.
- I wondered...

719
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,280
- if my cologne had a strong scent.
- That's so creepy.

720
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,310
- What are you doing?
- I'm just checking.

721
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,230
- But given the situation,
- Yes.

722
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,380
it'd be the funniest
if he was the one that hit me...

723
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,930
- You're right.
- because he chose me as his parent.

724
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,400
- He hit his own father.
- He came up to me and hit me.

725
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,560
- If he was the one...
- I told you it wasn't me.

726
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,130
- Let him hit you again.
- It wasn't me.

727
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,200
Hit him one more time.

728
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,900
See if it was him.

729
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,910
- You want me to hit him?
- Yes. He'll know...

730
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,910
- if he gets hit again.
- How hard did you hit him?

731
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,130
I can't hit him.
Don't be ridiculous.

732
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,710
- Go ahead and hit him.
- Where?

733
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,870
- Here?
- Yes, here.

734
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,300
- Hit there.
- Hit him.

735
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,150
- He'll see if it feels the same.
- Go ahead.

736
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,040
You punk.

737
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,950
It was him. I'm sure of it.

738
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,750
- That's the sound I heard.
- It was him.

739
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,280
- That's the sound I heard.
- I heard it. It sounded the same.

740
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,050
- I can assure you.
- It was him.

741
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,190
- You can hit me, but it wasn't me.
- I'm sure it was him.

742
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,280
I'm not the mafia.

743
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,790
- That was the same sound.
- The mafia must be excited now.

744
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,820
Because I'm not the mafia.

745
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,660
It's either So Min or Se Chan.

746
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,770
But I didn't hear
Ji Hyo's footsteps.

747
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,060
I could hear my own footsteps.
Why couldn't you hear it?

748
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,590
That sounds suspicious,
don't you think?

749
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,300
- Look at her face. She's not lying.
- I'm really not the mafia.

750
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,070
Gosh. I said it wasn't me!

751
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,210
- Now, let's begin the voting.
- It's Se Chan.

752
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,910
- One.
- It's Se Chan.

753
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,480
- Two.
- Yes, Jae Suk.

754
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,070
I'm not the mafia. Trust me.

755
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,080
I think you should go with your gut.

756
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,280
- In 1, 2, 3. Point at the mafia.
- I think it's Se Chan.

757
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,490
- No, it's not me.
- Point at the mafia.

758
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,190
(Everyone voted for Se Chan.)

759
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,850
All right. You chose Se Chan.

760
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:31,960
- He must be the one.
- I said I wasn't.

761
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,550
- I'm sure he's the one.
- The decision has been made.

762
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,400
- It's not me.
- But Ji Hyo...

763
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,700
- Now,
- I'm really not the mafia.

764
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,770
I'll tell you
if Se Chan is the mafia.

765
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,900
He must be.

766
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,060
Se Chan is...

767
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,830
(Who is the mafia
that hit Jong Kook in the head?)

768
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:06,490
(Se Chan is...)

769
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,160
- not the mafia.
- I told you so.

770
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,900
(Se Chan turned out
not to be the mafia.)

771
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,930
- Who was it?
- It must be Ji Hyo.

772
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,000
The mafia who scored a point is...

773
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,140
- Could it be Jae Suk?
- No, it's not me.

774
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,610
- I think it's Jae Suk.
- It's not me.

775
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,900
(The mafia is...)

776
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,940
It was So Min.
So Min and Jae Suk won a point.

777
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,020
- See?
- I told you so.

778
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,480
- What did I tell you?
- I told you so.

779
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,940
It was So Min.

780
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,820
(She finally smiles.)

781
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,150
I said he was defending her
because she was on his team.

782
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,680
- I was so afraid.
- I knew it was you.

783
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,060
- I was worried.
- I knew it.

784
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,300
I was so afraid I might get caught.

785
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,300
(The scaredy-cat mafia So Min
who successfully survived...)

786
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,310
(She boldly chose Detective Kim
who's good at guessing.)

787
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,670
(Should I really hit him?)

788
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,910
(She was lucky enough
not to get caught by Jong Kook.)

789
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,410
What I said was right.
Jae Suk smelled her perfume...

790
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,180
- I was so afraid.
- It's amazing that he smelled it.

791
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,490
- You see...
- I mean I smelled her perfume.

792
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,490
Listen.

793
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,300
- When she hit me,
- Yes.

794
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,130
- I knew it wasn't a man.
- What a shame.

795
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,190
- See? It wasn't me, right?
- Wait.

796
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,100
I was wrong. Ji Hyo hits
like a man does.

797
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,610
- My gosh. I smelled it...
- Jae Suk saved her.

798
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,670
I saved her.

799
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,310
- We almost got her.
- That was great.

800
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,050
- I saved So Min.
- I want to be the mafia.

801
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,580
Can you play
the marching band music?

802
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,940
- Right. Play some music for us.
- Yes, play it for us.

803
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,140
- Play the marching band music.
- Play some music for us.

804
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,240
- It'll be more difficult though.
- I had to walk so carefully.

805
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,350
- It'll be more difficult.
- Indeed.

806
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,590
- Put on the blindfold.
- Get further away from one another.

807
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,620
If they have good hearing.

808
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,630
(Who could be the mafia
for Round 2?)

809
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,180
- This is better.
- It's hard to guess.

810
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,530
Right. This is good.

811
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,890
Now, Mafia...

812
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,900
Please take off your blindfold
and hit one citizen hard.

813
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,170
(The mafia took off the blindfold
and quietly moved.)

814
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:59,080
(And then the mafia stopped
behind someone.)

815
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,850
(Hitting hard)

816
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,240
(Grunting)

817
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,890
Can we take the blindfold off?

818
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,860
(The 2nd victim is Mr. Ji
who lives in Seocho-gu.)

819
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:16,420
(The criminal is hiding
among the citizens.)

820
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,190
You may take off your blindfold now.

821
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,390
(Mr. Ji, the victim, seems
very shocked.)

822
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,300
(It's time to find the criminal.)

823
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,430
- Who got hit?
- Look at him.

824
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,500
- Was it Suk Jin?
- Suk Jin?

825
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,570
He got hit really hard.

826
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,230
I could hear the noise over there.

827
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,400
It was loud.

828
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,170
- What was that? Wait.
- I could hear the noise over there.

829
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,520
I got so surprised.

830
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,670
- Seriously.
- That startled me.

831
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,050
I was so surprised.

832
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,620
- He got hit really hard.
- It was so loud.

833
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,520
It hurt so much that I laughed.

834
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,590
(It hurt so much that I laughed.)

835
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,490
I don't know why, but I laughed.
I got hit so hard...

836
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,330
that it felt like
my eyes would pop out.

837
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,160
Suk Jin, who hit you?

838
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,370
- The arm wasn't swung like this.
- Then how?

839
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,690
- It moved like this.
- Vertically?

840
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,570
Really? Then I guess
it wasn't a man.

841
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,200
- I'm sure it moved vertically.
- I see.

842
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,580
As if the mafia was taking
his or her parents' revenge on me.

843
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,610
(As if the mafia was taking
his or her parents' revenge on me.)

844
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:05,400
- It was loud. I was taken aback.
- Suk Jin.

845
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,740
- I see what you mean.
- I think it was him.

846
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,240
- Why?
- When he told us to take it off,

847
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,050
- he was walking in place behind us.
- Yes.

848
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,350
He tried to hide his identity.

849
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,150
- Gosh, seriously.
- And based on how hard he hit me,

850
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,330
- he wanted to make it look funny.
- It was a man?

851
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,330
- Are you serious?
- Was it skillful?

852
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,750
- Yes, it felt skillful.
- Besides,

853
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,100
- Jae Suk...
- I'm sure it was him.

854
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,330
When we all took off our blindfolds,
I saw him standing behind us...

855
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,570
- He couldn't help it.
- He tried to hold back laughter.

856
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,960
- I bet he was satisfied.
- He couldn't seem to stop it.

857
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,040
- Hey.
- He's mistaken.

858
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,430
- You tried to make it look funny.
- It was him.

859
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,430
- I'm sure of it.
- That's not true.

860
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,670
- He looked like this.
- He knew it'd look funny.

861
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,170
- He was satisfied.
- It was him.

862
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,400
- Let me explain.
- That's funny.

863
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,700
- I...
- Why did you laugh?

864
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,620
- I heard the noise.
- Yes.

865
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,350
And it was so funny.

866
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,620
- It wasn't the sound.
- It was so funny...

867
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,320
- Is Jae Suk the mafia?
- That can't explain the laughter.

868
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,980
- I'll tell you why I laughed.
- It was the motion that was funny.

869
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,710
- I knew Suk Jin was hit.
- It must be Jae Suk.

870
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,330
I think that it could be Se Chan.

871
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,330
- It might sound suspicious,
- Okay.

872
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,690
- but I'm definitely not the mafia.
- Yes, you're suspicious.

873
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,220
- I think...
- I was too far away from you.

874
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,370
- I was standing here.
- I see.

875
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,770
Guys, I want you
to think about this.

876
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,900
The staff gave the mafia
a longer time in this round.

877
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,000
Suk Jin, that means...

878
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,700
I'm sorry to say this.
Although he's on my team,

879
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,780
Right.

880
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,140
he was quite far away from him.
I'm not saying it was Haha.

881
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,620
But the mafia had to walk slowly
not to get caught.

882
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,210
- He could be the mafia too.
- Absolutely.

883
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,820
- He could be the mafia.
- It took longer this time.

884
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,520
But that's why it could be Se Chan.

885
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,680
- I think it's Se Chan.
- Me again?

886
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,750
- I'm serious.
- He was right next to Suk Jin.

887
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,330
- I'm not the mafia.
- Because he was close to Suk Jin?

888
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,650
- Hey, are you just trying to...
- Then choose me.

889
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,060
- escape the suspicion...
- I'm not the mafia.

890
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,600
- By the way...
- I don't know who it was...

891
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,490
Whoever it was...
Although it was very funny...

892
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,300
You shouldn't have hit Suk Jin
like that!

893
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,000
- He's the mafia.
- It was him.

894
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,230
(It must be him!)

895
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,370
- It's him.
- Jae Suk!

896
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,780
The corners of his lips...

897
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,470
(The corner of Jae Suk's mouth
kept twitching.)

898
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,170
(He is a member of the mafia.)

899
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,520
(He danced around...)

900
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,320
(thrilled at the thought
of smacking someone.)

901
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,950
(He chose Seok Sam
who's the best punching bag.)

902
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:06,660
(He adjusted his cap to make it seem
like the perfect crime.)

903
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,140
- It's him.
- It has to be him.

904
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,370
- It's him.
- Jae Suk!

905
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,730
- The corners of his lips...
- It isn't me.

906
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,870
- But...
- Don't act suspiciously then.

907
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,430
- Don't act suspiciously.
- I won't.

908
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,280
I would've hit you harder
to make it funnier.

909
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,310
Those who do comedy sketches well
will have hit you hard.

910
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,440
I admit I'd be good at it,

911
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,280
but Jae Suk has done
comedy sketches too.

912
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,670
- He's a master at it.
- Hit me.

913
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,940
- In what way?
- The half of it...

914
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,550
- Do I make it look good?
- Yes.

915
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,820
- It could be him.
- That was off.

916
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,410
- You...
- To make it look good,

917
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,410
- he would've hit you like so.
- Hold on.

918
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,250
- He did the opposite.
- I made it look good.

919
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,480
I said the slap was
in a downward pattern,

920
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,560
but he swung to the side.

921
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,750
- Exactly.
- Should I do it again?

922
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,450
- Go ahead.
- That's what I meant.

923
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,690
- It's Se Chan.
- That's the sound I heard.

924
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,160
- It's Se Chan.
- Tasty, wasn't it?

925
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,660
- You next.
- Do you want me to hit you?

926
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,070
- Hit me right here.
- Sure.

927
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,960
- I'll hit you the best I can then.
- Yes, go ahead.

928
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,400
- That wasn't what I heard.
- He wasn't hit that way.

929
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,000
- I...
- Was it similar?

930
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,940
- He made it seem funny.
- Suk Jin.

931
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,940
He's digging into his memory
for a match.

932
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,350
- Suk Jin.
- He's digging into his memory.

933
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,790
- He...
- He's remembering.

934
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,410
- What's the verdict?
- That's what I tasted.

935
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,950
- Really?
- I'm sure of it.

936
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,750
(Jae Suk got caught
by the slap whisperer.)

937
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,750
- Was this it?
- Are you sure?

938
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,890
- It was him.
- How about another try?

939
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,390
Let Se Chan have a go.

940
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,530
Despite the direction being off...

941
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,630
- Let me have a go at it.
- Go ahead.

942
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,270
- This is how I'd do it.
- Right.

943
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,920
- Like this.
- This is what I heard.

944
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,190
- This was it.
- That's what I heard.

945
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,730
- No, this isn't it.
- Right?

946
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,190
- Right?
- It wasn't him.

947
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,730
I detected the feeling
of the edge of his fingers.

948
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,810
- Suk Jin...
- Let's vote.

949
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,110
- Be more certain about it.
- He's right.

950
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,900
- Yes, that's what I felt.
- Is it?

951
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,310
- His fingers leave an odd feeling.
- Was it on the sweeter side?

952
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,850
But Se Chan made a similar sound.

953
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,320
The snap of the wrist...

954
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,710
- Go ahead.
- Should I smack you with force?

955
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,390
- Yes, with force.
- With full force then.

956
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:38,860
That's the sound I remember.

957
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,720
- I was actually trying...
- Wasn't this what we heard?

958
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,630
- to make the same sound.
- This was it.

959
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,300
- Suk Jin, dig into your memory.
- I made it look good.

960
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,330
- It wasn't him.
- No?

961
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,460
I used the snap of my wrist.

962
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,640
Jae Suk.

963
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,840
- Smack me like you did before.
- Like you mean it.

964
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,960
- Like I mean it?
- Yes.

965
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,610
- Like you'd actually do it.
- I'll hit you like I mean it.

966
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,700
Yes, with feeling.

967
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,140
This wasn't the sound.

968
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,200
(This is what I felt!)

969
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,640
This is what I felt.

970
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,470
- He...
- It was him.

971
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,120
- You'll now vote.
- All right.

972
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,390
- That wasn't what I heard.
- Just do it.

973
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,390
It was Jae Suk.
I swear it wasn't me.

974
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,560
All right.

975
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,290
All right.

976
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,890
In 1, 2, 3.

977
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,450
- It has to be you.
- Se Chan...

978
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,860
(The majority votes for Jae Suk.)

979
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,860
- Do you think it's him?
- He's rushing the vote.

980
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,690
- Is it Se Chan?
- So Min, are you kidding me?

981
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,570
- Do you think it's him?
- He's rushing the vote.

982
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,390
- He's trying to rush it.
- Exactly.

983
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,100
- All right.
- I swear it isn't me.

984
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,340
You really should
think this through.

985
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,370
Se Chan made the exact same sound.

986
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,940
Think carefully, okay?

987
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,500
- The snap of his wrist...
- You're killing me.

988
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,480
- He rushed it.
- Okay, fine.

989
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,540
- I switch to Se Chan.
- What?

990
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,270
- It's not me!
- I choose Se Chan too.

991
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,940
- It's because...
- Really?

992
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,790
- What did I tell you?
- He's being serious right now.

993
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,250
- This is his serious face.
- I mean it.

994
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,290
Really?

995
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,250
- It wasn't me!
- One...

996
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,620
In 1, 2, 3.

997
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,520
- Se Chan.
- It's Jae Suk.

998
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,730
- You chose Se Chan...
- I was chosen both times.

999
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,020
See what I mean?

1000
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,620
Allow me to reveal the truth.

1001
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,960
- He tried to rush the vote.
- Exactly.

1002
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,170
Se Chan...

1003
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,540
- is...
- I don't know.

1004
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,440
- He isn't the mafia.
- What did I tell you?

1005
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,040
- It's him.
- It's Jae Suk.

1006
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,210
- The mafia...
- Is it HaHa?

1007
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,350
- It was Jae Suk.
- I was right.

1008
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,750
- What did I tell you?
- Why did you rush the vote then?

1009
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,920
Seriously?

1010
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,060
(Darn it!)

1011
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,690
I said I felt his hand on my head.

1012
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,150
So why would you choose
Se Chan instead?

1013
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,420
I agree that it was weird.

1014
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,620
- It was weird.
- I know what I felt.

1015
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,020
But at the end, Se Chan...

1016
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,170
- I can't believe it.
- Se Chan made the same sound.

1017
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,900
He stood there looking so innocent.

1018
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,540
I said I felt his hand on my head!

1019
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,270
- But...
- No way.

1020
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,440
- You guys are killing me.
- I get it.

1021
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,870
Here's how you did...

1022
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,770
in the Head Smack Mafia Game.
In first place are...

1023
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,810
Jae Suk and So Min.

1024
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,850
- Nice.
- That's too bad.

1025
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,170
(Jae Suk and So Min
are in 1st place.)

1026
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,040
In second place
are Haha and Jong Kook.

1027
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,080
Okay.

1028
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,960
The remaining three
are tied in third place.

1029
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,580
We'll now hand out scratchcards.

1030
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,080
Those in the first place...

1031
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,020
will be given two cards
and one will lead to a prize.

1032
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,000
One out of three for you
will be the winning card.

1033
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,560
And 1 out of the 4 for you
will be the winning card.

1034
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,900
Jae Suk and So Min
will scratch theirs first.

1035
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,170
Please choose one.

1036
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,810
- Must we only choose one?
- Yes.

1037
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,540
Which one should I choose?

1038
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,170
Which one will you choose?

1039
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,370
(Only one leads
to a prize of 200 dollars.)

1040
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,080
- I'll just have to gamble.
- Here.

1041
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,920
(You might not win any money
even after winning the game.)

1042
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,670
Wait.

1043
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,690
What do we get
if we see Se Chan's face?

1044
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,350
The winning card
will have three of his faces.

1045
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:25,230
- Nice!
- Did you win?

1046
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,650
- Yes, I won.
- Three identical faces.

1047
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,060
Three Se Chan.

1048
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,000
- You win 200 dollars.
- Nice.

1049
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,920
- We need three of his faces.
- Mine's a dud.

1050
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,230
You need three of his faces.

1051
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,440
Mine's a dud.

1052
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,830
So Min's card was a dud.

1053
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,100
Can I have some money?

1054
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,440
Any would do.

1055
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,730
(The variety show wife
begs for money.)

1056
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,830
Are you going to give me some?

1057
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,750
Thanks. Is this 20 dollars?

1058
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,600
Thank you.
Why are you being nice to me though?

1059
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,770
I'll do my best...

1060
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,290
- if we end up on the same team.
- Sure.

1061
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,650
(The runners-up
have a 33-percent chance.)

1062
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,620
- Darn it!
- Is yours a dud?

1063
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,420
Yes, it's a dud.

1064
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,890
- I have Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo, Jae Suk.
- Wait.

1065
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,600
- Hold on a second.
- You need one more.

1066
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,330
- It's his face.
- I can't believe I won.

1067
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,060
- Did you win the prize?
- Yes, I did.

1068
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,500
Congratulations.

1069
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,940
Jong Kook won the prize.

1070
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,500
He beat the odds.

1071
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,270
I'll just choose whatever I want.

1072
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,640
It's not like my chances are great.

1073
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,480
All I have is a 25-percent chance.

1074
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,500
(Those in third place
have a 25-percent chance.)

1075
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,770
- I see Haha's face.
- Mine's a dud.

1076
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:21,710
- Mine's a dud.
- Out of the three...

1077
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,250
Hey, I won the prize!

1078
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,580
- I won the prize.
- Really?

1079
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,920
- Yes, I did.
- Really?

1080
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,580
No way. Take a look.

1081
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,960
I won the prize.

1082
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,330
Congratulations.
Here's your 200 dollars.

1083
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,150
Suk Jin deserves it.

1084
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,330
I actually won.

1085
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,900
I can't believe it.

1086
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,960
We'll add the 200 dollars
to your name.

1087
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,170
The money from Se Chan
should be received in person.

1088
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,870
We'll regroup after you get changed.

1089
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,170
(Time to change outfits)

1090
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:55,120
(A space stocked with ingredients)

1091
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,190
- What's all this?
- What is this?

1092
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,120
What is this place?

1093
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,480
Is a chef meeting us here?

1094
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,060
So Min, get away from me.

1095
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,150
- I'm not giving her any money.
- Why?

1096
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,350
I saw her writing down my flaws.

1097
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,520
That's absurd!

1098
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,960
I saw you just now.

1099
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,330
- I did no such thing.
- I'm done being nice to you today.

1100
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,170
- You won't get anything from me.
- What happened?

1101
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,770
She was writing down my flaws
to gain a scratchcard.

1102
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,690
It's not like
she was trying to hide it.

1103
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,370
She wrote them down
while I was looking.

1104
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,040
- That's not the case.
- I peeked at what she was doing.

1105
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,670
- Is that what she was doing?
- Yes.

1106
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,080
Were you writing down his flaws?

1107
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,210
- You...
- Unbelievable.

1108
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,310
- But...
- You could've at least hid it.

1109
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,520
- While I was looking?
- Ji Hyo, he got it wrong.

1110
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,650
Doesn't he look cute today?

1111
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,710
His teeth look bigger than ever.

1112
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,790
(Tactless)

1113
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,310
- Oddly enough...
- His teeth?

1114
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,460
Here you go.

1115
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,460
Goodness.

1116
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,230
- Here.
- My gosh.

1117
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,230
- Hold on.
- While everyone's looking.

1118
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,650
You're the sweetest!

1119
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,690
Is it time for a meal?

1120
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,100
Come and get your pocket money too.

1121
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,900
- Goodness, my sweet boy.
- How devoted is this?

1122
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,790
- No way.
- Goodness, my sweet boy.

1123
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,670
- How devoted is this?
- As if this is of any use.

1124
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,810
You...

1125
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,270
There.

1126
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,230
Wait a second.

1127
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,400
I'm going to make you wait.

1128
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,870
- He's sweet and generous.
- My sweet boy.

1129
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,750
Why did you give us a notepad...

1130
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,310
where there are no flaws
to write down?

1131
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,390
- Se Chan, my goodness.
- He has no flaws.

1132
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:07,810
Isn't he a devoted son?

1133
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,310
I should write down five flaws.

1134
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,560
You only need five, right?

1135
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,460
Suk Jin, today...

1136
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,750
- If you write down my flaws...
- Unhygienic.

1137
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,460
You can say goodbye
to the pocket money today.

1138
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,870
- What?
- I won't give you any money.

1139
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,960
Fine, go ahead.

1140
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,290
He's ugly.

1141
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,940
While I'm here? Okay, fine.

1142
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,730
(He talks smack about his son
just to get another scratchcard.)

1143
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:27,900
Goodness.

1144
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,140
Come on in.

1145
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,270
Now I know who to thank this week.

1146
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,980
(He easily detects
product placement.)

1147
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,080
Welcome!

1148
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,250
- Giddy-up!
- Giddy-up!

1149
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,310
(Giddy-up!)

1150
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,540
- Giddy-up.
- Giddy-up!

1151
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,290
Their coffee tastes great though.

1152
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,060
No one drinks
the S brand these days.

1153
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,750
- What?
- I do.

1154
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,560
Please edit that out for me.

1155
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,600
- Please edit that out.
- It's too big of an enterprise.

1156
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:49,960
He has a weird way
of showing loyalty.

1157
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,290
(Seok Sam throws out words without
considering the consequences.)

1158
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,960
It can't be a birthday
without a proper birthday meal.

1159
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,330
(A birthday needs
a proper birthday meal.)

1160
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:00,370
The variety show parents
will pour their love...

1161
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,710
into a birthday meal
for their son...

1162
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,170
- and enjoy the food with him.
- A birthday meal?

1163
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,670
You will find seaweed
for seaweed soup,

1164
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,080
lobster, bulgogi, and many more.

1165
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,150
- Nice.
- Also,

1166
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,850
- there is hairtail...
- That's my favorite.

1167
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:16,290
Yesterday at a Chinese restaurant,

1168
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,390
- Suk Jin had his fill.
- I surely did.

1169
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,750
He says he doesn't have an appetite.

1170
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,080
- Who? Suk Jin?
- Yes.

1171
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,960
It's been a while
since I visited my in-laws,

1172
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,330
so I enjoyed a feast.

1173
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,330
You should see them often,
not once in a while.

1174
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,100
Once in every two years
clearly isn't enough.

1175
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,040
Once in every two years
isn't enough.

1176
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,400
- Has it been a while?
- You should at least...

1177
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,600
- visit them...
- Hold on a second.

1178
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,540
Of course, I visit them more often.

1179
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,900
Just count the holidays
we have in one year.

1180
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,210
Why don't you visit
your in-laws often?

1181
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,400
I don't appreciate you
spreading lies.

1182
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,980
His Dad-in-law and Mom-in-law...

1183
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,290
- Daddy-in-law.
- Mommy-in-law.

1184
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,420
Dad-in-law.

1185
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:49,250
Anyway, his in-laws
greeted him with love.

1186
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,150
And I took them out
for a delicious meal.

1187
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,480
They adore their son-in-law.

1188
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,960
That's sweet of you.

1189
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,350
Along with Husband Ji,

1190
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,100
please go ahead
and cook a birthday meal.

1191
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,330
Should I cook as well?

1192
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,400
That's up to you.

1193
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,960
You can share the money you have.

1194
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,400
The others can cash in his flaws
for another scratchcard.

1195
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,440
- I see.
- What would you like to eat?

1196
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,670
- More so than anything,
- Yes?

1197
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,980
I would like to talk to
Ms. Geum Bo Ra.

1198
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,310
I've been enjoying
the TV show you're on.

1199
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,670
I see. Thank you.

1200
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,620
Could you perhaps
cook seaweed soup for me?

1201
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,750
Is that what you want?

1202
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,850
- Seaweed soup.
- Of course.

1203
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,390
- Could you cook it?
- Seaweed soup.

1204
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,750
Aren't you sick and tired
of eating seaweed soup every year?

1205
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,960
Of course.

1206
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:28,420
(Then what should we have?)

1207
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,020
- What else should I have?
- What about ramyeon?

1208
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,620
- What?
- What about ramyeon?

1209
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,830
Are you suggesting ramyeon?

1210
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,870
- But...
- For all of us?

1211
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,230
Yes, let's have ramyeon!

1212
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,040
We have seaweed soup every year.

1213
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,400
- Aren't you sick of it?
- You want to break the mold?

1214
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,100
Yes, we should.

1215
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:43,000
All right, then.
Let's microwave instant rice.

1216
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,040
Let's have ramyeon.

1217
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,580
- Let's have a cup ramyeon.
- It's because...

1218
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,540
- I said I wanted seaweed soup.
- No.

1219
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,350
- Why would you want ramyeon?
- Seaweed soup won't take that long.

1220
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,980
- What's your favorite dish?
- Grilled hairtail.

1221
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,080
I'm good at grilling it.
I like grilled hairtail.

1222
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,460
- Grilled hairtail?
- It's too difficult.

1223
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,580
That's too troublesome.
It'll smell also.

1224
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,290
It's too difficult.

1225
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,460
- It's too troublesome to grill it.
- It'll smell.

1226
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,560
- It's too troublesome.
- It'll smell.

1227
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,520
(As they're strongly against it...)

1228
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,520
- It'll smell.
- It's too difficult.

1229
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,190
- You have to debone it too.
- It's too difficult.

1230
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,330
I can take ramyeon. It depends on
what you put in the ramyeon.

1231
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,940
- All right, then. I will...
- You just need to grill it.

1232
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,140
- I think the lobsters...
- I'll cook rice for you.

1233
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,980
- It looks like they're alive.
- Do you really want seaweed soup?

1234
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,310
- What will you make for me?
- Do you want seaweed soup?

1235
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,900
- Release them. They're pitiful.
- I want seaweed soup.

1236
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,080
But making japchae is simple.

1237
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,120
- Then I want japchae.
- Japchae?

1238
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,650
- I like japchae.
- You do?

1239
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,020
- I want japchae.
- Okay, got it.

1240
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,420
- So Min, can we make japchae?
- We can microwave instant curry.

1241
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,120
It'll take too long.
We need to soak the noodles.

1242
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,390
- It takes long?
- Yes.

1243
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,390
- Wait, Jae Suk.
- It takes long?

1244
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,020
- We can't make japchae.
- We can't make japchae.

1245
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,830
- Japchae takes too long.
- I'll make egg fried rice.

1246
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,330
- Hold on, Se Chan.
- I don't want that.

1247
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,290
- Se Chan.
- Let's just have beef.

1248
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,040
- Let's grill some meat.
- We can do that,

1249
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,640
- Let's have beef.
- but please season it.

1250
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,960
- Se Chan.
- You can dip it in salt.

1251
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,270
Soothe your stomach
with this for now.

1252
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,830
Ediya coffee on an empty stomach?

1253
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,270
Of course. I should boost my energy.

1254
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,750
Let's have Ediya coffee
on an empty stomach!

1255
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,710
- Giddy-up!
- Giddy-up!

1256
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,770
(Na Eun's dad's way
to calm down a sulky child.)

1257
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:57,120
Let's grill beef.

1258
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,750
- You should grill beef.
- You should.

1259
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,020
So Min, what will you make?

1260
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,480
Since there are many soups,

1261
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,650
I'll make egg fried rice
we can have as a side dish.

1262
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,460
- I'm making egg fried rice.
- Who is making ramyeon?

1263
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,620
I'll make it.

1264
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,190
All right. Jae Suk is good at it.

1265
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,460
I'm having ramyeon in the end.

1266
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,520
(I'm having ramyeon in the end.)

1267
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,730
- Must I wear gloves?
- Still, it's my birthday,

1268
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,400
so please add something
in the ramyeon.

1269
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,710
- They can make green onion oil...
- If you add too many things,

1270
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,270
- it'll not be tasty.
- Plain ramyeon is the best.

1271
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:24,810
Doesn't this look more delicious?

1272
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,600
How is this a birthday meal?

1273
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,250
You know how to make seaweed soup?

1274
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,580
Of course. I can make seaweed soup.

1275
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,980
This is top-quality beef.

1276
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,690
It's of good quality, isn't it?

1277
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:39,690
- Let me try it like a taster.
- It's heartwarming though.

1278
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:42,650
- They're all cooking for you.
- If you add too many things,

1279
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,790
it'll not be tasty.

1280
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,690
Ji Hyo knows how to cook it.

1281
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,440
- Come on, Suk Jin.
- You're making seaweed soup.

1282
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,190
Once, I didn't soak seaweed
when making seaweed soup,

1283
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,960
and it swelled
like a volcano explosion.

1284
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,310
- It swells a lot.
- The seaweed opened the lid itself.

1285
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,000
I'm sorry, but I'm really curious.

1286
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,350
Why are you just walking around
after wearing a mask and gloves?

1287
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,940
Because his hands were cold.

1288
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,270
(Taking a walk around the kitchen)

1289
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,520
- I'm so dumbfounded.
- It's because I have nothing to do.

1290
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:05,850
- What do you mean?
- Everyone is working on something.

1291
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:06,890
What am I supposed to do?

1292
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,810
- My fathers... Here.
- Oh, my!

1293
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,350
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1294
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,890
- You're so nice to us.
- Seriously.

1295
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,350
He's so nice. He's such a good son.

1296
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:18,020
- No, put it up there. Thank you.
- I'll put it in here.

1297
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,170
- There.
- Excuse me.

1298
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,400
- He's such a good son.
- Thank you.

1299
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,670
He's a good son.

1300
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:25,330
I can't stand someone
leisurely walking around...

1301
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,540
- with gloves on.
- He's such a good son.

1302
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,600
Sir, go and wash your face.

1303
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,330
Suk Jin. Can you make
zucchini jeon?

1304
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,980
- You want zucchini jeon?
- Yes.

1305
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,000
(He gives work to the old man
who's walking about.)

1306
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,310
Gosh, why would you want jeon?

1307
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:40,750
It's a birthday meal.
There should be some sort of jeon.

1308
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,250
- There's no cake...
- This is...

1309
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,350
or seaweed soup.

1310
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,580
You're just making ramyeon.

1311
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,230
There are no pans.

1312
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,560
Yes, we do. There's a lot.

1313
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,560
We have six pans here.

1314
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,460
Make me zucchini jeon.

1315
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,870
I should make zucchini jeon
since Se Chan wants to eat it.

1316
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:54,870
I'd love to have zucchini jeon.

1317
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:55,870
(Falling)

1318
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:58,040
My gosh. That old man...

1319
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,370
(Falling again)

1320
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:01,980
- That old man...
- Mister!

1321
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,210
- You could've used both hands!
- My gosh, seriously.

1322
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,210
I can't give you any allowances
at this rate.

1323
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:08,350
- I know. Why did he do that?
- Go and wash these now.

1324
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:09,980
- Okay.
- Wash them.

1325
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,940
- My gosh.
- I'll make zucchini jeon for you.

1326
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,210
- Are you really making it?
- Se Chan.

1327
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,620
Do you know how to make it?

1328
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,120
- Are you making egg rice?
- Yes, I'm making egg fried rice.

1329
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:19,290
The mushroom looks great.

1330
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,730
Se Chan, come over here and try it.

1331
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,020
Se Chan wanted to have
zucchini jeon.

1332
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,420
- The seaweed soup looks good.
- Ji Hyo knows how to make it.

1333
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,230
Ji Hyo is a good cook.

1334
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,670
I've never had so many people...

1335
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:34,210
prepare my birthday meal.

1336
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,540
- Is that so?
- I'm so happy.

1337
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,310
- Se Chan, you're happy, right?
- Yes.

1338
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,100
We're cooking with all our hearts
and with one heart...

1339
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,650
- for you.
- What is he saying?

1340
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,040
What does he mean
by all your hearts and one heart?

1341
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:46,420
Isn't this nice?

1342
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,650
- Happy birthday!
- Se Chan.

1343
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:48,960
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

1344
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,960
Go take a seat.

1345
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,850
- I hope you'll be healthy.
- You can stay seated.

1346
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,650
Hey, don't act up
and just stay seated.

1347
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,690
- Have the Ediya coffee.
- Se Chan.

1348
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,960
Can you do me a favor
before sitting? Get me a dish.

1349
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,560
I'm sorry, but I'm too busy.

1350
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,870
- A big one?
- Yes.

1351
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:04,000
I'm sorry, but I'm too busy.

1352
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:05,500
- I'm sorry.
- Not at all.

1353
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,870
It must be uncomfortable
for you to be seated.

1354
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:08,000
Not at all.

1355
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:11,400
(Meanwhile, Chef So Min was
doing something in the corner...)

1356
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,400
(with a plate.)

1357
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,250
- It's ramyeon.
- Se Chan!

1358
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:21,650
Happy birthday to you

1359
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,960
Happy birthday to you

1360
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,190
She actually means it.

1361
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:29,100
- Happy birthday, dear Se Chan
- She...

1362
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,020
She's always shooting
"We Got Married" with him.

1363
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,120
- She actually means it.
- Happy birthday to you

1364
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,120
It's so pressuring.

1365
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,560
Look at this.

1366
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,100
(She's more excited than him.)

1367
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,460
All right. Please take a seat.

1368
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,330
Please take a seat.

1369
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:42,480
Okay. Do you need help?

1370
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,140
So Min, can you make
soy sauce for me?

1371
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,810
- Soy sauce?
- Do you know how to make it?

1372
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,580
I hate this the most.

1373
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,020
It's ready. Ramyeon is ready.

1374
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,420
We must have ramyeon now!

1375
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,420
(The birthday dishes are being made
one by one,)

1376
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,390
(following the fried rice cake.)

1377
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:58,150
(The special ramyeon
made by the noodle lover himself)

1378
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,650
Hurry and sit. We must have it now.

1379
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,250
- Happy birthday to you
- Come and sit!

1380
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:04,190
- Okay. I'm done with ramyeon.
- Come and sit down.

1381
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,500
Leave Suk Jin,
and come sit here, everyone!

1382
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,770
- Suk Jin, what are you doing?
- Happy birthday to you

1383
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,100
(The zucchini man
barely finishes making his dish.)

1384
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,540
- Hurry up.
- It looks pretty good.

1385
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,870
It needs to boil down more.

1386
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:15,080
(The seaweed soup, the highlight,
is almost ready.)

1387
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,100
- Happy birthday to you
- So Min, give me a plate.

1388
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,150
- Ji Hyo.
- It looks pretty good.

1389
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,650
- You're not eating it, right?
- It looks quite good.

1390
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:21,940
- Try one.
- Should I?

1391
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,370
- Sit down. We have ramyeon.
- Ramyeon?

1392
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:24,710
The seaweed soup
has been boiling the whole time.

1393
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:27,040
Ji Hyo, sit down. Sit down, So Min.

1394
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,980
(A spoonful would've been enough.)

1395
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,920
Leave Suk Jin.
The noodles will get soggy!

1396
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,980
Come sit down first.

1397
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,290
The birthday meal looks quite good.

1398
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,460
- So Min, have this.
- It looks so nice. It's the best.

1399
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,650
This looks...

1400
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,330
- Thank you.
- Try it.

1401
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:39,500
It's your birthday.

1402
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,670
(Right then, Chef Jeon runs in.)

1403
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,600
What are you doing?

1404
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,040
(Putting candles)

1405
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:52,600
(The birthday of Se Chan who grew up
by a lot in the past 4 years)

1406
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:57,020
(Happy birthday, dear Se Chan)

1407
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,920
(Happy birthday to you)

1408
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,980
Thank you!

1409
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,520
- Eat up.
- Thank you for your hard work.

1410
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,980
- Se Chan.
- Se Chan, happy birthday.

1411
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,560
- Thank you.
- We hope you stay healthy.

1412
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,890
- Thank you.
- We hope you stay healthy.

1413
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:10,520
I haven't had ramyeon for so long.
It's so good.

1414
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,500
- This reminds me of that.
- You made it well.

1415
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:14,100
This is how seaweed soup
should taste.

1416
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,000
You should cut the cake
with chopsticks.

1417
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,900
Is it good?

1418
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,640
But how did it...

1419
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,770
(Chef Jeon's hidden menu,
egg fried rice)

1420
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,600
It's ramyeon with meat.

1421
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,730
It's incredibly good.

1422
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,350
It's fascinating that we made these.

1423
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,170
- How is this fascinating?
- Hey.

1424
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:32,580
- So Min.
- Yes?

1425
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,150
What's wrong with this fried rice?

1426
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,460
It's good.

1427
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,580
- Try it.
- What's wrong?

1428
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,730
It has no taste.

1429
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:40,650
Didn't you add salt?

1430
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,420
- I added a little.
- It looks so good though.

1431
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:45,230
Actually, you should have it
with something else.

1432
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,560
- I'll try it.
- Let's try it.

1433
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,770
I've never had such fried rice.

1434
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,870
- Try it with mayonnaise.
- This is a bit...

1435
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:55,040
(A bizarre dish
that's from another world)

1436
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,100
Does it taste bland?

1437
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:01,250
Although I've never tasted it,
it tastes like a cloud.

1438
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,210
It's just... It has no taste.

1439
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,650
She must've added
a lot of margarine.

1440
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:06,890
Gosh. Hey.

1441
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,890
(A shocking collaboration of
margarine, butter, and mayonnaise)

1442
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:09,920
It's good!

1443
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,080
It's a horrible menu
for the middle-aged.

1444
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,290
- For the middle-aged?
- Margarine and mayonnaise...

1445
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,850
For the middle-aged?

1446
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,020
I'll try the seaweed soup...

1447
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,270
- Ji Hyo made.
- Se Chan's eating the seaweed soup.

1448
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:20,830
I'm having seaweed soup
earlier than my birthday this year.

1449
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:22,040
It's your first seaweed soup.

1450
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,600
It looks good.

1451
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,870
- It smells nice.
- She made it well.

1452
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,560
- The soup looks thick.
- How is it?

1453
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,000
The soup looks thick.

1454
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,270
- How is it?
- I like soups...

1455
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:32,540
with many ingredients.

1456
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,480
I'll judge it. The seaweed soup
my wife makes is really nice.

1457
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,150
- It's nice.
- It needed to be boiled more.

1458
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,270
It's really nice.

1459
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:39,390
(Jae Suk tries a bite as well.)

1460
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:40,420
Is it okay?

1461
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,580
My goodness.

1462
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,520
You saw how she made it.

1463
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,020
- What's wrong?
- I shouldn't have added salt.

1464
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,080
It's too salty.

1465
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,100
Ji Hyo, be honest.
Did you add fish sauce to this?

1466
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,920
Why? What's wrong?

1467
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,460
It smells like fish sauce.
You added it, didn't you?

1468
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,000
It does taste
like fish sauce, right?

1469
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,830
- But she made it in a short time.
- Right. If it gets boiled more...

1470
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:58,190
- It has to be...
- I should've boiled more.

1471
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,870
It needs to be boiled more.

1472
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,140
It'll be delicious
if you boil it more.

1473
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,000
You need to boil seaweed soup
for a long time.

1474
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:05,000
Why is no one mentioning
the zucchini jeon?

1475
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,150
Sorry?

1476
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,270
Have some zucchini jeon.

1477
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,120
- It's slightly undercooked.
- I'll try it.

1478
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,540
- Try it.
- It's incredible.

1479
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,190
- It's crunchy.
- I made it with all my effort.

1480
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:15,750
This is quite fresh.

1481
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:18,060
I mean...

1482
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,480
How come it's so fresh
when he fried it?

1483
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:22,560
- Because he just harvested it.
- This zucchini is...

1484
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,500
It tastes like
it was just harvested.

1485
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,790
Doesn't it have a nice texture?

1486
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,500
- My gosh, this is...
- It has a nice texture.

1487
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,270
I thought it was radish kimchi
when I first bit it.

1488
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,790
(Big Nose was asked to make
zucchini jeon,)

1489
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,710
(but he made radish kimchi instead.)

1490
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,940
(The more he chews,
the more absurd it feels.)

1491
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,210
It's just so fresh!

1492
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,440
This is how I do it.

1493
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:40,750
- I see. That's how you make it.
- I like it this way.

1494
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:43,080
Suk Jin! This isn't zucchini jeon.
It's pickled radish.

1495
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,020
- It's pickled radish.
- It's because...

1496
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,960
- It still got its green color.
- The best zucchini jeon I had...

1497
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,890
is from a really famous
Korean restaurant.

1498
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,460
This is how they make it.
They make it a little crunchy.

1499
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,560
Where is that place?

1500
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,650
Sorry?

1501
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,100
He's lying.

1502
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,120
(He's busted.)

1503
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,190
Suk Jin.

1504
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,460
- Why do you keep making petty lies?
- Why do you keep telling lies?

1505
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,460
- He keeps making petty lies.
- Why do you lie so much?

1506
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,640
I wasn't lying.

1507
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,770
It wasn't a lie. Would you visit
if I told you the address?

1508
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,270
Are you going to verify it or what?

1509
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,000
That will be Suk Jin's punishment.

1510
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,870
Comparing their zucchini jeon
with his.

1511
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,750
He should compare
this zucchini jeon...

1512
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,870
with the restaurant near Dosan Park.

1513
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:16,870
- The zucchini jeon.
- He must.

1514
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:18,790
That will be your punishment.
Comparing your jeon with theirs.

1515
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:20,540
Can you leave two pieces?

1516
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:22,060
- Hey, stop it.
- Let's compare this with theirs.

1517
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,120
- Darn it.
- What?

1518
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,460
- What's wrong?
- It'll take hours.

1519
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,980
What? We should compare them.

1520
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:29,060
All right. Happy birthday again,
Se Chan!

1521
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,650
Thank you for the meal.

1522
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:32,400
(Thank you for the meal!)

1523
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,420
- Hey, let's...
- Let's have coffee.

1524
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,620
- We should have desserts.
- That's right.

1525
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,270
I'll make a hot cup of coffee
for everyone.

1526
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,270
Thank you.

1527
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,870
What's this?
Is this supposed to be that?

1528
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:41,170
Please don't touch it.

1529
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,440
Let me just look at it!

1530
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,710
- You should have this in winter.
- You look like an expert.

1531
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:47,250
- Six and seven.
- You're making it like a barista.

1532
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,080
You must have warm coffee in winter.

1533
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,540
How many cups are ready?

1534
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,810
It's a special gold blend.

1535
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,210
This is really good.

1536
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,210
I'm not even kidding.

1537
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:57,190
Jae Suk.

1538
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:58,690
She's after a commercial deal again.

1539
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:00,650
She's after a commercial deal again.

1540
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,020
Hold on. There's no cup for me.

1541
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:04,350
You can't have it there.

1542
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:05,400
Yes, I can.

1543
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,620
No, Ediya will not like it.

1544
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,900
No, they'll love it.

1545
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,290
Who has coffee in a soup bowl?

1546
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,460
No, what matters
is the person who has it.

1547
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,940
(No, what matters
is the person who has it.)

1548
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,810
It's like an advertising phrase
for an ad.

1549
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,170
- It really is like a copy.
- He and his confidence.

1550
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,850
Suk Jin, your nose is bleeding.

1551
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,150
Your nose is bleeding.

1552
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,480
There's a reason
why he's shot so many commercials.

1553
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,170
This is so good.

1554
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:26,940
Hey, don't you want to...

1555
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,350
mix rice in it?

1556
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:30,060
- Why don't you...
- Can you add some rice?

1557
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,290
Add some kimchi as well.

1558
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:32,460
Aren't you having scorched rice?

1559
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,520
(The gukbap lover always
thinks of adding rice...)

1560
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,560
(when there's product placement.)

1561
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,420
He always adds rice to it.

1562
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,420
He always says
it'd go well with rice.

1563
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,400
It'd go so well with rice.

1564
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:41,600
You must add rice to this.

1565
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:45,440
You must have a spoon.
You must have it like this.

1566
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,870
I find that the funniest.

1567
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:49,330
(After lunchtime...)

1568
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:52,310
Can you give me a coin, please?

1569
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,310
(Can you give me a coin, please?)

1570
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,810
Oh, my. When did you write all that?

1571
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:59,580
Earlier, when I was next to you.

1572
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:01,750
It's because I don't have money.

1573
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,060
(Yang Se Chan doesn't seem
to like egg fried rice.)

1574
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:04,580
(Yang Se Chan's smile
isn't that pretty.)

1575
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,250
(Almost half of it
is about his looks.)

1576
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,830
Ji Hyo, let's sit
and write some down.

1577
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,170
- We need to write five. Downsides.
- What should we write?

1578
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:13,690
Things you don't like about him.

1579
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,830
(So Min writes more bad things
about Se Chan.)

1580
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,640
Se Chan...

1581
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,100
doesn't have as many downsides
as I thought.

1582
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,400
That's only for you.

1583
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,540
(To Se Chan's variety show wife,
10 is the most she can write.)

1584
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,650
Gosh, you.

1585
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:26,850
(To Se Chan's variety show wife,
10 is the most she can write.)

1586
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:27,850
What are you up to?

1587
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,920
What are you two cooking up?

1588
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,020
- Oh, for the lottery ticket?
- You're writing his downsides?

1589
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,920
I should write some.
I have to write five of them, right?

1590
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,650
(They all join in
and write bad things about Se Chan.)

1591
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,850
So Min kept
writing something earlier.

1592
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:42,290
I didn't know. I was sitting next
to her, but I didn't know.

1593
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:44,920
- You need that.
- I should hurry and write some.

1594
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:47,370
Se Chan, look at them.

1595
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:48,400
(Right then, Se Chan comes in.)

1596
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,290
(Se Chan, look at them.)

1597
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:51,440
They're all holding papers...

1598
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,600
- and writing about you.
- They're all writing about you.

1599
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:56,500
My gosh. No wonder
my ears were burning.

1600
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,940
I had to cool them down.

1601
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,870
- They're no joke.
- It's frantic here.

1602
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,440
Hey! I didn't know
we got a notebook for this.

1603
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:05,480
- I can't believe it.
- I was stopping them.

1604
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,040
I'm using this bag...

1605
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,310
- You know that I told you first.
- to keep my phone.

1606
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:09,460
Jong Kook, here.

1607
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,650
- My goodness.
- I haven't seen you write one.

1608
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:13,250
- Haha, you...
- I almost forgot.

1609
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,460
Forget it, Haha.
You're holding a lottery ticket.

1610
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,020
- Where?
- It's in your hand.

1611
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,790
You gave me a lot.

1612
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:21,000
Mister, are you writing it
in my face?

1613
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:22,290
I'm right behind you.

1614
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:24,370
I'm writing down the ideas
I thought of.

1615
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:26,830
(The secret to becoming a national
MC is writing ideas down.)

1616
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,900
- You're writing down ideas?
- He's rice with ideas these days.

1617
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,640
- I reported it to you.
- Thank you.

1618
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,900
What about me?

1619
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,040
- I didn't do anything.
- I didn't do anything either.

1620
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:36,210
I really didn't do anything.
I swear.

1621
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,080
- I wrote five.
- Here's your lottery ticket.

1622
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:40,810
Give me a ten-dollar bill.

1623
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,460
- What are you, a beggar?
- Yes!

1624
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,480
Okay.

1625
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,580
Give me some.
I didn't write anything.

1626
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:48,330
He wrote it in my presence.
Isn't he being too much?

1627
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,250
You wrote them while looking at me.

1628
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,150
I told you. I wrote down my ideas.

1629
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,620
- They're reflecting your ideas?
- Of course.

1630
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,000
- Then I approve of it. Here.
- Give me one more.

1631
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:58,540
- Come on. Give me one more.
- What is this?

1632
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,730
Hold on.
You're extorting money from him.

1633
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:03,330
- What do you mean?
- Why are you extorting from him?

1634
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:04,640
- No, I didn't.
- Please wait.

1635
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,000
- Please wait.
- Everyone.

1636
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,250
Did you enjoy your lunch?

1637
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,650
- Yes.
- Yes, I did.

1638
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:12,540
Many of you submitted
slanders on the birthday boy.

1639
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,750
I didn't know such a thing existed.

1640
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,750
- I'll read a few.
- Okay.

1641
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,750
"The look in his eyes is dirty.
He's ugly. He's dumb."

1642
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,190
"He's ignorant. His feet stink."

1643
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,190
- My gosh.
- Suk Jin, how could you?

1644
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,920
- Suk Jin, you submitted them.
- He's the worst.

1645
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,830
- What else is there?
- And...

1646
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,060
"His teeth
look more protruding today."

1647
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,270
- It's So Min.
- "He only gave me 20 dollars."

1648
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,270
- Twenty dollars?
- "His cap is too small for him."

1649
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,140
"He pretends not to like me."

1650
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,900
- It's So Min.
- It's So Min.

1651
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,140
- She mentioned protruding mouth.
- "He pretends not to like me"?

1652
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,500
- "He pretends not to like me."
- How is that my downside?

1653
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:40,650
- I'm sure So Min wrote that.
- Hey.

1654
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:41,650
- It's So Min for sure.
- Was that a confession or what?

1655
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:42,920
- "He pretends not to like me."
- It's So Min.

1656
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,920
That's hilarious.

1657
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,690
"His gums show too much
when he smiles."

1658
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,940
"Looks like he thinks he's
the only one with a birthday."

1659
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:48,960
(Looks like he thinks he's
the only one with a birthday.)

1660
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,120
"Looks like he thinks he's
the only one with a birthday."

1661
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,190
But I didn't plan this.

1662
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,520
That was funny.

1663
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,000
They wrote down such downsides
about him.

1664
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,520
- That's a lot.
- It is.

1665
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,620
They're all petty.
They're not so impactful.

1666
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:04,370
All right.
Let's start the next mission.

1667
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:07,370
This mission will use
a low-frequency massager.

1668
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:08,460
Gosh, this is...

1669
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:11,480
The parents and son
will massage each other.

1670
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,370
It's called
Low Frequency in My Hand.

1671
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,310
I think it'll be nice.
I like this kind of massage.

1672
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:17,310
Each team's representative
will step forward...

1673
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:20,850
wear a blindfold and gloves...

1674
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:22,350
that have
a low-frequency massager attached.

1675
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,850
Within the given time,

1676
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:27,330
you need to touch the opponents'
bodies with the gloves.

1677
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,690
The one who screams
will have their point deducted.

1678
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:31,900
Okay, got it.

1679
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,420
Even when I get physical therapy,
I ask them to make it strongest.

1680
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,440
- Then you and I will be the winner.
- You're amazing.

1681
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,640
I love that tingling feeling.

1682
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,440
Each team will play against
its opponents.

1683
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,330
Se Chan, you can
pick a partner this time.

1684
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:45,330
- I can?
- Yes.

1685
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:47,310
- Join us.
- This time, I'll choose...

1686
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,080
- Jae Suk and So Min.
- Fine. You can join them.

1687
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,920
All right. Let's send him away.

1688
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,270
We should send him away
when we need to.

1689
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:55,440
The first round will be between
Se Chan, Jong Kook, and Suk Jin.

1690
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,480
- All right.
- All right.

1691
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,560
Please put on
the low-frequency massagers.

1692
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,150
- I hate it.
- I like this feeling.

1693
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,650
It's good for our body, right?

1694
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:04,420
When they ask if I'm okay,
I ask them to make it strongest.

1695
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:06,290
It's good for our body, right?

1696
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:08,190
Yes, it is. It's good for your body.

1697
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:09,640
It's fine
when it touches you at first.

1698
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,790
- If Jong Kook likes it...
- Good!

1699
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:14,730
Touch me a lot. Here and here.

1700
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:17,230
- They're truly amazing.
- If Jong Kook likes it,

1701
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,850
- I won't be able to attack him.
- I can't stand pains like this.

1702
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:20,980
No one can.

1703
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,350
- I can't stand it at all.
- No one can stand it.

1704
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,580
(Screaming)

1705
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,210
- What's the strongest one?
- Gosh!

1706
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,350
- How does it work?
- Touch your skin with it.

1707
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:32,250
It'll be fine.

1708
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:34,920
(Happy)

1709
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,900
- You like that?
- You like that?

1710
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,170
How is it?

1711
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:41,020
- Gosh, it stings!
- No idea.

1712
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:43,790
- I'm okay.
- It's like physical therapy.

1713
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:45,000
(The gym lover
is stimulating his muscles.)

1714
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,460
- Does it sting?
- It's like physical therapy.

1715
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,140
All right!

1716
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,040
Jong Kook is enjoying it.

1717
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,940
All right. Get ready.

1718
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,250
(The low-frequency trio is ready.)

1719
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,350
It's me, Suk Jin.

1720
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:57,350
- It's me!
- Not this way!

1721
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,310
- Go straight.
- Not this way.

1722
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,150
Se Chan, you need to
come to this side.

1723
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:02,710
- Jong Kook.
- Come here.

1724
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,560
Suk Jin is behind us.

1725
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,120
- Attack from right there, Se Chan.
- Grab him.

1726
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,330
- Grab him.
- Attack from right there.

1727
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:10,230
- Who is it?
- It's slightly to your left.

1728
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:12,100
(Se Chan, who made noise,
gets a point deducted.)

1729
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,370
Se Chan, minus one point.

1730
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,190
(He puts on guard first.)

1731
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:18,060
Go straight.

1732
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,810
Go straight. He's on the floor.
Grab him!

1733
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:24,830
(Screaming)

1734
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:27,350
(Suk Jin also grabbed Jong Kook.)

1735
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:28,440
(Jong Kook isn't affected at all.)

1736
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,620
Se Chan, come this way.

1737
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:32,350
It's right there.

1738
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,650
(Screaming)

1739
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,460
Se Chan, grab his legs.

1740
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:41,690
Go forward. Go straight.

1741
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,020
- Right in front of you.
- Go straight.

1742
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,020
(Screaming)

1743
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,270
No! Jong Kook!

1744
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:48,520
Jong Kook! Who is it?

1745
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:51,460
He likes it.

1746
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,940
(What? I clearly grabbed him.)

1747
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,830
- Hey.
- Jong Kook likes it.

1748
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,080
(He's strengthening his muscles
with the stimulation.)

1749
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,170
Hey.

1750
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,580
What's wrong with this? What's this?

1751
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:04,250
Maybe my massager isn't working.

1752
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,480
(Screaming)

1753
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,310
(Big Nose gets livened up.)

1754
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,250
(He looks the liveliest this year.)

1755
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,020
- I'm sorry!
- Grab him.

1756
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:14,830
I'm sorry!

1757
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:15,920
(The filial son's low-frequency
massage filled with love)

1758
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,020
The two of them are on the floor.

1759
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,620
- Go straight.
- Suk Jin.

1760
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,690
Suk Jin is behind you.
Just go straight.

1761
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:23,730
(A hyena hunting the weakest)

1762
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:26,270
- Go straight.
- Hey, Yang Ssaebssaeb.

1763
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:28,560
(Screaming)

1764
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:29,980
Yang Ssaebssaeb.

1765
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,850
(What? It didn't touch him yet.)

1766
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:35,440
(He can't hold his energy
and keeps shouting.)

1767
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,480
It's over.

1768
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,650
I touched Jong Kook,
but how come it didn't work?

1769
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:40,850
- Hey, what's wrong with you?
- I liked it.

1770
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:41,920
- Look at him.
- I liked it.

1771
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,190
It reminded me of physical therapy.

1772
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,810
He's unbelievable.

1773
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:46,230
(The game between the low-frequency master
and his preys is over.)

1774
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:49,060
It was fun. It's a healthy game.

1775
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,150
It helps improve your health too.

1776
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:53,690
Round Two is between
Ji Hyo, Haha, and So Min.

1777
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:54,920
(Round 2, Ji Hyo, Haha, So Min)

1778
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:56,690
I'm done for.

1779
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,790
Hey, So Min. Do a good job.

1780
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:01,670
This is fun though. It's funny.

1781
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:02,940
(Screaming)

1782
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:03,940
That startled me.

1783
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:06,540
It wouldn't come that fast.
You need to hold it for a second.

1784
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,170
He's making a fuss.

1785
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:10,940
I'm Pikachu.

1786
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:12,650
I surrender!

1787
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,020
(He practices saying he surrenders
before the game even begins.)

1788
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,020
All right. I'm practicing.

1789
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,850
What happens when he surrenders?
Does he just rest?

1790
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:18,020
(Screaming)

1791
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:19,980
- Darn it.
- He's a scaredy-cat.

1792
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,150
Get ready.

1793
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:23,120
So Min, don't scream.

1794
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,100
- Ji Hyo.
- Just stay still.

1795
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:28,330
Ji Hyo, to your left...
No. Behind you.

1796
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:29,770
- So Min is behind you.
- Go straight.

1797
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:32,060
Ji Hyo, you should
team up with So Min.

1798
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,940
- Can you even attack?
- Let's attack Haha together.

1799
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,980
- It hurts.
- You two should join hands.

1800
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:37,730
Ji Hyo, go straight
to where Haha is.

1801
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:40,040
- Haha is near me.
- I'm Pikachu.

1802
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,100
Haha, it might be better
to attack first.

1803
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,120
- To your right.
- Go straight.

1804
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,540
- Haha, run away!
- Go.

1805
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,770
He's right in front of you.

1806
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,980
- Run away.
- To your left.

1807
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:50,080
It's not a game about running away.

1808
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,020
- Stop there.
- Go after him.

1809
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,250
- So Min, go after him.
- Turn around.

1810
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,460
Where should I go to, Suk Jin?

1811
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,920
- Ji Hyo, over here.
- Follow the sound of my clap.

1812
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,620
- Over here, Ji Hyo.
- Over here.

1813
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,100
What are you, a zombie?

1814
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,520
- So Min, this way.
- You're so disgraceful.

1815
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,330
Gosh, Haha.

1816
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:03,330
(Haha is frivolously walking away
fast in case he gets caught.)

1817
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:06,270
It's me.

1818
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,940
(Jae Suk is trying to move So Min
to Haha's side.)

1819
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:09,980
Oh, my.

1820
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:12,710
(Screaming)

1821
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,710
Hey!

1822
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,040
(Haha is all scared.)

1823
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,440
- It's so scary.
- It's not.

1824
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:20,350
- Where is he?
- Gosh, Haha.

1825
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,350
- He's just a scaredy-cat.
- Where is he?

1826
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:25,120
- I'm right here.
- Be quiet.

1827
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,560
No one has touched anyone so far.

1828
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,690
(I'm sorry, but no one has touched
anyone so far.)

1829
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:29,730
Hey, this is...

1830
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,560
(That's how it started.)

1831
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,690
Who was that?

1832
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,560
Hey! Gosh!

1833
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,870
- Come here!
- He's gone crazy.

1834
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:40,960
- What a scaredy-cat.
- He's a complete scaredy-cat.

1835
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,540
Are you playing
a VR game or something?

1836
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,600
Are you playing
a VR game or something?

1837
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,580
(Even when someone brushes
by his clothes,)

1838
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:49,440
(he starts playing a VR game
on his own.)

1839
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,940
You touched my heart!

1840
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:53,920
(His frivolousness
makes everyone lose their minds.)

1841
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,150
- He's gone crazy.
- He's a scaredy-cat.

1842
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,890
- How did I team up with him?
- He's gone crazy.

1843
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,390
Oh, gosh.

1844
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:59,420
(Meanwhile, So Min...)

1845
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:02,330
(She made an error
and headed toward the staff.)

1846
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:04,850
(Screaming)

1847
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,790
(She massaged her cameraman
before anybody knew.)

1848
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:08,830
You should give us points for that.

1849
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,000
The cameraman screamed.

1850
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,230
- Give us points.
- You should grab someone too!

1851
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,100
You can grab others too, you idiot!

1852
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,670
- No!
- Go straight.

1853
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,730
- Go straight. Go some more.
- Pika-pika!

1854
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:20,710
- Go some more, you punk!
- Pika-pika!

1855
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:21,770
(In the end, the low frequency
gym goer steps in.)

1856
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:23,580
That's it. Grab her.

1857
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,920
- Grab her leg.
- Pikachu!

1858
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,520
Pikachu!

1859
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:29,560
Pikachu!

1860
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,710
(Screaming)

1861
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,750
Darn it!

1862
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,620
(It looks like his VR game
is pretty dynamic.)

1863
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,000
What is he, a monster?

1864
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:39,370
What kind of monster is he?

1865
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:40,770
She's right in front of you.

1866
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,230
She's on the floor in front of you.

1867
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:43,960
You're almost there.

1868
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,440
Go for it! You have to fight now!

1869
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,830
Go for it!

1870
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,500
(They finally touch each other
10 seconds before the game ends.)

1871
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,100
(Screaming)

1872
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:59,120
(He finally gets possessed
by the low frequency ghost.)

1873
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,210
- Hey.
- Is he a zombie?

1874
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:03,060
- Is he a zombie?
- Hey.

1875
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:05,060
- Hey.
- What is he, a zombie?

1876
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:07,520
- What is that? A zombie?
- Hey.

1877
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,330
Are you playing
a VR game or something?

1878
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:11,120
- Hey.
- Are you playing a VR game?

1879
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,330
It was so scary.

1880
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,190
What is he, a zombie?

1881
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:15,670
What was that about?

1882
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:19,060
All right. Who do you want to
play against, Jae Suk?

1883
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:22,330
- I want to play against Suk Jin.
- Play with Jong Kook.

1884
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,900
I want to play against Suk Jin...

1885
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,210
and Haha.

1886
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,750
Haha, you'll play one more time.

1887
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,250
Haha, don't take it off.

1888
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,580
(Round 3, Suk Jin, Jae Suk, Haha)

1889
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,020
All right. It's worth the fight.

1890
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:34,190
Jae Suk, I think you'll win
even if you just brush past them.

1891
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:35,710
- Of course.
- It doesn't hurt at all.

1892
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:37,080
I don't want to play.

1893
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:38,750
Hey.

1894
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:40,330
You'd better do a good job.

1895
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:43,000
- Hey. Haha.
- It's worth the fight.

1896
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:45,330
- This isn't strong enough.
- Hang in there a little.

1897
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:49,230
- It's too weak.
- Let me make it stronger for you.

1898
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,670
Make it stronger.

1899
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:52,170
- Is it still too weak?
- It is.

1900
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:53,640
Jae Suk, it's on level 12.

1901
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:55,040
It's too weak.

1902
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:56,710
What do you want to do?

1903
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:58,540
I want it to make you go like this.

1904
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:00,480
Jae Suk, try it.

1905
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,750
Jae Suk is so solemn right now.

1906
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,940
- Get ready.
- Good luck!

1907
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:05,940
(Jae Suk solemnly prepares
for his first match.)

1908
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:07,710
(The game starts.)

1909
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:08,980
I can just wave a white flag.

1910
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:10,810
- Go straight, Jae Suk.
- Hold on.

1911
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:12,080
I'm sorry,
but let's take off our shoes.

1912
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,120
(Haha hides behind others
as soon as the game starts.)

1913
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:14,520
Jae Suk, to your left.

1914
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:15,920
To your right.

1915
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,290
(The two of them met in the corner.)

1916
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:19,500
You got it.

1917
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,670
It's right there.

1918
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,120
It's right there. Grab him.

1919
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:24,230
(Screaming)

1920
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,560
(Screaming in a high pitch)

1921
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:32,140
Suk Jin, he's in front of you.

1922
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:33,600
He's in front of you!

1923
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:34,980
- To your front!
- To the left.

1924
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,120
Go straight, Suk Jin.

1925
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,310
(Screaming)

1926
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,960
(Suk Jin screams in a sweet voice
as it's his first time feeling it.)

1927
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,830
Go straight, Suk Jin.

1928
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:48,420
Go straight, Suk Jin.

1929
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:50,650
Haha, just stay still.
Just stay still there.

1930
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,830
That's it. Go that way, Jae Suk.

1931
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,330
To your left.

1932
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:56,460
To your right.
Go straight from there!

1933
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,190
In front of you! To the right.
Behind you!

1934
01:04:58,190 --> 01:04:59,290
Behind you! Right there.

1935
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:00,770
(Screaming)

1936
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:05,640
(They scream in a higher octave
as they're scared.)

1937
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,370
I'm sorry, but where is Haha?

1938
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:09,920
- To your left!
- To the right!

1939
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,040
To the right, Jae Suk.

1940
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:12,480
Come here.

1941
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,620
- To your left.
- To your left.

1942
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:15,040
To your left, Jae Suk.

1943
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:16,350
Haha is behind you.

1944
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:19,560
(The high-octave screamers reunite.)

1945
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:24,000
(They meet each other again
while looking for Haha.)

1946
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:25,420
Gosh, my arm!

1947
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:27,920
(They keep losing points.)

1948
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,290
Gosh, this stings!

1949
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:31,870
- It's over.
- What's wrong with him?

1950
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,060
Gosh, Suk Jin.

1951
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,310
(Suk Jin screamed like this.)

1952
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:35,940
That's when he's electrocuted.

1953
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,210
(The soprano's scream
was full of vitality.)

1954
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:38,810
It was like an animated film.

1955
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:40,980
It looked like he was electrocuted.

1956
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,210
That was hilarious.

1957
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:43,440
- It was really funny.
- Yes!

1958
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,580
How much do you have right now?

1959
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,040
- Me? I gave out a lot.
- Yes.

1960
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:48,440
I have 600 dollars.

1961
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,750
You have a lot.

1962
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:51,060
You have so much money.

1963
01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:53,290
- I have so little.
- How much do you have?

1964
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,730
I have only 20 dollars.

1965
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,100
- I have only 20 dollars for real.
- Don't give him any.

1966
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:58,600
Give me just 30... No, 50 dollars.

1967
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:00,560
Then you should at least
show me a cute act.

1968
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:03,940
Then you should at least
show me a cute act.

1969
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,640
(Showing him a cute act right away)

1970
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,210
- Thanks.
- He showed a cute act over this.

1971
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:12,370
- Se Chan. Give me some too.
- How much do you have?

1972
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,370
- I don't have much.
- You two should face each other...

1973
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:16,040
and do a battle on cute acts.

1974
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:17,920
(Being cute)

1975
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:22,420
(Cute)

1976
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,190
I'll give you thirty dollars.
Ten dollars for you.

1977
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,730
- I gave you 40 dollars in total.
- I'll announce the result...

1978
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:27,920
of the mission.

1979
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:29,560
The winners of the mission...

1980
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,790
(First place is...)

1981
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:33,270
- are Suk Jin and Ji Hyo.
- Yes!

1982
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:34,830
Suk Jin and Ji Hyo, you can take
the lottery tickets...

1983
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:36,540
with 50-percent chance of winning.

1984
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:37,770
(The winners get a lottery ticket
with 50-percent chance of winning.)

1985
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:38,870
- The one with a 50 percent chance?
- That's right.

1986
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,960
- It'll be amazing if I win it.
- Second place...

1987
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:42,730
is Jae Suk, Se Chan, and So Min.

1988
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:44,140
- It's us.
- All right.

1989
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:47,500
Third place gets a lottery ticket
with 25-percent chance of winning.

1990
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:48,650
Okay!

1991
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:52,440
Take one each and scratch it off.

1992
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,650
(Who will be the lucky winner
this time?)

1993
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:55,250
Darn it. The first face
I'm seeing is So Min's.

1994
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,520
The first face I'm seeing
is yours too.

1995
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:00,330
(Jae Suk's is a dud as well.)

1996
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:01,980
(The team in 2nd place all failed.)

1997
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:03,520
It's a dud! Give it to me.

1998
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,690
Suk Jin and Ji Hyo, how did it go?

1999
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,620
Suk Jin is scratching off both.

2000
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:08,670
You can't do that.

2001
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,730
You got a dud too, right?

2002
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:12,500
Darn it.

2003
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:16,000
I got So Min's face
as soon as I scratched it off.

2004
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:17,730
Darn it. I got So Min too.

2005
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:18,830
(I got So Min too.)

2006
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:21,400
(Surprised)

2007
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,580
What?

2008
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,170
I got three of So Min's faces!

2009
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:25,310
- You got three of So Min's faces?
- Really?

2010
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:26,710
I thought there was only Se Chan.

2011
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:28,120
I also got three of So Min's faces!

2012
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,390
I got three of So Min's faces!

2013
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,790
I also got three of So Min's faces!

2014
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:32,060
- So Min.
- This is...

2015
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:33,250
- Hey!
- Jong Kook.

2016
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,730
- I hated that I got your face.
- Me too!

2017
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:35,960
But I got three of your faces.

2018
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:37,250
This is amazing.

2019
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,290
It's not that I hated it.

2020
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:39,520
The ones in last place
won the lottery.

2021
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,960
I thought it needed to have...

2022
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,870
- Se Chan's faces.
- Me too. I thought the same.

2023
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:46,000
It wasn't like that? You could get
other people's faces?

2024
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,440
- So Min.
- Goodness, So Min.

2025
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,600
- You lucky charm.
- How did you get it?

2026
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:50,830
So then...

2027
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,850
the only winners of the lottery
will get 200 dollars each.

2028
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:55,040
(The 3rd place team
gets 200 dollars each.)

2029
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,540
- You both won?
- Yes.

2030
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:57,670
They're so lucky.

2031
01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:58,920
I'm so jealous.

2032
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:01,390
- This is the last mission.
- What is it?

2033
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,020
It's the last mission...

2034
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:05,790
where parents and their son...

2035
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:07,150
can have a heart-to-heart talk.

2036
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:08,580
It's called
What Happened to My Family.

2037
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:10,350
- What Happened to My Family.
- What Happened to My Family.

2038
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,900
Each team's representative...

2039
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:16,440
will be the eldest
among the team members.

2040
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:18,100
That'll be Suk Jin, Jae Suk,

2041
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,230
- and Jong Kook.
- What's this about?

2042
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,370
One of you will step forward
and wear headphones...

2043
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:23,730
where music is being played.

2044
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:27,440
The remaining members will
sit in front here side by side...

2045
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,540
- and slander them in their face.
- In their face?

2046
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,850
(It's a mission where they'll
slander them in their face.)

2047
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:35,110
- Slandering in their face?
- Yes.

2048
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:36,360
But the person...

2049
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,520
wearing headphones can't hear.

2050
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,110
- He'll just see the mouths moving.
- Oh, no.

2051
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:41,530
So whenever you slander them...

2052
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:43,400
in their face,
even if it's just a word,

2053
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,250
we'll give you a point each.

2054
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,900
And if the player
with headphones wants to know,

2055
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:50,160
then they can secretly
press the button underneath.

2056
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,160
Then we'll stop the music in secret.

2057
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,140
(The player with headphones can
listen if they press the button.)

2058
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:56,810
They can hear everything
from that moment on,

2059
01:08:57,110 --> 01:09:00,740
but the player on the same team
won't gain any more points.

2060
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,910
You need to talk badly of me
so our team can get more points.

2061
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:05,950
You must talk badly
of your team member.

2062
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:07,820
For how many seconds?
In which section?

2063
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:09,020
Once they press the button,
the music will stop for good.

2064
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:10,190
- For good? I see.
- Yes.

2065
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,950
Se Chan, you need
to choose your team.

2066
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,490
This time,

2067
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:15,280
- I'll join Suk Jin and Ji Hyo.
- All right.

2068
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,750
Please place a cushion in front.

2069
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:20,100
You need to hold out
as much as you can.

2070
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,460
(It's already making them excited
to slander Jae Suk in his face.)

2071
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,700
I won't press the button.

2072
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:27,500
- You can say whatever you want.
- Really?

2073
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,740
- You can even curse at me.
- Let's do that.

2074
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:31,480
Can you turn off
our microphones too?

2075
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:34,370
It'll be censored anyway.

2076
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:37,950
(He confidently
puts on the headphones.)

2077
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:39,210
Look at their eyes.

2078
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:42,020
It looks like they're saying
this is their chance.

2079
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,450
(They're looking
the brightest today.)

2080
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:45,360
It's like they've been
waiting for this chance.

2081
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:47,660
(Big Nose is already
itching to talk.)

2082
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:48,860
It has begun.

2083
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:50,160
- Wait.
- It has already begun?

2084
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,560
- What is it?
- I'm sorry,

2085
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:54,570
- can you turn on recent songs?
- You can't do that.

2086
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,030
- Recent songs.
- Put them back on.

2087
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:58,460
- I have a lot to say.
- Just put them back on.

2088
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,770
I want to listen to "Kiss Kiss"
by LABOUM.

2089
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:01,910
- We have a lot to say.
- "Kiss Kiss" by LABOUM.

2090
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:04,110
Why does he keep talking about kissing?

2091
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:05,110
I know.

2092
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,410
- He's just...
- Jae Suk...

2093
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,350
- is very picky with music.
- It's too old.

2094
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:11,150
I can actually read your mouths.

2095
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:12,650
You're a kiss lover.

2096
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,240
- You like kissing.
- He can't live without it.

2097
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,390
"Kiss Kiss" by LABOUM.

2098
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:17,780
- You see? He's still on about it.
- This song is too old.

2099
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:18,910
He's especially picky today.

2100
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,080
He must like kissing.

2101
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,990
- I can read your mouths.
- Really?

2102
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:23,900
- You're ugly.
- Can you hear me?

2103
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,100
- "You're ugly."
- Can you hear me?

2104
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,600
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- "Yoo Jae Suk."

2105
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:28,460
- You're ugly.
- "You're ugly."

2106
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:29,790
- Yes.
- Yes, I can hear it all.

2107
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:31,240
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- He can hear us.

2108
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,770
- Can you hear me?
- I read your mouths. Yes.

2109
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,140
- Can you hear me? Yoo Jae Suk.
- Yes, I can.

2110
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:35,310
- Yes.
- Yoo Jae Suk.

2111
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,000
- Do it.
- Let's start.

2112
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,440
- Ready, go.
- He is just to picky.

2113
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,480
Why is he so picky?

2114
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,070
He's so picky.

2115
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,850
It's being played!

2116
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:46,210
(Jae Suk's perspective)

2117
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:49,080
(Will Jae Suk be able
to enjoy the song fully...)

2118
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:54,390
(while they slander in his face?)

2119
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:56,490
- He's so picky about music.
- "Kiss Kiss" is being played.

2120
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:58,360
You should keep quiet.

2121
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,790
- Be quiet.
- Let's start.

2122
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:00,790
- Go.
- So we can start.

2123
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:02,320
- His face doesn't call for a kiss.
- Exactly.

2124
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,400
Listen. He keeps talking about
"Kiss Kiss" because...

2125
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,060
he has never kissed anyone
in his life before.

2126
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:15,190
- I know.
- Suk Jin.

2127
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:17,270
How did Jae Suk act
when he meets a woman?

2128
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:18,300
- What?
- How did he act?

2129
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,330
He wasn't popular, was he?

2130
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:21,230
- He flirted with them.
- Really?

2131
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:22,310
He flirted?

2132
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:23,770
Can I talk?

2133
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:26,070
- Be quiet.
- I can talk, right?

2134
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:27,230
- Can I talk?
- You know what?

2135
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:29,240
Don't be ridiculous.
Everything he says is a lie.

2136
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,350
He's talking nonsense.

2137
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:35,690
- He used to date an older woman.
- He knows nothing about me.

2138
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:38,060
- Tell me. I want to hear it.
- Really?

2139
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,390
- He used to date an older woman.
- Really?

2140
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:42,320
When the cafe street was popular
in Bangbae-dong,

2141
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:45,930
he told her he'd talk informally
and she slapped him.

2142
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:47,300
It's true.

2143
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,120
Did you get slapped?

2144
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,660
- Did you get slapped?
- Did you get dumped?

2145
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,330
You know Lee Seung Gi's song?

2146
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:54,360
"Because You Are My Woman."

2147
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,010
- I will call you you now
- I will call you you now

2148
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:58,610
- I got slapped?
- He said he'd call her you,

2149
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:00,180
- Did he get slapped?
- and he got slapped.

2150
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:02,610
As far as I'm concerned, he has
never dated anyone officially.

2151
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:04,400
- He deserved it.
- He wasn't popular at all.

2152
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,050
I'm getting curious.

2153
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:08,890
Do you know what he was like?

2154
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:11,890
When we all went clubbing,
he was the only one with no work.

2155
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:12,950
He had no work.

2156
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:15,780
"Jae Suk. You have to be there
by 7 p.m. to get a room."

2157
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:17,430
- "Be there on time to get a room."
- Is this "Talk Box?"

2158
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:19,150
- Is this "Talk Box?"
- I'm serious.

2159
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:22,120
He used to get a room for us.

2160
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,320
He was a room boy?

2161
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:27,100
- Were you a room boy?
- What?

2162
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:28,530
- A room boy?
- Because...

2163
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:31,230
you had to be there two hours
in advance to get a room.

2164
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:32,980
- Do you trust what he says?
- Nowadays...

2165
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:35,200
- at least we have a phone.
- Right.

2166
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,350
Back then, we had nothing.
There was nothing to do.

2167
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:39,020
- Because...
- He was excited.

2168
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:41,150
- He was waiting in the room.
- So he doesn't have to pay.

2169
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,580
- I see.
- He had to keep it reserved.

2170
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:43,980
"Jae Suk. Go get a room."

2171
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:45,450
- "Yes, sir."
- The room boy.

2172
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:49,520
(Jae Suk listened to music
for a minute.)

2173
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,600
(He pressed the button.)

2174
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,490
(Now he can hear everything.)

2175
01:12:54,490 --> 01:12:57,300
- Now he's become the national MC.
- I know.

2176
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,800
Let's give him a round of applause.

2177
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,990
He became successful.

2178
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:03,070
- That's amazing.
- He's very confident...

2179
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:05,030
- about what he wears.
- Yes.

2180
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:08,370
- He wears...
- Doesn't he have thin legs?

2181
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:10,810
Doesn't he have thin legs?

2182
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:12,240
They're weak.

2183
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,520
- He has no butt.
- They're skinny.

2184
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,240
You have no butt.

2185
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:18,480
- What?
- Your butt is too flat.

2186
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,560
It's too skinny.

2187
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,760
Don't say it clearly.

2188
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,430
You're very countrified.

2189
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,300
(Suk Jin enjoys badmouthing
Jae Suk in his face.)

2190
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,100
- You're very countrified.
- What?

2191
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,520
You're very countrified.

2192
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:29,970
I'm very countrified?

2193
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,300
- He heard it.
- He pressed the button.

2194
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,570
- He pressed the button.
- Did you press the button?

2195
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:35,700
- I didn't. I can't hear anything.
- You did.

2196
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:36,970
Your butt is so flat.

2197
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:38,530
- My butt...
- You have no butt.

2198
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:40,640
- I have no butt?
- Where is your butt?

2199
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,350
- He pressed it.
- You pressed it.

2200
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:43,680
- You pressed the button.
- I didn't.

2201
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,150
Isn't he the Bangbae-dong slap man?

2202
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:47,180
Yes.

2203
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:48,350
- What are they talking about?
- The slap man.

2204
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,410
It was hard for him to go on a date.

2205
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:53,080
- Right.
- Because of his appearance?

2206
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:56,480
He was able to hang out with them
thanks to us.

2207
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,320
Were his front teeth uneven
even back then?

2208
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,400
- Did he get braces?
- He got so much better now.

2209
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,120
Did his teeth become uneven after
getting slapped in Bangbae-dong?

2210
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,990
I saw him spitting on the street.

2211
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:06,400
When you spit, you spit forward.

2212
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,160
He almost spat on my face.

2213
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,640
He spits sideways.

2214
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,970
He almost spat on my face.

2215
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:12,370
(Believe it or not, Suk Jin shares
a ridiculous story about his teeth.)

2216
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:14,030
I'm not lying. He spits sideways.

2217
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:15,700
I was like, "Is it raining?"

2218
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,270
It turns out he spat.

2219
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,240
- He got so much better.
- Is that so?

2220
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:21,020
He's laughing too.

2221
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,220
Why is he laughing?

2222
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:25,190
I'm laughing
because you're laughing.

2223
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:27,360
How did his teeth get better
without getting braces?

2224
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,560
Somehow that happened.

2225
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,690
I was surprised.

2226
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:32,300
Do you want to hear why he kneeled
in Bangbae-dong?

2227
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:36,230
(Do you want to hear why he kneeled
in Bangbae-dong?)

2228
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:38,330
He can hear us.

2229
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:39,970
Do you want to hear it?

2230
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:41,030
- Tell me.
- Yes.

2231
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:42,200
He begged a woman not to leave.

2232
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,970
- He begged her.
- A woman?

2233
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:46,330
- He begged her.
- Who was she?

2234
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:48,240
He begged her not to leave.
Is it okay to tell them?

2235
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,310
(Groaning)

2236
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:51,370
(Laughing)

2237
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:53,980
- What's wrong?
- Did you?

2238
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:55,780
- He begged her not to leave.
- It's a painful story...

2239
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:57,110
- that happened in Bangbae-dong.
- He went down on his knees.

2240
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:59,020
- Bangbae-dong knee man.
- Yes.

2241
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,280
I don't remember
whether it was him or not.

2242
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,280
We asked women...

2243
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,860
to have coffee with us
all night long.

2244
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:08,060
- That's what we did at night.
- Yes.

2245
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:09,820
After failing at 5 a.m.,

2246
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:12,360
I couldn't believe myself.

2247
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,070
I realized
I shouldn't live this way.

2248
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:16,360
So I went to church and prayed.

2249
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,360
- Really?
- With him.

2250
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,440
It was you, right?

2251
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,270
- It was you and Yong Man.
- It was Yong Man?

2252
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:22,200
That's right.

2253
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,050
You and Yong Man went to
a Catholic church.

2254
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,680
- It wasn't you? You can hear me?
- I left before that.

2255
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:28,480
Yes. I left before that.

2256
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,280
I wasn't going to say this,

2257
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:31,610
but you guys told me to go home.

2258
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:32,720
Did I?

2259
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,150
- Because we were uneven.
- Wait.

2260
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,620
"Uneven."

2261
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:38,230
Since when did you listen to us?

2262
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:39,360
I think he started listening
from early on.

2263
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,450
- No.
- It's over.

2264
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,300
Next is Jong Kook.

2265
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:44,800
Right. You should play
the latest music.

2266
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,030
- That was hilarious.
- It's always "Ring Ding Dong."

2267
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:48,530
Just play anything.

2268
01:15:49,730 --> 01:15:51,330
(The calm before the storm)

2269
01:15:51,330 --> 01:15:53,110
It's like the calm before the storm.

2270
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:55,240
I have so much to say
about Jong Kook.

2271
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,700
Can you give us like two hours?

2272
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:59,050
You'll be surprised to hear...

2273
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:01,020
- what I'm about to say.
- Just wait!

2274
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:03,320
- I have put it on yet.
- Okay.

2275
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,610
But he'll get in trouble
if I say this.

2276
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:06,360
I can't wait to hear it.

2277
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:07,980
Is it what happened
behind the camera?

2278
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,690
He's trying to make us curious.

2279
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,100
I'll stop after this.

2280
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,260
- I wonder what it is.
- Is the music playing?

2281
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,320
(The music is on.)

2282
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,320
- It's playing.
- He can't hear us.

2283
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,730
- Go.
- You may start.

2284
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:18,070
- Hey, you fool. Can you hear me?
- Tell us.

2285
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:19,570
- Can I really say this?
- Yes.

2286
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:20,970
- What?
- Isn't it better to say this later?

2287
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:22,230
- Tell us later.
- Is it about Eun Hye?

2288
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:23,330
- Honestly...
- We...

2289
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:24,940
- Did they date or not?
- I...

2290
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:27,310
- I guess it's about Eun Hye.
- Unless it's about Eun Hye,

2291
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:28,900
- I wouldn't talk so quietly.
- It's about Eun Hye.

2292
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:30,440
You're talking about Eun Hye
from the start?

2293
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,320
That's why I said
I'll talk about it later.

2294
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,110
I knew it. It's about Eun Hye.

2295
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:35,780
You're talking about Eun Hye
from the start?

2296
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:39,080
(He figured what it's about.)

2297
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:41,450
If we say Eun Hye, he can tell.

2298
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:42,560
Let's call her apple.

2299
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,080
- Apple?
- Apple?

2300
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,690
- Are you scared?
- How about Hye Eun?

2301
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:46,990
- Hye Eun.
- Hye Eun.

2302
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:49,620
- Hye Eun.
- Change her name.

2303
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:51,490
- I won't make this long.
- Hye Eun?

2304
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:52,990
No.

2305
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,690
Eun Hye texted me.

2306
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:56,970
- Really?
- Really?

2307
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:58,370
Eun Hye texted me.

2308
01:16:58,370 --> 01:16:59,810
(Twitching)

2309
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:01,570
- Really?
- I'll stop here.

2310
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:02,700
What did she say?

2311
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:03,770
- Will she come here?
- I can't tell the details.

2312
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:04,810
Did she tell you...

2313
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:06,370
- to stop talking about her?
- No.

2314
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:08,050
- "I'll appear in Running Man."
- That's what I thought.

2315
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:09,280
Did she say she'll say the truth?

2316
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,910
I thought about it a lot
in case she gets mad at me.

2317
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:14,690
- But she isn't like that.
- No?

2318
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:16,020
I talked to her on the phone.

2319
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,360
So what's the truth?

2320
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:19,020
- Is it true?
- I can't tell you.

2321
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:20,900
When things lighten up,
I'll tell you.

2322
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,100
He's listening.

2323
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:23,860
- Jae Suk.
- That punk...

2324
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:25,190
Jae Suk.

2325
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:26,640
(Flustered)

2326
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:28,700
(Spiteful)

2327
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,030
- Hey.
- Wait.

2328
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:32,480
He was listening the whole time,
wasn't he?

2329
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,680
- No. He doesn't know.
- Was he listening?

2330
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,810
- I think he's listening.
- He hasn't pressed it yet.

2331
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:36,070
He's guessing
by the shape of your mouth.

2332
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:37,610
- Isn't he listening?
- He's listening.

2333
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:39,570
- He's listening.
- Yes. He's listening.

2334
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:40,820
- Try.
- Is he listening?

2335
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:42,890
- He's listening.
- He's listening. Look.

2336
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:44,410
- Haha.
- He's listening.

2337
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:45,610
- You say it.
- What?

2338
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:47,110
Say, "You fool."

2339
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:48,760
He probably can't hear me.

2340
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,190
Are you that good at fights?

2341
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:52,260
- He's listening.
- Meet me at the rooftop.

2342
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:54,950
He can hear me. Gosh.

2343
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:58,440
(He can hear me.)

2344
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,600
- He can hear me.
- I think he pressed it.

2345
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:03,010
He looked at me
when you said my name.

2346
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,360
What are you looking at?

2347
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:06,900
- You can't play soccer.
- Can he hear us?

2348
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:10,310
(You can't play soccer.)

2349
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:11,570
- He can hear us.
- Why do you act like you're good?

2350
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:12,980
He can hear us. Look at his face.

2351
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:14,520
- Can you hear me?
- His expression changed.

2352
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:16,440
Can you hear me, Jong Kook?

2353
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,020
(The bad son made a big mistake.)

2354
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:21,320
Can you hear me?

2355
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:23,980
- He can hear us.
- I think he can hear us.

2356
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:26,150
- Can you hear me?
- See? He's listening.

2357
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:27,860
Are you listening to us?

2358
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:30,600
How can you make eye contact
with us?

2359
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,940
Jong Kook. Hey.

2360
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,160
My.

2361
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,360
He can hear us.

2362
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:35,830
- He can hear us.
- He can hear us.

2363
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,200
Do you prefer me or Yoon Eun Hye?

2364
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:42,440
(He laughs
at Ji Hyo's sudden question.)

2365
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,510
He can hear us.

2366
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:45,180
(Jong Kook can hear them.)

2367
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:46,440
He can hear us.

2368
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,720
- Jong Kook. Never mind.
- See?

2369
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,150
- Stop this.
- Let's stop.

2370
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:50,910
"Do you prefer me or Yoon Eun Hye?"

2371
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:52,060
He can hear us.

2372
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,190
- Really?
- He can hear us.

2373
01:18:54,190 --> 01:18:56,230
- Ji Hyo. That was crazy.
- He can hear us.

2374
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:57,730
- It's over.
- It's over.

2375
01:18:58,690 --> 01:18:59,900
- Hey.
- Wait.

2376
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:03,660
I can't play soccer? Hey.

2377
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,830
(This was expected.)

2378
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:07,140
Hey. Look.

2379
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:08,570
- You talked to her on the phone?
- He heard everything.

2380
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:09,940
- No.
- He heard the whole thing.

2381
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:11,270
- Did you talk to her on the phone?
- No.

2382
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,770
You better watch what you say on TV.

2383
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:16,150
- Okay.
- Will you?

2384
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,700
- Hey.
- Yes.

2385
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:19,440
- I'm good at fights.
- My goodness.

2386
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:22,320
Fight is the only thing I'm good at.

2387
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,240
- I'm well aware of it.
- Did he press it from the start?

2388
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,720
- Did he press it from the start?
- Yes, sir.

2389
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,080
- Jae Suk.
- Yes, sir.

2390
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,360
- Did he press it from the start?
- Even if...

2391
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:33,190
place last,
we already got everything.

2392
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:35,690
- I'm sorry.
- Watch what you say.

2393
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,970
What if people think it's true?

2394
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:42,230
- I'll delete Eun Hye's number.
- Attention.

2395
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:43,510
- Attention.
- I said, don't.

2396
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:45,570
- I'll delete Eun Hye's number.
- Don't.

2397
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:47,070
I haven't talked to her since.

2398
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,740
I said it was nice to talk to her
and hung up.

2399
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:51,770
I didn't talk to her about the show.

2400
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:53,820
Don't. You should know when to stop.

2401
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:54,870
- Yes.
- Know when to stop.

2402
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:57,580
I apologized to Eun Hye,
and she said it was okay.

2403
01:19:58,190 --> 01:19:59,580
- Okay. Rest.
- Yes.

2404
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:00,610
Yes, sir.

2405
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:02,690
- Hey.
- You're the best fighter ever.

2406
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:05,650
There's no rooftop here.
You're the best in the country.

2407
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:08,490
From a thug to a grand award winner.

2408
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:09,770
- Okay. Sit down.
- Thank you, sir.

2409
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:10,800
Hey.

2410
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,300
You're the Messi and the Ronaldo
of Tiger FC.

2411
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:14,490
The king of soccer!

2412
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:16,360
You never lose the ball.

2413
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,200
Don't talk about soccer.

2414
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,010
Just say I'm a terrible singer.

2415
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,940
The best soccer player.

2416
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:23,270
The best singer.
You're the best of all.

2417
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:24,810
Sit down.

2418
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:26,820
- You like Yoon Eun Hye.
- Hey.

2419
01:20:27,370 --> 01:20:28,690
- But...
- Don't do that.

2420
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:29,820
- But...
- You too.

2421
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:31,190
- Yes.
- Sit down.

2422
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:34,260
- He heard everything.
- He heard everything.

2423
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:35,520
- But how?
- He heard it from the start.

2424
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,520
From the start?

2425
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:37,580
He pressed it
as soon as he sat down.

2426
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,690
- He pressed it right away.
- I heard the whole thing.

2427
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:42,430
- His wife doesn't love him.
- Right.

2428
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:43,430
(Then they started
talking about Suk Jin.)

2429
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:46,330
- He's a beggar.
- He's a beggar.

2430
01:20:46,330 --> 01:20:47,800
- Big nose?
- You're a beggar.

2431
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,200
- Big nose.
- A better.

2432
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:51,470
He's a beggar with big boogers.

2433
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:53,310
You know Suk Jin is very stingy.

2434
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:54,510
- He's stingy.
- I know.

2435
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:56,310
- He's very narrow-minded.
- Right.

2436
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:57,310
Time's up.

2437
01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:00,720
Hey, your facial
expression was great.

2438
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,240
(He gets back at them.)

2439
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,050
- What was I like?
- A beggar?

2440
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:05,050
(The slander time is over.)

2441
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:06,560
- He pressed it early.
- A beggar?

2442
01:21:06,610 --> 01:21:08,150
I'm curious about Jae Suk.

2443
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:11,890
So the winner
of the last mission is...

2444
01:21:11,890 --> 01:21:13,490
(The winner
of the last mission is...)

2445
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:17,070
Suk Jin and Ji Hyo.

2446
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,320
- Really?
- Am I included?

2447
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,770
Suk Jin did it a lot.

2448
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:22,270
And the second place is
Jae Suk and So Min.

2449
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,270
Se Chan did a good job.

2450
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:26,070
And the third place is
Jong Kook and Haha.

2451
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:27,310
Okay. It's all right.

2452
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:29,050
I'll give you the last scratchcards.

2453
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,370
- We can do this.
- Let's do this.

2454
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,870
All right. The mission...

2455
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:35,050
So Min, why do you have so many?

2456
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:37,480
- Hey, you have so many.
- How many cards do you have?

2457
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:38,760
So Min is...

2458
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,280
- I bet she wrote a lot about me.
- No.

2459
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:43,450
Let's pick one.

2460
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:45,120
- It's random.
- This time...

2461
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,860
- I won't raise them.
- Jae Suk.

2462
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:49,300
(Se Chan has a 50-percent chance.)

2463
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:50,800
Jae Suk.

2464
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:54,100
Jae Suk!

2465
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:56,310
- Me?
- What? It's Haha.

2466
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:58,010
I need Haha. It's Haha.

2467
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:01,610
(Jae Suk won the lottery
with his 33-percent ticket.)

2468
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:04,110
Haha!

2469
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:05,180
That's amazing.

2470
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:06,910
(Ji Hyo has
a 50-percent scratchcard.)

2471
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,320
- She won.
- I won.

2472
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,280
Now please count the money
you have in your bags.

2473
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,780
And we will calculate
the money from scratchcards.

2474
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,860
Tell us how much money
you have in total.

2475
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:20,100
- I have 300 dollars.
- I have 330 dollars.

2476
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,600
- I have 670 dollars.
- I have 50 dollars.

2477
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,100
I have 324 dollars.

2478
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,940
I have 534 dollars.

2479
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:27,400
I have 781 dollars.

2480
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:31,160
Guys, before we announce the result,

2481
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:34,310
I'll let you exchange
your slander scratchcards for money.

2482
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:36,150
- Okay.
- I'll let you exchange.

2483
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:39,550
(They can turn the game around
with the slander scratchcards.)

2484
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:41,320
Look.

2485
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:44,280
Only 20 out of 100 tickets win.

2486
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:46,220
But So Min is...

2487
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:47,220
So Min is so mean.

2488
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:50,520
That's not it. I didn't get
a single scratchcard today.

2489
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,600
- You do have a lot of money.
- Three, four,

2490
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,600
five, six, and seven.
I hope that counts too.

2491
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,190
- Take this.
- She has seven cards.

2492
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:57,430
I hope it counts.

2493
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:01,690
(She wrote 8 pages of slanders.)

2494
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:04,530
You're unbelievable.

2495
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:07,980
- Here.
- I have two.

2496
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:09,400
(They get scratchcards based on
the number of slanders they wrote.)

2497
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:12,910
(This is what
Haha wrote about Se Chan.)

2498
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:14,220
(This is what
Ji Hyo wrote about Se Chan.)

2499
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:16,280
It has a 20-percent chance.

2500
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:17,520
Where should I get it?

2501
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,320
(This is what
Jong Kook wrote about Se Chan.)

2502
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:24,260
(If one of the scratchcards wins,
the ranks will change immediately.)

2503
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:25,690
- What?
- Why?

2504
01:23:25,690 --> 01:23:27,150
I have two Jong Kook.

2505
01:23:27,230 --> 01:23:28,260
Really?

2506
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,300
It's Jong Kook.

2507
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:31,300
You won?

2508
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:33,490
He's so lucky.

2509
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:34,900
- I have three.
- I know. I never won.

2510
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,270
- I'll take three.
- Give me them all at once.

2511
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:37,310
Let me scratch them.

2512
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:39,940
Darn it. It's a dud.

2513
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:42,270
(So Min bet her everything
on the slander scratchcards.)

2514
01:23:42,270 --> 01:23:44,050
Is this worth 200 dollars?

2515
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:46,440
- So Min didn't win.
- How many cards does she have?

2516
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,610
(She can turn the game around
with the 8 scratchcards.)

2517
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:49,890
- Are they all duds?
- She can turn the game around.

2518
01:23:49,890 --> 01:23:51,780
(Are they all duds?)

2519
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:53,190
- They all are duds.
- I have two Jong Kook.

2520
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:55,260
- Two Jong Kook.
- This is a dud.

2521
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:56,280
You should be a nice person.

2522
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:58,230
So Min has only one card left.

2523
01:23:58,230 --> 01:23:59,900
It must be a dud.

2524
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:01,100
(So Min has
only one scratchcard left.)

2525
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,270
(The last one of the 8 scratchcards)

2526
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:06,230
(What is the result?)

2527
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:08,100
It's a dud again!

2528
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,140
(All the 8 cards are duds.)

2529
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,070
(How unlucky)

2530
01:24:11,070 --> 01:24:13,510
You should be ready
to get the penalty today.

2531
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,980
This is ridiculous.
All eight tickets are duds.

2532
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:17,150
Really? All of them?

2533
01:24:17,150 --> 01:24:19,370
The first and second
will get the prize.

2534
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:22,150
The first place is Jae Suk
with 670 dollars.

2535
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:23,440
Am I the winner?

2536
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:25,050
- You picked good cards.
- At the last minute.

2537
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:28,390
The second place is Jong Kook
with 534 dollars.

2538
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:30,060
(No. 1: Jae Suk, No. 2: Jong Kook)

2539
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:31,080
- The prize.
- I was honest.

2540
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,990
Those two will bet the prize.

2541
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:34,690
The 5th is Ji Hyo with 300 dollars,

2542
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:36,400
and the 6th is So Min
with 50 dollars.

2543
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,660
So Min.

2544
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,800
She scratched eight cards.

2545
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,700
And Se Chan has 781 dollars.

2546
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:43,830
My gosh.

2547
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,810
I spent all my money.
I got 200 dollars...

2548
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:47,110
and spent 500 dollars.

2549
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:49,440
What is today's penalty?

2550
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:52,010
We had the low-frequency
patches earlier today.

2551
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,610
They should sing a song
with the patches on.

2552
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,740
- The birthday song?
- Yes, the birthday song.

2553
01:24:57,190 --> 01:25:00,080
Se Chan has 781 dollars,
so the prize he's getting is...

2554
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:03,190
- the beef set.
- Really?

2555
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,430
Thank you.

2556
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:07,520
Jae Suk who took first place
gets the pork set.

2557
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,190
And Jong Kook gets the chicken set.

2558
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:11,360
- Thank you.
- That's perfect.

2559
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,440
Jong Kook likes chicken better.

2560
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,190
- I like the prize.
- He likes it.

2561
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:18,660
- The low-frequency patches.
- Please bring them in.

2562
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,180
(The low-frequency patches are in.)

2563
01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:22,270
All the tickets
So Min got were duds.

2564
01:25:22,270 --> 01:25:24,310
- It's unbelievable.
- I thought one of them would win.

2565
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:26,720
So Min got eight scratchcards.

2566
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:30,080
That means she wrote
40 bad things about Se Chan.

2567
01:25:30,650 --> 01:25:32,860
How could she think of 40 things?

2568
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:34,650
She got eight cards,
but they all were duds.

2569
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:35,780
And I took first place twice.

2570
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:36,890
- Really?
- It was a 50-percent chance.

2571
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:38,020
But they were all duds.

2572
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:39,150
Ji Hyo is feeling it.

2573
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:40,150
Ji Hyo, what are you doing?

2574
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:41,900
- Ji Hyo is a good dancer.
- Are you happy?

2575
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:43,520
They are feeling it.
This is exciting.

2576
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,620
Good.

2577
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:47,140
Start.

2578
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:50,530
(Happy birthday to you)

2579
01:25:50,530 --> 01:25:53,940
- Happy birthday to you
- They use some vibrato.

2580
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:57,770
(The low-frequency duo sings
"Happy Birthday" with vibrato.)

2581

(The unlucky sisters' special
performance for Se Chan)

2582

Show us the robot dance.

2583
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:04,720
- The robot dance.
- Okay.

2584
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:06,890
They should be
on "Street Woman Fighter."

2585
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:10,150
(I've controlled Suk Jin
my whole life.)

2586
01:26:10,150 --> 01:26:11,580
(No. I'll convince him.)

2587
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,010
Which cell am I?

2588
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:15,690

(The six cells try
to make Suk Jin a top star.)

2593
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:26,590
(The cells recommend funny outfits
to make fun of him.)

2594
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:29,590
(I've always wanted
to wear things like this though.)

2595
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,830
(As soon as they encourage him,)

2596
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:33,960
(he accepts it.)

(Shut his mouth.)

2605

(The six cells have occupied
his weak body.)

2606
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:56,720
(He should pose as he's told.)

2607
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:59,620

as he's told.)
