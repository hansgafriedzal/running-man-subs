(A Monday morning
that is going to be a special day)

2
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,710
- Hello.
- Hey.

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,450
- Hello, Ji Hyo.
- Okay.

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,240
- This is cute.
- Okay.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,620
Okay.

(The members come in together
wearing hats.)

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,920
The hats are difficult to pull off.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,260
- What are we doing today?
- What is it?

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,620

but he doesn't know his place.)

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,170
You guys look like beggars today.

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,760
- The hat...
- The Beggar Special.

(Supposedly, she recently had
a haircut to get more sleep.)

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,640
- What's with So Min?
- What are we doing with the hats?

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,440
- I have a pigeon in here.
- Your head looks...

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,550
- A rabbit in here.
- like "The Simpsons."

18
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,910

(A romance expert
who learned love from books)

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,050
What are you? You're
dressed in ocher today.

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,650
And you're in pink,
but you look scary.

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,690
The scariest one is in pink.

good after a lower-body workout)

27
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,640
- He's scary.
- Shall we start?

28
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,530
- Look at him smiling.
- Terrifying.

29
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,440
Where are Jae Suk and Suk Jin?

30
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,080
- Suk Jin.
- The two old members.

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,170
- There he is.
- He always wears a hat like that.

32
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,810
- Jae Suk.
- Are you an archer?

33
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,640
- He looks like Jiangshi.
- Is this "Doctor Zhivago" or what?

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,810
Jae Suk, it looks like a thimble.

- He doesn't beat around the bush.
- Madam.

I feel like I should call you madam.

40
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,000
- It feels natural, right?
- Yes.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,470
- It looks good on you.
- You look good in the hat.

42
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,030
- Where's Mr. Ji?
- What?

43
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,590
- Why isn't Mr. Ji coming?
- I know.

44
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,840
I guess he's not coming today.

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,940
Is this a special episode
for Suk Jin?

46
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,610
- No way.
- Seriously?

47
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,440
- I guess that's true.
- A special episode for Suk Jin?

48
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,750
Today, we will
help gullible Suk Jin...

49
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,640
- So that's true.
- become more decisive.

It's called Suk Jin's Cells Race.

51

- Suk Jin's Cells?
- I see.

52
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,510
So we're cells.

53
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,190
Today, you will be Suk Jin's cells.

54
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,390
Every time Suk Jin needs
to decide something,

55
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,500
you will persuade him
to make a good decision.

56
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,420
- Are we supposed to persuade him?
- Is it like "Yoo Mi's Cells?"

57
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,020
I've controlled Suk Jin
my whole life.

58
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,700
Right. You're good at it.

59
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,540
- It's so easy for him.
- This is just meaningless.

60
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,170
Suk Jin is his marionette.

61
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,430
- He listens only to Jae Suk.
- If you force him into something...

62
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,510
too strongly,
he won't listen to you.

63
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,540
What should we do then?

64
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,910
- What?
- what do we do to convince him?

65
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,350
You just let something slip,
and he will bite into it.

66
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,320
- He doesn't like compliments.
- He doesn't.

67
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,110
- You just put a bait.
- Yes.

68
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,140
- So you fish him all the time.
- Of course.

69
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,420
Fish him?

70
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,710
So every time...

71
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,520
Suk Jin follows your decision,

72
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,130
you'll get Gullible Coin
for convincing him.

73
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,490
- I see.
- It will be tricky.

74
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,640
The more coins you win,
the better prizes you get.

75
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,330
But this is of great
advantage to Jae Suk.

76
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,040
- I think so.
- Because they're so close.

77
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,330
It's not like that.

78
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,010
- Suk Jin might change his mind.
- Above all things,

79
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,510
I'm in no mood
to convince him today.

80
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,770
Why not?

81
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,140
- That's just how I feel.
- But Suk Jin will still...

82
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,450
- You feel that way?
- Yes, I do.

83
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,480
- It can't be helped.
- It can happen sometimes.

84
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,510
I know.

85
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,890
Gullible Suk Jin will arrive soon.

86
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,360
First, you will be
his fashion cells...

87
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,260
and pick his outfit.

88
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,490
The clothes and accessories
picked by Suk Jin's stylist...

89
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,760
are behind you.

90
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,860
We have them here?

91
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,140
- I can imagine.
- I have many different clothes.

92
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,140
Once he arrives,
you should take him here right away.

93
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,170
And if he puts on what you
recommend, you will get coins.

94
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,740
- We dress him up.
- Does he know this is about him?

95
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,800
He knows roughly about it.

96
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,240
- Really?
- Then he'd want something special.

97
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,980
He will probably start acting
as soon as he gets here.

98
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,610
- Exactly.
- "What's going on?"

99
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,710
"Hey, what are you doing to me?"

100
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,210
"Why are you doing this to me?"

101
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,480
This is why I'm not
so thrilled about today's race.

102
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,980
- This is going to be...
- He will be so annoying.

103
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,330
- Right.
- You'll see. He won't act natural.

104
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,260
- I'm telling you.
- We're doomed.

105
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,490
You can't expect things
to be realistic today.

106
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,430
- We're doomed.
- It will be all fake.

107
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,040
It will be like a fake documentary.

108
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,960
- A fake documentary?
- A fake documentary.

109
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,830
Actually, after he found out
today would be about him,

110
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,450
he called our writer
almost every day.

111
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,550
- Did he ask for something?
- Seriously?

112
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,140
- He wants to be a star.
- He asked you to prepare something?

113
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,320
He's unbelievable.

114
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,080
He acted like a superstar.

115
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,920
If nothing else,
he can't make a superstar...

116
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,630
because he lacks refinement.

117
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,980
He does.

118
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,420
- He doesn't have the capacity...
- It's not about personality.

119
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,120
- He doesn't.
- He doesn't have...

120
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,690
- what it takes to be a star.
- He's not enough.

121
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,800
Actually, what he has now
is beyond his capacity.

122
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,600
- This is the maximum.
- I know.

123
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,230
He's got talents and everything.

124
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,630
He has a good personality.

125
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,130
But he lacks refinement.
He's a man of poor caliber.

126
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,170
This is beyond his capability.

127
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,280
- I feel bad for him.
- He's about to cave in.

128
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
He'll be here in a minute.

129
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,000
Why is he coming so late?

130
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,150
Is So Min wearing a large-size hat?
What's with her hat?

131
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,940
I know.

132
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,520
It doesn't look like Ji Hyo's.

133
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,220
- In the hat...
- It's like an elevator hat.

134
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,520
- That's because of my hair.
- Can you fold it a little?

135
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,620
You should fold it like Jae Suk.

136
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,360
- What's with your hat?
- That's because of my hair.

137
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,320
He'll get here
once he turns the corner.

138
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,620
You don't have to be so nervous.

139
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,060
- Right. No need to be cautious.
- What's the big deal?

140
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,400
He's not so important.

141
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,990
- It's not thrilling at all.
- I mean,

142
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,430
this isn't a prank or something.

143
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,970
Guys, he is very excited
about this. Just play along.

144
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,340
- Who is?
- Does he want a fanfare?

145
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,340
Should we toss him
in the air or something?

146
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,000
- Let's just get this over with.
- Or carry him with our arms?

147
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,610
- Okay.
- Just take it easy.

148
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,240
- Should we carry him around?
- This is no big deal.

149
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,310
What do we do?

150
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,050
(Today's superstar is coming.)

151
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,050
(Even the car looks
conscious of the camera.)

152
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,180
(It looks like he's all prepared.)

153
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,490
Guys, he has just arrived.

154
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,120
Please bring him in.

155
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,400
Should we bring him in?

156
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,190
- Bring him in?
- Do we have to?

157
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,540
My goodness.

158
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,990
Let's take it easy.

159
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,800
- Gosh.
- This is... My gosh.

160
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,000
You don't want to do this, do you?

161
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,340
No, I don't.

162
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,480
(They feel heavy-hearted
to see him get too excited.)

163
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,480
(A few of them get ready
to welcome the star.)

164
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,150
It's all dusty, but anyway.

165
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,650
He will love it. He will think
we prepared this for him.

166
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,650
Suk Jin, get off.

167
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,220
Suk Jin, get out of the car.

168
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,860
Suk Jin.

169
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,320
(There are a lot of cameras,
but he's still in his car.)

170
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,730
- There's a car coming. Come here.
- There's a car, So Min.

171
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,300
(The superstar shows up.)

172
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,420
Where are you going?

173
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,360
At the bakery...

174
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,130
I want to have some coffee.

175
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,770
Hello, Suk Jin.

176
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,360
- You're here.
- Hello, Suk Jin.

177
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
What's with your hat?

178
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,840
- Let's go.
- Where?

179
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,070
- Come here.
- Don't pretend you don't know.

180
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,500
- Know what?
- This is a special episode for you.

181
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,220
Obviously, you already know.

182
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,650
- Something's strange.
- No.

183
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,020
- Stop it.
- Why are you playing innocent?

184
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,480
He's playing innocent.

185
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,350
I can't believe this.

186
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,980
You're ruining this already.

187
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,180
- My gosh.
- Okay?

188
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,250
- Welcome.
- Suk Jin.

189
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,920
Ji Suk Jin.

190
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,250
Put this on.

191
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,100
Gosh, it hurts.

192
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,360
- You should throw a die.
- Why?

193
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,300
- One, two, and three.
- One, two, and three.

194
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,690
If you get five...

195
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,990
All right.

196
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,060
(The grand-scale
welcoming ceremony is over.)

197
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,270
They all came off.

198
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,300
- Why did you kick it?
- Why are you throwing a tantrum?

199
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,610
He pretends not to know anything.

200
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,150
Why are you playing innocent?
Since when you were in the car?

201
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,110
- I don't know anything.
- You kept calling them.

202
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,720
- We heard you kept calling them.
- And...

203
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,810
- What?
- I could tell...

204
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,170
- from your outfit.
- What about it?

205
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,090
- He's dressed up.
- He knew there would be...

206
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,180
- cameras around him.
- Why?

207
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,180
- He's all dressed up today.
- He's dressed up.

208
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,460
This is how I always look.

209
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,090
- No way.
- I was on other shows...

210
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,180
- looking like this.
- You're lying.

211
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,190
Why are you wearing
this dusty wreath?

212
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,860
That's...

213
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,270
Gosh, it hurts.

214
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,900
Why are you yelling?

215
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,190
Why are you upset?

216
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,430
It's all black. I like that.

217
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,970
I love black suits.

218
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,130
You know he always...

219
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,930
- carries his bag around.
- I know.

220
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,870
- This thing.
- His bag? You're right.

221
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,480
- He doesn't have it now.
- I left it in my car.

222
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,870
All right. Let me do it.

223
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,170
You're all dressed up.

224
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,290
You look great.

225
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,960
That's a magazine.

226
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,250
- A cartridge belt?
- It looks like a magazine.

227
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,980
(Variety Show Special Forces)

228
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,730
The microphone...

229
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,900
- Come here.
- That's unique.

230
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,030
- That's new.
- It's unique.

231
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,400
This is new, Suk Jin.

232
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,690
(His vision for variety shows
has been upgraded.)

233
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,100
This is new.

234
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,930
I know. This is novel.

235
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,410
- This is new.
- A variety show...

236
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,710
- is like a war.
- It's new.

237
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,130
- The microphone...
- I'm the first one to do this.

238
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,430
The microphone doesn't
always have to be on here.

239
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,070
- That's a stereotype.
- Of course.

240
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,480
We need Dong Geun here.
This is a cartridge belt.

241
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,350
(The upgraded item)

242
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,720
This is real.

243
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,740
- I know.
- Right above his lips.

244
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,980
The audio...

245
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,380
You look like Charlie Chaplin.

246
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,110
We can easily hear him now.

247
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,320
You're Charlie Chaplin.

248
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,530
- He likes it.
- This is quite new.

249
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,860
- I know.
- We can hear you well.

250
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,600
You're the star of the day.

251
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,670
- Stop it.
- We can hear him well.

252
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,730
I don't want to be the protagonist.

253
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,900
We heard that
you called them every day.

254
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,710
- Anyway...
- The writer called me,

255
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,110
- so I answered her questions.
- You knew what we'd be doing...

256
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,630
This really hurts.

257
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,150
Why are you playing innocent
when you know the whole thing?

258
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,910
So what are we doing today? Tell us.

259
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,810
As soon as Suk Jin got off,
he was like this.

260
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,440
"What's going on?"

261
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
(Poor acting)

262
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,550
Why...

263
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,790
- Why are you looking for cameras?
- Please, Suk Jin.

264
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,260
This is why...

265
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,760
I didn't want to do this.

266
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,950
Stop it.

267
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,220
You know what we're doing today.
Why are you playing innocent?

268
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,500
Didn't you come here
and rehearse it yesterday?

269
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,060
Why would I rehearse?

270
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,590
Today, for Suk Jin
who is easily swayed...

271
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,560
by others all the time,

272
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,970
- the six cells are here together.
- I see.

273
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,380
Now the cells will...

274
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,440
recommend good outfits
for today to Suk Jin.

275
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,120
- I have something in mind.
- For today?

276
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,880
We will recommend
some outfits to you then.

277
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,310
- Okay. But I get to decide.
- You make the decision.

278
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,450
I bet his stylist brought
a lot of unique outfits.

279
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,050
- Because...
- My goodness.

280
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,390
- Suk Jin is...
- We should be serious.

281
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,590
Suk Jin.

282
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,850
Suk Jin, I love this one.

283
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,350
His stylist...

284
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,820
There are a lot of fancy clothes.
Look at the shoes.

285
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,930
They look cool.

286
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,770
(The place has a lot of fancy items
like a select shop.)

287
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,200
(There are a lot of
nice outfits for a superstar.)

288
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,470
- I love these shoes.
- They are nice.

289
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,740
You should definitely wear them.

290
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,250
Suk Jin, I know what you'd want.

291
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,700
- Suk Jin, today is...
- All right.

292
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,920
a special day for you.

293
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,840
Suk Jin would
love things like this.

294
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,290
I don't look good in it.

295
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,890
- Suk Jin.
- Seriously, it's not for me.

296
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,310
- Suk Jin.
- One person at a time.

297
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,710
- You should try the hats first.
- Look.

298
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,950
This is how it looks.

299
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,920
Actually, I like that.

300
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,080
It looks good on you.

301
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,720
That's nice.

302
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,030
Suk Jin, you should try this on.

303
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,820
This is what Yong Jin does.

304
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,830
Seriously, it's really popular.

305
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,270
- Everyone in "SWF" wears it.
- Everyone wears it.

306
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,830
It's really popular these days.

307
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,200
- It's so cool.
- It's a brand-name hat.

308
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,430
- I know that.
- Just try it on.

309
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,910
- Jae Suk...
- My gosh.

310
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,280
- Suk Jin.
- You have to wear this.

311
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,840
- You look good.
- "You should try it on."

312
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,120
It looks great on you.

313
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,520
- "You should try it on."
- "You should try it on."

314
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,650
Do you mean that?

315
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,990
"You're the protagonist."

316
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,450
Say it one by one.
What do you think?

317
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,990
- It looks perfect.
- Give it a score.

318
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,260
It's over 90 points.

319
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,890
- Show the mark.
- You have to go with that.

320
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,290
I have an outfit in mind.

321
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,000
- I think...
- This is what I recommend.

322
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,820
- I think the fedora is better.
- What do you think?

323
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,090
- It doesn't look good on you.
- It doesn't? What about you?

324
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,500
- I'll go with a fedora.
- You?

325
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,040
I was seriously going to punch you.

326
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,870
I knew it. It's strange.

327
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,510
You look like
a Turkish ice cream seller.

328
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,060
- I knew it.
- Suk Jin, today is your day.

329
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,470
It doesn't look good on you.

330
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,300
- Look at the brand name.
- My gosh.

331
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,970
You don't know much about fashion.

332
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,380
Do you not wear a beanie at all?

333
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,470
A beanie is...

334
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,520
You can put slightly on your head.

335
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
Suk Jin.

336
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,750
- It will be okay.
- I don't wear a beanie...

337
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,120
because the shape of my head
isn't so pretty.

338
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,150
Look.

339
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,160
- Just put it slightly on your head.
- It looks pretty that way.

340
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,310
- Like this.
- It looks pretty.

341
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,820
- This is what you should do.
- It looks nice that way.

342
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,260
See? Just put it on like this.

343
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,130
- You can still show the bangs.
- Right.

344
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,400
Let me try it on.

345
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,820
(Let me try it on.)

346
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,420
What's wrong with you?

347
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,830
- Seriously...
- Why are you wearing it?

348
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,090
Do you like fashion?

349
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,330
Just look.

350
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,870
This is so pretty.

351
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,270
- What's wrong with this?
- Seriously?

352
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,700
- This isn't strange.
- It is strange.

353
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,240
- All right then.
- What's wrong with this?

354
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,510
- Let me pick the clothes first.
- It's not bad.

355
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,880
- It looks good on you.
- It looks good.

356
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,750
- Suk Jin, this is nice.
- You look good.

357
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,020
What are you doing?

358
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,170
What's wrong?

359
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,520
Suk Jin, you should
look into a mirror.

360
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,580
Hey, get rid of this!

361
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,290
- This is nice.
- You look good. Where's a mirror?

362
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,080
- This is nice.
- There's no mirror.

363
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,260
- This is good.
- It looks good, doesn't it?

364
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,050
- This is pretty.
- Are you serious?

365
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,550
- He never lies.
- Suk Jin,

366
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,000
why did you not wear it before?

367
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,190
- It looks really strange.
- Let's pick something powerful.

368
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,420
- This isn't bad.
- Seriously.

369
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,130
- You look really good.
- It's not that bad.

370
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,560
- I know.
- It's not bad. Seriously.

371
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,700
- You look young.
- Just tidy your hair a little.

372
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,930
Fine! Stay quiet!

373
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,600
Let me pick clothes first.

374
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,470
Suk Jin, let's go
with this colorful one.

375
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,440
- That looks nice.
- You should pick brand-name goods.

376
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,970
- Suk Jin.
- One person at a time.

377
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,550
- One by one.
- I picked something for you.

378
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,120
- This is it.
- Right. I agree.

379
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,940
- They will go well with the beanie.
- But...

380
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,180
But with this hat.

381
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,710
You should wear these
on a day like today.

382
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,760
You can wear them
only when there are cameras.

383
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,030
- This is a famous brand.
- Actually,

384
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,550
- I wanted to try things like this.
- This is...

385
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,260
- I know.
- I wanted to try this,

386
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,090
but it is too much for me.

387
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,590
So if you force me...

388
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,270
Suk Jin, you will spend
all day in that suit.

389
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,800
This is pretty.

390
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,830
- Suk Jin.
- Isn't this nice?

391
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,410
You should pick
something simple like this.

392
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,780
You will be wearing it
the whole day.

393
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,740
He wore something
like that last week.

394
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,300
- This is...
- This is what you wore last week.

395
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,780
It looks cold.

396
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,120
Suk Jin.

397
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,380
- What?
- This is your style.

398
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,290
- It's perfect.
- Isn't it for KCM?

399
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,550
- This is your favorite style.
- It's KCM.

400
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,890
Will you pick one each?

401
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,080
Stand here with what you picked.

402
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,520
You guys are being so loud.

403
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,050
Look at this.

404
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,180
- Leather.
- Suk Jin.

405
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,420
Suk Jin, you should wear shorts.

406
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,670
Suk Jin.

407
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,690
- Forget about it.
- Why?

408
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,560
- That doesn't make sense.
- You can wear socks.

409
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,740
- Hey.
- They will go well together.

410
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,270
- Get out.
- What?

411
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,040
- Why?
- Who do you think I am?

412
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,740
Now that he keeps being like this,

413
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,100
I'm a little annoyed.

414
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,200
He's not listening to me.

415
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,340
I'm just trying to pick what I want.

416
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,780
But it's taking too long.

417
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,880
Do I have to listen to you?

418
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,580
Just pick anything.

419
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,580
Do I have to listen to what you say?

420
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,850
- This is so tacky.
- No, it's not.

421
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,790
- Seriously, I think this is cool.
- This is better.

422
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,390
- Like this.
- It's not cool at all.

423
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,800
- It is cool.
- Don't be ridiculous.

424
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,000
You wear them.

425
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,960
- That's not good.
- They're not talking to you.

426
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,460
This is a special episode for you.

427
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,370
Actually, this makes me feel bad.

428
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,690
Cut the chitter.

429
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,040
- "Chitter?"
- "Chitter?"

430
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,100
Cut the chitter.

431
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,380
- "Chitter?"
- "Chitter?"

432
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,800
- What is he talking about?
- "Chitter?"

433
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,700
- What is chitter?
- Are you Chitter?

434
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,940
Suk Jin, are you talking to me?

435
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,970
- Who's Chitter here?
- Hey, Chitter?

436
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,620
- Am I Chitter?
- Are you Chitter?

437
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,710
- Am I Chitter?
- Let's say you are.

438
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,450
- I'll stop talking.
- Okay. You should.

439
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,660
I'm Yang Chitter now.

440
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,160
Suk Jin, this is leather.

441
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,260
Leather? But it's...

442
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,420
- A turtleneck sweater.
- But it feels uncomfortable.

443
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,900
- Then you can wear only this.
- Seriously, it's uncomfortable.

444
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,170
- Without anything underneath.
- I can't wear a turtleneck sweater.

445
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,640
- I brought this because it's cold.
- It's itchy.

446
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,800
Suk Jin, if you're cold,
what about a bench coat?

447
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,510
That's a good idea.

448
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,930
- Hey, I'm a celebrity.
- You said it was cold.

449
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,200
Suk Jin.

450
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,250
I'm a celebrity.
I'm supposed to be fashionable.

451
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,550
Suk Jin, what about a bench coat?

452
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,420
- Suk Jin.
- Okay.

453
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,970
- I'll dress like a celebrity.
- All right!

454
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,250
- I want to look like a celebrity.
- This is it.

455
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,580
This is how a celebrity looks.

456
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,710
I'll dress like a celebrity.

457
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,810
You need leopard-print shoes.

458
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,720
You should definitely wear these.

459
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,950
Can you go around Gangnam
in those shoes?

460
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,260
- Okay. I'll wear them.
- Okay.

461
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,800
- Good. I'll look like a celebrity.
- These are the shoes.

462
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,350
- I'll dress like a celebrity.
- You're so broad-minded.

463
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,300
- I'll look like a celebrity.
- Suk Jin.

464
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,430
You should wear these.

465
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,640
What are you talking about?

466
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,560
- These look good though.
- They do look good.

467
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,100
These are just...

468
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,140
To be honest,

469
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,880
- this is a better fashion choice.
- Of course, it is.

470
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,910
He listens only to Jae Suk.

471
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,470
- I mean...
- You should wear these.

472
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,050
To be honest, these are
better than them.

473
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,210
- These are better.
- This is sophisticated.

474
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,790
- They are tacky.
- These are so pretty.

475
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,020
If you wear them...

476
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,080
These will make you
look like a celebrity.

477
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,530
These are what a celebrity wears.

478
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,030
I can't wear these all day.

479
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,450
- This is better.
- He's right.

480
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,800
They are high-heeled. I'll be tired.

481
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,670
Suk Jin, it's cold. Why don't you
wear a turtleneck sweater?

482
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,090
- A turtleneck sweater sounds good.
- I know. Wear a turtleneck sweater.

483
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,640
The black one.

484
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,240
- You should wear a turtleneck.
- Okay.

485
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,670
Because it's cold today.

486
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,240
- Seriously, this is...
- It's cold.

487
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
He is so gullible.

488
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,380
- This is soft. It's not itchy.
- It is soft.

489
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,910
Okay. I'll wear a turtleneck.

490
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,380
Let's go with them.
I'll go get changed.

491
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,570
Okay. Go get changed.

492
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,570
The shoes look good
with the clothes.

493
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,120
(There are cameras everywhere
in the dressing room.)

494
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,340
There's no place where I can change.

495
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,050
- Suk Jin.
- There is no camera.

496
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,390
Where?

497
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,660
I'll cover you.

498
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,850
That might be better.

499
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,000
There's no camera in there.

500
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,160
- Act naturally, Suk Jin.
- Hey.

501
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,920
- What's the matter?
- This is a fake documentary.

502
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,720
- That's funny.
- Think that there's no camera.

503
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,690
I see three cameras in there,
but he keeps saying there's none.

504
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,410
- Just think that there's no camera.
- Where should I get changed?

505
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,830
A TV celebrity wouldn't mind.

506
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,910
Oh, boy.

507
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,100
Right. I should dress as a top star.

508
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,670
Good. I'll dress as a top star.

509
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,780
- Will we recommend him food too?
- Yes, you will.

510
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,210
- They probably prepared menus.
- Of course.

511
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,020
- You will have to convince him...
- Jae Suk must know...

512
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,580
- Suk Jin's food preferences too.
- Jae Suk must know that.

513
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,810
- He's a picky eater.
- Of course, I know what he likes.

514
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,660
- Based on the weather...
- Gosh.

515
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,320
- and his condition,
- Yes.

516
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,850
- I can tell what he wants to eat.
- It seems to me...

517
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,720
- that since you've trained him,
- True.

518
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,460
he keeps worrying
about what you think.

519
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,960
- That's true. I could see that.
- Yes.

520
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,830
- That's not true.
- He'd only take Jae Suk's advice.

521
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,830
But I know Suk Jin very well.
I know what he likes.

522
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,170
It's not easy to convince Suk Jin.

523
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,700
We should make him put on a hat.

524
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,170
Gosh, this mic is annoying.

525
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,280
Gosh, this turtleneck is
so uncomfortable.

526
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,470
- Look at him.
- Hey, you look amazing.

527
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,550
(How could Superstar Ji look
in the clothes his cells chose?)

528
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,630
Gosh, this mic is annoying.
The turtleneck is uncomfortable.

529
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,050
Hey, can I wear the jacket
you showed me earlier?

530
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,630
- This is so uncomfortable.
- You look amazing.

531
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,920
No. It's so uncomfortable.

532
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,290
- I can't put on my mic on it.
- You look great.

533
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,320
The turtleneck was a bad choice.

534
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,530
- That's not true.
- Suk Jin.

535
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,060
- You look fabulous.
- You look like a trot singer.

536
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,040
- Suk Jin.
- You look like a trot singer.

537
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,110
You look great in that turtleneck.

538
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,640
- This is how a trot singer dresses.
- You're wrong.

539
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,930
- It's so uncomfortable.
- This isn't how a superstar looks.

540
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,980
- You can put your mic here.
- I'm at Sangsu Station

541
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,280
- Put it on here.
- You're at Mangwon Station

542
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,040
(Pleasing his fans)

543
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,880
- Do we have a clip, by any chance?
- He looks like a trot singer.

544
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,250
I think I've seen a man who dresses
like that on "What on Earth."

545
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,680
- I've seen him too.
- Right?

546
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,450
A man who likes to wear
flashy clothes appeared on the show.

547
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,990
Hey, why do you keep making me...

548
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,490
Suk Jin, you look great.
I like how you look.

549
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,530
- How about you put on a necklace?
- Can I have jjamppong, please?

550
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,180
- Gosh, seriously.
- I'll have jjamppong.

551
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,130
- This isn't right. Why...
- Ji Hyo.

552
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,900
- Ji Hyo, the necklace... Oh, good.
- That doesn't look good.

553
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,060
- Layering two necklaces is better.
- Okay. I'll wear necklaces.

554
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,360
- Two necklaces.
- I thought something was missing.

555
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,360
- But Suk Jin...
- Suk Jin, wear a beanie instead.

556
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,540
- Right, I'll take this off.
- That doesn't look good.

557
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,240
- Put the beanie on him.
- This will go well with his outfit.

558
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,510
I'll put it at the back
of your head.

559
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,070
- Wait, you guys.
- Suk Jin doesn't like... Listen.

560
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,710
There's something you don't know.

561
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,400
See? I knew he would take
Jae Suk's advice.

562
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,540
- Suk Jin hates flat front hair.
- I don't look good in it.

563
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,880
- True. Don't make him wear it.
- He likes to keep it up?

564
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,220
- Correct.
- It's not like that.

565
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,920
- That's why he styles his hair up.
- I won't put it on.

566
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,310
- I won't put the hat on.
- But try it at the back.

567
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,020
- No, I don't want to.
- Try it and look in the mirror.

568
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,350
He does everything
that Jae Suk suggests.

569
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,260
- Now, check yourself in the mirror.
- Is he Jae Suk's son?

570
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,230
He's like a good son
who listens to his dad.

571
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,770
- He's acting like Jae Suk's son.
- You look well-proportioned in it.

572
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,290
Right? What do you think, Suk Jin?

573
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,830
- It makes you look...
- It does make me look younger.

574
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,890
You look much younger.

575
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,670
- You look great, Suk Jin.
- Do I?

576
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,630
What is this?
Is this Jae Suk's special?

577
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,680
This isn't fair.

578
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,300
- Don't be like that.
- The best outfit in a few months.

579
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,040
I like it. I wanted to dress
like a top star.

580
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,370
You do look like a top star.

581
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,220
- All right.
- You look fabulous.

582
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,380
The star of the day Suk Jin has
chosen his outfit for today.

583
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,420
Yes.

584
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,490
- He looks great.
- I want to dress like a top star.

585
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,050
For the first time, I feel distant
from Suk Jin.

586
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,230
I feel like I'm star struck.

587
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,390
- Come on. Stop it.
- Everyone will recognize him.

588
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,390
- We counted the fashion items...
- I like the outfit.

589
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,430
that each of you recommended
to Suk Jin.

590
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,830
The number of the items he chose
as Jae Suk recommended...

591
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,700
is 4 out of 5.

592
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,800
(Jae Suk convinced him to choose
4 out of 5 items he recommended.)

593
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,300
- That's unbelievable.
- He's practically...

594
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,040
- Jae Suk's son.
- Exactly.

595
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,100
- He's practically Jae Suk's son.
- That's not true.

596
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,540
He's like Jae Suk's son Ji Ho.

597
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,840
He's Jae Suk's son.

598
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,040
- Two of Jong Kook's were chosen.
- I see.

599
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,680
- Three of Haha's were chosen.
- Okay.

600
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,810
I chose that many items
that Haha recommended?

601
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,310
And he chose one item
that Ji Hyo recommended.

602
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,450
Three of So Min's were chosen.

603
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,610
So Min did a good job.

604
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,260
Se Chan convinced him to choose
two items he recommended.

605
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,620
That's correct,
including the jacket.

606
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,320
- I'd like to apply some hand cream.
- I'll give you some.

607
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,760
- She has hand cream.
- Do you?

608
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,390
It'd be funny if Suk Jin goes
around by himself in that outfit.

609
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,530
Suk Jin, I have hand cream too.

610
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,670
- Suk Jin.
- Here you go, Suk Jin.

611
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,200
- Suk Jin, here's hand cream.
- Hey.

612
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,240
- Stop it.
- I'll give you my hand cream.

613
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,790
(He's giving Suk Jin toothpaste.)

614
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,210
- That's enough.
- This is a special episode.

615
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,270
- I said, enough.
- He should apply this.

616
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,600
Suk Jin, apply this
since it's your special.

617
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,070
- That's perfect.
- Right?

618
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,340
It'd be so refreshing.

619
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,540
Stop it.

620
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,540
(The special hand cream
for the star of the day)

621
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,340
- Give me a chance.
- It'd smell great.

622
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,840
- Absolutely. It'd be refreshing.
- Indeed.

623
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,340
- That'd be funny, I must say.
- Exactly. Apply this instead.

624
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,580
- What a shame.
- It would've been funny.

625
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,610
I wish he had applied it.

626
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,460
As the six members just helped
Suk Jin choose his outfit,

627
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,530
they will be Suk Jin's cells today,

628
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,970
and will influence his decisions.

629
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

630
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,200
The cells will receive coins
when he takes their advice.

631
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,540
You can exchange the coins you saved
for prize balls.

632
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,040
And at the end, the number
of your prize balls...

633
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,300
will affect the draw for deciding
two winners...

634
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,710
and one person to get a penalty.

635
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,640
(2 winners and 1 person to get
a penalty will be chosen.)

636
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,870
What penalty do you want?

637
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,680
- Do we get to decide?
- Yes.

638
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,190
- How about no penalty at all?
- I have an idea.

639
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,310
- Right.
- No.

640
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,650
- Let's exempt ourselves from it.
- Let's do that.

641
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,720
Is that allowed?

642
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,960
- It's up to us. We won, you know.
- Yes. It's up to us.

643
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,080
- I agree.
- No penalty today.

644
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,260
How about the one in last place
wear Suk Jin's outfit next week?

645
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,790
- That's a good idea.
- Dress exactly the same as him...

646
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,000
at the opening next week.

647
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,700
- I like the idea.
- As a penalty.

648
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,290
- I'd hate to dress like that.
- Wearing his outfit next week.

649
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,500
- Wearing this outfit.
- I love the idea.

650
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,670
Gosh, I hate it.

651
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,210
- Exactly the same as he's dressed.
- Yes.

652
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,300
Jong Kook would have to make
a new one since it doesn't fit him.

653
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,600
That would be a lot of work.

654
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,070
I must avoid getting the penalty.

655
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,540
- It's the worst even for a guest.
- Indeed.

656
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,600
It's the worst.

657
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:21,310
Also, there are different rules
only for Suk Jin.

658
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,340
Okay.

659
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,420
You will take the cells' advice...

660
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,820
to make mock stock investments
until the end of the race.

661
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,050
- Stock investments?
- Yes.

662
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,890
You will make
mock stock investments.

663
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,960
- Stock investments?
- Yes.

664
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,500
He's getting excited.

665
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Suk Jin smiled while saying,
"Stock investments?"

666
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,290
Cells, read the given stock charts
to advise him. It's virtual.

667
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,940
- You'll receive 10,000 dollars.
- Got it.

668
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,100
The return you make will decide
the prize or the penalty you'll get.

669
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,300
- For me?
- They prepared everything he likes.

670
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,100
- It's Suk Jin's special for sure.
- That sounds fun.

671
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,210
- Thank you.
- It'll be fun.

672
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,520
- This is his schedule for today.
- Thanks.

673
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,780
- "Photoshoot and interview".
- What?

674
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,490
"Eating at his regular restaurant
and hosting an event".

675
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,490
"Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong
shopping for a gift for his wife".

676
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,290
- Why a photoshoot?
- Great.

677
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,620
- That's nice.
- He'll pose in that outfit?

678
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,620
- He looks great.
- He seems happy.

679
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,000
Where can we see his photos?

680
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,790
We'll use his photos
for several purposes.

681
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,790
He'll have a photoshoot
looking like that.

682
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,270
Now, let's go inside and continue.

683
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,040
- Okay.
- Let's go inside. It's so cold.

684
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,360
- Hey, Se Chan.
- Yes, Jong Kook.

685
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,560
You should hurry up and vote.

686
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,040
- What do you mean?
- The soccer club.

687
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,710
- Oh, for this week?
- Yes.

688
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,180
Oh, I see. I wondered
what you were talking about.

689
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,480
I saw that you hadn't voted.

690
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,950
- Right. I'm afraid...
- I voted already.

691
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,680
- I don't think I can make it.
- Whether or not you'll be there...

692
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,290
You missed it last week too.

693
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,040
True. But I'm going to drink
with some friends.

694
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,760
- You'll have a drink?
- I mean...

695
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,580
You'll miss the soccer game
to have a drink?

696
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,050
(You'll miss the soccer game
just to have a drink?)

697
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,820
The restrictions related to COVID-19
have finally been dropped.

698
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,890
- So I'll meet some friends.
- That's not acceptable. You guys...

699
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,790
I can't believe this.

700
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,540
Shall I introduce you
to someone I know?

701
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,540
Who?

702
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,270
He can make a fake leg cast.

703
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,180
He's really good at that.

704
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,480
Jae Suk, he'll need to submit
a medical certificate too.

705
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,870
- Really?
- He should submit it.

706
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,180
Then it won't work. He can't forge
a medical certificate.

707
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,750
- That won't work.
- I'll introduce you to him anyway.

708
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,220
- I need my legs to move freely.
- He's good at making a fake cast.

709
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,650
You can still come
to cheer for our team, can't you?

710
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,960
Exactly. You should submit
a medical certificate.

711
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,930
He's really good at making
a fake cast.

712
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,080
That was totally unexpected.

713
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,620
He startled me.

714
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,620
- What?
- What is this?

715
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,820
- Oh, the stock investment?
- Now,

716
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,770
we'll begin
the mock stock investment...

717
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,790
that will save Suk Jin
who failed as a stock investor...

718
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,290
because he let others
sway him too easily.

719
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,330
- All right. Let's do this.
- I see that the stock items...

720
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,680
- The stock items are real.
- That's a lot.

721
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,040
- Is the market currently...
- Yes, it's a real-time chart.

722
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,210
- These are the real-time prices?
- Yes, they're the real prices.

723
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:32,110
- Suk Jin, you have 10,000 dollars.
- Yes.

724
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,610
You can invest as much as you want
until the end of the race...

725
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,020
with some advice from the cells.

726
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,260
But the market is not
doing well today.

727
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,350
He knows much about stocks.

728
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:44,090
- Due to the new virus variant,
- I don't even know how to read it.

729
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,760
- overseas stocks dropped sharply.
- Now...

730
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,820
- There are always some going up.
- You can hit the jackpot...

731
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,000
You must turn the crisis
into an opportunity.

732
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,630
- He likes day trading.
- When the market is doing bad...

733
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,830
- And he likes...
- I'm not a day trader.

734
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,400
You like to make risky investments.

735
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,370
I usually buy stocks
that don't fluctuate much...

736
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,870
- But I have only one day, right?
- Correct.

737
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,040
- Stocks like this are good.
- How about K company?

738
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,310
- That's...
- You should buy at a low price.

739
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,450
- You should make a high return.
- Exactly.

740
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,720
- For example...
- Aren't you guys listening to me?

741
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,290
- Only you are listening to me.
- Buy one that'll rise rapidly.

742
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,310
- I have only one day, right? So...
- Until the market closes.

743
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,150
Suk Jin, how about this company?

744
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,050
- Hey.
- You like this company.

745
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,350
I suffered a huge loss
when I invested in that company.

746
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,460
How's the price going today?

747
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,390
Oh, gosh. I bought their stocks
for a little more than 20 dollars,

748
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,200
- Is this refer to A company?
- and then...

749
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,730
I sold them for 11 dollars.

750
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,130
(He calmly told the story
of losing 50 percent.)

751
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,830
Suk Jin, it's
14 dollars and 50 cents now.

752
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,210
- Is that so?
- The price is...

753
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,770
Blue means an increase, right?

754
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,180
- Blue means a decrease.
- I see.

755
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,440
- Gosh.
- Red means an increase.

756
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,450
How can I take his advice?

757
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,450
Suk Jin, you should
take a look at this.

758
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,980
- What is it?
- It dropped but rebounded.

759
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,020
It's day trading.

760
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,290
It seems like a good investment
since it's a large-cap stock.

761
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,150
- No, I don't think so.
- I don't see it.

762
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,790
- Today,
- He never listens to others.

763
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,320
I'll invest
in small and medium cap stocks.

764
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,290
Suk Jin rarely buys
large-cap stocks.

765
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,560
The thing about large-cap stocks...

766
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,770
- He buys unknown stocks.
- He invests in unknown stocks.

767
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,860
- This one went up 15 dollars.
- Really?

768
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,800
It went up 15 dollars today.

769
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,740
- Which one?
- It's an advanced material company.

770
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,210
What's the percentage?

771
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,900
- Suk Jin.
- It's 2.4 percent.

772
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,310
Check this company out.

773
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,520
That one seems to have
a good chance of going up.

774
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,490
- Oh, it refers to the market cap?
- Trust me.

775
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,880
- Okay.
- Just check how much it went up.

776
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,810
Only this game company's
stock price increased, Suk Jin.

777
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:24,320
- Oh, I get it. If the pandemic...
- It's a pandemic-sensitive stock.

778
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
If the pandemic gets worse,
people will have to stay at home.

779
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,270
- They'll just play games at home.
- In any case...

780
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,700
- Then the stock price will go up.
- You're right.

781
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,330
You see, it's
a pandemic-sensitive stock.

782
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,600
Omicron has been detected, you know.

783
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,980
Suk Jin, it's strange.
This mobile carrier is going up.

784
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,440
- The mobile carrier?
- Yes.

785
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,180
- It's going up continuously.
- You must choose wisely.

786
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,280
I think it's a good investment.
Due to the pandemic,

787
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,070
people must use their phones
more often to talk to one another.

788
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,420
The pandemic situation is
really serious, you know.

789
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,260
Suk Jin, superbug-related stocks
seem to be going up.

790
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,530
- Suk Jin, check this one out.
- Yes?

791
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,390
- In only one day...
- It's day trading.

792
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,590
- My, it went up 16 percent.
- It's good, right?

793
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,170
- It could hit the upper limit.
- Blue...

794
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,440
Blue means an increase, right?

795
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
Suk Jin, you should buy
the mobile carrier's stocks.

796
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,240
Due to the outbreak
of the new virus variant,

797
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,800
- people use their phones so often.
- True.

798
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,540
- Look. It just went up one percent.
- But...

799
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,600
- It went up in only ten minutes.
- Exactly.

800
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,980
- What are you going to do?
- It's okay.

801
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,180
- That's not good enough for me.
- Suk Jin, come on.

802
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,280
It just went down to 8.6.
I should buy it now.

803
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,920
It was a little over nine
just before.

804
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,650
- I've made my decision.
- What did you buy?

805
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,150
- I'll invest in S company.
- See? I knew it.

806
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,490
- I'll invest 10,000 dollars in it.
- Who...

807
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,490
(He invests all 10,000 dollars
to S company.)

808
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,290
- Who recommended the company?
- I did.

809
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,390
You'll invest all you have in it?

810
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,700
Look how focused Suk Jin is.

811
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,590
- This is so fascinating, right?
- Indeed.

812
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,000
I see why investors can't sleep
at night.

813
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,900
- I wouldn't be able to sleep.
- I don't think I can do it.

814
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,800
- I think I shouldn't try it.
- Right.

815
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,870
All right. Suk Jin made
an investment.

816
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,980
You can advise him to sell it
and buy something else later.

817
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,980
Got it.

818
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,920
Now, Suk Jin will have
a magazine photoshoot...

819
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,580
- and an interview.
- Yes.

820
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,650
I'm small

821
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,080
(The first item on Suk Jin's
schedule is coming up shortly.)

822
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,990
- Exactly.
- Did Suk Jin already lose money?

823
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,690
It's between minus 50
and minus 60 dollars.

824
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,850
(The stock Suk Jin bought is
going down.)

825
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,050
Is that true?

826
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,650
- Darn it.
- Did he lose money already?

827
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,790
Suk Jin, it'll go up again.

828
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,030
Suk Jin, do you think
you can focus on the shoot?

829
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,200
Of course. It's only
minus 50 dollars. That's okay.

830
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,600
- Think that you treated us.
- Exactly. That's what I'll do.

831
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,710
The money you lose will be
deducted from your pay.

832
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,900
(It'll be deducted from your pay.)

833
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,710
That would be awful.

834
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,710
- He'd lose a lot of money.
- Oh, man.

835
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,280
Jae Suk, check the price
of your stock.

836
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,450
I bet it went up.

837
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,690
See? What did I tell you?

838
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,750
Why? Did it go up?

839
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,960
I'm already up by
14 dollars and 30 cents.

840
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,580
- Let me check mine.
- When I saw...

841
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,690
that it was rebounding
after dropping,

842
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,790
- I knew it was a good investment.
- How should I check it?

843
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,030
- I told you so.
- I'm up by 18 dollars and 40 cents.

844
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,060
- Is mine going up too?
- The beginners made a profit too.

845
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,790
- I made a profit too.
- Twenty-five dollars?

846
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,830
I'm currently at minus 64 dollars.

847
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,290
Oh, no.

848
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,600
(He's bad at making mock investments
as well.)

849
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,870
Everyone, forget about the stocks
for the time being.

850
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,250
- I'm losing more than 60 dollars.
- He can't focus on the shoot.

851
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,710
Every second matters.

852
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,300
Hang on. Should I sell it now?

853
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,180
Why would you sell it already?

854
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,950
I'm losing 60 dollars.

855
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,580
- We'll begin the first event.
- Okay.

856
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,850
He's scheduled for a photoshoot...

857
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,190
- and an interview with a magazine.
- Right.

858
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,580
We'll start with the photoshoot.

859
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,260
- Recommend Suk Jin good poses.
- Got it.

860
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,700
We'll upload his photos
and the interview...

861
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,890
- with the title "Fake Interview"...
- "Fake Interview"?

862
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,700
on Running Man's
social media account.

863
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,590
Our fans will like it.

864
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,270
- His interview will be revealed.
- "Fake Interview".

865
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,170
- The fans will be excited.
- Indeed.

866
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:27,300
Let's meet the photographer
of Running Man Choi Hyung In.

867
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,800
- Oh, Hyung In?
- Hyung In is coming in.

868
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,710
- Hyung In will take photos?
- Hey.

869
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,720
- If Hyung In takes photos...
- Will she use an instant camera?

870
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Hyung In...

871
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,190
- Hyung In is...
- What's that? Hey.

872
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,950
Who uses a single-use camera...

873
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,690
for a magazine photoshoot?

874
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,380
- Please stand in the middle.
- Where should we stand?

875
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,260
- Why a single-use camera?
- On that side?

876
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,550
To be honest, I've had
a photoshoot several times,

877
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,770
- it was always hard to pose.
- By the way...

878
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,500
- Suk Jin, cross your arms.
- Yes?

879
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,170
(The cells started giving him
tips on posing.)

880
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,240
- Cover your mouth. Good.
- You should pose like this.

881
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
- That's a good pose.
- How about this?

882
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,860
If you bend your knees like this,
you'll look unnatural.

883
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,130
- Put your hand on your chin.
- Good.

884
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,510
No, that looks weird.

885
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,070
- Oh, like this?
- Yes.

886
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,010
- Yes, that looks great.
- You can get coins here too.

887
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,510
- I like that pose.
- Hold on a second.

888
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,980
- Suk Jin, listen.
- Show me some poses.

889
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,640
- You should strike this pose.
- Try some basic poses first.

890
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,110
Grab your collars like this.

891
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,950
Yes. That's great.

892
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,610
- Stand straight.
- Good. Stand diagonally.

893
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:14,220
Don't look at the camera. Good.

894
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,880
They don't look at the camera
these days.

895
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,150
- It makes you look better.
- One, two, three.

896
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,120
(The stylish man)

897
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,790
- He looked at the camera anyway.
- Suk Jin, how about this pose?

898
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,390
- That's weird.
- That looks so weird.

899
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,710
- You look awful.
- Suk Jin, you look weird.

900
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,270
- Don't pose like that.
- "Awful"?

901
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,710
- I'm sorry.
- It makes your legs look short.

902
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,010
- Isn't this pose nice?
- Listen.

903
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,210
- No, it's not.
- Try a basic pose first.

904
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,210
- Something like this.
- Right. Try that pose.

905
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,250
- How boring. I want something else.
- I recommended that pose earlier.

906
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,750
- You should try basic poses first.
- No, I don't want to.

907
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,380
- I really don't like that pose.
- Pull your necklaces.

908
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,880
- My necklaces?
- Yes, grab them.

909
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,290
- Like this?
- Yes. That's good.

910
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,580
Keep going. That's great.

911
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,080
(That's great.
Go with a charismatic pose.)

912
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,760
- Go with a charismatic pose.
- Pull the neck. Yes, that's good.

913
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,700
(The wild man)

914
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,890
Grab your necklaces.

915
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,700
- Bite the neck of your sweater.
- Your face looks unnatural.

916
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,790
- Bite the neck of your sweater.
- Okay.

917
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,270
- Yes, like that.
- Bite it. Good.

918
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,270
- No. Bite it like this.
- Cover your mouth.

919
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,710
- Pull it up. Yes. That's good.
- One.

920
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,640
- Just cover your mouth with it.
- One, two, three.

921
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,100
- It's better to cover his mouth.
- Bite it lightly.

922
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,110
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Don't bite it.

923
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,520
- Just cover your mouth with it.
- That's great.

924
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,380
- Suk Jin, listen. Bite this.
- Just cover your mouth.

925
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,040
- What?
- Bite one of your necklaces.

926
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,420
- Why would I do that?
- I mean...

927
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,530
- I might break my teeth.
- Just lightly.

928
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,580
(It seems like they'll make him
bite everything he can.)

929
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,530
- Bite it lightly. That's good.
- Let go of it.

930
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,620
Gosh.

931
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,360
Bite it lightly.

932
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,930
My gosh. What are you trying to do?

933
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,040
- Why would you lie down?
- The lying pose is weird.

934
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,470
- Bend one knee.
- You look weak, Suk Jin.

935
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,800
- Are you watching TV at home?
- Come on.

936
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,330
- Move your leg...
- Just leave me be.

937
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,900
- Bend one knee.
- You look like an old man...

938
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,400
- watching TV at home.
- Raise your leg a little.

939
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,720
- What is that on his butt?
- What's that?

940
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
(He put electrical tape
to cover a hole in his pants.)

941
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,220
- That's hilarious.
- What's that?

942
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,880
What's this? I thought
it was a magazine photoshoot.

943
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,380
- That's so him.
- Suk Jin.

944
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,790
- I'll show you a pose. Get up.
- Or try this pose.

945
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,230
- Suk Jin.
- Try this pose.

946
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,790
Pose like a chicken in chicken soup.

947
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,790
(Try this pose. Pose like a chicken
in chicken soup.)

948
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,670
Suk Jin, why would you do that?

949
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,970
I like this pose.

950
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,500
Is he a cicada larva or what?

951
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
(The man like a boiled chicken)

952
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,900
I like this pose.

953
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,300
Is he a cicada larva or what?

954
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,400
- Suk Jin, get up.
- I like that.

955
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,600
- Hey.
- I'll show you a pose.

956
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,800
- Hey.
- I really like the chicken pose.

957
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,300
- Don't just joke around.
- I'll show you a pose.

958
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,840
- Turn around and look back.
- Right.

959
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,020
- Like this.
- You're right.

960
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,750
- That looks natural.
- Of course. Turn around.

961
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,580
Turn your head to any side you want.
Turn your head around.

962
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,020
- Turn your head around.
- One, two, three.

963
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,760
My, that's great.

964
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,200
(He was relaxed enough to wait
until she counted to 3.)

965
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,960
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

966
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,200
- That's good.
- Great job.

967
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,860
Sit on this chair this time.

968
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,890
Sit down.

969
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,540
- Cross your legs, Suk Jin.
- Right.

970
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,130
- Sit straight...
- That's not how you should sit.

971
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,710
- No.
- I'll show you. Move aside.

972
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,440
- Suk Jin, make a playful face.
- Put your hands here. Like this.

973
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,510
- That's a good idea.
- But...

974
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,780
- A playful face...
- Now, sit down.

975
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,980
- wouldn't go with my outfit.
- It'll make you look cute.

976
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,900
- This chair would be better.
- Sit on this one first.

977
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,680
- That's too high.
- Ouch.

978
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,180
(Grunting)

979
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,690
- Suk Jin, sit on the edge.
- That hurt.

980
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,190
- Sit on the edge like this.
- What's wrong with him?

981
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,190
- Put that away.
- Okay. I'll do that.

982
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,380
That reminds me
of old-fashioned family photos.

983
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,190
- Sit down.
- Sit on that chair.

984
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,050
- Sit down comfortably.
- Sit down.

985
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,890
- No.
- Don't do that.

986
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,770
- That's not cool at all.
- Sit down.

987
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,890
- How about I put it upside down?
- Sit down for now.

988
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,000
- That'd be weird.
- That looks funny.

989
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,770
- That's over the top.
- You're supposed to look cool.

990
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,210
- Really? Okay.
- Yes.

991
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,710
- Okay. Sit down.
- Put your hands in the middle.

992
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,040
- Put them on the edge.
- Haha is good at posing.

993
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,600
- Put your hands on the edge.
- Suk Jin.

994
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,280
- Move your legs to the sides.
- Bend this knee a little.

995
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,610
- Let this arm dangle like this.
- That's great.

996
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,020
- Put the other hand on here.
- That's cool.

997
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,990
Put the other hand on here.

998
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,110
- Hey.
- That's the right pose.

999
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,310
- I'm not joking around.
- Hey.

1000
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,530
(Director Ha has his own unique
artistic point of view.)

1001
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,190
- You little...
- I'm serious. I swear.

1002
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,700
- I swear.
- Are you kidding me?

1003
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,120
- Okay. Go ahead.
- I like this pose.

1004
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,500
- Good. That's great.
- What about the facial expression?

1005
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,270
Pull your head back...

1006
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,290
- just a little bit.
- Move just a little.

1007
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,000
Make an arrogant face.

1008
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,800
(Pull your head back
and make an arrogant face.)

1009
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,240
- Good. Keep that angle.
- You should look confident.

1010
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,070
He looks
as if his face was paralyzed.

1011
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,040
- Is his face paralyzed?
- That's not my intention.

1012
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,250
(Stiff)

1013
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,610
(Superstar Ji's body became stiff
while he was posing as he was told.)

1014
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,480
Are you kidding me?
That's not the right pose for you.

1015
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,990
Suk Jin, you should strike
this pose.

1016
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,880
- That's a good one.
- Oh, my goodness.

1017
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,380
- That's an old-fashioned pose.
- That's too old-fashioned.

1018
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,880
- That's an old pose.
- It's too old-fashioned.

1019
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,690
- Please strike this pose just once.
- It keeps bothering me.

1020
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,290
Put your foot on the chair.

1021
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,500
- What? On the chair?
- Put your foot on the chair.

1022
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,970
- And look at the camera.
- No, that's not cool.

1023
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,430
- I don't like this pose.
- Just try it just once.

1024
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,390
You must strike a basic pose
like this.

1025
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,860
(He made Suk Jin poke his nose.)

1026
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,100
What is he doing?

1027
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,780
- What is that pose?
- This is a magazine photoshoot.

1028
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,040
- He looks upset.
- You should strike this pose.

1029
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,210
- He looks upset.
- Go away.

1030
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,250
- Kick him out. He makes me upset.
- It's funny.

1031
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,310
- Don't do it, Suk Jin.
- Funny?

1032
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,420
- Give it a try.
- Don't do it.

1033
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,520
Do it just once.

1034
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,790
- Don't take a photo now.
- Take a photo for now.

1035
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,110
- Take it.
- Don't take a photo now.

1036
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,380
- Come on, Suk Jin.
- No. I don't want to do it.

1037
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,420
- You should do it.
- He looks like a teenager.

1038
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,530
- It's fitting for social media.
- Suk Jin, sit down. Watch me.

1039
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,260
- Can't you recommend a cool pose?
- Check the inside pocket.

1040
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,260
- Will you use the chair?
- The inside pocket?

1041
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,200
Pose naturally. Good.
You look great.

1042
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,790
Take a photo of him now.
One, two, three.

1043
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,790
- One, two, three.
- Good.

1044
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,500
- Check inside the pocket. Good.
- That's weird.

1045
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,970
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin, I'll show you one.

1046
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:57,540
Stand straight and pose like you're
adjusting your cuff.

1047
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,510
You should strike this pose.
Yes, that's good.

1048
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,510
- But he doesn't have a cuff.
- Great.

1049
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,300
Turn around a little to this side.

1050
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,680
Lift this chair
over your head instead.

1051
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
(Lift this chair
over your head instead.)

1052
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,840
- That's great.
- Hey.

1053
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,880
- Don't take a photo.
- What's this?

1054
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,350
Don't take a photo. Don't!

1055
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,920
- It's done. Great.
- I told you not to.

1056
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,880
(The lonely man)

1057
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,260
That was great.

1058
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,320
- That was great.
- Suk Jin, sit down.

1059
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,030
- I don't mind sitting down.
- Sit down and watch me.

1060
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,790
I'm sorry. Sit comfortably.

1061
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,790
Spread your legs a little
with your knees bent.

1062
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,300
- And open your mouth slightly.
- Okay.

1063
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,710
Keep your mouth slightly open.

1064
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,040
- That's good, Suk Jin.
- She'll take a high-angle shot.

1065
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,510
- Tilt your head a little.
- That looks weird.

1066
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,750
- Put your feet on the floor.
- Good.

1067
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,870
- Are you feeling unwell, Suk Jin?
- Keep your mouth slightly open.

1068
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,790
- Just slightly.
- Is he not feeling well?

1069
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,640
- Make a dreamy face.
- He looks...

1070
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,310
- Do something about his hands.
- Hang on.

1071
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,960
- Suk Jin.
- Put your hand on the floor.

1072
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,930
- And put this one over your head.
- Yes.

1073
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,150
- As if you were grabbing something.
- Yes. That's great. This is it.

1074
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,430
Keep your mouth slightly open.

1075
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,530
(The marionette of his own cells)

1076
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,790
- That's good.
- That's hilarious.

1077
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,090
(They made him believe
he looked okay.)

1078
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,890
I look okay, right?

1079
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,860
- No. You're doing it wrong.
- Your right hand.

1080
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,900
(Jae Suk adds a detail.)

1081
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,900
He looks like a monkey.

1082
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,100
That's great.

1083
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,540
Good.

1084
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,800
That's it. Great job.

1085
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,780
- You did great.
- There won't be any good ones.

1086
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,180
You looked fabulous.

1087
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,340
- That was good.
- It's hard to pose.

1088
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,750
- You did well.
- The photoshoot is over.

1089
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,020
Now, Reporter Lee Myung Jae
from Running Daily...

1090
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,790
- will interview Suk Jin.
- Myung Jae?

1091
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:24,900
- Recommend him good answers.
- Okay.

1092
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,920
The six of you will
sit around Suk Jin.

1093
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,190
Suk Jin will sit
in the yellow chair.

1094
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,460
- Right.
- So these are our chairs.

1095
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,190
Those giving out orders
are usually on higher ground.

1096
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,000
- I hope I can get talking.
- As you know,

1097
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,270
I'm one to have witty answers.

1098
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,540
Make suggestions
and I'll choose one of them.

1099
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,400
Suk Jin isn't one
to talk well to the press,

1100
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,840
- so you'll offer guidance.
- Sure.

1101
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,150
He said Suk Jin has trouble
answering questions.

1102
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,940
(Will the cells guide him
through a successful interview?)

1103
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,210
And we all agreed.

1104
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,340
- Help me answer questions.
- Are you ready?

1105
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,090
Yes, I'll begin the interview.

1106
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,090
- Right.
- Sure.

1107
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,980
Next year marks
your 30th year in the industry...

1108
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,790
which is half your life.

1109
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,880
Has it been that long?

1110
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,020
It's about time you retired.

1111
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,070
Please describe you as a celebrity
and you as a human being...

1112
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,770
in one sentence respectively.

1113
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,590
- As a celebrity and a human being.
- Say you're like dung.

1114
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,400
(Childish)

1115
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,900
A long one.

1116
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,130
(Flustered)

1117
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,340
One that's long but thin.

1118
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,400
One that stinks.

1119
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,440
Seriously?

1120
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,250
Suk Jin, that sounds witty enough.

1121
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,710
You know how it is...

1122
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,710
- There's a rich smell to you.
- Something witty.

1123
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,050
Yes, of course.

1124
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,380
Give me a sentence that says it all.

1125
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,480
Short but meaningful.

1126
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,190
You as a celebrity...

1127
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,730
and you as an average man.

1128
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,360
- Give me some ideas.
- Okay.

1129
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,730
- As a celebrity...
- A watermelon.

1130
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,900
- Why?
- Why's that?

1131
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,860
You as a celebrity
have a flashier side...

1132
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,630
just like a watermelon's
black and green stripes.

1133
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,230
You're dressed like
a watermelon today.

1134
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,500
I quite like that.

1135
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,570
- You're dressed like one.
- As an average man...

1136
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,670
- Me as a human being.
- As a human being?

1137
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,770
- Well...
- Yes?

1138
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,000
You're red inside.

1139
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,800
- That's how...
- Are you saying I'm passionate?

1140
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,480
- What does the red represent?
- Watermelon doesn't seem right.

1141
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,770
It's just odd.

1142
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,210
- I quite like it.
- It's too old-fashioned.

1143
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,690
- It's too old-fashioned.
- You're red on the inside.

1144
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,150
It's not the appropriate season.

1145
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,920
Watermelon is a summer fruit, right?

1146
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,190
I'll keep it in mind though.

1147
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,190
He believes in what others say
too easily.

1148
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,650
- As a celebrity...
- Give me something cooler.

1149
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,320
- As a celebrity...
- Give me something cooler.

1150
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,130
- He...
- Me as a celebrity.

1151
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,320
It's only been three years.

1152
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,500
- Hey.
- Is he a rookie?

1153
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,130
Is he a rookie?

1154
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,270
He's been working for 30 years.

1155
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,800
- It's been four.
- He only became...

1156
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,110
- a household name three years ago.
- Is he a rising star?

1157
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,770
- What do you mean?
- You became a household name...

1158
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,070
about 2 to 3 years back.

1159
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,550
- Don't be ridiculous.
- He's a rookie then.

1160
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,050
- As a celebrity.
- I've got one!

1161
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,980
As a celebrity,
he's only getting started.

1162
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,650
But as a human being,
he's in his latter years.

1163
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,960
- Awesome, right?
- Nice!

1164
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,110
The beginning and the end.

1165
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,150
Wasn't that a good one?

1166
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,460
Suk Jin, what's your answer?

1167
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,650
- Right.
- The beginning and the end.

1168
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,150
(Surprisingly enough,
that's what he chooses.)

1169
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,460
In a sentence each.

1170
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,130
As a human being, he's dead.

1171
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,190
(How does the superstar of 3 years
see himself?)

1172
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,540
- You as a celebrity.
- As a celebrity...

1173
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,110
- I have one.
- But I was just about to answer.

1174
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,500
- As a human being...
- What she said is cool.

1175
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,000
As an average man, you're 56.

1176
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,670
But as a celebrity,
you're only three.

1177
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,550
- I like that one.
- That one's better.

1178
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,610
You can't say
that your life is over.

1179
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,340
- You're Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong.
- That's right.

1180
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,090
As a celebrity,
I belong to the public.

1181
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,980
But as an average man,
I belong to my wife.

1182
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,520
(But as an average man,
I belong to my wife.)

1183
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,380
- I like that one.
- You're Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong.

1184
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,750
- That's what you should say.
- I love it.

1185
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,250
- But...
- Hold on.

1186
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,750
But that's a lie.

1187
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,420
As a celebrity,

1188
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,690
- I belong to the public.
- Exactly.

1189
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,630
This is a lie though.

1190
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,730
How can you belong to the public
when they might not want you?

1191
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,570
- But I'm a superstar today.
- Besides, this is a lie.

1192
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,800
You don't belong
to your wife either.

1193
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,880
Forget it.

1194
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,000
As a celebrity...

1195
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,150
- When you're 60...
- Hey!

1196
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,250
(Hey!)

1197
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,710
He gave me a cool answer to say.

1198
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,520
- Mine was good, right?
- That's not what I mean.

1199
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,920
- This will give you everything.
- But you said...

1200
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,420
you'd emigrate at 60.

1201
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,520
I have to admit it sounded cool.

1202
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,840
As a celebrity,

1203
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,650
I belong to the public.

1204
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,320
How can you be
when the public doesn't want you?

1205
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,230
- But as an average man...
- Say you're Yang Jung A's.

1206
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,690
(Say you're Yang Jung A's.)

1207
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,730
(Yang Jung A used to be
the woman of his dreams.)

1208
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,900
(A blast from the past
brings his energy up.)

1209
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,540
Mentioning her was hilarious.

1210
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,710
Suk Jin belongs to Yang Jung A!

1211
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,380
Ask how she's doing.

1212
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,750
Tell her to return your calls.

1213
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,170
Jung A, I apologize.

1214
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,710
- It's just an inside joke.
- You were smiling brightly though.

1215
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,170
(His romantic image
takes a rocky turn.)

1216
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,020
- You were beaming.
- Let me answer you again.

1217
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,020
As a celebrity,
I belong to the public.

1218
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,960
- But as an average man,
- Your wife's.

1219
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,590
- The bank's.
- Your wife's.

1220
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,230
- You belong to the bank.
- Did you take out a loan?

1221
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,650
- Then the bank does own you.
- The bank's.

1222
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,800
I've been flying toward
what I want in life...

1223
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,800
and I belong to my wife.

1224
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,040
It sure sounded pretentious.

1225
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,270
It doesn't make any sense.

1226
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,110
The word "wife"
seems romantic to me.

1227
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,610
Here's your next question.

1228
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,040
Can you be any less annoying?

1229
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,610
You've been on Running Man
for 11 years.

1230
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:39,020
What does this show mean to you?

1231
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,440
He wanted to leave at first,
but now...

1232
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,340
(Suk Jin looked for a way out
at the very beginning.)

1233
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,520
- But now...
- It's the truth!

1234
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,860
- He's not going anywhere now.
- One should give honest answers.

1235
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,520
- It's not appropriate though.
- At first,

1236
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,360
- you hated the show.
- That's...

1237
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,650
That's...

1238
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,900
what I would say on
"You Quiz on the Block."

1239
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,630
But this is a formal interview.

1240
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,960
You should be just as honest.

1241
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,460
I'm looking for another cool answer.

1242
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,130
You thought you were the main host,

1243
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,270
but you weren't...

1244
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,690
which upset you. Tell them.

1245
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,460
That's what you thought at first.

1246
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,610
You thought Haha
had bad intentions at first.

1247
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,840
- But later on...
- You didn't like him at first.

1248
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,130
You wanted to quit because of Haha.

1249
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,050
- We're all a big family now.
- He thought he was a host.

1250
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,750
- You invest in stocks, right?
- Right.

1251
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,480
Say that it's the only stalwart...

1252
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,820
you own.

1253
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,380
You're on a roll today.

1254
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,210
- Right? You...
- Suk Jin.

1255
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,020
You don't own any stalwarts though,

1256
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,750
- so that makes no sense.
- It's the only one he owns.

1257
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,750
It's the only one.

1258
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,820
- Be more like him, guys.
- Say it's like day trading.

1259
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,860
That...

1260
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,650
That was a good one.

1261
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,460
It makes no sense.

1262
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,400
Say that it's your only
source of income.

1263
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,770
My only source of income?

1264
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,000
I'd rather sound cool...

1265
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,110
- since I'm a superstar today.
- Cool?

1266
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,540
- Okay.
- Make me look cool.

1267
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,800
And elegant.

1268
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,210
Running man is...

1269
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,840
(Running man is...)

1270
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,270
It is the only...

1271
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,650
The only show you're on.

1272
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,320
- I'm right though.
- The other one ended recently.

1273
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,210
- "Tteokbokki Brothers" ended.
- It ended.

1274
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,480
- There will be a second season!
- Did it end already?

1275
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,150
This is the only TV show you're on.

1276
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,320
This is the only one you're on.

1277
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,550
Is "Tteokbokki Brothers"
over already?

1278
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,650
- That's what he'll say.
- No way.

1279
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,730
It ended before
we could taste the tteokbokki.

1280
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,190
This is the only show he's on.

1281
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,170
The only show he's a regular on.

1282
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,130
You should be writing what I say!

1283
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,610
- Sorry about that.
- That should be your answer.

1284
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,110
- Running Man...
- What I said is right.

1285
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,210
- It is my only...
- The only TV show he's on.

1286
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,710
- It's my only stalwart.
- One he's a regular on.

1287
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,840
- Stalwart.
- Stalwart.

1288
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm in love with the expression.

1289
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,270
Jong Kook is good with his words.

1290
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,920
(Running Man?
It's the only stalwart I own.)

1291
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,920
- You've been busy in 2021.
- Right.

1292
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,420
TicToc, YouTube,
Running Man, and "How Do You Play?"

1293
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,360
Being active through
various channels...

1294
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,050
opened the doors
to your second heyday.

1295
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,190
It's actually his first.

1296
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,400
May I ask what made it happen?

1297
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,000
Say that it's thanks to Jae Suk.

1298
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,940
Say that Jae Suk made it happen.

1299
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,800
- It was Jae Suk.
- You said it yourself.

1300
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,400
- Self-improvement and...
- It was thanks to Jae Suk.

1301
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,860
- Yes, Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk made it happen.

1302
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,630
- That's not true.
- Yoo Jae Suk.

1303
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,540
Jae Suk's fans will like you
for saying so.

1304
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,170
- It's true.
- His fans would appreciate it.

1305
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,380
It was thanks to Jae Suk.

1306
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,670
- You know it's true.
- I did my best this year.

1307
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,070
You'll seem humble that way.

1308
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,340
Say that you did as Jae Suk said.

1309
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,590
- Say you owe it to all of us.
- Jae Suk...

1310
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,650
- and the rest of us.
- You did not get here on your own.

1311
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,520
- It was a group effort.
- We made it happen for you.

1312
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,050
Say Jae Suk's name though.

1313
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,130
I don't want to.

1314
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,190
- Why not?
- Say his name.

1315
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,520
Because I value
my friendship with you.

1316
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,650
It was only a success...

1317
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,520
- thanks to Jae Suk.
- You must say his name.

1318
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,500
- Jae Suk and...
- It's thanks to Jae Suk.

1319
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,900
- I won't say his name.
- Why not?

1320
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,270
Check out this headline.

1321
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,110
"I Owe It All to Jae Suk".

1322
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,230
But that'll make me look bad.

1323
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,340
- On the contrary.
- You'll seem humble.

1324
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,900
Say that it's thanks to me
and the others.

1325
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,300
It was a group effort.

1326
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,110
I was able to get this far...

1327
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,570
not on my own...

1328
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,110
Nothing can be done alone.

1329
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,650
Say you can't even change
your own underwear.

1330
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,110
That's actually true.

1331
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,190
Go ahead.

1332
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,360
Say you can't even change
your own underwear...

1333
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,590
or feed yourself.

1334
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,690
- To get this far...
- Alone?

1335
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,630
It's not possible
to get this far alone.

1336
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,400
Nothing can be done all by yourself.

1337
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,020
Just like your mother raised you
from birth,

1338
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,520
Jae Suk raised you
throughout your career.

1339
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,020
- You're right.
- He's your stepfather.

1340
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,070
- Those younger than me...
- That's true.

1341
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,860
It was all thanks to
my younger friends.

1342
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,130
- Say Jae Suk's name.
- Say his name.

1343
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:53,130
- You should say his name.
- If you don't say my name...

1344
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,480
- Because...
- He's your best friend.

1345
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,610
That's why...

1346
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,550
- Say Jae Suk's name.
- End it with this.

1347
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,150
"Thanks, Jae Suk."

1348
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,380
He raised you in variety shows.

1349
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,020
- And...
- Thank Jae Suk.

1350
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,380
- I...
- Thanks to my seniors...

1351
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,250
I only got this far
thanks to my colleagues.

1352
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,460
- "Thanks, Jae Suk."
- But most importantly,

1353
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,860
name the one who raised you.

1354
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,190
- He's like a father figure.
- And Jae Suk...

1355
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,520
must be mentioned.

1356
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,190
(And Jae Suk must be mentioned.)

1357
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,820
- Nice.
- You mentioned us all.

1358
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,590
- That's settled.
- We're good.

1359
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,190
- Heartwarming, isn't it?
- Of course.

1360
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,230
"I Owe It All to Jae Suk."

1361
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,690
That would be the headline.

1362
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:25,730
You are known as
the Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong.

1363
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,000
- So Min gave me that nickname.
- Yes, earlier.

1364
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,840
Describe yourself
as a husband and father.

1365
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,500
Just say, "Hugh."

1366
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,980
(Just say, "Hugh.")

1367
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,250
Just say, "Hugh,"
and take a deep breath.

1368
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,480
- How about...
- I quite like that.

1369
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,710
That isn't for me to say.
It's for my wife to decide.

1370
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,290
- It's not my place to say.
- No, that's not right.

1371
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:46,500
To be witty,
this is what you should say.

1372
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,020
"You should discuss it
with my agency."

1373
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,400
- Like a superstar.
- Sensitive questions...

1374
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,270
should go through my agency.

1375
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,900
With my agency...

1376
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,110
Won't I seem arrogant?

1377
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,270
That's the point.

1378
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,070
I'll sound too arrogant.

1379
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,400
- How about this then?
- What was it that you asked?

1380
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,150
- In the past...
- What kind of a father are you?

1381
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,750
I thought you said "husband."

1382
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,770
Father and husband.

1383
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:06,920
Start off with a chuckle and say,

1384
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,940
"Yes, we almost broke up."

1385
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,250
("Yes, we almost broke up.")

1386
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:12,960
That's how it should begin.

1387
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,250
Look. He's loving it.

1388
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,690
- It's the Hollywood style.
- You'll seem down to earth.

1389
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,250
The Hollywood style.

1390
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,590
"It wasn't always
rainbows and butterflies."

1391
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,000
It's so down to earth.

1392
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,630
- It can't always be good.
- Exactly.

1393
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,960
It's so down to earth.

1394
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,770
"There were many challenges."

1395
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,130
(They add in a few challenges
to make him seem down to down.)

1396
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,400
We never almost broke up.

1397
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,610
- Say you tried hard.
- That never happened.

1398
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,210
I recommend,
"It wasn't always good."

1399
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,270
- Well...
- Of course, we fought.

1400
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,770
- I'll come up with my own answer.
- Go ahead.

1401
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,150
- Of course, we fought.
- Well, of course...

1402
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,710
- I always...
- Say you argued today as well.

1403
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,070
No, we didn't argue.

1404
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,110
- I always lack...
- However,

1405
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,520
- you still keep in touch.
- Hey!

1406
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,020
Keep in touch?

1407
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,190
This morning,

1408
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,050
- we almost kissed, you know.
- Almost?

1409
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,020
- Why didn't you go through with it?
- Almost?

1410
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,150
Why didn't you just kiss her?

1411
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,920
How about this then?
You've almost kissed before,

1412
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,270
but not for real.

1413
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,770
You only "almost" kissed.

1414
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,170
I'm a husband...

1415
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,400
- who knows he lacks in many ways.
- Good.

1416
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,800
- I try...
- And it'll stay that way.

1417
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,230
I'm able to work hard...

1418
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,270
thanks to my wife's support.

1419
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,440
And say,

1420
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,420
"It's why I'm thankful for Jae Suk
who introduced her to me."

1421
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,380
I'm the one who introduced you two.

1422
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,690
I resented you for a while.

1423
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,420
Suk Jin, how about this?

1424
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,550
- What is it?
- Say...

1425
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,090
you're hoping for a second child.

1426
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:23,880
No way.

1427
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,000
That's... It's not even possible.

1428
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,500
Can you not put on a serious face
when we're only giving you tips?

1429
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,690
Why would you put on a serious face?

1430
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:32,300
- It's an interview.
- We were only giving you tips.

1431
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,730
- This is an interview.
- You were too serious.

1432
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,710
- Having a second child is...
- This is fun though.

1433
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,000
- I want to try it too.
- It's an interview.

1434
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,340
- I need to be serious.
- Why is it impossible?

1435
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,340
You can talk about being a father
in a cool way.

1436
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,570
- My wife might be flustered.
- Okay.

1437
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:46,420
What kind of father are you?

1438
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,550
(What kind of father is Suk Jin?)

1439
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,480
- A father who is like a friend.
- Actually...

1440
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,610
- I'm like a friend to my son.
- He really is.

1441
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,750
- This is serious.
- I'm really like his friend.

1442
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,790
- You play with him well.
- I don't scold my kid.

1443
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:56,960
- That's right.
- I don't nag at him.

1444
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,090
- You talk with him on his level.
- You cater to your son.

1445
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:01,130
- I...
- You walk with him on his level.

1446
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:03,360
I work hard to have a perspective
that's similar to his.

1447
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,500
I want my kid...

1448
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,340
Say that you don't want your son
to live like you.

1449
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,770
Thank you for your answer.

1450
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,340
Sorry? Don't write that down.

1451
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,170
Why didn't you
respond to my answer...

1452
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,070
but respond to his?

1453
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,650
- They're not supposed to be here.
- Right.

1454
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,050
You can only interview me.

1455
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,790
- They're not here.
- We're his cells.

1456
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,150
- You need to answer me properly.
- Right.

1457
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,480
You can't do that.

1458
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,480
It's nice that he's like a friend
to his son.

1459
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,420
- In other words...
- Just use what I said.

1460
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,820
He's never talked to his son.

1461
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,400
In another word,
he's not that interested in his son.

1462
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,630
That's not true.

1463
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:36,300
Don't write that down!
Why are you writing it?

1464
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,320
You should write down when I say it,
not him!

1465
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,500
- He should say it himself.
- Writer. No, I mean Reporter.

1466
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,040
He'll live his life, and Hyun Woo
will be on his own as well.

1467
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,630
You should say that you're
not that good of a father.

1468
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:45,800
- That's what makes it cool.
- No, I don't...

1469
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,480
He grew up by himself.

1470
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,250
I'm not a controlling father.

1471
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,920
The son doesn't control
his father either.

1472
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:54,880
They live their own lives.

1473
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,380
I don't tell him what to do.

1474
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,590
I tell him to find a job
that makes him happy.

1475
00:45:58,590 --> 00:45:59,920
That's true. That's really true.

1476
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,590
- I always say that to him.
- He's serious.

1477
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,920
Then you should write down
Hyun Woo's answer as well.

1478
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,020
Hyun Woo's answer?

1479
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,650
"Dad, don't mind me."

1480
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:07,960
(Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong,
I'm like a friend to my son.)

1481
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,500
- Here comes the next question.
- All right.

1482
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:13,400
They say you're bad with ad-libs.
What's your take on that?

1483
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,000
- That's true.
- We agree.

1484
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,040
I agree too.

1485
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,270
- He's keeping silent.
- When he's in good condition...

1486
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:19,070
The fact that I can laugh
about it...

1487
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,300
- No comment.
- proves I'm good at ad-libs.

1488
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,480
No comment.

1489
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,750
If I were bad at ad-libs...

1490
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,250
We'll wrap up the interview now.

1491
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,440
- No.
- Let's wrap it up here.

1492
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,020
- Excuse me.
- Why would you end it?

1493
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,440
- Let's wrap it up now.
- Because...

1494
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,050
he's run out of ad-libs.

1495
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,690
- He has nothing more to say.
- I just laugh it off like this.

1496
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:34,750
No comment, sir.

1497
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,050
What do you mean by no comment?

1498
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,130
- No comment?
- Did you see...

1499
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,190
how he ran out of ad-libs just now?

1500
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,920
"I just laugh it off like this."

1501
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:42,020
That's what you call an ad-lib?

1502
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,500
- "I just laugh it off like this."
- "I just laugh it off like this."

1503
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,770
- You call that an ad-lib?
- Can you write that down?

1504
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,570
- No. Don't write that.
- "I just laugh it off like this."

1505
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,070
- It's the worst ad-lib.
- Don't...

1506
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:52,000
Don't write that down.

1507
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,840
- It was too old.
- What do you think?

1508
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,940
Please write this instead.

1509
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,940
- "I just laugh it off like this."
- The reason I can laugh...

1510
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,150
Make sure to keep that.

1511
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,980
Make use of Ji Hyo's name
at the end.

1512
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,190
- "I just laugh it off like this."
- "I just laugh it off like this."

1513
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,320
Anyway...

1514
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,110
- Anyway, he's out of ad-libs.
- Because it's not true.

1515
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:09,630
Tell them to talk to your agency
about it.

1516
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:10,650
- About his ad-libs?
- Yes.

1517
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:11,650
Or you can say this.

1518
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:13,320
"It's not that I'm only bad
at ad-libs."

1519
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,320
("I'm bad at other things too.")

1520
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,960
- You'll look humble.
- Well...

1521
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,570
- My ad-libs...
- "No matter how hard I think,"

1522
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:21,630
- "I just laugh it off."
- "I can't think of an ad-lib."

1523
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,040
No matter how hard I think,
I got none

1524
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,480
No matter how hard I think

1525
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,210
(No matter how hard we think,
we can't accept that ad-lib.)

1526
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,770
- Anyway...
- That was the worst.

1527
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,710
(Bursting into laughter)

1528
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,440
- That was the worst.
- What do we do with this?

1529
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,210
- "I just laugh it off like this."
- "I just laugh it off like this."

1530
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:39,290
- Let's all just laugh it off.
- Let's laugh it off.

1531
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,380
The viewers will laugh it off.

1532
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,500
All right. So you don't
agree with that comment?

1533
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,500
Of course not. Because...

1534
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,920
if I were really bad at ad-libs,

1535
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,130
- Here's the next question.
- they wouldn't...

1536
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:51,690
- I'm talking right now.
- He cut it off.

1537
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,360
- He cut it off.
- If they really thought I were bad,

1538
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,170
- they wouldn't say so.
- "I just laugh it off like this."

1539
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:57,610
Because I'm good at it...

1540
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,170
- That was the best answer.
- Because I'm good at it,

1541
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,070
they can make jokes like that.

1542
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,110
- Oh, no.
- Then...

1543
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,900
They can make jokes like that.

1544
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,520
(Showing off a slapstick)

1545
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:08,380
That was a nice ad-lib.

1546
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:09,980
- He did a slapstick.
- He turned it around.

1547
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:11,980
He turned it around. My gosh.

1548
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,380
- Goodness.
- Anyway,

1549
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,090
we'll try our best
to improve his ad-libs.

1550
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:17,480
I actually think...

1551
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,750
I have more popular lines
than these guys.

1552
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,920
- "I just laugh it off like this."
- "I just laugh it off like this."

1553
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,590
Goodness, he's in serious trouble.

1554
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:30,730
The next question is
your plan for next year.

1555
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,270
Are you planning to make donations
next year?

1556
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,170
This is a very sensitive question.

1557
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,570
It's very sensitive.

1558
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:38,940
- You should donate some.
- It's about time that you do.

1559
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:39,940
You should.

1560
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,320
- He doesn't donate at all.
- That's right.

1561
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,980
Let's just sit out
for this question.

1562
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:43,980
(The cells have no intention
to help with this question.)

1563
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,980
- Let's see his ad-lib for this.
- Donations...

1564
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,690
- Donations...
- "I just laugh it off like this."

1565
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:49,090
We don't make plans for donations.

1566
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,980
- "I just laugh it off like this."
- "I just laugh it off like this."

1567
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:52,550
Are you saying
"I just laugh it off" again?

1568
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:54,750
- Just say "I just laugh it off."
- You should make donations.

1569
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,460
- "I just laugh it off."
- It makes you feel great.

1570
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,570
You shouldn't make plans
for donations.

1571
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,900
- Just say "I just laugh it off."
- Just repeat that.

1572
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,900
- Hey.
- Do you have plans...

1573
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,900
to make donations?

1574
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,730
"I just laugh it off like this."

1575
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,340
- That's hilarious.
- I'm always thinking...

1576
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:12,380
- of making donations.
- Right.

1577
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,920
Actually, I don't want it
to be known.

1578
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,480
That's why he's never done it.

1579
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,520
"It won't be known anyway."

1580
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:20,690
"Why would I do it?"

1581
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,750
I have made donations before.

1582
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,480
But I didn't want to make it public.

1583
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,460
Didn't you go around
to look for land to buy recently?

1584
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,730
- I did.
- In Dongtan.

1585
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:28,800
Did you sell the land in Paju?

1586
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,020
No, I didn't.

1587
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,340
Well, I...

1588
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,690
Why don't you spare the money
to buy lands and donate instead?

1589
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:36,040
How about donating that land?

1590
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,880
Are you going to
just laugh it off again?

1591
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,000
Are you laughing it off again?
He'll laugh it off.

1592
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,570
He'll laugh it off.

1593
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,820
He's not going to sell that land.

1594
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,210
He'll just laugh it off.

1595
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,320
- It's so funny.
- We're sorry.

1596
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,880
- That's not true.
- It's so funny.

1597
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,020
I'm not that into making donations.

1598
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:56,250
I don't think I need to make
a promise...

1599
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,320
- to make donations.
- That's true.

1600
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,300
I think I should make donations
when I feel the need to.

1601
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,130
I don't want to make donations
for the sake of it.

1602
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:02,820
Does that mean you never
felt the need to make donations?

1603
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,860
That's when I...

1604
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:05,320
- That's why...
- Until now?

1605
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,230
- I have made donations.
- That's why he still...

1606
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:09,340
- doesn't feel the need to.
- He doesn't.

1607
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,500
I have made donations before.

1608
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,670
He also wishes to return
all his assets to society.

1609
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:14,800
No, I don't.

1610
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,440
No, I don't.

1611
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,670
All right, then.

1612
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:20,340
(It's good that he's honest.
He doesn't want to make donations.)

1613
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:25,590
You're turning 60 soon, which
the members made jokes about.

1614
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,380
I'm not turning 60 soon.
I still got 4 more years.

1615
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,460
- No, it's 3 years.
- It's 3 years.

1616
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,150
- No, it's four years.
- The new year is around the corner.

1617
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:32,050
- The new year is around the corner.
- Still, I got four years left.

1618
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:33,400
- I'll be 61 after 4 years.
- That's 3 years, then.

1619
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,460
Why is it 3 years?
I still got 5 more years!

1620
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,770
You see?

1621
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:37,230
He gets upset so easily.

1622
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,570
- I can't say anything now.
- You'll turn 60 after 3 years.

1623
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,090
Is there a bucket list
you want to accomplish?

1624
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:43,360
- A bucket list.
- Can you speak up?

1625
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,840
- He's a reporter!
- He's a reporter!

1626
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,210
- I'm sorry.
- Who talks like that to a reporter?

1627
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,880
- How can you speak like that?
- I was just annoyed by them.

1628
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,940
- I'm sorry.
- He's rude.

1629
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,050
- You'll be in big trouble.
- I apologize.

1630
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,440
Is there a bucket list you want to
accomplish when you turn 60?

1631
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,920
- A bucket list?
- A bucket list.

1632
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,020
I actually do.

1633
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,380
- Wasn't it getting a divorce?
- You actually said this to me.

1634
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,650
- It's graduating from marriage.
- Graduating from marriage?

1635
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,020
- It's graduating from marriage.
- Is that true?

1636
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,730
- You told me.
- Explain it.

1637
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,730
- It's that...
- You said you wanted to be free.

1638
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,900
Earlier...

1639
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,400
- Seriously...
- "I just laugh it off."

1640
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:14,360
- "I just laugh it off."
- You said that on the show.

1641
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,840
He actually said it.

1642
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,570
He said he'll graduate from marriage
when he turns 60.

1643
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:19,800
It's true that I said that
ten years ago.

1644
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,710
It's true. I jokingly talked
about it with my wife.

1645
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:26,610
"Hey, when we turn 60,"

1646
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:29,920
"why don't we
freely enjoy our lives?"

1647
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,790
And my wife told me this.

1648
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:34,110
"Make sure to keep that promise."
That's what she said.

1649
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:35,980
I still remember that.
But things have changed.

1650
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,380
- Then?
- Things have changed.

1651
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,090
My wife is my forever best friend.

1652
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:40,750
- A friend?
- When I'm with my wife...

1653
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:42,360
- Yes.
- Then what does that make of you?

1654
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,920
You're friends
with your son as well.

1655
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,500
- It's so strange.
- A friendship.

1656
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,590
What does that make of your family
if you're friends...

1657
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:48,670
with both your son and wife?

1658
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:50,270
- A friendship.
- A friendship?

1659
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:51,540
It's a friendship.

1660
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:54,210
That's why I have a bucket list.

1661
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,210
("I have a bucket list.")

1662
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:57,270
- Going to a nude beach.
- When I turn 60...

1663
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:58,340
I want to go to a nude beach.

1664
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,250
(He hopes to visit a nude beach.)

1665
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,590
(Superstar Ji wants to visit
a nude beach when he's 60.)

1666
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:06,190
- Hey.
- What?

1667
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,460
A nude beach?

1668
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,980
Imagine Suk Jin lying
on a nude beach.

1669
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,690
- I mean...
- He wants to go to a nude beach...

1670
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:14,250
when he's 60.

1671
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,170
That was hilarious.

1672
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:17,270
Right?

1673
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:18,400
That was hilarious.

1674
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,230
- Going to a nude beach.
- His laugh looks fake.

1675
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,040
- Going to a nude beach.
- Imagine him...

1676
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,270
being naked.

1677
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:27,340
- And he'll be smiling.
- That's not what I want to do.

1678
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,570
- With sunglasses.
- That's not true.

1679
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:29,980
- Don't write that down.
- With sunglasses.

1680
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,150
- Don't get swayed by them.
- Going to a nude beach.

1681
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,770
I do have one thing
that I want to do.

1682
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:34,840
Making donations.

1683
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,110
- Making donations.
- That's hilarious.

1684
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:39,460
Everyone is the same.

1685
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,050
What are you writing down?

1686
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,090
I haven't said anything.

1687
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:44,750
- Don't write that.
- He'll donate everything.

1688
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,320
I only laughed because it was funny.

1689
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,520
Going to a nude beach.

1690
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,460
- Going back to the soil.
- I want to go on a trip...

1691
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,900
- around the world for 31 days.
- Going to a nude beach.

1692
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:55,770
You'll go to a nude beach
for your trip.

1693
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:56,960
(A nude beach tour
for 30 nights and 31 days)

1694
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,710
- He'll be naked for 30 days.
- Be quiet!

1695
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,040
- He'll be completely tanned.
- You'll be tanned.

1696
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,650
You can't go.
You'll be completely tanned.

1697
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:03,980
That was hilarious.

1698
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,250
- Suk Jin, that's your beach look.
- A trip for 30 nights and 31 days.

1699
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:10,690
I want to go on a cruise
for 30 nights and 31 days.

1700
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,590
You see how they're reacting?

1701
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:14,980
- They've gone quiet.
- Suk Jin.

1702
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,250
You can't go with this answer.

1703
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:17,550
- That's right.
- I'll choose the other answer.

1704
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:19,090
Please just write that down.
A trip around the world.

1705
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:20,400
- Going to a nude beach.
- A trip around the world.

1706
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,420
He'll be naked.

1707
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:25,130
I kept imagining his back
on the nude beach.

1708
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:26,440
I can't imagine it.

1709
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:29,500
- That was hilarious.
- As you performed well in 2021,

1710
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,300
many people are saying
that you deserve the grand award.

1711
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,380
- Pardon?
- Right.

1712
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:37,300
If you were to receive
the grand award,

1713
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,770
what will your acceptance speech
be like?

1714
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:40,480
- It's already tear-jerking.
- I'm already touched.

1715
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,090
- I've never thought...
- I agree that he deserves it.

1716
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:45,050
- of winning the grand award.
- Come on.

1717
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:46,380
Tell them you'll refuse it
even if they give you one.

1718
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:47,420
(Tell them you'll refuse it
even if they give you one.)

1719
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:50,050
- Didn't you say...
- Tell them you'll refuse it.

1720
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:51,550
that SBS is too mean to you?

1721
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:52,630
No, that's not it.

1722
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:53,730
Tell them you'll refuse it.

1723
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:57,070
I've never thought of getting
the grand award.

1724
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,860
- You'll cry.
- It's strange...

1725
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,040
that we're doing this special
when the award show is nearing.

1726
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,300
I know. You deserve it.

1727
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,860
- They're making a narration.
- Suk Jin.

1728
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,170
- That's not true.
- They must be planning something.

1729
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:08,400
- This is a great storyline.
- Suk Jin.

1730
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,800
- That's not going to happen.
- You should look forward to it.

1731
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,710
- No, that's not true.
- To be honest,

1732
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,520
- it's not like we have...
- We don't have one.

1733
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,020
- strong candidates for this year.
- There's none.

1734
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,110
That's not true.

1735
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:19,320
Even Tak Jae Hoon is after it.

1736
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,480
- Jae Hoon is?
- Yes.

1737
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,960
Suk Jin is way better than him.

1738
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,980
There's no strong candidate
for the grand award this year.

1739
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,650
It has been only two years
since he returned. He's being greedy.

1740
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:29,190
Suk Jin deserves it.

1741
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,270
You've been in this business
for 30 years.

1742
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:32,730
I think he's being greedy.

1743
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,230
- Tak Jae Hoon is being greedy.
- Anyway...

1744
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:37,400
- You must be getting one.
- I'm suddenly...

1745
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,480
You're not getting ready
for it already, are you?

1746
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,000
No. I've never imagined it.

1747
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,070
His heart must be beating
really fast.

1748
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,670
- He lost his focus.
- His heart must be beating fast.

1749
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:45,710
It is beating really fast.

1750
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,170
- You've thought about it.
- Just the question itself...

1751
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:48,340
must be nerve-racking for him.

1752
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,650
- You've thought about it.
- I'm really nervous.

1753
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,090
- I really am nervous.
- Right?

1754
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:52,480
I think I might cry.

1755
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,360
- The grand award winner.
- I might cry.

1756
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,860
- Ji Suk Jin!
- Ji Suk Jin!

1757
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,960
- Suk Jin, you won the grand award!
- Congratulations!

1758
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,460
- Suk Jin!
- This is...

1759
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,020
- You should hug us.
- For real?

1760
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,860
I think I might cry.

1761
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,820
I can't imagine it, to be honest.

1762
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,840
But you've thought of it, right?
At least once.

1763
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,500
- This year's grand award winner...
- Be honest.

1764
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,940
I mean, I heard
I'm one of the candidates.

1765
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,940
Really?

1766
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,380
- They've never heard of it.
- Really? You all know about it?

1767
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,150
What do you mean
you're one of the candidates?

1768
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,380
- For which award show?
- You're not getting shingles, yes?

1769
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,150
- Suk Jin!
- Are you getting shingles?

1770
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,770
- Are you getting shingles?
- You never know.

1771
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:22,840
I heard I'm one of the candidates.

1772
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,250
For which award show?

1773
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:25,840
- Suk Jin is at it again.
- Anyway...

1774
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:29,650
I bet it's not only for me
if they give me the grand award.

1775
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:32,050
I'm sure it's meant
for all of us on Running Man.

1776
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:33,820
- That's not fair.
- What are you talking about?

1777
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:35,250
That's not true. It's meant for you.

1778
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,730
It's making me become serious.

1779
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:39,300
Honestly speaking, he deserves it.

1780
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,070
- He certainly does.
- He deserves it.

1781
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,040
Let's move on to the next question.

1782
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,460
- I'm going to cry my eyes out.
- That was the last question.

1783
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,670
Then we'll wrap up the interview.

1784
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:49,110
Good work, everyone.

1785
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,050
There's no way I'm getting
the grand award. No way.

1786
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,420
- Thank you.
- No way.

1787
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,210
- Good work, everyone.
- Good work, everyone.

1788
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:57,190
- Everyone.
- You never know.

1789
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:00,690
According to how the interview went
for Superstar Ji,

1790
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,790
Jae Suk and Jong Kook will
receive eight Gullible Coins each.

1791
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:05,130
- That's a lot.
- You got a lot.

1792
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,400
- Haha will get seven coins.
- That's a lot.

1793
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,900
Se Chan will get five coins.

1794
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,190
So Min and Ji Hyo
will get three each.

1795
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:13,130
- Yes.
- You guys did a lot.

1796
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:16,840
We'll move to the next spot
for lunch.

1797
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,170
My gosh.

1798
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:20,110
- Se Chan!
- What is it?

1799
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:22,230
I've already lost 300 dollars.

1800
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:23,570
I invested in something else though.

1801
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:24,940
You can sell them now if you want.

1802
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,570
You should purchase SK Telecom's
stocks now.

1803
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:28,250
I already made 370 dollars.

1804
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:29,820
- Really?
- Yes! Take a look.

1805
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,340
I bought it with the 10,000 dollars
I was given.

1806
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,920
Why didn't you buy
SK Telecom's stocks?

1807
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,750
I know, right? He should've
bought them when I did.

1808
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,360
People make a lot of calls
because of COVID-19.

1809
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,480
How much did you lose, Se Chan?

1810
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,820
I already lost two percent too.

1811
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,400
Why did you buy that stock
in the first place?

1812
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,730
Because it was just for today.
I don't buy stocks like this.

1813
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,730
- I get it, but why?
- In case they get me wrong.

1814
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:50,630
Suk Jin is not the type
to buy stocks like this.

1815
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:54,170
He doesn't buy stocks based on
info that's already open to public.

1816
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:57,650
He buys stocks based on the tips
that people give.

1817
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,650
- You get what I mean?
- The tips they give nonchalantly?

1818
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,750
- Yes, those tips.
- Not the tips you get...

1819
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,250
- from deep conversations.
- Exactly.

1820
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,710
Then you should get those.

1821
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:06,750
There are so many people
who give me tips.

1822
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,610
- "I'm only telling you this."
- Right. I'm talking about those.

1823
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:09,920
"I'm only sharing this with you."

1824
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,980
Cells, don't only focus
on your stocks.

1825
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,820
- It's driving me crazy.
- He keeps asking me.

1826
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,000
This is fake money.

1827
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
By the way,
where are we going for lunch?

1828
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,230
It's the place
with Suk Jin's memories.

1829
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:21,590
Where could it be?
I've mentioned a couple of places.

1830
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:32,600
It's this place.

1831
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,870
(It's a restaurant in Apgujeong
where Suk Jin's memories are.)

1832
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:35,580
- I know that place.
- It's not only for me.

1833
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,710
They all have memories
of that place.

1834
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:39,870
I saw Suk Jin and Jae Suk
in that place.

1835
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:41,120
- Soo Hong was also there.
- We...

1836
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,290
I'm not even kidding.
Suk Jin, Yong Man,

1837
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:44,290
- and I...
- You picked the right place.

1838
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:46,560
I saw them chatting for
more than ten hours.

1839
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,350
We always started our nights
in that place.

1840
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:50,080
- That place is...
- When was that?

1841
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:53,290
We went there
from the early 1990s...

1842
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:56,100
- That's right.
- to the early 2000s.

1843
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,120
After I made my debut
as a member of Turbo in 1995,

1844
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:00,870
I went to Gangnam
for the first time.

1845
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:03,600
- It must be an old place.
- The cells will decide on the menu.

1846
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,830
We must have their tteokbokki.

1847
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:07,000
- We must have their tteokbokki.
- Of course.

1848
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,710
When we were single,

1849
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,850
many incredible women
visited that place.

1850
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:14,020
- That's true.
- That's right.

1851
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:16,580
Many celebrities visited that place.

1852
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,020
They did.

1853
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:21,660
Many trainees worked there...

1854
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,660
- as a part-timer.
- They did.

1855
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,390
- To be scouted?
- Yes.

1856
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:27,750
There were many people
who were scouted from cafes.

1857
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:30,000
- That's right.
- I heard Jung Woo Sung...

1858
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,100
- used to work near there.
- That's true.

1859
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:34,230
What about you?
Didn't you wait tables there?

1860
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:35,230
Actually...

1861
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,600
- Did you debut early?
- I worked at a cafe.

1862
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,940
You did?

1863
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,040
- You got scouted from there?
- You must've been popular.

1864
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,310
Of course.
They all must've wanted her.

1865
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,140
- I see.
- You must've been really popular.

1866
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:47,140
Of course. Not just anyone
could work at a cafe.

1867
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,170
Even when I was young.

1868
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:49,640
Have you ever done
a part-time job, Suk Jin?

1869
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,980
- I have.
- Where?

1870
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,540
I worked near
Ewha Womans University.

1871
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,480
- I waited tables.
- In where?

1872
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,390
- At a cafe.
- You worked at a cafe?

1873
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,350
- Yes.
- Is that from 40 years ago?

1874
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:00,230
Suk Jin. Didn't you work
in the kitchen?

1875
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:01,390
Didn't you work in the kitchen?

1876
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:02,830
No. I was the main waiter.

1877
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,960
He worked at a tavern.

1878
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,870
- A tavern?
- I waited tables.

1879
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:07,290
- That sounds plausible.
- You dressed up as a servant.

1880
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:09,190
- I was the main...
- You had to lift a rice bag.

1881
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:10,730
- A rice bag?
- At a tavern.

1882
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:12,710
It was a popular place
near Ewha Womans University.

1883
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:13,910
I waited tables.

1884
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:15,600
How much was the minimum wage
back in your day?

1885
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,980
- Back in my day...
- Wasn't it in coins?

1886
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,310
I bet it was
only three hwan per hour.

1887
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:19,920
I bet you got about four coins.

1888
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,040
I bet you only got four.

1889
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,080
Or he could've exchanged goods.

1890
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,080
Or buckwheat per hour?

1891
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,190
Maybe he got two cabbages per hour.

1892
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:25,290
(Two cabbages)

1893
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:26,660
- Maybe he got buckwheat.
- Or two cabbages.

1894
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,190
- Or two fishes.
- Or three hwan.

1895
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,060
I got sweet potatoes and millets.
Are you happy now?

1896
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,850
I love it when he admits it.

1897
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:34,620
- It makes you go crazy.
- I love it.

1898
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,690
Let's have some tteokbokki.

1899
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:38,390
We must have tteokbokki
in this cafe.

1900
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:40,560
- It's good to be back.
- It smells like Gangnam.

1901
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,100
It does smell like Gangnam.

1902
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,500
- I get it.
- What do you mean by that?

1903
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,600
It's different.

1904
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,500
- They didn't have this before.
- Things have changed a lot.

1905
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:50,000
Suk Jin, why don't you order
some ttekbokki since we're hungry?

1906
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,500
We should have tteokbokki.

1907
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,020
There are so many delicious things.

1908
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,270
They still have kimchi fried rice.

1909
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:57,290
We used to eat
kimchi fried rice here very often.

1910
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:59,580
Guys, their ramyeon is 23 dollars.

1911
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:00,690
It's so expensive.

1912
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,750
I want to try it.

1913
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:06,460
It's so expensive.

1914
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,690
Actually, when we were young,
we were so poor...

1915
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,560
- that we couldn't eat them all.
- We were poor then.

1916
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,870
So we only sat by the entrance.

1917
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:14,500
We sat there to watch the people
that come by.

1918
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,830
(They could only watch the people
that come in by the entrance.)

1919
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:17,910
- Goodness.
- Hello.

1920
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,710
- I'll take your order.
- Hello.

1921
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:21,870
- It's been so long.
- I know.

1922
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:23,370
I haven't been here for so long.

1923
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,810
- Right?
- Suk Jin came back as a superstar.

1924
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:27,710
I know. Back in those days,

1925
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,940
he only had drinks.

1926
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,580
- That's right.
- Oh, right.

1927
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,480
He couldn't eat anything.

1928
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,690
- It's because I had no money.
- You're precisely right.

1929
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:36,690
- Right.
- He only had drinks.

1930
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:39,500
- He only sat by the entrance.
- That's right.

1931
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,120
- He's right.
- He only had drinks.

1932
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,290
For how long did you work here?

1933
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:45,190
I've been working here for 23 years.

1934
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:48,600
So I remember seeing Jae Suk...

1935
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,600
- and others.
- He's been here since then.

1936
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,770
He knows
the history of all celebrities.

1937
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:55,310
Let's order a seafood stew.

1938
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:57,040
- Let's order two.
- It'd be nice to dip bread with it.

1939
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,480
- Let's have that.
- We must have that.

1940
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,310
We'll have seafood tomato stew.

1941
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:02,670
Why don't you order
a menu of your memories?

1942
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:04,890
Can you recommend us
which tteokbokki to get?

1943
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:05,980
- What about this?
- Let's have kimchi fried rice.

1944
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,810
Let's have truffle oil garlic pasta.

1945
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:10,290
How about pizza margherita?

1946
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,890
They still have kimchi fried rice.

1947
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:14,120
We used to eat that a lot here.

1948
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,660
Let's have kimchi fried rice.

1949
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,290
- Let's have kimchi fried rice.
- We should have kimchi fried rice.

1950
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:18,890
- The two of them...
- We'll have two.

1951
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:20,100
- We used to have this.
- We used to have this.

1952
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,040
We used to serve one fried egg
with it, but we serve two now.

1953
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,440
- Really?
- Yes.

1954
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,830
You used to give us
only one fried egg.

1955
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:26,040
- We serve two now.
- You do?

1956
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,100
It was one of the cheapest menus.

1957
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:30,770
I bet you couldn't have it
because it was too expensive.

1958
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,080
Right. It was too expensive.

1959
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:33,580
(He's making fun of the regular
he couldn't see for years.)

1960
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:36,120
Then let's have a dish of pasta.
Or shall we have pizza?

1961
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,540
- We must have their pizza.
- Let's do that.

1962
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:39,290
How about pizza margherita?

1963
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:41,080
Let's have pizza margherita.

1964
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,710
I also want pizza margherita.

1965
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:44,250
- Me too.
- No, order pizza gorgonzola.

1966
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:45,420
The Hawaiian pizza...

1967
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:47,020
- is the one with pineapples, right?
- No.

1968
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:48,330
- Let's have pizza gorgonzola.
- Pizza margherita...

1969
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:49,790
is their menu to go.

1970
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,100
- Let's have pizza margherita.
- No.

1971
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,100
- Let's have pizza margherita.
- Suk Jin.

1972
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,370
You'll stop midways...

1973
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:55,390
- while having that.
- Pizza margherita is good.

1974
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:56,670
- but gorgonzola is...
- Order pizza gorgonzola.

1975
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:58,830
- Gorgonzola is stinky.
- Gorgonzola is one with honey, no?

1976
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:00,710
- That's right.
- But it's too stinky.

1977
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:01,980
What's the pizza
that's most convenient to eat?

1978
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:02,980
It's pizza gorgonzola.

1979
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,870
(Sending a signal)

1980
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,210
You should pick one.
Just pick pizza gorgonzola.

1981
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:08,210
That's right.

1982
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:09,810
Then let's have pizza gorgonzola.

1983
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:12,020
Why don't you just order
whatever the two of you want?

1984
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,580
- Let's order a Hawaiian pizza.
- Looks like they're in charge.

1985
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,460
- Let's have a Hawaiian pizza.
- Are we all set?

1986
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:16,480
- Yes, we are.
- Yes.

1987
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,460
- We'll have that.
- Let's order drinks now.

1988
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,290
We can order that while eating.

1989
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:22,730
Why not? I want to order drinks.

1990
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:24,600
Does anyone want any drinks?

1991
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,370
Is there a non-alcoholic cocktail
called Nude Beach here?

1992
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:28,830
A glass of Nude Beach?

1993
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:30,100
I want Nude Beach too.

1994
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:33,980
Can you make a cocktail called
Nude Beach for us?

1995
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:34,980
Can you make one with that name?

1996
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:35,980
- Oh...
- Yes.

1997
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:38,500
- That's impossible.
- We can't.

1998
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,580
- "I just laugh it off."
- Why would you make them do that?

1999
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:41,920
Is what we ordered
enough for all of us?

2000
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,750
- Yes, it's more than enough.
- Please make it delicious.

2001
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,190
- We'll have those.
- All right.

2002
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:46,480
It's nice here.

2003
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,580
It's so fascinating that
he remembers you two.

2004
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:52,560
- That must be really expensive.
- Did you choose this place?

2005
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,460
No, I gave the staff many options,
and they chose it.

2006
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:56,790
- That's what happened.
- Right.

2007
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:58,560
Why did you dress like that though?

2008
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:01,000
Now that we're on it...

2009
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,910
Gosh, you guys.

2010
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:04,140
He looks weird alone.

2011
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:06,980
This is so annoying.
Why did it burst?

2012
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,940
- Where?
- It really burst.

2013
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:10,980
Did it really?

2014
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:13,670
- Come on.
- Suk Jin...

2015
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:14,940
Maybe it's corroded.

2016
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,890
Corroded?

2017
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:20,190
(A superstar who came by a cafe
with corroded pants)

2018
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:21,480
- This place is a bit...
- They're already here.

2019
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,920
They're here.

2020
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,480
- We can just eat them?
- Yes, go ahead.

2021
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,750
- What should I do?
- Thank you.

2022
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:29,000
This is the seafood tteokbokki.

2023
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,290
- Rice.
- Ramyeon and rice tteokbokki.

2024
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,230
Ramyeon and rice tteokbokki.

2025
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:34,500
It's the chopped steak.

2026
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,060
Look at that.

2027
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:38,730
These are the dishes
I have never had here.

2028
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:40,100
- Thank you.
- What is this?

2029
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,670
- Stew.
- Suit.

2030
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,270
Not suit. It's stew.

2031
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:46,210
- Stew.
- Stew?

2032
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:49,040
- No way.
- Thank you for the food.

2033
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,350
You know,

2034
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:53,390
I never had
a fancy feast like this here.

2035
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:54,520
Seriously.

2036
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,850
- I never ate so well here.
- That's right.

2037
01:03:57,850 --> 01:03:59,390
My goodness.

2038
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:00,660
(The friends who have been together
for 30 years realized their dream.)

2039
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,560
Our plans never succeeded.

2040
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:05,790
We came here with hopes
to meet women,

2041
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:07,230
- but we never succeeded.
- No.

2042
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,670
I will be honest with you.

2043
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:11,410
Before going to a nightclub,

2044
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:13,770
we gathered here for a short while.

2045
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:15,410
- I see.
- Then we had...

2046
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,910
- a briefing...
- Plans.

2047
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:18,770
about what we will do.

2048
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:19,920
You planned how you will play.

2049
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,310
- And...
- "I will pick up the tab here."

2050
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:24,580
We talked about how much money
each member should pay.

2051
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,710
We came up with plans at this place.

2052
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:29,390
All of us were from far away.

2053
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,850
None of us were
from this neighborhood.

2054
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,660
- All of us...
- We were from Suyu-ri.

2055
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,250
- Suyu-ri and Myeonmok-dong.
- Really?

2056
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,290
Myeonmok-dong. Thus...

2057
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,620
Hoegi-dong.

2058
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:39,870
(The big mouths gathered around
from different neighborhoods.)

2059
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:42,100
We had to meet at a place.

2060
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,910
- That's right.
- Why didn't you meet there?

2061
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:45,960
- Why did you meet in Gangnam?
- Why did you come here?

2062
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,410
- We came here.
- You had no money.

2063
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:49,600
- We came here.
- Why didn't you hang out there?

2064
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,250
- We just met someplace else.
- Did you ever talk...

2065
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:53,870
- to a woman you liked?
- No.

2066
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:55,440
- No.
- You didn't even try.

2067
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,690
We didn't think it would work.

2068
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,540
We knew that we were shabby.

2069
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:01,190
There was one forte we had.

2070
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:02,660
- The older members had it anyway.
- Smooth talk.

2071
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:03,750
- Smooth talk.
- I knew it.

2072
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:05,480
- Smooth talk.
- That was...

2073
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:07,920
the only thing we had in Gangnam.

2074
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,460
It did work to our advantage.

2075
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:11,730
In terms of looks...

2076
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:12,960
There are times...

2077
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,830
women take a break
from partying with handsome men.

2078
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:15,960
(That's how it is.)

2079
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,600
- "Let's just laugh today."
- Yes.

2080
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,830
To be honest,

2081
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:21,310
- that was all we had.
- I can say this for sure.

2082
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:23,410
Women who hung out with us...

2083
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:25,910
- laughed a lot.
- They laughed all day long.

2084
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:28,170
And we went home afterward.

2085
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:29,790
(And we went home afterward.)

2086
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:31,020
We went home afterward.

2087
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,160
After laughing for a while...

2088
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,560
They headed home.

2089
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:36,690
- "We had fun." They headed home.
- You were left by yourselves.

2090
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:38,330
We went home afterward.

2091
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:40,350
"I just laugh it off like this."

2092
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:42,330
("I just laugh it off like this.")

2093
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:45,390
Orangeade, lemonade,
and grapefruit ade.

2094
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:47,060
- You can get a latte too.
- I will have a coke.

2095
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:48,270
I want...

2096
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:49,640
iced Americano.

2097
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,410
- Do you want it light?
- Yes.

2098
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:52,870
- Me too.
- Me too.

2099
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:54,310
- Let's all order Americano.
- Okay.

2100
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:55,330
Sir.

2101
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:56,850
Then I will order Americano too.

2102
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:58,000
You should get Americano too.

2103
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,480
- Coke is...
- I thought you wanted a coke?

2104
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,640
No. Americano sounds better.

2105
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:01,770
Order iced Americano.

2106
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:03,190
No.

2107
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:04,520
- Order iced Americano.
- Iced?

2108
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,350
- You should drink something cold.
- Iced Americano.

2109
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:09,060
Please give us seven iced Americano.

2110
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:10,730
Can you make it light?

2111
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:12,660
- Of course.
- Please make one cup light.

2112
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,520
I will add double shots
for the other six cups.

2113
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,920
Please make two cups
with a single shot.

2114
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,870
- Please make it 3 cups.
- So 3 cups with a single shot.

2115
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:19,020
You should have it
with a single shot too.

2116
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:20,060
Please make another cup that way.

2117
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,690
Four cups with a single shot.

2118
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,730
So 4 cups with a single shot
and 3 cups with double shots.

2119
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,210
- Okay.
- Okay.

2120
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:27,170
Do you do everything
Jae Suk tells you to do?

2121
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:29,000
I don't do everything
he tells me to do.

2122
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:30,310
Iced Americano was bitter...

2123
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:32,000
when I made it
with double shots at home.

2124
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,920
- A single shot is better.
- It's better.

2125
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:38,390
- It was a rich and tasty meal.
- Everything was tasty.

2126
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:40,160
You ordered food...

2127
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,560
and shared memories of the past.

2128
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,330
- Jae Suk earned 3 coins.
- Did he only earn 3 coins?

2129
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:45,890
- He talked a lot.
- Jong Kook earned four coins.

2130
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:47,750
My goodness. All right.

2131
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,770
Haha earned 1 coin
and Se Chan earned 2 coins.

2132
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:51,500
- Ji Hyo and So Min didn't earn any.
- Okay.

2133
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:55,770
Here comes the last schedule
of Suk Jin, the superstar.

2134
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:58,600
Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong
will buy a present for his wife.

2135
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:01,830
- Suk Jin will use his own money...
- Of course.

2136
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,270
because loves his wife.

2137
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,270
Go ahead and recommend things
without worrying about the price.

2138
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,640
That's right.

2139
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:08,540
We will recommend things.

2140
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:11,040
- We will keep it reasonable.
- Okay.

2141
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,420
- To be honest,
- We are quick-witted.

2142
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:15,920
my wife doesn't like presents
that are over-the-top.

2143
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:17,730
- So the price...
- You don't know that.

2144
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:19,160
Seriously.

2145
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,020
Have you lived with my wife?

2146
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,750
- Of course, we haven't.
- But...

2147
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:24,270
- your wife is fancy.
- Seriously.

2148
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:26,000
The present shouldn't be
overly expensive.

2149
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,100
- We know that.
- All right, Suk Jin.

2150
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:29,370
Suk Jin.

2151
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:31,460
How much
are you planning to spend today?

2152
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:34,140
Suk Jin doesn't have a problem
spending 2,000 dollars on himself.

2153
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:35,330
How much
will you spend on your wife?

2154
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:36,480
What's the maximum?

2155
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,100
- Is it 500 dollars?
- Suk Jin.

2156
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,140
How much are you thinking?

2157
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:40,580
You need to remember
that this is for a show.

2158
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:41,810
- That's right.
- How much are you thinking?

2159
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:43,440
- I bet it's under 500 dollars.
- Under 500 dollars.

2160
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,020
- It's under 500 dollars.
- Really?

2161
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,290
Under 500 dollars?

2162
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:48,560
Isn't there a category she likes?

2163
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,690
- What?
- What's her favorite color?

2164
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:51,890
She likes fancy things too.

2165
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:53,250
Doesn't she have a favorite color?

2166
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:54,250
You didn't say that earlier.

2167
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,350
You said
that she doesn't like fancy things.

2168
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:57,370
Come on.

2169
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:58,770
She likes fancy designs.

2170
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:00,140
She wears bold clothes.

2171
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:01,770
- What?
- That's not what you said earlier.

2172
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:03,170
Why are you confusing us?

2173
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:04,560
You know,

2174
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,910
she likes ordinary clothes as well.

2175
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:08,330
Don't think about
the brand and price.

2176
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:09,980
- What's her favorite color?
- Style.

2177
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:11,410
How about a scarf?

2178
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:12,670
She should wear a scarf.

2179
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:14,310
Wouldn't it be suffocating?

2180
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,850
You are the most suffocating.

2181
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:17,980
(Suk Jin, the human scarf)

2182
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:19,140
Seriously.

2183
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,420
My wife's fashion style is...

2184
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,830
too different from mine.

2185
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:25,850
She doesn't trust my eyes.

2186
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:27,620
That's why you should trust me.

2187
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,330
- She doesn't trust my eyes.
- That's why you should get...

2188
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:30,460
accessories instead.

2189
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,120
- Ones that are widely popular.
- I can help you pick one.

2190
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,500
How about a necklace?

2191
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,640
- A necklace.
- I don't know about a necklace.

2192
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:36,770
- A scarf is better.
- A necklace...

2193
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:37,830
needs to be very fancy.

2194
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:39,760
- Really?
- It's Christmas.

2195
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:41,270
It's your heart
that matters the most.

2196
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:43,550
- Gloves and scarves.
- Gloves make a nice present.

2197
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:45,470
- A set.
- A scarf is a good idea.

2198
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:47,010
You should go and look.

2199
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:49,050
- That's right.
- Then you will be able to find one.

2200
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:50,980
In that case,

2201
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:52,440
can I get something as well?

2202
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,960
- No. Why would you get something?
- Just because.

2203
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,090
- "Can I get something as well?"
- Buy us a present each.

2204
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:58,980
Of course not.

2205
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:00,160
I will buy you something.

2206
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:02,390
- Jae Suk.
- Go ahead and pick one.

2207
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:04,220
- He is the best.
- Ji Hyo, pick one as well.

2208
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:05,800
Hey, what does that make me?

2209
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:08,340
He is generous enough
to buy his junior a present.

2210
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:09,560
I will buy you a present.
Pick one each.

2211
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:10,910
- Really?
- Jae Suk.

2212
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:13,130
I can buy you a present,

2213
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:15,380
but I don't want to do it
in front of the cameras.

2214
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:17,050
His face turned so red.

2215
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:18,770
- He will be Santa.
- My face didn't turn red.

2216
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:20,440
- My face didn't turn red.
- Santa.

2217
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,580
I don't want to do it
in front of the cameras.

2218
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,310
You should pick one as well.

2219
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:26,380
- I wanted to buy you a present.
- He is a superstar.

2220
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:27,880
- Can I pick one as well?
- Yes. Go ahead.

2221
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:31,380
Today, I will pay.

2222
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:33,260
It's okay. You should just get
your wife's present.

2223
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:34,960
No. I actually wanted...

2224
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,590
- to buy everyone a present.
- It's okay.

2225
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:38,830
Don't force yourself.

2226
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,470
Seriously.

2227
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:41,760
- This is the perfect opportunity.
- I mean it.

2228
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,670
Look at him.
He wouldn't have much money.

2229
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,430
I have a lot of money.

2230
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:46,730
Look at him.

2231
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:48,300
He is leading a fake life.

2232
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:49,910
His clothes are in tatters.

2233
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:51,410
What is this?

2234
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:52,680
- He is leading a fake life.
- These clothes...

2235
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:54,270
are falling apart.

2236
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:57,480
It makes my heart ache.

2237
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:59,750
We are here.

2238
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:01,310
- It's a boutique.
- A boutique.

2239
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:02,660
- Isn't it nice, Se Chan?
- There are so many things to see.

2240
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:04,460
- There are so many pretty things.
- This is nice.

2241
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:06,350
This is cute.

2242
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,550
This is very cute.

2243
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:10,170
- This is like a paradise.
- This is cute.

2244
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:11,170
- Nice.
- There are many cute clothes.

2245
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:12,300
There are so many things I like.

2246
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,260
I think your wife would like
a padded jacket.

2247
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:16,090
No. She doesn't wear
a padded jacket.

2248
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:19,230
- Suk Jin, there are many options.
- Don't look for your item.

2249
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,430
Help me find my wife's present.

2250
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:22,470
I will help you.

2251
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:23,750
There are cosmetic products as well.

2252
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:25,410
Suk Jin,

2253
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:27,120
what Jae Suk's said...

2254
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:29,340
made me focus on my item.

2255
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:30,940
Same here.

2256
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:32,680
I can't help but look for my item.

2257
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,180
- What should I do?
- This is cute.

2258
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:35,660
Se Chan, I can't help
but look for my item.

2259
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:36,830
So Min, how does this look?

2260
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:37,980
It's pretty.

2261
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:39,160
It suits you.

2262
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,630
Stop picking your present.

2263
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:43,390
It has been so long
since I went shopping...

2264
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,970
- that I am focused on my present.
- I know.

2265
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:47,260
My concentration level dropped.

2266
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:49,130
How cute!

2267
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:51,010
- Is there downstairs?
- We were too focused on work.

2268
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:53,630
- Jae Suk, there is downstairs.
- It's so nice to come back here.

2269
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:57,440
So Min, this will look good on you.

2270
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,300
- It's pretty.
- Right?

2271
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,640
- This is exciting.
- This place is nice.

2272
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,270
Doesn't Suk Jin seem like
a designer?

2273
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,140
- You look like a designer.
- Please choose.

2274
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,620
- You look like a designer.
- Please choose.

2275
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,760
Welcome to my boutique.

2276
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,380
- You look like a designer.
- It's hilarious.

2277
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:12,660
- A designer.
- Please choose.

2278
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:13,930
- Ji, the designer.
- This is cute.

2279
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:16,760
- This is cute.
- This is cute.

2280
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,590
What do you think of this?
Isn't it cute?

2281
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:20,430
- It's cute.
- It's cute.

2282
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:22,090
- Isn't it cute?
- It's cute.

2283
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:24,300
- It's cute.
- It's very cute.

2284
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,600
If my wife wears it...

2285
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,430
- Isn't it cute?
- It's cute.

2286
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:29,130
- How about this?
- But...

2287
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,840
she doesn't like rough texture.

2288
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,580
Buy her a padded jacket.

2289
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,010
It's cute, but the price is...

2290
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:36,810
- How about this?
- The texture is too rough.

2291
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:38,010
(Put it back down.)

2292
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,940
How about a padded vest like this?

2293
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:42,180
How about a padded vest like this?

2294
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,680
- Doesn't she like it?
- She never wears such a thing.

2295
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:44,720
This.

2296
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:47,460
Jong Kook headed straight over
to the padded jackets and vests.

2297
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:50,330
She would like a padded vest.
Why doesn't he get one?

2298
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,560
I like this.

2299
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,430
- I think she would look good in it.
- What?

2300
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:55,730
This light purple top.

2301
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:57,870
She would like it. It's short.

2302
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:59,060
- Really?
- Yes. It's very pretty.

2303
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:00,340
- I see.
- It's the trendy style.

2304
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:01,730
- I don't know what's good.
- It's pretty.

2305
01:12:03,410 --> 01:12:05,100
I should check the price.

2306
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:09,220
(He checks the price tag.)

2307
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:13,250
Gosh.

2308
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,460
Where was it?

2309
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:16,680
Why don't you buy
something bright like this?

2310
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,290
- What?
- This one.

2311
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:20,960
She doesn't wear such clothes.

2312
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,550
- No?
- No. It isn't her style.

2313
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:24,260
- I love this color.
- Really?

2314
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:26,090
- The price is good too.
- It's bright, isn't it?

2315
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:28,090
She likes bright colors.

2316
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,100
Isn't this cardigan too big?

2317
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,100
- Boxy clothes are in these days.
- It's too big.

2318
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,510
Loose-fitting clothes are in.

2319
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:35,730
Even if it's loose-fitting...

2320
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,640
What's the price?

2321
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,080
The price isn't that bad.

2322
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,680
You're right.

2323
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:43,010
(The frugal customer is satisfied
by the cheap price.)

2324
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:44,510
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

2325
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:45,840
(Let's see.)

2326
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,120
These are for you.

2327
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:49,720
- Gosh.
- These are for you.

2328
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,160
- Come on.
- They suit you perfectly.

2329
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:52,590
Don't they suit you?

2330
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,000
- They are cool.
- They match your shoes too.

2331
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:55,720
While they go well with my outfit...

2332
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,890
Shall I buy this?

2333
01:12:56,890 --> 01:12:59,300
- I think it will suit me.
- It will suit you.

2334
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:00,540
- What?
- It's pretty.

2335
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:02,470
- Shall I buy this?
- It's pretty.

2336
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:03,760
(The cardigan enthusiast
picked his own present.)

2337
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:06,060
- When she goes to exercise...
- Right? It suits me.

2338
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,040
- When she goes to exercise,
- Suk Jin.

2339
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,010
she can wear this
over her gym clothes.

2340
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,880
- It's pretty.
- I like this.

2341
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:13,010
It's nice, right?

2342
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:14,550
- Do you like it?
- It's nice.

2343
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:16,050
Take a look at the price.

2344
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:18,220
Is it okay? Should I put it back?

2345
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:20,620
- Gosh.
- Put it back.

2346
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:21,660
(It isn't okay.)

2347
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,310
Put it back.

2348
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:24,760
(He orders him to put it back
after checking the price.)

2349
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:26,460
Is that really the price?

2350
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:28,520
- Is there one more zero?
- Yes, there is.

2351
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,430
Suk Jin, your pants are tattered.

2352
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:34,370
- It's quite expensive.
- Seriously.

2353
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:36,000
There is one more zero.

2354
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:37,540
Isn't it nice?

2355
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:38,710
It's pretty.

2356
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:39,800
Put it back for now.

2357
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:42,100
- It's pretty.
- It's for your wife.

2358
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,550
You said that you like it.

2359
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:44,640
How much is this?

2360
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,080
What do you think of this vest?

2361
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:48,120
- This vest.
- It must be expensive.

2362
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,720
- All right.
- It's really pretty.

2363
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,090
- How about this?
- Is it rabbit? Is it mink?

2364
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:52,480
I think it's something like that.

2365
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,790
- How much is it?
- It's 1,950 dollars.

2366
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,120
Hurry up and put it back.

2367
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,760
- Suk Jin, how about this?
- Suk Jin.

2368
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:58,330
This is 790 dollars.

2369
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:00,130
- What is?
- What's her style?

2370
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:01,190
- The cardigan?
- Yes.

2371
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:02,630
Is it that expensive?

2372
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:03,890
Suk Jin.

2373
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:05,260
Please.

2374
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:08,000
Spend money on your wife.
Why do you keep checking...

2375
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,300
- the price tag?
- It's not like that.

2376
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,870
- You are buying her a present.
- It's not like that.

2377
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:12,910
Why did you change your mind
after checking the price?

2378
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:15,040
- It's not like that. It's fine.
- It's 790 dollars.

2379
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,970
You know, 790 dollars is a hefty price.

2380
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:19,250
It's so pretty.

2381
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:21,440
(Meanwhile, suspicious activity
is detected at the changing room.)

2382
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:24,340
(A forsythia gentleman appears.)

2383
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:26,510
This is it!

2384
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,090
What?

2385
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,460
Why did you wear it?

2386
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:32,520
It looks nice. It suits you.

2387
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,830
This is it.

2388
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:34,930
It suits you.

2389
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:37,060
- This is what you should wear.
- Isn't it menswear?

2390
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:39,220
- Seriously.
- It suits you. You should buy it.

2391
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:41,230
Shall I buy it?

2392
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,430
That wasn't my plan.

2393
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:45,370
(He forgot about the mission
and shopped for his cardigan.)

2394
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:49,580
(Se Chan heads somewhere
with a smile on his face.)

2395
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:50,750
Suk Jin.

2396
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:52,470
Suk Jin, in that case...

2397
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:53,750
Hey.

2398
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:54,970
(He puts his hat on the mannequin.)

2399
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:56,720
- Suk Jin, how about this?
- Hey.

2400
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,480
So Min. I am going to buy this.

2401
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,810
It looks nice.

2402
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:00,960
It suits you.

2403
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,880
Suk Jin said it looks nice.

2404
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,290
The hat looks nice.

2405
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:05,980
- This hat.
- It looks nice.

2406
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:07,220
- It looks nice.
- It's cute.

2407
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:08,800
- Why don't you get it?
- How much is it?

2408
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:10,500
Suk Jin, I will hold it.

2409
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:12,370
Why is the hat so hot?

2410
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,690
How about this?

2411
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:17,040
Isn't it the hat you were wearing?

2412
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:18,760
You jerk.

2413
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,130
(It's easy to make fun of Suk Jin.)

2414
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:21,630
Apparently, this isn't her style.

2415
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:23,100
What's her style?

2416
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:24,640
This is so hard.

2417
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,640
Why did you change your mind
after checking the price?

2418
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:32,480
It's not like that. It's fine.

2419
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,790
- Ji Hyo, I think this is pretty.
- How about this?

2420
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:36,920
It's nice, right?

2421
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,550
I saw it earlier. Isn't it too much?

2422
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:39,980
She likes something like this.

2423
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:41,020
- Really?
- It's feminine.

2424
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:42,260
- It's nice, right?
- Yes.

2425
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:43,760
- It's nice.
- It's a bit...

2426
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,170
- This one is cute too.
- She likes something like this.

2427
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:46,520
It would fit nicely.

2428
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,060
- She likes something like this.
- She has eccentric tastes.

2429
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,170
It's nice, right?

2430
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:51,510
Is it the price on the tag?
Is there a discount?

2431
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:53,100
- No.
- It's so pretty.

2432
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:54,880
- It's so pretty.
- Why is it so expensive?

2433
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,180
How much is it?

2434
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:57,710
It's 750 dollars.

2435
01:15:58,510 --> 01:15:59,600
It's pretty.

2436
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,010
A sweater should cost that much.

2437
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:03,250
- It's pretty.
- Really?

2438
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:05,090
- It's pretty.
- The shoulders are reminiscent...

2439
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:06,590
of Son Dam Bi
in the "Saturday Night" music video.

2440
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:07,810
- These days...
- It's pretty.

2441
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:09,010
Son Dam Bi
in the "Saturday Night" music video.

2442
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:11,790
My wife does prefer a sweater...

2443
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:13,330
with a V-neck.

2444
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:14,930
She likes a V-neck.

2445
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:16,390
She prefers a V-neck.

2446
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:17,390
(Suk Jin sways
amidst people's opinions.)

2447
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:19,890
The price is nice too.

2448
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:20,970
(Jong Kook is still looking at
the padded vests.)

2449
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:23,090
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

2450
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:24,870
- Most boutiques...
- That looks nice.

2451
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:26,260
- Suk Jin, listen.
- Okay.

2452
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:28,770
Most boutiques add their own items.

2453
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:30,600
- Really?
- It looks luxurious, right?

2454
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,010
- I will show your the price tag.
- Suk Jin.

2455
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:34,010
It's perfect. 465 dollars.

2456
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:35,640
- It's perfect, right?
- It's nice.

2457
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,440
Yes. It looks luxurious.

2458
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,980
- Look. The color is pretty too.
- It's nice.

2459
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:42,680
Haha, he isn't interested in
that one.

2460
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,020
- No?
- I showed it to him earlier.

2461
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:45,180
Move out of the way.

2462
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:47,220
- It's perfect. It's pretty, right?
- I showed it to him earlier.

2463
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:48,590
He doesn't want it
because it's 1,500 dollars, right?

2464
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:50,300
- No.
- I saw it when I came downstairs.

2465
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,390
I was surprised
upon checking the price.

2466
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:53,390
It's perfect.

2467
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:54,560
These days,

2468
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,890
- people wear oversized clothes.
- It looks very practical.

2469
01:16:56,890 --> 01:16:58,340
Totally.

2470
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,910
Does it come in other colors?

2471
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:01,470
Will it be okay?
Will she be happy to receive it?

2472
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:02,540
Suk Jin.

2473
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,410
It's a sweater
that makes one go, "It's pretty."

2474
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:06,840
It's pretty.

2475
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,420
- You have a point.
- Think about it.

2476
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:09,720
That vest seems like
an insincere present, right?

2477
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:12,420
You can buy something like that
anywhere.

2478
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:13,920
- Suk Jin, do you want this or not?
- I am so confused.

2479
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,720
- Look at this.
- You should buy this.

2480
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,050
- I think...
- Hold on.

2481
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:18,550
this would make the best present.
It's winter.

2482
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:21,330
While it's nice, I don't know
if it would make a good present.

2483
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:22,550
Why? It's pretty.

2484
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,020
When you look at it,

2485
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:26,830
- it looks cute and luxurious.
- This is...

2486
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:30,340
Suk Jin, I recommend this one.

2487
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:31,800
- But...
- The price is just right.

2488
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:33,510
- Really?
- The price is just right.

2489
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:35,840
Still, it's too casual.

2490
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,800
- What?
- It's too casual.

2491
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:39,250
This is better.

2492
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:41,010
- Suk Jin.
- Mister.

2493
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:42,580
You have no money, right?

2494
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:44,880
Get out.

2495
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,090
Get out if you aren't going to buy
anything.

2496
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:49,010
- Suk Jin, tell me this.
- At home...

2497
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:50,980
- What?
- How much do you have?

2498
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,260
- What kind of a question is that?
- What's the limit?

2499
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:55,690
There is no limit.
I want to buy her something nice.

2500
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:58,760
You agreed to everything
under 300 dollars.

2501
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,130
- If it was over 1,000 dollars...
- That's not true.

2502
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:04,210
Suk Jin, you saw everything
in this boutique.

2503
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:05,230
You really did.

2504
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:06,870
- It's about time you buy something.
- I think this sweater is nice.

2505
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:08,630
- My wife...
- She wouldn't like that.

2506
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:10,230
likes eccentric clothes.

2507
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:12,880
- Would she like that?
- It would fit nicely.

2508
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,250
- Even if it fits nicely,
- It's very pretty.

2509
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:17,550
- the cherries and strawberries...
- I have a problem...

2510
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:19,010
- with its arms.
- The shoulders.

2511
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:21,420
The shoulders will look fine
once you wear it.

2512
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:23,310
Why don't you send her photos?

2513
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:24,660
- What?
- Ask her to choose...

2514
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:26,180
- the one she likes.
- Seriously.

2515
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:27,630
- No.
- A photo of this sweater...

2516
01:18:27,630 --> 01:18:28,960
I will buy this one.

2517
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,430
- Really?
- Ji Hyo did it.

2518
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:32,870
- Did you make up your mind?
- It looks nice.

2519
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:34,260
Other items didn't make me go,

2520
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:36,690
- "She would like that."
- How much is it?

2521
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:38,510
- I know her style.
- It's cute.

2522
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:40,260
Once this episode airs,

2523
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:42,730
wouldn't people recognize her
from this sweater?

2524
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,010
People would go,
"Isn't she Suk Jin's wife?"

2525
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:48,640
It's bound to happen.

2526
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,420
- It's bound to happen.
- This is the only one left.

2527
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:52,340
- That's right.
- It's a nice sweater.

2528
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:54,120
- Suk Jin, it fits nicely.
- It's very pretty.

2529
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,660
Suk Jin, it fits nicely.

2530
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:56,760
It's pretty.

2531
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:57,830
(She suddenly has a fashion show.)

2532
01:18:57,830 --> 01:19:00,430
She can wear it
over her gym clothes.

2533
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:01,760
Suk Jin, it fits nicely.

2534
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,260
(Hold on. It looks nice.)

2535
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:04,870
It's really nice.

2536
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:06,930
She likes such clothes.

2537
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:08,340
- Really?
- She does, right?

2538
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,370
I knew it.

2539
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:11,340
The vest is 300 dollars cheaper.

2540
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:13,370
That's why Suk Jin likes it.

2541
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:14,470
That's right.

2542
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:16,710
The sweater is 700 dollars,
but the vest is 300 dollars.

2543
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,440
It's winter,
so the vest is the way to go.

2544
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:20,510
Seriously.

2545
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:21,840
- This is hard.
- The fabric is soft.

2546
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,050
- Right?
- Yes.

2547
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,290
She can wear it
when she goes to play golf.

2548
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:26,510
That's right.

2549
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:28,310
- It does look nice. Go ahead.
- Not bad, right?

2550
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:30,010
Swing.

2551
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:33,050
Come on and show us. Show us a shot.

2552
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:35,330
- Nice.
- What did you hit?

2553
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:37,870
- It's nice and practical.
- It's pretty.

2554
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:39,300
- It's practical.
- I am sweating.

2555
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:40,390
- It's practical.
- Are you sweating?

2556
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:41,840
- Is it warm?
- Yes. I am hot right now.

2557
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,470
My wife did ask me why there are
no short-sleeved padded jackets.

2558
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:45,540
This is it.

2559
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:47,930
You can also wear it
to go for a jog.

2560
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,410
(She becomes a jogging model.)

2561
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:51,940
- It looks nice.
- "What?"

2562
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:53,600
- "Honey."
- That's right.

2563
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,920
I think she will like it better.
She likes to exercise.

2564
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,440
- That's nice.
- I really think that.

2565
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,880
You changed your mind
because of the price.

2566
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:02,790
It's because of the price, right?

2567
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:04,520
- No.
- It's fact.

2568
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,090
It's because of the price.

2569
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:08,690
Since black is too common,
I will buy this one.

2570
01:20:08,690 --> 01:20:09,960
It's a good one.

2571
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:13,020
- I will buy this one.
- It's a good one. Seriously.

2572
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:14,730
She will like it.

2573
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:15,970
She likes light-colored clothes.

2574
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,600
Suk Jin is swayed so easily.

2575
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,230
Back in the day,
he moved when I said,

2576
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:21,970
"They are having a sale."

2577
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:23,510
"They are having a sale." "Where?"

2578
01:20:24,710 --> 01:20:26,340
"They are giving a discount."
"Where?"

2579
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:29,180
(Sale Ji pays for the item.)

2580
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:30,270
Here you go.

2581
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:34,010
We will give a coin to Jong Kook.

2582
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:35,010
Thank you.

2583
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:39,590
It's time to pick the members
who will receive the prize.

2584
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:41,630
You know, Suk Jin is...

2585
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:44,090
in tattered clothes.

2586
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:47,220
Seriously. He is a romantic man.

2587
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:49,470
- He is in tattered clothes.
- He is a romantic man.

2588
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:50,970
- You know,
- He is in tattered clothes.

2589
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:53,800
these clothes are so old
that the overlapping parts...

2590
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,710
- are falling apart.
- His bottom is a wreck.

2591
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,710
- His bottom is a wreck.
- His clothes are falling apart.

2592
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:00,380
- A wreck.
- He really is...

2593
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:02,580
- a romantic man.
- The overlapping parts...

2594
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,420
are falling apart.

2595
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:08,420
According to our record,
Jae Suk has 16 coins.

2596
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:10,290
Jong Kook has 15 coins.

2597
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,220
Haha has 11 coins.

2598
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:14,020
Ji Hyo has four coins.

2599
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:15,660
So Min has six coins.

2600
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:17,220
Se Chan has ten coins.

2601
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:21,540
Since Ji Hyo has
the smallest number of coins,

2602
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:25,540
we will convert 4 coins
to 1 prize ball.

2603
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:27,800
(The number of prize balls)

2604
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:30,410
Let's check the stocks.

2605
01:21:30,710 --> 01:21:33,770
- I told you to invest.
- Seriously.

2606
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:37,440
A negative return
will earn you a penalty.

2607
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,380
- Me? A negative return?
- Yes.

2608
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:40,590
- Did you say that earlier?
- I told you that a penalty...

2609
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:41,790
depends on the result.

2610
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:43,260
(He acts like
he didn't hear the rules.)

2611
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:47,960
(Se Chan recommended buying
stocks in biotechnology.)

2612
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:50,190
(Suk Jin went all in.)

2613
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,930
What's the number?

2614
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:53,260
(A negative return will make him
a candidate for a penalty.)

2615
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:55,260
I'm turning it back on. Currently...

2616
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:56,340
(What will be the result?)

2617
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,060
Currently... What?

2618
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,670
The return is in the negative.

2619
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:02,970
(The return is in the negative.)

2620
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:04,550
(He proved once again
that he has unlucky hands.)

2621
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:06,050
It's 154 dollars.

2622
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,940
- Thus,
- It's 154.80 dollars.

2623
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:12,480
Suk Jin will be
a candidate for a penalty as well.

2624
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:13,680
I can't believe it.

2625
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:15,790
Some people earned money.

2626
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,010
I did.

2627
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:18,850
He should have listened to you.

2628
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:20,090
Suk Jin.

2629
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,330
I told you that there is a prize.

2630
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:25,560
The prize of the day is something...

2631
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,470
you can enjoy
with your family at the year-end.

2632
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:29,840
It's Champagne.

2633
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,540
Thank you.

2634
01:22:31,630 --> 01:22:33,370
- I love it.
- It's a high-end Champagne.

2635
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:34,510
Seriously.

2636
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,540
The first two people
will receive a prize.

2637
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,680
The last person
will receive a penalty.

2638
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:41,640
It's a close call.

2639
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:43,720
- It's a close call.
- It can be anyone.

2640
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,590
What should I do?

2641
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:47,510
I don't want to wear this outfit.

2642
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:49,550
I really don't.

2643
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:51,260
No one wants to wear it.

2644
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:52,850
I really don't want to wear
this outfit.

2645
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,090
The first two people...

2646
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:56,660
It doesn't count if the two balls
belong to the same person.

2647
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:57,760
Prize.

2648
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,470
- Prize.
- Prize.

2649
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:02,690
- The first winner is...
- Let's do this.

2650
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:04,410
Haha.

2651
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:07,300
- The first winner is...
- Me.

2652
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,340
- Jae Suk.
- Okay.

2653
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:11,300
- Jae Suk.
- Okay.

2654
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,880
(Jae Suk wins a prize.)

2655
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,220
He had many balls.

2656
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:15,620
- I know.
- There wasn't a twist.

2657
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:16,750
Let's drink Champagne.

2658
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:18,480
- He is so lucky.
- Let's drink Champagne, Se Chan.

2659
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:19,640
This ball doesn't count
because it's yours.

2660
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,480
Hold on.
How many balls belong to me?

2661
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,510
One.

2662
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:24,480
Then mine will be the last one.

2663
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:26,460
- We don't know it yet.
- I also have one.

2664
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,430
I had only two,
but I still got picked last time.

2665
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:30,130
- My gosh.
- There's not much difference.

2666
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,670
- Prize! Say Yang Se Chan.
- Haha.

2667
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:34,390
(Who's the second prize winner?)

2668
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:35,970
- Haha.
- So Min.

2669
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:36,970
Haha.

2670
01:23:37,670 --> 01:23:39,040
(He had only 2 balls,
but he got lucky and won the prize.)

2671
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,040
I can't believe this.

2672
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,300
I'm so jealous.

2673
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:42,930
- Good.
- Congratulations.

2674
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:44,710
It's a perfect gift
for those who like to drink.

2675
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:45,770
Now...

2676
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:48,770
I'll draw balls
until one of your names is called.

2677
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:49,970
I don't want to get the penalty.

2678
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:51,050
How many balls do you have?

2679
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:52,640
- How many?
- I think I have four balls.

2680
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:53,640
It's good to have
my name picked first, right?

2681
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,120
- It's drawn.
- The first one to be exempted.

2682
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,460
- I want to be exempted.
- It can't be me.

2683
01:23:58,590 --> 01:23:59,680
- It can't be me.
- Jong Kook.

2684
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,350
- Okay.
- I can't be picked...

2685
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:02,590
- because I have only one ball.
- Yes!

2686
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,430
I need at least three balls.

2687
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:07,470
It will be funny
if he wears it again next week.

2688
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:09,060
- I know. It's connected.
- All right.

2689
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:11,170
(Who's the next one
to be exempted from the penalty?)

2690
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:12,210
The next one is...

2691
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:14,680
- Yang Se Chan.
- Okay!

2692
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:15,840
(Sighing)

2693
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,680
- I survived!
- It's Ji Hyo, So Min, and...

2694
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,840
It will be either Ji Hyo or So Min.

2695
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,140
(Only Ji Hyo, So Min, and Suk Jin
are left with 1 ball each.)

2696
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,440
The outfit is...

2697
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,550
Only the members who can fit
into the outfit are left.

2698
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,880
It will be funny.

2699
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,850
- All right.
- Say Ji Suk Jin.

2700
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:32,020
(Who will be the first one
to be exempted among these three?)

2701
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,830
Say Ji Suk Jin.

2702
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:44,830
Jeon So Min.

2703
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:45,920
(Jeon So Min)

2704
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:48,250
- Jeon So Min.
- So Min.

2705
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,830
This is better
than winning the prize.

2706
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:50,920
It's a lot better.

2707
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:53,370
It's better than winning the prize.

2708
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:55,440
- It might be Suk Jin.
- I'm so happy.

2709
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,760
- I have only one ball.
- It'll be funny to wear it again.

2710
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:03,040
(The last draw to decide
a member to be made fun of)

2711
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:04,970
- It's decided.
- It is?

2712
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:08,010
I bet it's me. Ji Suk Jin.

2713
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:09,450
It will be funny
if Ji Hyo is picked.

2714
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:11,120
- The last one to be exempted.
- I bet it's me.

2715
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,790
(Who will be
the last one to survive?)

2716
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:14,790
Song Ji Hyo.

2717
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:18,220
(Song Ji Hyo has survived.)

2718
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:19,290
Suk Jin.

2719
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:21,900
- Two weeks in a row.
- Can you believe this?

2720
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:22,920
(Can you believe this?)

2721
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,900
- Should I wear this again?
- He should wear it again.

2722
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,540
He will wear it again next week.

2723
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:28,540
You must be happy.

2724
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:31,440
How would I wear these?
They are all worn out.

2725
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,540
- I survived.
- This is hilarious.

2726
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:34,740
I was surprised as I tried
to take this off. It just came off.

2727
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:38,340
We are having
a year-end party next week.

2728
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:39,780
- You should come in that outfit.
- That sounds nice.

2729
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:40,910
It sounds perfect.

2730
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:43,250
I think it's perfect for a party.

2731
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:45,510
- It looks good on you.
- I know this is good, but...

2732
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:50,010
(A fancy year-end party
for the grand finale)

2733
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:54,030
(Superstar Ji Seok Sam is back.)

2734
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,160
I'm a queen.

2735
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:59,460
(And the other members
are all dressed up too.)

2736
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:01,290
(But the stars of the day are...)

2737
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:04,410
(the 3 guests who brought great
honor to Running Man this year.)

2738
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:06,940
(Cha Chung Hwa, Ha Do Kwon)

2739
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:09,800
(Hur Young Ji)

2740
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:13,150
(They even have special performances
to celebrate the exciting party.)

2741
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:16,010
(With songs that
old people would love,)

2742
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:19,910
(the festive mood
of the party is heightening.)

2743
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:21,910
(But they have to cook...)

2744
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:24,290
(the party food themselves.)

2745
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:27,720
(But they only have
limited amounts of ingredients.)

2746
01:26:28,330 --> 01:26:32,400
(A war begins
with some signs of overheating.)

2747
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:36,570
(A life-and-death struggle
to get more ingredients!)

2748
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:40,000
(What's happening
to the peaceful year-end party?)

2749
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:42,940
(2021 Clever Year-end Party)
