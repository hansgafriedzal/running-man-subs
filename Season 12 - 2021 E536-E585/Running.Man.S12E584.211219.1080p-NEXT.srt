1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,330
(December 7, 2021)

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,870
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,800
- Hello, Ji Hyo.
- Hey, So Min.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,860
- The Awards Ceremony preview.
- So Min, what's this?

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,710
- With a bouquet...
- What's happening? All right.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,470
Okay. All right.

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,570
- Okay.
- Hey.

8
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,670
Good. Okay.

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,880
Great.

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,540
What do we do with the bouquets?

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,880
What?

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,790
- Are we getting a bouquet?
- Seok Jin.

13
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,790
- This is like "Incredible Moment."
- My goodness.

14
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,160
I love your outfit.

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,180
- I think I'm so out of style.
- An old man who looks young.

16
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,680
- Right.
- This is so tacky.

17
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,950
You had your pants mended.

18
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,390
- His pants...
- I bought a new pair of pants.

19
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,330
Really? I knew it.

20
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,990
- Hello.
- Hi.

21
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,230
But the sneakers...

22
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,900
You're all dressed up, Ji Hyo.

23
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,530
- Jae Seok.
- You look nice, Ji Hyo.

24
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,510
What's wrong with her outfit?

25
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,700
She does look good.

26
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,130
- I mean...
- I was surprised.

27
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,600
You're the one who's poorly dressed.

28
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,410
He does look strange.

29
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,600
He looks like an earl today.

30
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
Ji Hyo looks great today.

31
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,240
- I like your suit.
- My goodness.

32
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,880
You look so stylish.

33
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,350
Is something going on
between you two today?

34
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,590
What are you talking about?

35
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,690
Don't be silly.

36
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,420
- You look great anyway.
- Okay.

37
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,480
My gosh.

38
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,950
Are we shooting already?

39
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,320
Yes, we are. Gosh, you look amazing.

40
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,900
- I like your outfit.
- I look so tacky.

41
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,400
- Today, I want...
- My gosh.

42
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,790
- Shall we begin?
- Yes.

43
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,240
Jong Kook looks
just like a physical trainer.

44
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,570
Let's just start the shoot.

45
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,070
I have a lot to say. What can I do?

46
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,370
That's enough.

47
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,680
I just have a lot to say.

48
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,310
Let's just hurry and begin.

49
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,540
- My gosh.
- Let's begin.

50
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,740
Your shoes are shining.

51
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,850
Let's start the award ceremony.

52
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:32,910
Okay.

53
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,790
- Okay.
- Congratulations.

54
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,880
(They finally stop talking
and start the award ceremony.)

55
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,260
- Congratulations!
- Let's go!

56
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,790
I'm happy for you.

57
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,850
- Congratulations.
- Great.

58
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,230
Well done.

59
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,320
- Okay.
- Good.

60
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,460
Be careful.

61
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,870
(The award ceremony
is over like that.)

62
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,870
(The year-end party
for the members...)

63
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,370
(who have worked hard
for the past year)

64
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,370
- It's party time.
- Cool.

65
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,070
- It's a party.
- Hello.

66
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,740
- It's a party.
- Cool.

67
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,120
This is a party.

68
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,150
This doesn't seem
like a penalty for Seok Jin.

69
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,790
- I know.
- I think so. He looks fine.

70
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,180
- He's just dressed up.
- Because we're having a party.

71
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,520
That's because I pull it off well.

72
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,780
- What?
- I look good in this suit.

73
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,800
What are you talking about?

74
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,900
What did you just do?

75
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,800
- He touched your eyeglass frame.
- That's what you pull off.

76
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,930
He pulls off his eyeglass frame?

77
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,170
His eyeglass frame.

78
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,300
Gosh, Seok Jin.

79
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,310
By the way, take a look at Ji Hyo.

80
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,610
- You look great.
- Gosh, Ji Hyo.

81
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,970
- You look beautiful.
- Right.

82
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,080
You should wear suits
like that more often.

83
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,110
- My goodness.
- You look amazing.

84
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,440
- She looks stunning.
- Seriously...

85
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,620
- This is what my stylist got me.
- I know.

86
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,310
- A perfect suit for today.
- I know.

87
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,680
- It looks great.
- And it's not like...

88
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,090
you just wear
what your stylist gets you.

89
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,860
- It also reflects your taste.
- Sure.

90
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,150
- Exactly.
- Of course.

91
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,220
It's not like
my stylist is not working.

92
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,220
I know.

93
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,270
That's just your taste.

94
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,270
I'm just like, "Forget about it!"

95
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,400
- Sure.
- And I put on what I want.

96
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,110
I do the same thing.
I have a stylist myself,

97
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,400
- but I often pick my outfit.
- He's stubborn.

98
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,810
- He's very stubborn.
- Right.

99
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,080
- I have my own style.
- Right. He does.

100
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,180
- But I just wear what I get.
- What?

101
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,420
- I wear what I get.
- That's true.

102
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,240
- That's a lie.
- The shirt I wore the other day...

103
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,740
that looked like a diaper.

104
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,280
My friend from school
called me after 30 years...

105
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,520
- and said this.
- What did he say?

106
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,890
"Don't live like that."

107
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,120
Was that Yong Man?

108
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,430
- Yes.
- It was Yong Man.

109
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,190
- My hair will grow back quickly.
- Right.

110
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,870
I like your hair.

111
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,590
- Right. It looks good on you.
- You can try many different things.

112
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,900
Ji Hyo, did you go to the same
salon as Jong Kook?

113
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,870
Your hair looks the same.

114
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,610
Did you go to my barber?

115
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,370
- What?
- His barber?

116
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,840
I went to a barbershop.

117
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Did you do your hair yourself?

118
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,710
- A barbershop?
- I went to a barbershop.

119
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,520
- A barbershop?
- You went to a barbershop?

120
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,940
- A barbershop.
- A barbershop.

121
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,080
I thought it was my barber.

122
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,940
I guess Kwang Soo opened a shop.

123
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,860
Kwang Soo opened a barbershop?

124
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,120
A barbershop.

125
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,590
I want to go there.

126
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,960
- About Kwang Soo...
- What about him?

127
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,590
- At the Blue Dragon Film Awards...
- Did he win an award?

128
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,430
He looked like a cat's-paw.
Did you see that?

129
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,140
- I did.
- He had this strange mustache.

130
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,370
(Kwang Soo attended the ceremony
with a strange-looking mustache.)

131
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,770
(Give me 10 seconds.)

132
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,030
(Can I borrow 50 cents?)

133
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,470
- Really?
- Yes.

134
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,680
How did he look?

135
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,940
He looked like a cat's-paw.

136
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,470
- Like this.
- He always looks like that.

137
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,470
With this weird gesture.

138
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,840
He's shy to do this,
so he's always like this.

139
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,250
- With his hair parted...
- It looks like a chicken foot.

140
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,990
He had his hair parted like this.

141
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,990
He enjoyed the ceremony
in a strange way.

142
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,660
He doesn't even know
how to enjoy it.

143
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,390
He hasn't decided his character yet.

144
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,600
Right. He doesn't know what to do.

145
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,620
- It's ambiguous.
- That's a problem.

146
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,490
So Min, you look like a character
from your drama.

147
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,600
- Right. It's "The Queen's House."
- "The Queen's House."

148
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,870
Isn't the dress Haha's mom's?

149
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,610
- Mom. "Get lucky this year."
- It's Haha's Mom's dress.

150
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,110
"Get lucky this year."

151
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,940
I watched So Min's new drama...

152
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,410
because it features So Min.

153
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,980
- I watched it.
- I watched it too.

154
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,480
All my friends...

155
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,180
- I didn't watch it yet.
- You know what?

156
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,310
It's just a drama, but I was like...

157
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,750
"My goodness."

158
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,560
I can't watch it because of my kids.

159
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,250
(This is the scene
that became the talk of the town.)

160
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,660
My gosh.

161
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,890
Hey, are you out of your mind?

162
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,670
(Unlike on Running Man,
So Min sounds tough and terrifying.)

163
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,370
(It receives high viewing rates
with her character of a villain.)

164
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,370
- Gosh, that was...
- Did you watch it?

165
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,240
She doesn't look like
the person we see here.

166
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,610
She's different in the drama.

167
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,740
- I can't watch it.
- Ji Hyo texted me.

168
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,510
- What did she say?
- After watching the drama.

169
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,740
"You vixen."

170
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,490
She flirts a lot.

171
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,120
- I asked her to curse me.
- I guess her acting was good.

172
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,360
And there's...

173
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,730
My goodness.

174
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,230
I can't believe this.

175
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,600
- Right.
- It's unbelievable.

176
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,450
- Seok Jin is...
- It was really cool.

177
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,530
Seok Jin won
the Best Project Music Award.

178
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,130
- What?
- Hang on.

179
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,800
- My goodness.
- Thank you.

180
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,110
It's not for me though.

181
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,560
- Seriously, he should thank me.
- Sure.

182
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,480
He raised you.
You should call him Father.

183
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,280
- I'm like his father.
- Call him Dad.

184
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,940
I mentioned your name
in my acceptance speech.

185
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,780
- You did?
- I said I was grateful to Yu Yaho.

186
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,350
- What about us?
- What about us?

187
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,640
What do you have to do
with this award?

188
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,880
What did you just say?

189
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,450
- You sound so mean.
- Amazing.

190
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,250
- My gosh.
- That's not what I mean.

191
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,490
- Hang on.
- It's not like that.

192
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,860
"What do you have to do
with this award?"

193
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,120
That's not it. Just think about it.

194
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,160
- This is...
- Well...

195
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,600
about another show.

196
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,190
- I was there as a singer.
- It's another show,

197
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,560
- but you could've mentioned us.
- I was really glad anyway.

198
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,170
I was glad that
you turned out so well.

199
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,930
He's proud of you.

200
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,700
- Right.
- I'm really happy.

201
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,430
By the way, Se Chan...

202
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,740
- You're all dressed up, Se Chan.
- You look uncomfortable though.

203
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,410
I'm dressed like a hairtail
from Jeju Island.

204
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,120
- Why are you wearing this jacket?
- Because it's cold.

205
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,240
He's gained a lot of weight.
This is about to burst.

206
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,850
You can have
my Michael Jackson character.

207
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,750
- Well...
- What happened?

208
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,010
It's the end of the year,
so I've been drinking a lot.

209
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,250
It's funny when you're fat.

210
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,180
- I met a lot of people.
- This is cute.

211
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,450
- Your belly looks funny.
- I know.

212
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,190
- Why did you put on weight?
- My belly got fat.

213
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,730
But So Min seems...

214
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,490
to think it's really cute.

215
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,690
She's strange.

216
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,630
Seriously.

217
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,200
Stop it.

218
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,330
She looks even stranger
in this dress.

219
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,540
That's not his arm. It's empty.

220
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,070
The sleeve is empty.

221
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,310
It's empty.

222
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,220
It looks like I have my arm
around her shoulder.

223
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,920
It does.

224
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,510
(She tries to hug him
like a tough girl.)

225
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,160
She's unbelievable. She's so feisty.

226
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,430
The year 2021 is
drawing to a close already.

227
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,190
I appreciate the hard work
that you've shown for the past year.

228
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,930
Right. We've worked hard.

229
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,490
- He agrees.
- That's true.

230
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,540
(January 2021)

231
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,800
(February 2021)

232
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,670
(March 2021, April 2021)

233
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,760
(May 2021)

234
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,110
(June 2021)

235
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,330
(July 2021)

236
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,740
(August 2021)

237
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,740
(September 2021)

238
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,980
(October 2021)

239
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,810
(November 2021)

240
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,310
(December 2021)

241
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,510
We've been through a lot.

242
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,850
- Right.
- Yes, we have.

243
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,580
- Sure.
- It wasn't easy.

244
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,750
I know.

245
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,060
So we prepared a year-end party...

246
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,990
for the members of Running Man.

247
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,160
- I see.
- My gosh.

248
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,120
And we need some guests
to grace the occasion.

249
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,170
- Of course, we do.
- Do we have guests today?

250
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,030
We have three guests...

251
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,890
who brought great honor
to Running Man this year.

252
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,330
It can't be Ha Do Kwon.

253
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,760
Really? Is Do Kwon coming?

254
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,610
- I'm serious.
- I'm sick of him.

255
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,000
- Is it Do Kwon again?
- I'm sick and tired of him.

256
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,410
I bet it's Do Kwon.

257
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,310
You were on Running Man a lot.

258
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,280
I think they call me
when a guest doesn't show up.

259
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,420
I was surprised.

260
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,240
- Look at that.
- It's Do Kwon.

261
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,440
- It's him.
- It's Chung Hwa.

262
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,790
I can't believe this.

263
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,060
Hey, Young Ji.

264
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,380
Hello.

265
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,620
- Hey.
- Jae Seok.

266
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,490
Young Ji.

267
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,490
It's Do Kwon.

268
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,560
Young Ji is here.

269
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,800
Hey, Young Ji.

270
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,890
- Hello.
- Hello.

271
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,170
I just mentioned Do Kwon's name,

272
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,830
- and he's really here.
- Gosh, Do Kwon.

273
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,700
(He joins Running Man
acting pompously,)

274
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,680
(but he always ends up
having a hard time.)

275
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,100
(Whatever he does looks funny.)

276
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,420
(He's like a member of the family.)

277
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,180
(The funniest guest,
Do Kwon is back.)

278
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,680
(The guest who swept the Internet
with her appearance, Cha Chung Hwa)

279
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,130
(Cha Chung Hwa overwhelms people
dancing to "Switch to Me.")

280
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,560
(The video has received
1.27 million views.)

281
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,630
(It was the best opening dance
on Running Man ever.)

282
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,560
(She's perfect for variety shows.)

283
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,310
(She dominated Running Man
with only one song.)

284
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,200
(She's amazing. Have Chung Hwa
on Running Man more often.)

285
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,810
(With so many requests
for her comeback,)

286
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,310
(Chung Hwa's back on Running Man.)

287
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,250
(Hur Young Ji joined the Empty
Head Club on her first appearance.)

288
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,890
(She showed up with her
refreshing charm as an idol artist.)

289
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,950
(But her charm becomes sour
when she answers quizzes.)

290
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,800
(She joined the Empty Head Club
saying some alien words.)

291
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,170
(Doesn't liter start with an L?)

292
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:40,010
(She's the new Empty Head Princess
who's always confident.)

293
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,680
- Gosh, Young Ji.
- Young Ji.

294
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,230
(Welcome to the year-end party.)

295
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,380
Hello.

296
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,050
Young Ji, this is too much.

297
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,110
- Hello.
- Hello.

298
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,150
What's that?

299
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,580
- Hey, this is...
- Hello.

300
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,840
My goodness.

301
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,710
Young Ji, what's with...

302
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,020
It's not like...

303
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,260
Hey, Young Ji.

304
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,680
Hey. Are you a princess?

305
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,220
- I'm just like you.
- Hey.

306
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,800
Young Ji.

307
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,270
The other guests need
our attention too.

308
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,170
- Young Ji, are you Elsa?
- You look beautiful.

309
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,540
- She's Elsa.
- Gosh, Young Ji.

310
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,960
- It's pretty.
- She's unbelievable.

311
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,880
Young Ji, this is like your place.

312
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,570
- She looks beautiful.
- I bet Young Ji saw this.

313
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,970
Today,

314
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,650
I was going to dress
like Elsa from "Frozen."

315
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,520
But the dress wasn't available.

316
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,290
- You work really hard.
- It wasn't available.

317
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,750
You're amazing, Young Ji.

318
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,580
She's Cinderella.

319
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,350
We've had a lot of guests
on Running Man this year,

320
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,390
but these three were really special.

321
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,480
(The 3 guests were outstanding.)

322
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,690
They showed memorable performances.

323
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,760
That's right.

324
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,320
What do you remember about them?

325
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,770
(He can barely remember
what happened yesterday.)

326
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,930
Tell us.

327
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,810
It was shocking that Do Kwon's
family name wasn't Ha.

328
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,860
It isn't?

329
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,140
- It's not his real name.
- It's not?

330
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,730
- Are you Kim?
- From the Kims of Andong.

331
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,330
What's your real name?

332
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,150
- It's Kim Yong Gu.
- Yong Gu.

333
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,020
(They forgot about
the friendly name for a while.)

334
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,570
- We can call him Dragon Nine.
- Yong Gu.

335
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,310
- Dragon Nine.
- It's Yong Gu.

336
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,580
Yong Gu.

337
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,790
- I like Yong Gu better.
- Yong Gu.

338
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,130
- That's better.
- He looks just like a Yong Gu.

339
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,350
- He has the face of a Yong Gu.
- Yong Gu.

340
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,850
You should be called Yong Gu.

341
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,690
- Yong Gu.
- Yong Gu.

342
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,930
Why do you look so shabby?

343
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,900
- Shabby?
- Did you say "shabby?"

344
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm all dressed up today.

345
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,040
I'm in my nicest outfit today.
What are you talking about?

346
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,140
For Jong Kook, this is...

347
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,810
- like a party.
- Sure.

348
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,780
- He's not wearing shorts.
- I'm all dressed up.

349
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,780
I should go
to like five different places.

350
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,610
I'm afraid of Do Kwon...

351
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,520
because he looks fine
only during the opening.

352
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,080
He changes completely later on.

353
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,710
Why do you pretend to be fine...

354
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,560
only during the opening?

355
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,130
We are going to have a year-end
party with the three guests today.

356
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,760
And we need special performances
to celebrate the party.

357
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
- Right.
- Performances?

358
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,800
- Now...
- Are there more guests?

359
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,670
- Here's the first performance.
- What?

360
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:02,400
"When We Disco" by Yang Se Chan
and Jeon So Min.

361
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,580
- Music, please.
- What?

362
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,980
- "When We Disco?"
- I can't remember...

363
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,750
What is he talking about?

364
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,990
(The music plays anyway.)

365
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,190
- All of a sudden?
- Do you remember the moves?

366
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,730
- All of a sudden?
- Do you remember the moves?

367
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,100
(Stepping)

368
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,290
(The hairtail stepped
on the queen's foot.)

369
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,920
So Min took off her shoes.

370
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,840
(The duo is always available
with no extra charge.)

371
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,340
This isn't it.

372
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,480
So Min.

373
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,740
This is so funny.

374
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,800
They're so good.

375
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,640
You guys are amazing.

376
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,590
(They make the best use
of the dance moves they learned.)

377
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,720
- For So Min...
- My goodness.

378
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,150
This is the happiest moment
for So Min.

379
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,020
- Right.
- I was startled. Are you all right?

380
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,690
- So Min...
- She even took off her shoes.

381
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,000
The happiest moment
for So Min is when she does...

382
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,730
- something with Se Chan.
- Right.

383
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,200
- Is your foot okay?
- That's true.

384
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,730
- It's strange.
- It hurts a lot.

385
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,630
But Se Chan...

386
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,290
- never likes her back.
- I know.

387
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,030
- He's unbelievable.
- Right. He keeps his distance.

388
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,480
- Why do you keep your distance?
- That's not true.

389
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,710
- It is.
- I'm not asking you out.

390
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,940
I know.

391
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,950
Thank you.

392
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,300
First, you didn't watch
her new drama, did you?

393
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,410
You should watch it.

394
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,540
What am I supposed to do then?

395
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,850
She was really sexy. I was shocked.

396
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,090
- Thank you.
- She's amazing.

397
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,850
- I look really sexy.
- Okay. I'll watch it.

398
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
(The queen forces him
to watch her drama.)

399
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,120
She does look sexy.

400
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,730
- She's a vixen.
- I should watch it.

401
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,020
- She's a fox.
- And...

402
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,700
we have the next performer.

403
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,200
- Who is it?
- Next up is...

404
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,470
He's back as a singer.

405
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,700
- It's Ha Dong Hoon.
- I said I wouldn't do it.

406
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,790
He will perform his new song.

407
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,740
- Just do it.
- Ha Dong Hoon's new song.

408
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,610
You should do your best here.

409
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,900
You should do your best here.

410
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,670
- Is this how you promote your song?
- Give it a try.

411
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,000
I said I wouldn't do it.

412
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,040
I'm done promoting my new song.

413
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,140
Hey, you look cool today.

414
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,210
- Are you performing your song?
- You look nice.

415
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,950
Play Dong Hoon's new song.

416
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,140
(Haha is actually performing
his new song for the first time.)

417
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,690
- This is a good chance for you.
- You're the best.

418
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,220
There won't be any difference...

419
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,780
between the MR and AR
for his live performance.

420
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,830
- They were different at first.
- They were?

421
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,150
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

422
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,730
- Good luck.
- Let's begin.

423
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,700
What's the title?

424
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,730
- The title is...
- What did he say?

425
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,790
- The new song...
- Hey.

426
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,290
I'm back with a new solo album
after ten years.

427
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,530
- Okay. What is the song title?
- After ten years?

428
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,660
- Ten years?
- Yes, ten years.

429
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,900
- I'll sing "Gap." Let's go.
- All right. "Gap!"

430
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,870
- "Gap?" Is it "Gap" or "Get?"
- Seriously.

431
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,300
- It's "Gap."
- "Gap?" I see.

432
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,950
("Gap," Ha Dong Hoon's new song)

433
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,170
- Oh, my.
- You look so cool.

434
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,450
- Oh, my.
- You look so cool.

435
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,380
(Had I had any gaps in my life)

436
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,830
Is this a trot song?
It sounds like one.

437
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,730
- Is this a trot song?
- Are you imitating Lee Moon Sae?

438
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,050
- He's singing like Lee Moon Sae.
- If anyone

439
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,160
- You sound like Lee Moon Sae.
- What is this?

440
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,420
- He sounds like Lee Moon Sae.
- What is this?

441
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,000
- What's this song?
- This is so unexpected.

442
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,290
- I would be so happy
- I'm surprised.

443
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,530
- Is this really his song?
- I don't know.

444
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,530
- What's this song?
- Let's go!

445
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,480
(While Haha is barely focusing
on his performance,)

446
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,140
(the old man from Seocho-gu barges
onto the stage.)

447
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,350
What is Seok Jin doing?

448
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,670
(What's wrong with him?)

449
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
(It's his new song,)

450
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,250
(but it makes So Min dance
a traditional dance.)

451
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,520
(Haha doesn't care about it
and focuses on his performance.)

452
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,290
(Shouting)

453
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,130
(However, the old man in red pants
won't leave the stage.)

454
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,070
- I didn't expect this kind of song.
- He's excited.

455
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,610
- He's really excited.
- I love this song.

456
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,870
(He seems to have enjoyed
himself enough to leave the stage.)

457
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,980
Are we celebrating
Seok Jin's 60th birthday or what?

458
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,080
Elderly people will love this song.

459
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,170
- Let's go!
- Nice!

460
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,490
(It's so exciting.)

461
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,520
(Screaming)

462
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,590
(Seok Jin gets all the attention.)

463
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,790
(Now that Yong Gu joined Seok Jin,)

464
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,230
(it turned into a party.)

465
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,130
(Haha's performance ended
with a lot of distraction.)

466
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,400
(The singer who just released
a new song is about to cry.)

467
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,870
- That's an exciting song.
- By the way...

468
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,440
- That was great.
- It was unexpected.

469
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,110
- It was more like an impression.
- It sounded like...

470
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,370
- Is it a trot song?
- He sang like Lee Moon Sae.

471
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,670
- It sounded like a trot song.
- No.

472
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,910
I saw Seok Jin rolling his eyes back
after a long time.

473
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,280
Did he roll his eyes back?

474
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,550
(He got so excited...)

475
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,880
(that he rolled his eyes back.)

476
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,380
- That's funny.
- The song was really exciting.

477
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,150
- I loved the song.
- Young Ji couldn't dance to it.

478
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,330
- True.
- She couldn't dance to it?

479
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,570
- It's difficult for me.
- She couldn't seem to do it.

480
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,200
- It's a difficult song to dance to.
- Oh, my.

481
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,660
What was more shocking was
that Chan Hee smiled.

482
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,660
(The song was perfect
for his preference.)

483
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,080
Great. That's good.

484
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,270
- That's great.
- The song will be a big hit.

485
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,950
It's a perfect song for people
aged between 50 and 89.

486
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,480
- Between 50 and 89?
- They'll love the song.

487
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,040
- Between 50 and 89?
- Yes, they'll love his new song.

488
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,750
It's a perfect song
for that age group.

489
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,820
(He can be a top star among people
aged between 50 and 89.)

490
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,990
- You little... I'll kill you.
- That's hilarious.

491
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,250
- I'll kill you.
- Seok Jin...

492
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,460
- Seok Jin and Chan Hee liked it.
- Between 50 and 89?

493
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,500
I mean, he released a new song
as a solo artist after ten years.

494
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,970
Exactly.

495
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,570
But only I got so excited
and danced to the song.

496
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,940
(Only I got excited.)

497
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,940
- Seok Jin really liked the song.
- Indeed.

498
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,400
- People aged between 50 and 89?
- Do Kwon danced too.

499
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,710
- I rarely laugh this hard.
- I can't believe it.

500
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,210
- I laugh so hard that I cried.
- Hey.

501
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,670
Hey, I rarely dance on the show.

502
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,040
- Why did you dance?
- But your song...

503
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,490
Why did you dance to my song?

504
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,510
- Your song made me dance.
- It's a song for young people.

505
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,620
Don't be ridiculous. It's not
what young people would like.

506
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,920
It's what people in their 50s to 80s
would like.

507
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,880
Why did you get excited?

508
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,730
Chan Hee, why did you get excited?

509
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,820
- He's upset.
- This is hilarious.

510
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,130
- Chan Hee, why?
- Just like Tae Jin Ah.

511
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,430
This is so funny.

512
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,860
The melody was so catchy
that I memorized it all.

513
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,000
(Singing)

514
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,670
- This is it, right?
- Yes.

515
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,240
- It's exciting though.
- It's a great song.

516
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,600
- It's a really great song.
- It'll top the charts.

517
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,650
That was funny.

518
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,040
- I love your song.
- It was shocking.

519
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,500
I didn't expect to hear that people
in their 50s and 80s would like it.

520
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,650
It was nostalgic.

521
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,250
- "Nostalgic?"
- The episode we'll shoot today...

522
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,920
will be aired for two weeks...

523
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,920
along with the behind-the-scenes
of the Entertainment Awards...

524
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,660
that will be revealed
for the first time in 11 years.

525
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,850
As you know, food
for year-end parties are important.

526
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,930
- True.
- Yes.

527
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,430
Just as we did before,
when we arrive at the location,

528
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,760
you will receive eggs.

529
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,760
Eggs?

530
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,060
The first team to make
three dishes...

531
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,440
- using eggs wins the race.
- I see.

532
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,530
- I see.
- We'll have to cook.

533
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,040
You will be divided
into 2 teams of 5 members.

534
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,510
- I see.
- Each of you will receive ten eggs.

535
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,580
At the end of each mission,
one of the recipes will be revealed.

536
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,810
You can use your eggs
or someone else's...

537
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,080
to make those dishes.

538
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,960
The first team to finish
making the three dishes wins.

539
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,160
(The 1st to make 3 dishes wins.)

540
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,700
Even the member with the least eggs
on the winning team...

541
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,670
can be one of the people
to get a penalty.

542
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,030
That is, even if your team finishes
cooking more quickly,

543
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,180
if you use or lose many eggs
of yours, you could get a penalty...

544
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,100
despite your team's victory.

545
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,500
And all members of the losing team
will be the candidates as well.

546
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,920
Three out of the six candidates
for a penalty...

547
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,780
will be chosen through voting.

548
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,460
You can get a ballot
by finding someone else's egg.

549
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,850
Turn in the egg you found
to the staff in charge.

550
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,590
Of course, you can turn in an egg
of someone on your team too.

551
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,290
- This is stressful.
- Try not to be betrayed.

552
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,060
The team that wins each mission will
receive extra eggs.

553
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,000
Winning the missions will
play a big part too.

554
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,940
We divided you into two teams.

555
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,950
Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Haha, So Min,
and Chung Hwa are on the same team.

556
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,480
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Haha,
So Min, Chung Hwa)

557
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:23,040
Jong Kook, Do Kwon, Se Chan, Ji Hyo,
and Young Ji are on the second team.

558
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,160
- Okay.
- Nice.

559
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,690
- That's great.
- We have younger people.

560
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,720
This is great.

561
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,130
- Yong Gu.
- We're in our 20s to 40s.

562
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,630
- Team 2049!
- Let's do this!

563
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,250
- Team 2049!
- Let's name our team Team Gap.

564
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,590
- Team Gap!
- Team Gap.

565
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,730
- I'm glad we're on the same team.
- Me too.

566
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,290
The penalty will be decided
at the end of the race.

567
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,290
As soon as we arrive
at the location,

568
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,440
we'll give you time to hide
your eggs at different places.

569
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,180
- The first team to hide...
- It's hard to hide eggs.

570
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,600
their eggs will be
at a disadvantage...

571
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,920
since the members of the other team
could find them while hiding theirs.

572
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,920
Therefore,
the losing team will go first.

573
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
(The 1st team to hide their eggs
will be at a disadvantage.)

574
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,010
- Okay.
- Got it?

575
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,010
- Hurry up and come out.
- Jong Kook, you can come out.

576
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,310
You can't put it in there.

577
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,390
- You must put it on.
- We all came out. Hurry up.

578
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,460
- You can just put it on.
- Done!

579
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,080
All right. Team Jae Seok won.

580
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,460
(Team Jong Kook will go
hide their eggs first.)

581
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,230
The members of the losing team,

582
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,000
- you have to go hide your eggs.
- Okay.

583
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,170
Should we go?

584
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,400
- Okay.
- Okay.

585
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,800
We're Team 2049.

586
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,740
Nice. I like
the cheerful atmosphere.

587
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,030
- Jong Kook, we're first to go.
- Yes?

588
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,380
So they have a good chance
to find our eggs.

589
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,420
True. Let us all stay alert...

590
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,610
and hide our eggs so well...

591
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,810
- they'll never find our eggs.
- Of course.

592
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,450
- As Kwang Soo used to do before.
- That's a great idea.

593
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:30,720
As Kwang Soo did?

594
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,490
- Just as Kwang Soo did.
- That won't be fun at all.

595
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,190
- I'll bury my eggs underground.
- Just as Kwang Soo did.

596
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,630
- Kwang Soo was incredible...
- The nice team...

597
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,630
We just have to watch out
for Do Kwon today.

598
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,130
Do Kwon, make sure not to betray us.

599
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,830
I'll sacrifice myself for our team.

600
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,760
You're lying. You would never
do that. That's not you.

601
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,030
Then will you pitch in
more than we do?

602
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,860
I'm willing to use all of my eggs
to cook.

603
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,410
Then give one egg to each of us now.

604
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,770
We're not allowed to do that.

605
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,980
That's not true.

606
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,340
- What do you mean?
- We're on the same team.

607
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,220
Bo Pil told me that we're not
allowed to do that.

608
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,580
- He always acts like this.
- Exactly. Gosh.

609
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,110
(While Do Kwon is trying
to dodge the bullet slyly...)

610
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,810
- We've been here before.
- You're right.

611
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,580
- This is where we hid eggs.
- Yes.

612
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,430
- We hid rice cakes and eggs.
- Right.

613
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,850
(This is where last year's
Chuseok special was filmed.)

614
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,440
(The members hid eggs
in different places in the town.)

615
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:23,360
(Dirty fights took place
over the hidden eggs.)

616
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,880
- We've done it here before.
- I see.

617
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,140
We know where the others would hide
their eggs.

618
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,680
- I bet we can find them easily.
- This place is...

619
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,150
There were a few places
we didn't search last time, right?

620
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,340
- You'll hide your eggs now.
- Okay.

621
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,390
You can hide them inside and outside
of any buildings you see here.

622
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,890
(They can hide their eggs
anywhere they want.)

623
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,580
I hid one here last time,
but someone found it.

624
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,660
Here?

625
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,520
Places like that are
unexpectedly easy to find.

626
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,050
(Since they've been here before,
they're more cautious.)

627
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,700
I'll check that place out.
I see an air conditioner.

628
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,330
Shall I hide one on top of that?

629
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,560
(Jong Kook climbed up on the roof.)

630
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,770
(He's determined to hide his eggs
where no one can find.)

631
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,500
I wonder if anyone would
climb up here.

632
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,950
(He put an egg on the edge.)

633
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,000
(While Jong Kook is hiding his eggs
with strong determination...)

634
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,180
Done.

635
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,650
(Another member seems
very determined.)

636
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,420
I bet no one will find this.

637
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,280
(He buried an egg underground.)

638
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,020
- Can I hide one of my eggs here?
- Sure.

639
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,630
Good. I think it's perfect.

640
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,460
I must keep them intact too, right?

641
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,500
(She found a box that's good
to hide some eggs in it.)

642
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,060
I hid five in here.

643
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,060
(Ji Hyo also hid her eggs
in a hard place to find.)

644
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,500
- Sir, please don't go anywhere.
- Yes?

645
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,640
Got it.

646
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,330
No one can find it
if I hide it here. There's no way.

647
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,950
(Se Chan will hide his egg
in the bushes.)

648
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,580
(This is it!)

649
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,750
Oh, no. It fell off. Gosh.

650
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,610
(Cracking)

651
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,960
Gosh. I didn't know
there was a hole in there.

652
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,230
(Ssaebssaeb broke 1 of his eggs
from the beginning.)

653
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,350
I didn't know
there was a hole in there.

654
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,260
Darn it. I'm so upset.

655
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,970
Gosh, seriously.

656
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,240
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook is looking
for another place to hide his eggs.)

657
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,030
- It'll take a long time.
- I broke one of my eggs.

658
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,950
- What? My gosh.
- I broke one.

659
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,380
- Wait a second.
- Why?

660
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,010
- You broke your egg?
- Yes.

661
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,480
Why?

662
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,310
Trust me. I'm not lying.

663
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,720
I tried to put one in the bushes.
You saw it, right?

664
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,690
I put it in the bushes,
and it fell off.

665
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,920
- I'll show you later.
- Give me your hand.

666
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,230
I didn't break it in my hand.
It fell off while I was placing it.

667
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,520
I'm telling you the truth.

668
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,960
I bet you got a ballot.

669
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,590
- No, I didn't.
- Where did you break it?

670
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,900
- Trust me. It's over there.
- Where?

671
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,830
- And we can't get a ballot yet.
- Show me later, okay?

672
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,000
- I'll show you.
- Promise me.

673
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,060
- You can see it.
- You have three minutes left.

674
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,300
- Oh, no. What do I do?
- You should hurry.

675
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,530
How about I hide one
on top of the air conditioner?

676
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,980
Hey, wait.

677
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,680
My gosh. I'm upset.

678
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,750
(Se Chan is also looking for a place
to hide his eggs hastily.)

679
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,780
Come on.
Where should I hide my eggs?

680
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,990
Come on.
Where should I hide my eggs?

681
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,280
(Do Kwon saw Se Chan looking
for a place to hide his eggs.)

682
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,320
(Rushing)

683
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,470
(He's approaching
without letting Se Chan know.)

684
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,400
(Quiet down.)

685
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,940
(Se Chan is hiding his egg without
knowing that Do Kwon is coming.)

686
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,040
(But Do Kwon is watching it all.)

687
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,310
(After hiding the egg,)

688
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,340
(he's moving to another place.)

689
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,510
(Surprised)

690
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,920
(Do Kwon is hiding himself hastily.)

691
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,460
(Se Chan who hasn't noticed
Do Kwon...)

692
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,930
(hid all of the eggs he has left
in 1 place.)

693
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:35,290
Can anyone find them?
That's impossible.

694
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,000
(It's not impossible.)

695
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,560
(He's leaving happily
without knowing anything.)

696
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,450
(Do Kwon appeared after Se Chan left
like a wild cat.)

697
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,750
(He found Se Chan's eggs.)

698
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,920
Gosh.

699
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,840
(Surprised)

700
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,610
(He found 1 of Se Chan's eggs.)

701
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,930
(This is a great team combination
unless Do Kwon gets greedy.)

702
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,130
(The greedy Do Kwon)

703
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,020
(He runs away excitedly
after betraying his team member.)

704
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,560
You have one minute left.

705
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,630
One minute?

706
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,440
Hurry up. We can win this.

707
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,640
(Meanwhile, Team Jae Seok sets off.)

708
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,000
Oh, boy.

709
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,300
(There's not much time left.)

710
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,180
(Parking Lot)

711
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,950
Gosh, no. This isn't a good place.

712
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,650
(She has to hide all of her eggs
before Team Jae Seok arrives.)

713
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,840
(Where will Young Ji hide her eggs?)

714
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,340
Can I hide an egg here too?

715
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,890
Oh, no. I don't remember
where I hid them. I'm in trouble.

716
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,550
- Okay.
- That's what he does.

717
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,280
Oh, I remember this place.

718
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,020
- The holiday special. Am I right?
- This is the place we filmed it.

719
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,630
Yes, we played
Name Tag Elimination here.

720
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,790
- I remember Starlight Party.
- We'll hide...

721
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,170
- our eggs here.
- Starlight Party wasn't here then.

722
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,900
- It was here.
- It was here then, Seok Jin.

723
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,940
This is where we hid eggs.

724
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,940
- I remember that, but...
- Will we hide our eggs right away?

725
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,210
- Yes.
- I see.

726
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,440
You can go whenever you're ready.

727
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,450
Got it. Okay. Can I hide one there?

728
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,210
- All right. Let's go.
- Let's go.

729
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,750
I don't think I can find
my eggs later.

730
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,150
I took photos of the places
I hid my eggs.

731
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,390
- Did you?
- Yes.

732
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,010
They might have hidden an egg
in here.

733
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:08,020
(Team Jae Seok started searching
for Team Jong Kook's eggs.)

734
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,160
Jong Kook must've hidden his eggs
in unexpected places.

735
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,400
Oh, I found one.

736
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,560
(He found Young Ji's egg.)

737
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,440
(She underestimated the cast members
and hid it in an easy place.)

738
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,150
It's obvious. We all think alike.

739
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,680
When can I use my ballot
if I get one?

740
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,040
At the end of the race.

741
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,390
Is it important to get many ballots?

742
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,810
You'll vote for the person
to get a penalty.

743
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,010
Where should I hide these? Well...

744
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,390
(So Min is also looking
for Team Jong Kook's eggs.)

745
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,350
I hid my egg in here last time
and lost it.

746
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,960
Oh, my. I got so lucky.

747
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,500
Awesome. They belong to Se Chan.
Okay.

748
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,670
I'm going to use his eggs to cook.

749
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,470
I have to hide my eggs.

750
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,740
I'll do an amazing job
at hiding my eggs this time.

751
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,840
(He's disassembling
the air conditioner while mumbling.)

752
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,570
This is amazing. I'm a genius.

753
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,310
No one will open it, right?

754
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,310
(He hid an egg
inside the air conditioner.)

755
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,420
Okay.

756
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,750
May I come in just for a moment?

757
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,920
- I'm sorry. I'll be quick, ma'am.
- It's okay.

758
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,960
You won't use them, right?

759
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,050
No, I won't.

760
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,550
I'll hide one here.

761
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,090
(She found regular eggs
in the kitchen.)

762
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,430
I'll hide my egg among them, ma'am.

763
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,290
This is great. Oh, my.

764
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,210
Thank you for letting me in, ma'am.

765
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,440
I think I found a great place
to hide my egg.

766
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,680
No one will find it.
I did an amazing job. Great.

767
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:38,770
Hold on. I'm going to search
the place I hid an egg last time.

768
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,220
(Jae Seok approaches
the air conditioner.)

769
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,250
This air conditioner lays eggs.

770
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,630
(Seok Jin hid his egg in the place
where Jae Seok hid his last time.)

771
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,790
I'm glad that the air conditioner
laid an egg.

772
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,400
Oh, my. It belongs to Seok Jin
of all people.

773
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,000
I thought it wasn't Seok Jin's,
but it turned out to be his.

774
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,300
I bet he thinks that he hid it
where no one could find.

775
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,250
It's so funny.
I hid an egg here last time.

776
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,450
(Seok Sam hid it in an obvious place
and bragged about it.)

777
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,680
Seok Jin,
where did you hide your eggs?

778
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,650
I can't tell you that.

779
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,040
You won't tell me? Why?

780
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,310
I can't tell you that
because you'd steal my eggs.

781
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,310
- Gosh. I'd never do that.
- I'm sure of it.

782
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,390
You would definitely steal them.

783
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,820
You and I are on the same team.

784
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,580
- Still, you'd steal my eggs.
- No way.

785
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,320
Did he hide one there?

786
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,400
(They lost team spirit
a long time ago.)

787
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,130
I'll go to the place
I hid an egg last time.

788
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,700
Hello.

789
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,760
I hid an egg in a place like this.

790
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,830
I hid mine in the fridge
in the kitchen.

791
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,210
- Hello.
- Hello.

792
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,410
Has anyone come in here?

793
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,150
- Someone stopped by.
- Right?

794
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,150
Yes.

795
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,250
Where did that person stop?

796
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,840
- I don't know that.
- Pardon?

797
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,720
You can't answer
that question, right?

798
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,730
Someone came in here for sure.

799
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,350
(Haha figured something out.)

800
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,400
(Chuckling)

801
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,860
Oh, my. There's a lot of eggs here.

802
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,410
It's a good place to hide many eggs.

803
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,670
I knew it.

804
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,030
(He found So Min's eggs.)

805
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,030
Oh, dear.

806
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,300
Thank you, So Min.

807
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,950
(He's putting the eggs
in his pockets.)

808
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:22,510
I feel bad about taking her eggs,
but I have no choice.

809
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,990
I should go and exchange them
for ballots.

810
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,020
Thank you so much.

811
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,000
(Following Jae Seok,
Haha betrayed his team member.)

812
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,130
(Meanwhile,
Jae Seok is hiding his eggs.)

813
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,130
Can you still see it?

814
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,500
I can't see it now.

815
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,230
I haven't found any eggs yet.

816
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,290
I found one.

817
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,940
- Whose egg was it?
- It was Young Ji's.

818
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,940
- Really?
- Just this one.

819
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,910
It's hard to hide eggs.

820
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,530
It's really hard. I've hidden
all of mine. What about you?

821
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,800
Did you hide all of them
in the same place?

822
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,940
Yes, I did.

823
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,150
I knew it.

824
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,570
- I hid all of them...
- You never change.

825
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,040
(Anxious)

826
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,580
- Why?
- Where will you hide yours?

827
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,650
- Sorry?
- Where will you hide yours?

828
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,080
I'll go around to the back.

829
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,080
(He avoided answering the question.)

830
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,160
(He started searching
as soon as Jae Seok left.)

831
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,430
(I'm sure it was around here.)

832
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,130
Where did he hide them?

833
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,320
We're not allowed to find
the eggs of those on the same team.

834
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,290
You can exchange an egg of your team
member for a ballot as well.

835
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,740
- Really?
- Can we?

836
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,640
That's not right.

837
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,740
- Really?
- Why?

838
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,240
The other members on my team must be
searching for my eggs.

839
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,270
(Haha is exchanging eggs
for ballots there.)

840
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,450
Haha is exchanging eggs
for ballots there.

841
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Hey.

842
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,040
- I'll exchange two eggs.
- Hey.

843
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,920
Wait, no. They can see me
from over there.

844
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,720
- Why?
- What are you doing here?

845
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,850
Why?

846
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,460
What is it?

847
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,020
(Jae Seok is worried
Haha might find his eggs.)

848
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,230
I think I should hide my eggs
somewhere else.

849
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,200
Why? Why would you do that?

850
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,520
- I really should move them.
- Why?

851
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,900
- I should hide them somewhere else.
- Why? We're on the same team.

852
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,790
- I don't trust you.
- What?

853
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,590
Why? We're on the same team.

854
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,210
You can't take mine.

855
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,570
- Got a death wish?
- But...

856
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,570
Jae Seok, wait.

857
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,570
- We're on the same team.
- No.

858
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,000
- We're teammates. Come on.
- Darn.

859
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,150
- No. I can't let it happen.
- Please.

860
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,280
I'm begging you.

861
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,750
- No.
- You hid them well.

862
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,810
- Why? We're teammates.
- Gosh, seriously.

863
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:07,820
(Jae Seok runs away
after retrieving his eggs.)

864
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,320
(What a shame.)

865
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,430
Gosh, I can't believe that punk.

866
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,200
(Haha lost his chance.)

867
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
I'll exchange one egg for now.

868
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,560
(I'll exchange one egg for now.)

869
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,530
(As he lost a chance to team kill,
he decided to get a ballot.)

870
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,640
It's So Min's egg.

871
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,410
(He turned in 1 of So Min's eggs
and got 1 ballot.)

872
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,180
(Jeon So Min)

873
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,150
(So Min saw Haha exchanging
the egg for a ballot.)

874
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,840
(She spotted Haha.)

875
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,490
I'd like to get ballots.
Two ballots, please.

876
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,780
(So Min noticed
something fishy was going on.)

877
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,630
(She exchanged Se Chan's eggs
for 2 ballots.)

878
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,230
I'll exchange this for a ballot now.

879
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,350
Getting many ballots will help me
avoid a penalty, right?

880
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,630
(The team spirit has been
shattered in pieces.)

881
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,940
Will I remember all the places?

882
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,290
Please go in now.

883
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,300
No one will search here.

884
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,670
(Team Jae Seok finished
hiding their eggs.)

885
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,800
I remember this place clearly.

886
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,300
I remember everything.

887
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,570
I was pregnant when we came here.

888
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,680
What?

889
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,310
That's right. You were
in the early stage of pregnancy.

890
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,510
I had morning sickness
when I was here.

891
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,920
(Running Man, Episode 523,
Chuseok last year)

892
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,190
(So Min and Se Chan played
a married couple for 1 day.)

893
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,630
(Retching)

894
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,630
(And the fake marriage couple were
blessed that day.)

895
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:30,000
(They enjoyed role playing so much.)

896
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,440
(And they're back here
after 1 year.)

897
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,100
- I had morning sickness.
- Oh, hi.

898
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,570
- Hi, my sister-in-law.
- Hi, my brother-in-law.

899
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,480
- You're here.
- Yes.

900
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,570
I gave birth recently.

901
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,840
I haven't recovered fully yet.

902
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,450
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

903
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,810
I left my baby with someone.

904
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,780
- Did you give birth to your baby?
- Of course.

905
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,630
Where is your baby
with a protruding mouth?

906
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,400
It turned out
that she took after me.

907
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,630
That's a relief.

908
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,930
I'll sign her up for a beauty
contest. She's so pretty.

909
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,430
- It's a girl?
- Yes.

910
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,000
You must be happy.

911
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,530
- Oh, dear.
- Se Chan.

912
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,410
- Sir, can I have a dried squid?
- What's that?

913
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,740
- Dong Hoon.
- If I'd found at least one egg...

914
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,030
- Dong Hoon.
- It was so easy.

915
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,910
- We rearranged your song...
- Really?

916
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,150
- during the break.
- Did you?

917
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,750
- Yes, it's completely different.
- We rearranged the song.

918
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,450
- It's perfect for elderlies.
- Absolutely.

919
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,040
- Sing the first few bars.
- Sing it.

920
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,110
- We'll sing the rest.
- We'll sing it for you.

921
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,040
Sing the part that goes,
"Had I had any gaps in my life."

922
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,650
(Had I had any gaps)

923
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,420
(Had I had any gaps)

924
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,750
(In my life)

925
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,230
(Your days will be sunny again)

926
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:32,090
(They mixed his song
with Song Dae Kwan's "Sunny Day.")

927
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,360
It sounds so natural, right?

928
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,470
Indeed.

929
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,910
(Shaking his head)

930
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,410
- Look at his face.
- It wasn't me.

931
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,570
- Had I had gaps
- It wasn't me.

932
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,910
(Had I had any gaps)

933
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,340
(Your days will be sunny again)

934
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:51,250
- It does match my song though.
- It's perfect.

935
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,250
- Isn't it perfect?
- It'll become a hit for sure.

936
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,130
- Definitely. It'll be a big hit.
- Right.

937
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,430
(It'll be popular among people aged
50 years or over like Seok Sam.)

938
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,730
- Your days
- Your days

939
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,230
(His new song became more addictive
with the additional trot vibe.)

940
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,290
It's perfect.

941
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,500
It fits perfectly.

942
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,790
(Chuckling)

943
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,970
- Do you know what's scary?
- Tell me.

944
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,670
It's the fact that Jong Kook's
finding it funny.

945
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,170
(It's the fact that Jong Kook's
finding it funny.)

946
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,210
He thinks it's hilarious.

947
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,270
(Look at him.)

948
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,750
Look at him.

949
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,840
He's been loving it
since he first figured it out.

950
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,450
He sang it about ten times
on our way here.

951
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,750
Really?

952
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,820
- That easily?
- Jong Kook's having fun.

953
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,260
(Madness)

954
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,480
He...

955
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,710
- Jong Kook...
- That easily?

956
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,090
Jong Kook thinks
that it's hilarious.

957
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,900
- Because it is.
- See?

958
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,820
- It's hilarious.
- This is not good.

959
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,130
- Guys.
- Look at him having fun.

960
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,170
- He won't forget anytime soon.
- It rolls off your tongue.

961
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:40,260
This is the first game...

962
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,400
- where you can obtain extra eggs.
- Extra eggs.

963
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,210
It's the Crazy Acting Party.

964
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,440
- What will we be doing?
- Acting?

965
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,300
- Each team will compete in turns.
- Yes.

966
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,210
After hearing
what the scene is about,

967
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,050
you will go into the room...

968
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,710
and choose a person
to act out the scene.

969
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,690
The others will practice
their responses.

970
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,780
- Our responses?
- Our responses?

971
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,690
Once your two minutes are up,

972
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,590
you will all exit the room...

973
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,360
and act out the scene
that was given to you.

974
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,960
The opposing team will guess...

975
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,730
which one of you
actually went through with it.

976
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,800
- That sounds like fun.
- For instance,

977
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,900
I got it.

978
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,960
one of you had to smell...

979
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,570
Se Chan's socks.

980
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,380
You will enter the room
and decide who'll actually do it.

981
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,440
- Then...
- We're supposed to guess who.

982
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,800
- We're supposed to guess.
- The others will be acting.

983
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,170
The others will pretend
to have smelled it.

984
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,340
They'd either scrunch up their faces
or act like nothing happened.

985
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,940
- That's right.
- You will get three turns each.

986
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,690
You will decide who goes first,

987
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,550
but the one going first
could be at a disadvantage.

988
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,650
- Right.
- That's right.

989
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,760
Then...

990
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,400
- How about a Game of Wits?
- Why not?

991
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,630
- A Game of Wits?
- The losing team...

992
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,420
will instantly head to the room.

993
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,960
- Do we stand up?
- Yes.

994
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,760
I doubt Seok Jin
will get on his feet.

995
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,170
It's why we need to win.

996
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,760
It looks like Jae Seok
won't be standing either.

997
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,300
- I'll go first, guys.
- Hey.

998
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,440
- I'll go one.
- A Game of Wits.

999
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,900
I'll go at one and self-destruct.

1000
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,780
Yes, do that.

1001
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,210
- I'll go at one as well.
- Ready...

1002
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,750
- I'll go first.
- And go.

1003
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,170
- One!
- One!

1004
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,210
The both of you?

1005
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,110
- The three of us...
- Are you kidding me?

1006
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,840
- I said I'd go first.
- I said it too.

1007
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,860
- We're at a disadvantage now.
- Unbelievable.

1008
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,320
- Next round.
- Just go instantly with one.

1009
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,360
Ready, get set,

1010
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,420
- go.
- Leave them be.

1011
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,590
- One.
- Two.

1012
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,650
Three.

1013
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,360
- Get up.
- Four.

1014
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,800
- Do Kwon, go on.
- No.

1015
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,920
- You have to get up.
- Six.

1016
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,960
- Five.
- Do Kwon, go on.

1017
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
- No.
- You have to get up.

1018
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,000
- Six.
- Not yet.

1019
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,710
- The game's over.
- Why didn't you get up?

1020
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,860
- Six.
- Not yet.

1021
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,980
The game's over.

1022
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,170
- Why didn't you get up?
- Hey!

1023
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,630
You should've gotten up.

1024
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,840
- What were you doing?
- Are you kidding me?

1025
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,250
You could've gotten up ages ago.

1026
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,880
- The game's over.
- What's wrong with you?

1027
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,340
- But there are ten of us.
- Is someone a mafia today?

1028
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,610
Seriously?

1029
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,820
When were you eliminated?

1030
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,610
- In the first round.
- Exactly.

1031
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,150
He wasn't aware of the rules!

1032
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,150
- Unbelievable.
- This time, you'll sit down.

1033
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,690
- Right.
- Sure, we'll sit down.

1034
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,030
- You're done for.
- You've been eliminated.

1035
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,190
What's with him?

1036
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,300
- He loses it after the opening.
- Yong Gu, please!

1037
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,590
Unbelievable.

1038
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,460
- Yong Gu's killing me.
- Go, Yong Gu.

1039
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,900
I'm glad to know
you're just as ditzy.

1040
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,610
- Ready, get set, go.
- I'm glad.

1041
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,030
- One.
- Two.

1042
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,070
- Three.
- Four.

1043
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,440
- Five.
- Five.

1044
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,510
(Seok Jin and Chung Hwa
are both eliminated.)

1045
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,570
Nice!

1046
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,050
- We can win this.
- We did great.

1047
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,940
Wait for Jae Seok
and just self-destruct with him.

1048
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,980
You can win this.

1049
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,110
- Jong Kook, just...
- I'll give it a shot.

1050
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,210
Is Jae Seok the only one left?

1051
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,980
See how Jae Seok does it!

1052
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,380
- You fools!
- I can be faster.

1053
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,230
- Right.
- I can be faster.

1054
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,980
- He will beat all three.
- Just you watch.

1055
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,650
- You'll see me winning this.
- Okay.

1056
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,820
Just you watch.

1057
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,190
- Nice!
- You'll be in awe.

1058
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,670
- Triple kill!
- Let's do this.

1059
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,300
Just wait for Jae Seok
to say a number.

1060
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,300
The Master of Games will show you.

1061
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,210
- The MG.
- The Master of Variety Shows,

1062
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,030
the Master of PPL,
and the Master of Games.

1063
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,570
(Yu Jae Seok,
a master in many fields)

1064
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,780
Ready, get set, go.

1065
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,800
- One.
- Two.

1066
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,510
(Jong Kook says one first
by mistake.)

1067
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,170
- One will be out.
- He won this round.

1068
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,550
(Did you see that?)

1069
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,860
He eliminated two actually.

1070
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,360
They could say it at the same time.

1071
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,630
But... Three.

1072
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,280
- Four.
- No one was eliminated then.

1073
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,820
- Okay.
- Now it's down to two.

1074
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,500
- I know what I must do now.
- I wasn't expecting that.

1075
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,230
- Nicely done.
- The Master of Games.

1076
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,530
The Master of Games.

1077
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,860
- I get it now.
- The Master of Games.

1078
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,030
That was cool, Jae Seok.

1079
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,300
Young Ji, don't do anything.

1080
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,670
- Just stand there.
- Got it.

1081
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,840
Let them two compete.

1082
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,440
- Get ready.
- The viper's out to get him.

1083
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,800
And go!

1084
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,610
- Tensions are high.
- Young Ji, wait for it.

1085
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,110
Young Ji, wait for it.

1086
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,920
Jae Seok, now.

1087
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,880
Jong Kook's going
to say "one" together.

1088
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,050
- One.
- One.

1089
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,420
- One.
- One.

1090
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,480
Okay.

1091
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,980
- I said it.
- No way.

1092
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,230
She wasn't fast enough.

1093
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,960
- She said it.
- But a second later.

1094
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,190
- She said it.
- She said "One."

1095
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,590
- She said "One."
- I heard it.

1096
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,650
I heard her say it.

1097
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,170
- She didn't make it.
- She wasn't fast enough.

1098
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,190
- You didn't sit down though.
- Okay!

1099
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,260
(Young Ji didn't sit
which is why it doesn't count.)

1100
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,030
- Okay.
- Okay, fine.

1101
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,210
- Hear me out though.
- Triple kill!

1102
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,530
- Yu Jae Seok!
- Yu Jae Seok!

1103
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:39,010
- Had I had any gaps
- The Master of Games.

1104
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,130
- In my life
- She didn't manage to sit.

1105
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,670
- Your days will be
- Your days will be

1106
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,150
- What are you going to do about it?
- I don't know.

1107
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,320
- But...
- I'm the Master of Games.

1108
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,670
- But...
- She didn't manage to do it.

1109
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,980
Normally when we play...

1110
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,050
the Game of Wits,

1111
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:52,210
- you consider this as a fail.
- She didn't manage to do it.

1112
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,860
- That's right.
- You eliminate that person.

1113
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,550
- She wasn't fast enough.
- But she didn't sit down.

1114
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,760
No, hear me out.

1115
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,630
When we normally play this game...

1116
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,570
(He chokes the producer
with hard facts.)

1117
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,530
You consider this as a failure.

1118
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,000
But the situation
is different today.

1119
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,090
This is what I want to do today, I guess.

1120
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,610
(This is what I want to do today,
I guess.)

1121
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,800
(He shuts Jong Kook down
with an unbreakable logic.)

1122
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,940
Right, okay.

1123
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,820
(For some reason, that answer
puts a smile on everyone's faces...)

1124
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,880
(regardless of their teams.)

1125
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,090
Fine, I hear you.

1126
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,650
- Okay.
- Nice.

1127
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,150
Take this!

1128
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,460
(He celebrates
with the Russian folk dance.)

1129
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,150
(You!)

1130
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,820
Okay. The last round will be
rock-paper-scissors.

1131
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,320
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- If you win...

1132
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,090
- If I win...
- It'll go down in history.

1133
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,530
Triple kill!

1134
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,760
Rock-paper-scissors

1135
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,570
(How will it end for the hero?)

1136
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,940
- The MG.
- I'm amazed.

1137
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,510
Triple kill!

1138
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,710
- The MG.
- Rock-paper-scissors

1139
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,940
Okay!

1140
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,030
(Jae Seok loses.)

1141
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,110
(He falls flat on his face
when it really matters.)

1142
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,780
- After two great rounds?
- That's what you lose at?

1143
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,940
But you were on a roll.

1144
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,650
- It was all for nothing!
- My gosh!

1145
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,150
My gosh!

1146
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,190
- Goodness!
- I bet...

1147
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,690
the Russian dance annoyed him.

1148
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,380
Is this the real him?

1149
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,650
- Okay.
- All right.

1150
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,500
Let me tell you your scene then.

1151
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,690
- Sure.
- It wasn't easy.

1152
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,130
- Your scene...
- We're up first.

1153
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,940
Only one will eat
a spicy Cheongyang chili...

1154
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:14,960
while the others will eat a chili
that is not spicy at all.

1155
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,670
I have a high tolerance
for spicy food.

1156
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,300
- But I don't.
- I have a low tolerance.

1157
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,630
They must exit
as soon as they've eaten it.

1158
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,730
- Right.
- You must exit right away.

1159
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,170
- We'll choose randomly.
- I can't eat spicy food.

1160
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,340
(They'll decide who'll eat
the spicy chili inside.)

1161
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,840
My gosh.

1162
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,170
- Unbelievable.
- These are the non-spicy ones.

1163
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,940
- This is the worst.
- This is the spicy one.

1164
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,440
- We're doomed.
- Shall we play rock-paper-scissors?

1165
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,150
Seok Jin and Jae Seok
can't tolerate spicy food.

1166
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,730
- Really?
- Yes, and it'll show.

1167
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,400
Who's good with spicy food?

1168
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,420
- Haha.
- That's right.

1169
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,570
It could be a Running Man member,

1170
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,960
but they might have Chung Hwa eat it
since she's a guest.

1171
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,630
Because Chung Hwa...

1172
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,940
- She's the guest.
- They started acting already.

1173
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,730
- To get her involved.
- I see.

1174
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,510
- It'll be Chung Hwa then.
- That's my guess.

1175
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,980
Haha usually lets the guest
have more screen time.

1176
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,710
That's because
he wants to slack off.

1177
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,750
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors

1178
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,940
Nice. No way!

1179
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,650
- He's faking it.
- Right.

1180
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,650
- He's faking it.
- It's nothing to shout about.

1181
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,190
- It's a lie.
- It's to throw us off.

1182
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,820
Talk about old-fashioned.

1183
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,960
So...

1184
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,650
Must we eat the whole chili?

1185
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,570
- It's spicy.
- I can smell the spiciness.

1186
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,130
It's killing me!

1187
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,940
(Which one of them
ate the spicy chili?)

1188
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,730
- Please take your seats.
- Our seats?

1189
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,230
- All right.
- Oh, no.

1190
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,670
It's killing me.

1191
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,780
My gosh. Oh, no.

1192
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,570
- Oh, no.
- Here we go.

1193
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,010
It's killing me.

1194
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,510
Please sit on the cushions.

1195
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,550
Just a second.

1196
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:34,980
- She...
- I'm...

1197
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,210
- My gosh.
- It was super spicy.

1198
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,710
(They all exit the room in agony.)

1199
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,690
- Oh, no.
- Why can't I stop laughing?

1200
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,300
Chung Hwa means business today.

1201
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,760
You're taking this
way too seriously.

1202
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,000
- Just a second.
- Chung Hwa...

1203
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,190
- You will get one minute.
- Did you throw up?

1204
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,940
I bet you spat it out.

1205
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,730
What's that in your mouth?

1206
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,400
Chung Hwa looks like she threw up.

1207
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,380
- Of course not.
- Like this.

1208
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,940
Jae Seok, my gosh.

1209
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,380
Jong Kook, check out his eyes.

1210
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,280
So Min's in tears.

1211
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,400
No, she's acting.

1212
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,550
- It's really spicy.
- She's that good of an actor?

1213
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,820
She's the worst.

1214
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,780
- She's acting right now.
- No, it's really spicy.

1215
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,650
The fact that
she seems to be acting...

1216
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,190
No, it's the truth.

1217
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,260
Could...

1218
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,460
- her acting be this awkward?
- I think it's Jae Seok.

1219
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,130
- I doubt it.
- Seok Jin can't tolerate it,

1220
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,820
- so I doubt he ate the chili.
- Right.

1221
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,260
Our guess is Haha or Jae Seok.

1222
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,070
We decided by playing
rock-paper-scissors.

1223
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,090
- But...
- We played rock-paper-scissors,

1224
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,170
- so the person was chosen randomly.
- He's faking it.

1225
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,340
Can I have some water?

1226
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,800
There's no way
Haha would talk that way.

1227
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,510
He's good with spicy food.

1228
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,280
(No way!)

1229
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,070
(Here's another person
who is being awkward.)

1230
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,510
I bet he was just thirsty.

1231
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,050
- He suddenly got thirsty.
- Do we have 30 seconds left?

1232
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,650
Jae Seok's seems
too peaceful right now.

1233
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,760
Look at the tone of his skin.

1234
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,190
So Min, can we see your ears?

1235
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,280
- My ears?
- Yes, show us.

1236
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,150
We can see everyone else's,
but not yours.

1237
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,920
- Do you want to see my ears?
- Yes.

1238
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,070
Show us your ears.

1239
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,400
- It's not her.
- She didn't eat the chili.

1240
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,090
She's giggling now.

1241
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,130
Check out Seok Jin's gaze.

1242
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,960
One might think
he ate jelly instead.

1243
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,400
- Something sweet.
- I don't see...

1244
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,340
- a drop of sweat on his forehead.
- Right.

1245
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,010
Chung Hwa's the one
with a damp forehead.

1246
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:11,070
It's time to make your decision.

1247
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:12,710
I don't think we have a choice.

1248
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,010
I can actually smell
the Cheongyang chili.

1249
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,840
(Groaning)

1250
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,010
I can actually smell
the Cheongyang chili.

1251
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,050
(Groaning)

1252
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,510
The guest today...

1253
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,710
No one's suspecting him.

1254
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:22,780
No one...

1255
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,730
- is suspecting him.
- But Jae Seok...

1256
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,130
He usually does this
after eating spicy food,

1257
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,320
but I didn't see that today.

1258
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,570
It's time to make a decision.

1259
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,300
I don't think we have a choice.

1260
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,210
- She's the guest.
- They'd get her involved.

1261
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,530
- The guest?
- Please make a decision.

1262
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,530
I bet they let Chung Hwa
take center stage.

1263
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,170
If you eat something spicy,

1264
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,300
you can't keep your mouth closed
like Seok Jin.

1265
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,550
- One...
- You'd want to open your mouth.

1266
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,150
- Two...
- He suddenly opened his.

1267
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,750
- That's right.
- We choose Chung Hwa.

1268
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,420
What do you say?

1269
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,480
Look at Jae Seok
trying to stay in character.

1270
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,360
- It's not him.
- I think it's Jae Seok.

1271
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,280
I think it could be him too.
Should we say it's him instead?

1272
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,090
I can smell...

1273
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,860
the Cheongyang chili from here...

1274
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,260
and it's whenever
he lets out his breath.

1275
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,690
Two...
Please make your final decision.

1276
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,030
In 1, 2, 3.

1277
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,860
- No, it's...
- Shall we just pick the guest?

1278
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,590
Please choose one. In 1, 2, 3.

1279
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,570
- Cha Chung Hwa.
- Cha Chung Hwa.

1280
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,880
They picked Chung Hwa.

1281
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,110
The one who had
the real spicy chili...

1282
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,400
will get up on the count of three.

1283
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:19,980
- In 1, 2...
- I don't think it's her.

1284
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:21,420
- No, it's not him.
- It's not him.

1285
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,980
Three!

1286
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:26,650
Three!

1287
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,150
- It was Jae Seok.
- For real?

1288
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,860
(It was Jae Seok.)

1289
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,090
(Grunting)

1290
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,150
I knew it.

1291
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,230
- For real?
- Chung Hwa is such a good actress.

1292
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:39,500
Well done!

1293
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,570
It was really spicy, right?

1294
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:41,840
- Good work.
- Good one!

1295
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,110
- It was really spicy.
- Good one!

1296
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,130
My goodness.

1297
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:46,340
Eat the whole thing.

1298
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,530
Let's see.

1299
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:48,570
It's...

1300
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,300
(Grunting)

1301
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,980
- It's really spicy.
- He's already reacting to it.

1302
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,050
- It's really spicy.
- It must be spicy.

1303
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:55,250
Ours is spicy too.

1304
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,940
We're in trouble. I got hiccups.

1305
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:58,650
I thought Jae Seok was acting.

1306
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:00,010
(He had to drink water
to ease the spiciness.)

1307
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,230
He actually drank water
because it was too spicy.

1308
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,230
I can still smell
the Cheongyang chili.

1309
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:07,320
All right. The acting Team Jong Kook
is going to carry out...

1310
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,320
Us?

1311
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,820
One of you will do
an elephant trunk spin...

1312
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,860
and get out right away.

1313
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,960
- How can they act that out?
- The one who did the spin?

1314
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,960
- Yes.
- All right.

1315
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,360
- Let's all leave the same way.
- When we leave...

1316
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,400
- Or we could...
- We can all go like this.

1317
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:19,880
We could all walk the same way.

1318
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,570
Someone must've hidden their eggs
inside the house.

1319
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:23,610
- What?
- In the bag?

1320
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,780
I bet. Someone must've hidden
their eggs in the house.

1321
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,170
- Definitely.
- They must've hidden them inside.

1322
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,820
(The hyenas look for eggs
while Jong Kook is away.)

1323
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,090
I really can't find
a single egg they hid.

1324
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,510
They must be spinning inside.

1325
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:35,730
They're so loud.

1326
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:37,320
You should watch them.

1327
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,550
They'll jump out of the room
as soon as they're done.

1328
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:40,730
- All right.
- Oh, they'll jump out right away?

1329
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:41,960
(Their first reaction
will be the biggest hint.)

1330
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,920
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1331
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,940
I was going to sit here,
but Seok Jin...

1332
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,110
was afraid his seat would be taken.

1333
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,860
The seat where he can
lean his back against the wall.

1334
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,400
So he pushed me
to go in front of me.

1335
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,480
(A petty man's race)

1336
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,900
You noticed that?

1337
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,710
- He pushed me like this.
- Everyone.

1338
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,170
They're coming out.

1339
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:00,570
(It's time for the elephants
to come out.)

1340
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:02,880
- They're so loud.
- You need to check their eyes.

1341
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:04,590
- He's not it.
- He's making it obvious.

1342
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,110
- You need to check their eyes.
- They're so loud.

1343
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:07,650
- He's not it.
- He's definitely not it.

1344
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,420
- Hey.
- You fail, Jong Kook.

1345
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:10,880
Jong Kook is...

1346
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,150
Watch them.

1347
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,090
- You fail, Jong Kook.
- It's not him either.

1348
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,570
What's with him?

1349
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,900
(The elephants
can't control their bodies.)

1350
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,300
(The 2021 elephant show)

1351
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,400
It's not him.

1352
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,880
- It could be Se Chan.
- Hey.

1353
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,210
No, it's not him. Hey.

1354
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,440
- Gosh, I'm so dizzy.
- It's not him.

1355
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,110
Could it be Se Chan?

1356
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,880
He's going overboard on purpose.

1357
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,110
- She's not it.
- It could be Se Chan.

1358
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:39,320
- No, it's not him.
- Look at him.

1359
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,710
- Could it be Se Chan?
- It could be Se Chan.

1360
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:43,280
He's going overboard on purpose.

1361
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,880
- It's either Do Kwon or Se Chan.
- It's definitely not Young Ji.

1362
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,150
- It's not Young Ji.
- It's not Young Ji.

1363
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:48,360
I think it's Ji Hyo.

1364
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,530
- No, she's acting.
- Hey.

1365
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:50,590
Is she acting?

1366
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:52,070
I think it's Jong Kook.

1367
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,230
I think so too.

1368
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,900
- Because he's acting so well.
- He's gasping for air.

1369
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,130
It's Do Kwon
whose acting was most desperate.

1370
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,530
- He's amazing.
- Ji Hyo is doing so well too.

1371
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:02,070
(One of them is acting
like they're dizzy.)

1372
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,170
It doesn't look like
Ji Hyo's stomach hurts.

1373
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,300
But she's...

1374
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,710
It looks like
she wants to take a dump.

1375
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,340
(He thinks she has problems
with her digestion.)

1376
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,380
- I think it's Jong Kook.
- Me too.

1377
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,920
- No way.
- But Young Ji's soles are dirty.

1378
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,260
Is that so?

1379
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,380
Look at them.

1380
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,590
- Young Ji.
- But last time she was here,

1381
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,900
- they were dirty too.
- Are they always dirty?

1382
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:22,460
(They think Young Ji's soles
are always dirty.)

1383
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,670
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1384
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,400
- It's a routine.
- I had only one pair, so...

1385
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,190
- You had only one pair?
- It's a routine.

1386
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:29,860
- A routine of a public show.
- Right. It's the routine.

1387
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,300
But Young Ji's soles...

1388
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:33,440
Her soles are dirty.

1389
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,940
They really are dirty.

1390
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,550
- What's wrong with them?
- Look at them.

1391
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,050
Do Kwon, you must be feeling okay.

1392
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,440
No, mine are black.

1393
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
Are you feeling okay now?

1394
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,570
- All right!
- Yes.

1395
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:44,190
I think it's Se Chan
because he's pale.

1396
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:45,960
- He's pale.
- I've always been pale.

1397
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,460
You've always been pale?
You're making excuses.

1398
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,510
Hold on.

1399
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,690
Can they come this close to us?

1400
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:52,530
- They can't sound us out like this.
- Can I approach him?

1401
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:53,760
- It's too close.
- Look at him moving away.

1402
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,960
He can't come this close.

1403
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,920
- You can't touch us.
- Right. This isn't allowed.

1404
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,940
Look at him. He's being defensive
and coming up with excuses.

1405
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,170
No, I think it's Jong Kook.

1406
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,630
- His hair is messy.
- Right?

1407
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,760
I think it's
either Se Chan or Jong Kook.

1408
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,210
I also think
it's either Se Chan or Jong Kook.

1409
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:07,480
- I think it's Se Chan.
- Have you made up your mind?

1410
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,480
Yes. The lines around his mouth
look deeper than earlier.

1411
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,980
- And he's pale too.
- He's aged a lot.

1412
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,670
The color of your face
is different from your neck's.

1413
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:14,710
Look at him.

1414
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,090
His mouth is protruding more.

1415
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:17,480
Then let's choose Se Chan.

1416
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,480
- All right.
- Okay, let's pick Se Chan.

1417
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,960
In 1, 2, 3.

1418
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,150
- Yang Se Chan!
- Yang Se Chan!

1419
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:25,230
Tell everyone who did the spin
on the count of three.

1420
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:26,960
Based on the soles,
it must be Young Ji.

1421
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,260
Please get up on the count of three.

1422
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,630
- One,
- It must be him.

1423
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:30,800
two,

1424
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,070
three!

1425
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,570
Is it Do Kwon?

1426
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:36,670
Who is it?

1427
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:37,670
Is it you?

1428
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:39,940
(It's Do Kwon?)

1429
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,170
(It was Do Kwon
whom they didn't doubt.)

1430
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:43,170
It didn't even occur to me
that it'd be Do Kwon.

1431
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,710
We never even mentioned him.

1432
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:48,280
(Actually, Do Kwon,
who easily made it out...)

1433
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,550
Rock-paper-scissors, go.

1434
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,420
(He lost, so he had
to do the elephant trunk spin.)

1435
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,860
- Ten!
- Let's go!

1436
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:55,960
Gosh, I'm so dizzy.

1437
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,380
Just go ahead.

1438
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,500
(He leaned on the wall
and tripped the others.)

1439
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,050
(He made it obvious
that he was dizzy.)

1440
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,530
He looked just fine.

1441
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:05,500
- He acted for real.
- He looked like...

1442
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,690
I couldn't let go
because I was afraid I'd fall.

1443
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:09,530
- He was trying to grab onto it.
- I had to.

1444
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,300
(It's all thanks to him.)

1445
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,070
- I thought he was going overboard.
- That was hilarious.

1446
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:15,650
I was really dizzy.

1447
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,110
This is hard.

1448
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,440
- It's hard.
- It's Team Jae Seok's mission.

1449
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,510
What is it?

1450
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:22,440
One of you has to put on the
low-frequency therapeutic apparatus.

1451
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,510
(One of their low-frequency
therapeutic apparatus will be on.)

1452
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:24,940
We can definitely catch one.

1453
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,590
I should've done that, right?

1454
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:28,460
- This is difficult.
- It's funny though.

1455
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,280
- There are apparatuses.
- You all should pretend.

1456
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,280
- Hold on.
- Wait.

1457
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,690
- Where should we wear them?
- All of us should wear it?

1458
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,260
- Yes, and you need to act.
- Oh, I need to act?

1459
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,320
Okay, got it.

1460
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,130
We need to decide now.

1461
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:38,400
I'll do it since you were the chili.

1462
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,670
I mean, you ate the chili.

1463
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:40,760
You scared me.

1464
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,860
(I'll do it
since you were the chili.)

1465
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,610
(Startled)

1466
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:45,940
Since he is the chili?

1467
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,130
(What a coincidental mistake.)

1468
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:49,710
You startled me, Chung Hwa.

1469
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:51,480
What do you mean
by "since you were the chili?"

1470
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,070
Come on, Chung Hwa.

1471
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,780
- You scared everyone.
- I'm sorry.

1472
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:55,840
I'm sorry.

1473
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,380
(After her shocking
slip of the tongue...)

1474
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:00,610
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1475
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:01,710
Rock-paper-scissors.

1476
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,960
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

1477
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,650
It's fun to fool others.

1478
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,000
Let's do it.

1479
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
(It's time to find out
who has it on.)

1480
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,260
(The low-frequency
therapeutic apparatus lovers enter.)

1481
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,030
This is so funny.

1482
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:14,260
It's not Haha for sure.

1483
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,670
This is hilarious.

1484
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,630
Chung Hwa is amazing.

1485
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,610
- Chung Hwa is amazing.
- Seok Jin is good.

1486
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:25,280
What is this?

1487
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:26,780
She's good.

1488
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,050
Is this a joke? Oh, no!

1489
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,380
- It's Chung Hwa.
- It's Chung Hwa.

1490
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,460
It must be Chung Hwa.

1491
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,230
(He's certain that it's Chung Hwa.)

1492
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:41,920
Look at her hands.
That can't be fake.

1493
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,530
Gosh, this is...

1494
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:44,530
- What's wrong with this?
- This is...

1495
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:45,900
It's Chung Hwa.

1496
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,030
- This is driving me crazy.
- If it's her, she's really good.

1497
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:48,260
- I can't...
- This is...

1498
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,460
- I can't act.
- This is...

1499
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,440
Look at this!

1500
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:53,300
Look at this!

1501
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,380
No, that's fake.

1502
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,880
- I'm sure it's not Chung Hwa.
- It's not Chung Hwa.

1503
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,250
- Gosh, what do I do?
- It's not Chung Hwa.

1504
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:00,650
She's getting the shocks too late.

1505
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,280
She's not even stretching
her hands out.

1506
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:03,650
It's So Min.

1507
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,480
So Min has been getting
regular shocks.

1508
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,150
It's So Min.

1509
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,820
This is no joke.

1510
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,730
Please sit down now.

1511
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,420
I can't sit, you jerk!

1512
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,420
- Please sit down.
- I can't!

1513
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,690
- Sit down.
- Seok Jin.

1514
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,960
- Can you not cuss?
- I couldn't help it.

1515
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,190
It wasn't even the right timing
to cuss.

1516
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:21,760
- I couldn't help it!
- Why would you cuss?

1517
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,840
I couldn't help but cuss.

1518
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,880
- Please keep going.
- Why would you cuss?

1519
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,400
- Keep going.
- Chung Hwa.

1520
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,630
Chung Hwa.

1521
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,170
We have one more minute.

1522
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,840
Let's see each of you
stretching your arms out...

1523
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,880
and doing this gesture. In 1, 2, 3.

1524
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,460
- No, we won't.
- We can't do it.

1525
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,050
I can't.

1526
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,650
All right.

1527
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:44,190
So Min, try it. In 1, 2, 3.

1528
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,090
Gosh, this is so funny.

1529
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:47,960
- Gosh.
- Chung Hwa.

1530
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,670
In 1, 2, 3.

1531
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,190
In 1, 2, 3.

1532
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:52,460
I can't do it!

1533
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:54,030
- In 1, 2, 3.
- It hurts, you know?

1534
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:55,940
- I got it. I can do it now.
- It hurts.

1535
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,260
It hurts.

1536
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,630
I can't do this.

1537
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:01,610
- Seven, eight.
- Seok Jin, show us.

1538
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,110
You see? She's on beat.

1539
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,940
- You're right.
- She is.

1540
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,210
She's on beat.

1541
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:08,210
Chung Hwa is on beat.

1542
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,710
She reacts every eight seconds.

1543
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,250
(Do Kwon thinks Chung Hwa trembles
every eight seconds.)

1544
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,980
Jong Kook!
I'm certain it's Chung Hwa.

1545
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,320
- It's Chung Hwa for sure.
- It's her for sure.

1546
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,880
(Exclaiming)

1547
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,360
Jong Kook!
I'm certain it's Chung Hwa.

1548
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,550
(Staring)

1549
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:22,730
- Ji Hyo, Chung Hwa is...
- I think it's Jae Seok.

1550
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,630
- I think it's Jae Seok.
- We'll give you ten seconds.

1551
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:25,860
I think it's Jae Seok.

1552
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:28,230
Hey, it's Jae Seok.

1553
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:29,860
- No, it's Chung Hwa.
- No, it's not.

1554
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,960
- It's not Jae Seok.
- It's Chung Hwa.

1555
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,960
She's laughing.

1556
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,340
It's because...

1557
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:37,050
Her muscles aren't responding.

1558
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:38,650
No, it's not him.

1559
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,420
Since you can see them in action,
please pick one right away.

1560
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,750
(The four candidates who are
giving their best performances)

1561
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:43,440
In 1, 2...

1562
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,760
- In 1, 2, 3.
- His muscles are budging a lot.

1563
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,860
- It's Chung Hwa!
- It's Chung Hwa!

1564
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:47,860
(Team Jong Kook picks Chung Hwa.)

1565
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,280
Please get up.

1566
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,280
In 1, 2, 3.

1567
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,590
Stop it!

1568
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:55,360
It's Chung Hwa.

1569
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,730
- Hey!
- It's not her.

1570
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:58,030
(It's Yu Jae Seok.)

1571
00:52:58,030 --> 00:52:59,630
- It was Jae Seok.
- It was Jae Seok.

1572
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,130
I told you I saw it.

1573
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,210
I saw him right next to him.

1574
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,840
He kept twitching.

1575
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,480
- Goodness.
- Look,

1576
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,050
- his muscles kept twitching.
- So you can see it.

1577
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:11,380
I can see it now.

1578
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:12,840
Wait, that hurts.

1579
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,070
It hurts, right?

1580
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,420
I told you.

1581
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,460
(His whole body twitched
and made it obvious.)

1582
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,610
It really hurts, right?

1583
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:24,690
(His whole body twitched
and made it obvious.)

1584
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,800
- It wasn't me.
- His muscles kept twitching.

1585
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,420
Chung Hwa is really good.

1586
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:32,230
- You know...
- Wait, Chung Hwa.

1587
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,170
How come you're so good at acting?

1588
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,940
How could you bend your arms
like this?

1589
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,800
It was too intense.

1590
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:40,110
Chung Hwa is really good at acting.

1591
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:41,730
- I really thought she was the one.
- She was incredible.

1592
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:43,800
- Chung Hwa went like this.
- Isn't she incredible?

1593
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,880
- She's a great actress.
- She even counted the beats.

1594
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,940
Exactly. She did.

1595
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:49,420
This is what Team Jong Kook
will do next.

1596
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:50,880
- That was close.
- Let's get them.

1597
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,980
It's the last mission.

1598
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:54,590
- That sounds difficult.
- You need to find the person...

1599
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:55,860
who has real ice in their stomach.

1600
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,190
One of you will be holding
an ice pack,

1601
00:53:58,190 --> 00:53:59,820
and the rest will be holding
a pack of a similar size.

1602
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,860
- Let's go.
- So there's water in it instead.

1603
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,900
Where should we put them?
In our stomach?

1604
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,500
Maybe they'll pick the same person
as they did before.

1605
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:07,860
Young Ji might roll on the floor.

1606
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,860
And Se Chan might act the same.

1607
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,400
Se Chan always came out first.

1608
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,460
I know. He always did.

1609
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,940
It's because he likes to act up.

1610
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,230
That's true.

1611
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:16,940
(Vocalizing)

1612
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,510
You see?

1613
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:19,980
As soon as I was done saying that.

1614
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:22,920
- He likes getting attention.
- It's hilarious.

1615
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,690
(Se Chan is ready to act up
as much as he wants.)

1616
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:34,730
(Who is holding the real ice pack?)

1617
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:35,730
Oh, gosh!

1618
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,730
Oh, gosh!

1619
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,630
(Screaming)

1620
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:48,670
What did he say?

1621
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,800
If it's that bad,
you must go to the bathroom.

1622
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,320
(Se Chan's amazing acting
of needing to relieve himself)

1623
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,510
Gosh, Se Chan.

1624
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,050
- Se Chan has never been it, right?
- Gosh, he's so funny.

1625
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:00,480
(Perhaps Se Chan has
the ice pack for real?)

1626
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,860
(One of them is holding
a cold ice pack.)

1627
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,650
Is it an ice block?

1628
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:08,090
Or are they ice cubes?

1629
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,800
It's not dry ice, is it?

1630
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,960
Try drinking water, Se Chan.

1631
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,360
Se Chan, try drinking water. Gosh.

1632
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,800
(Scowling)

1633
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,840
- Se Chan.
- Try drinking water.

1634
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,980
Gosh, I hate the sight of him.

1635
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:25,570
Se Chan, can you try
pressing your stomach?

1636
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:27,340
- Sorry?
- Try pressing your stomach.

1637
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,320
- It's that bad?
- It's not him.

1638
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,280
- It's not him.
- It's not Se Chan.

1639
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:37,860
He's out. Please stop. You're out.

1640
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,820
Young Ji, can you try
pressing your stomach?

1641
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,730
- Try pressing it.
- Me?

1642
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,130
Press it harder. Is she the one?

1643
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:45,260
It's not Young Ji.

1644
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,130
I think she's pretending.

1645
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:49,300
(He finds her more suspicious.)

1646
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:52,210
- Goodness.
- Do Kwon, can you press yours?

1647
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,380
No.

1648
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,280
You're crouching.

1649
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:58,550
It must hurt.

1650
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:00,780
Look at Se Chan.

1651
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,820
(Screaming)

1652
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,090
I think I'll be really upset
if it's really him.

1653
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,860
It's not him.

1654
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,420
- It's not him.
- It can't be him.

1655
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,190
No, I think it's him.

1656
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:19,400
It must be him because the rest
are laughing at him.

1657
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,360
They wouldn't have laughed
if he was acting.

1658
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,130
They're laughing because they know
it's him.

1659
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,800
- They're laughing because he's it.
- It's not the shape...

1660
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,130
- of ice.
- It is Se Chan.

1661
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,510
- They're laughing because it's him.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1662
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,050
- Yang Se Chan.
- Yang Se Chan. It's you, right?

1663
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:32,210
(They decide it's Se Chan
after seeing the rest laugh at him.)

1664
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:34,280
- It's him. I'm sure it is.
- They're laughing because it's him.

1665
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,920
Because it's him.

1666
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,110
- It is him.
- On the count of three,

1667
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:40,380
- please get up.
- Hurry!

1668
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,630
- In 1, 2...
- Is it really him?

1669
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:43,760
Three!

1670
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,860
(Who is carrying the ice pack?)

1671
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,510
- He's acting.
- It must be him.

1672
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:54,930
- Is it Jong Kook?
- It's Jong Kook.

1673
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:56,140
It's Jong Kook.

1674
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,370
It was Young Ji.

1675
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:03,050
(Young Ji was carrying
the ice pack.)

1676
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:07,950
Gosh, it's so upsetting.

1677
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:09,820
It's so annoying.

1678
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,280
This is really upsetting.

1679
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,820
- I told you.
- It was Young Ji.

1680
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,090
I told you.

1681
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,300
They might think it's your turn
to be it.

1682
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:22,030
- Comedians get penalties a lot.
- They do.

1683
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,260
Let me put it here.

1684
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,760
(Young Ji volunteered
to put it in her belly...)

1685
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,240
(instead of Se Chan
who was more at risk.)

1686
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,800
Goodness.

1687
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,800
- Se Chan, you're so annoying.
- Ji Hyo must've planned this.

1688
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,550
(Se Chan's acting caused
critical damage to Team Jae Seok.)

1689
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:33,550
Oh, gosh.

1690
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,820
He's so annoying
although we're on the same team.

1691
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,510
I know. He's so annoying.

1692
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:38,550
Darn him.

1693
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:39,680
I want to hit his mouth.

1694
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,890
We'll give two eggs
for Team Jong Kook as they won.

1695
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:45,680
- They're for the whole team?
- They're raw eggs.

1696
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,800
- They get only two?
- That's too little.

1697
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,620
- They're for our team.
- Our names are on it too.

1698
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,990
It's time for lunch and to cook.

1699
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:54,070
- What are we making?
- Among three party dishes,

1700
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,570
the first one you'll make...

1701
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,490
is a hamburg steak.

1702
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:58,570
- It sounds delicious.
- I like it.

1703
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:00,970
We have
all the basic ingredients ready.

1704
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:03,930
You only need to take simple steps.

1705
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:05,800
You need five eggs for this dish.

1706
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,970
(They need to use 5 eggs.)

1707
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:10,470
(Today's party dishes)

1708
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:13,890
(The first dish, hamburg steak)

1709
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:15,780
We only need three more.

1710
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,660
You can use your own or others'.

1711
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,450
- You can use other team's eggs.
- We need five eggs?

1712
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:21,550
Do whatever it takes
to find five eggs.

1713
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:24,570
We can each contribute an egg each.

1714
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,930
(But it's advantageous for them
if they don't use their own eggs.)

1715
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,930
Since we need to use 5,
let's contribute 1 each.

1716
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:30,030
- Let's contribute one each.
- We should bring one.

1717
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:31,510
Whether you use your own
or others' eggs.

1718
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,610
- Let's each bring one.
- Okay, let's do that.

1719
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,570
We should look for their eggs
instead of using ours.

1720
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:36,640
Then I'll look for one too.

1721
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,780
- I'll go look for eggs.
- We're not using ours, right?

1722
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,680
We can find three at least.

1723
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,070
We can find the other team's eggs.

1724
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:45,180
- We can look for them now, right?
- Yes.

1725
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,180
(It's time to cook
their first dish.)

1726
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:48,410
I need to find our team's eggs too.

1727
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:53,180
(He hurriedly looks for eggs
here and there.)

1728
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,550
(Impressed)

1729
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,700
Gosh, this is...

1730
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,760
(Se Chan easily found
Young Ji's eggs in the cupboard.)

1731
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,970
I found Young Ji's eggs.

1732
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,970
(Se Chan easily found
Young Ji's eggs in the cupboard.)

1733
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:04,700
Whom should I vote for?

1734
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:05,930
(Se Chan is holding
Young Ji's eggs.)

1735
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:08,470
I'll get two ballots then.

1736
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:10,430
(He exchanges them
with ballots right away.)

1737
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:13,370
Yes. I'm sorry, Young Ji.
I had no other choice.

1738
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,180
(Se Chan earned two ballots
by betraying Young Ji.)

1739
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,280
(Exclaiming)

1740
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,260
(He found two more eggs
of Young Ji's.)

1741
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,720
I'll exchange it with one ballot.

1742
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,890
You found them again?

1743
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:31,200
Young Ji is in trouble.

1744
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,490
- You're exchanging just one?
- I'll give it back to Young Ji.

1745
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:38,070
(Se Chan acquired 3 ballots.)

1746
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:42,370
Mine must be here.
I should check it.

1747
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,370
(Surprised)

1748
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:50,050
They took... They took this?

1749
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,090
Right? There were two.

1750
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,450
Thank you.
Two of my eggs were stolen.

1751
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:58,320
I put two eggs there,
but they're gone.

1752
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,550
(The 168cm tall thief
who stole So Min's eggs)

1753
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:01,890
(It's Haha.)

1754
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,470
(He sneaked into the kitchen
while others are outside.)

1755
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:09,340
(He used So Min's egg
he was holding.)

1756
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,160
(He used one of her eggs
as a ballot...)

1757
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,970
(and one as an ingredient.)

1758
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:18,070
(And soon...)

1759
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:20,370
Jae Seok, the recipe...

1760
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:22,450
Whose egg is that? I got one too.

1761
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,870
I got two eggs.

1762
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:24,910
Put them in here.

1763
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:26,240
Mine was stolen.

1764
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,320
The process doesn't look good,
but it'll be fine...

1765
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,360
as long as it tastes good.

1766
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,510
- You were already working on it?
- Chung Hwa.

1767
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:31,530
- We need an egg.
- Did you bring an egg?

1768
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:33,090
It took long
because I had to find mine.

1769
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:34,390
- Crack it in here.
- Give it to them.

1770
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:35,700
You got five eggs.

1771
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,360
- We got it?
- I have no more eggs.

1772
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,590
We got five already.
We should hurry up and make it.

1773
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:41,300
- We should all work on it.
- Hurry.

1774
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,970
- Work on that first.
- What is it?

1775
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,030
- Heat up the pan already.
- What's with our team?

1776
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:46,470
- Okay.
- Let's hurry.

1777
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:48,340
- We need to hurry.
- Hurry up and make it!

1778
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:50,680
- We need to heat up the pan.
- The eggs...

1779
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,070
(How is Team Jong Kook doing?)

1780
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:53,870
Gosh, they took mine.

1781
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,140
They took mine.

1782
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:57,180
(Team Jong Kook
is still collecting eggs.)

1783
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:05,050
Gosh, both of my eggs are gone.

1784
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:11,760
What do I do?
I think all of mine are taken.

1785
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:14,370
(Meanwhile, what is Do Kwon up to?)

1786
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:22,870
(He found Chung Hwa's egg...)

1787
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:26,140
(by the stone wall.)

1788
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,300
Let me exchange this with a ballot.

1789
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:30,280
I need an insurance for myself.

1790
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,390
(Do Kwon exchanges the egg he found
with a ballot.)

1791
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:35,320
(Just as Jong Kook worried,
Do Kwon gets more greedy.)

1792
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:36,510
I didn't find one.

1793
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:38,860
The more the ballots,

1794
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,550
the better, right?

1795
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:42,950
Here. I want to exchange it
with a ballot.

1796
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:44,550
(He exchanges the egg he found
with a ballot again.)

1797
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:46,120
- Guys, look at this.
- It looks good.

1798
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,430
- It looks so good.
- It's looking good.

1799
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:49,490
It really feels like a holiday party.

1800
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,240
Look at that.

1801
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:52,700
We're done.

1802
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,200
- We got it.
- They haven't even started.

1803
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:58,140
- Here it is.
- We finished one dish.

1804
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:59,450
- We're done.
- We won, right?

1805
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,280
- We should start cooking.
- I guess I really can't find one.

1806
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,240
How did they hide them so well?

1807
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:07,620
(It's time for the second mission.)

1808
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,450
If we didn't have kimchi
It's this song.

1809
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:12,820
(Team Jong Kook is in good spirit
although they were late.)

1810
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,550
- What was it again?
- Delicious ramyeon

1811
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:16,990
Jae Seok, they have
such great teamwork.

1812
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:19,760
Hey, what's the point
of having good teamwork?

1813
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,430
They'll part ways
after today anyway.

1814
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:23,800
(They're now used to
the instant family love.)

1815
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,870
What's the point?

1816
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:27,410
He said they'll part ways
after the shoot.

1817
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:29,610
The three of them
are on "How Do You Play?"

1818
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:31,780
- I know, this team...
- That was a bit rude of you.

1819
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:33,680
- What do you mean?
- He's right!

1820
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,680
- What was that about?
- I'm not on that show!

1821
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,180
- What do you mean?
- I was on the show temporarily.

1822
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:40,240
You were smiling from ear to ear
after getting an award.

1823
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,410
It doesn't mean the three of us
only work for "How Do You Play?"

1824
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:46,990
It's a gganbu show.
It's a sister show of Running Man.

1825
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:49,430
If it is, then you should
let us be on it too.

1826
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:51,360
I'm planning it.

1827
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,390
- Nice.
- I told them what I wanted.

1828
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:55,430
- You should arrange it.
- I already told Bo Pil too.

1829
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:57,430
- Will you wait?
- That's what I'm saying.

1830
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:59,760
You're also thinking
about it too, right? This is nice.

1831
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,430
- Will it air...
- It will be innovative.

1832
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:02,510
- on both channels?
- That will be nice.

1833
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:03,700
Will we gather around...

1834
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:05,180
and film for a day?

1835
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,610
- No.
- Will it be like that?

1836
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:08,180
We are still talking.

1837
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,280
It will be like a joint shoot.

1838
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,370
We need to figure it out.

1839
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:11,550
You should arrange it...

1840
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:12,640
in the middle.

1841
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,890
I will take care of it.

1842
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,180
Hurry up and do it.

1843
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:16,220
- Okay.
- Do a good job.

1844
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:18,450
Anyang Loser should be on that show.

1845
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:20,820
Can we be mean to the other members?

1846
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,450
If it happens, you will be the host.

1847
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:24,700
I will be so stressed out.

1848
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,800
- Which side are you on?
- Now that the plan is underway...

1849
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,340
You should dress up as a bat.

1850
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,740
Come on.
I am a member of Running Man.

1851
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,470
Then Haha will be paid twice, right?

1852
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:34,370
- Will he be paid twice?
- Right?

1853
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:36,110
Don't say it like that.

1854
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,300
It's the same for us.

1855
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,740
If we appear on that show,
we need to receive payment.

1856
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:41,780
Of course.

1857
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:42,870
I will talk to them about it.

1858
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:44,010
To whom will you talk?

1859
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,010
I will talk to them about it.

1860
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:46,010
To whom will you talk?

1861
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:47,180
Why would you volunteer yourself?

1862
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:49,450
- To whom will you talk?
- I will talk to them.

1863
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,780
I will talk to Hye Jeong,
the scriptwriter of the show.

1864
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,450
He thinks of her as his mom.

1865
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:54,680
(He thinks of her as his mom.)

1866
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,720
Mom.

1867
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:58,590
- He thinks of her as his mom.
- Seriously.

1868
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:00,120
So "How Do You Play?"
is like your mom...

1869
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,470
and Running Man is like your dad.

1870
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,570
While searching for the eggs,

1871
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:05,530
various emotions must have piled up.

1872
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:06,610
- Yes.
- Of course.

1873
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:07,760
Now,

1874
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,910
please write down
five simple punishments...

1875
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:12,870
you want the other team to receive
on a piece of paper...

1876
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:14,410
and turn it in.

1877
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:16,180
- Simple punishments?
- Simple punishments.

1878
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,050
They shouldn't be too big.

1879
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:21,240
- They shouldn't be too much work.
- Do we discuss this as a team?

1880
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,410
- Do we write them down separately?
- Write them down separately.

1881
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:23,490
Separately?

1882
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,620
Just make sure they don't overlap.

1883
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,760
- I want to see gourd-breaking.
- Gourd-breaking? Okay.

1884
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,800
- Okay.
- I have never seen it.

1885
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,300
- Gourd-breaking.
- Gourd-breaking?

1886
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,760
- Did you write them down?
- Yes.

1887
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:34,620
Take turns to reveal the penalty.

1888
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,490
My penalty is getting slapped
with a wet wipe.

1889
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:38,300
- It's a fun penalty.
- It's fun.

1890
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,430
My penalty is the eagle.

1891
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,180
- What's that?
- Se Chan will explain.

1892
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:43,780
It's pulling the philtrum.

1893
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,780
- That's a good one.
- It's fun.

1894
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:48,220
- It's fun.

01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:49,280

01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,510
Getting hit on the sole.

1897
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:51,950
- That's a good one.
- Getting hit on the sole.

1898
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:53,820
- What should be used?
- A cane.

1899
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:56,510
Young Ji.

1900
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:58,620
Drawing rosy cheeks on the face.

1901
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,180
That's a cute one.

1902
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:01,620
- Isn't it too cute?
- Okay.

1903
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,760
Mine is pulling the sideburns.

1904
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:06,590
- Mine is drawing on the face.
- Drawing on the face.

1905
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:08,930
- Getting slapped with a wet towel.
- A wet towel.

1906
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:09,990
It will hurt.

1907
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:12,610
Getting slapped with water.

1908
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:13,930
That's a good one.

1909
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:15,610
That's a neat and nice penalty.

1910
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:17,470
- So Min.
- Eating your raw eggs.

1911
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,010
- Raw eggs?
- It's the worst.

1912
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:20,450
- It's the worst.
- Raw eggs.

1913
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:21,870
- It's the worst.
- That's annoying.

1914
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:23,450
- Mine is gourd-breaking.
- It's a fun penalty.

1915
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:25,140
- Gourd-breaking.
- I really wanted to try it.

1916
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:26,450
Let's win.
We will be fine if we win.

1917
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,450
- I will give you the rules.
- Okay.

1918
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:30,950
Running Man is well-known
for its penalties.

1919
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:33,160
To celebrate the year-end,
the second mission...

1920
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,260
will cover a variety of penalties.

1921
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:38,260
It's the Penalty Party,
Good Penalty.

1922
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:40,030
- Okay.
- Good penalty

1923
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:42,470
You will use the beats
of the strawberry game.

1924
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,010
The penalty you pick...

1925
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,740
will be your name.

1926
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,140
(The penalty you pick
will be your name!)

1927
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,010
So we need to say,
"Drawings on the face."

1928
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:51,530
Eating your raw eggs.

1929
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,680
So this will be our name.

1930
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,280
It will go like that.

1931
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,010
(Good Penalty Rules)

1932
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:58,280
(1. The penalty you choose
becomes your name.)

1933
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:02,820
(2. Use the name to play
the Strawberry Game.)

1934
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:08,490
(3. After the round, the losing team
will carry out the penalty.)

1935
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:10,860
Chung Hwa, please pick a penalty.

1936
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:11,970
Okay.

1937
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:13,660
(Everyone picks a penalty.)

1938
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:14,800
- What is it?
- Show us.

1939
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:17,030
Getting rosy cheeks drawn
on the face.

1940
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:18,870
It's the one I wrote.

1941
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:22,140
You can't even say that
to attack her.

1942
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,570
We will let you shorten it
to "Getting rosy cheeks drawn."

1943
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,010
- Getting rosy cheeks drawn.
- Getting rosy cheeks drawn.

1944
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:28,510

01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:29,680
It's so hard.

1946
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,120
- I got "Eagle."
- It's a good one.

1947
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,590
- Eagle.
- Okay.

1948
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:34,910
Let's attack her only.

1949
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:38,260
Getting caned on the sole.

1950
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,430
Getting hit by a wet tissue.

1951
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:41,390
It's an easy one.

1961
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,050

1962
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,510

is an easy one.

01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:07,320
Let's do well.

1967
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:09,050
- Let's begin.

1968

Getting...

1971
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:19,890
What did you say?

1972
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:24,200
(He babbled
because he was too pressed.)

1973
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,370
- What did you say?
- What did you say?

1974
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:26,530
Getting what?

1975
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:28,930
- What did you say?
- What did you say?

1976
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:31,240
How am I supposed to say it
eight times?

1977
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:33,510
- Getting.
- I should have started right away.

1978
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:34,610
Good

(Rosy)

1988
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,990
Why did you just repeat "Rosy?"

01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,340
Getting rosy cheeks drawn.

1990
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:00,570

1994
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,510
You failed.

1995
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,410
- Chung Hwa, start over.
- Should I start over?

1996
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:11,680
I don't remember
other people's names.

1997
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,590
- Drawings on the face.
- Drawings on the face. Okay.

1998
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:14,820

01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:15,910
(Telling her whom to attack)

2000
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,390
That's me, Seok Jin.

2001
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,990
What is wrong with you?

2002
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:21,490
(He asked her to attack
her teammate.)

2003
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:22,530
That's me.

2004
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:24,430
- He told me to attack "Eagle."
- That's me.

2005
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:26,220
- She is our teammate.
- You are "Eagle?"

2006
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:27,430
I thought it was his name.

2007
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:28,660
What's your name? Show me.

2008
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,700
Show me. Let's play fair and square.

2009
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:34,570
(He shows the back side.)

2010
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:35,670
What?

2011
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:36,740
- is that it?
- Yes.

2012
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:37,970
- I see.
- Okay.

2013
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:39,040
- Is that it?
- Okay.

2014
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,170
- I see.
- Let's go.

2015
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:41,580
One.

2016
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:45,040
- Good penalty.
- Good penalty.

2017
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,710
- Let's go.
- Gourd-breaking, three.

2018
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:51,180
- Hey.
- What was that?

2019
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,630
Gourd-breaking, three.

2020
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:54,250
(She ignored the rhythm.)

2021
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:56,050
Hold on. Excuse me.

2022
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:57,160
What was that?

2023
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,790
She hasn't partied much.

2024
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:00,460
- You should understand.
- Chung Hwa.

2025
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:02,390
We played the game multiple times.

2026
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:03,830
Gourd-breaking, three.

2027
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:04,930
I couldn't believe it.

2028
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:06,460
- We played the game multiple times.
- Gourd-breaking, three.

2029
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:07,800
- Go easy on her.
- It was just wrong.

2030
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,880
- She is out.
- I mean...

2031
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,080
- Hey.
- Seriously.

2032
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,210
Chung Hwa went through a lot.

2033
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:13,500
- Still...
- She doesn't go out much.

2034
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,340
- I am not used to playing games.
- She doesn't watch TV...

2035
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:16,840
- or drink.
- She isn't used to it.

2036
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:18,510
Everyone here is the same.

2037
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:20,920
I haven't partied much either.

2038
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,550
You have partied much.

2039
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:24,420
- Come on.
- That's not true.

2040
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,680
I just followed the older guys
to the nightclub a few times.

2041
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:31,500
(That's right!)

2042
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,630
I took him to places.

2043
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:34,030
I used to take him with me.

2044
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,260
You are right.

2045
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,830
That's so funny.

2046
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:38,910
A few times.

2047
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,970
I told you that
he used to book rooms.

2048
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:43,470
"Jae Seok."

2049
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:44,800
I did that.

2050
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:46,250
- "I did that."
- All right.

2051
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:47,640
Haha, you can start.

2052
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,640
- Good penalty
- Good penalty

2053
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,120
- Good penalty
- Let's go.

2054
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,540
- Good penalty
- Good penalty

2055
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:54,510
Eating your raw eggs, three.

2056
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,790
Raw... Raw eggs.

2057
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,920
What?

2058
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,530
- What do you want?
- Say it properly.

2059
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:02,960
- I did it.
- His pronunciation was off.

2060
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,590
- I did it.
- No, you didn't.

2061
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:06,170
I did it pretty well.

2062
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:07,830
- His pronunciation was off.
- I heard him clearly.

2063
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:08,930
I did it pretty well.

2064
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:10,700
Eating raw... What was that?

2065
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,740
I thought you were talking about
eating jjajangmyeon.

2066
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:14,800
It sounded completely different.

2067
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,040
I heard him clearly.

2068
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,800
- What?
- My ears hurt...

2069
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,280
because he enunciated so well.

2070
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,950
Jae Seok became his target. Okay.

2071
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,820
- Your pronunciation was off.
- Seriously.

2072
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:26,750
Okay. I got it.

2073
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,380
- Okay.
- I got it. Okay.

2074
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:29,660
Okay.

2075
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:33,490
He said "Okay."

2076
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:34,630
- Hold on.
- Let's go.

2077
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,200
You were the one
who mispronounced the words.

2078
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,460
Let's keep going.

2079
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,000
- Okay.
- Let's keep going.

2080
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,570
- Hold on.
- Good penalty

2081
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:44,870
- Good penalty.
- Good penalty.

2082
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:47,500
(The 1st punishment has begun.)

2083
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:50,380
- Good penalty.
- Good penalty.

2084
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:53,970
- Good penalty.
- Good penalty.

2085
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:55,640
Sideburns, six...
Getting the sideburns, seven.

2086
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,040
What was that?

2087
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:58,420
What was that?

2088
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:02,580
(He babbled.)

2089
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:03,960
- What was that?
- What was that?

2090
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,050
What was that?

2091
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,050
Mr. Raw Raw Eggs.

2092
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:08,630
Mr. Raw Raw Eggs?

2093
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:10,550
- You wrote this name.
- I became too excited.

2094
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:11,920
- What was that?
- I became too excited.

2095
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,090
- Seriously.
- I became too excited.

2096
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:14,420
You should have understood me earlier.

2097
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,700
How are you so bad at this game?

2098
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:17,960
"Raw raw eggs."

2099
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,000
- He got worked up.
- You wrote this.

2100
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,410
- Start over then.
- What is up with him?

2101
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:23,330
- You wrote this.
- Start over then. I got it.

2102
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:24,880
Let's begin. Good penalty

2103
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,470
- This is insane.
- Good penalty

2104
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:28,380
- Good penalty
- Don't let them win.

2105
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:31,920
- Good penalty
- Good penalty

2106
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,990
When will you stop?

2107
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:34,040
Getting the sideburns pulled, six.

2108
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,080
(Determined)

2109
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,920
Getting the sideburns pulled

2110
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,530
Getting the sideburns pulled

2111
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:43,220
(Melodious)

2112
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,920
(He said it with a nasal voice
without minding the rhythm.)

2113
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:47,390
His hands moved on their own.

2114
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:48,870
Seriously.

2115
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:50,130
How am I supposed to do this?

2116
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:53,110
- Getting the sideburns pulled
- It's a hard one.

2117
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:54,500
How am I supposed to do this?

2118
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,040
It's so hard.

2119
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,500
It isn't hard.

2120
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,840
- Let's not play this game.
- In this game,

2121
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,110
there is no such thing as a rally.

2122
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,670
We can take anyone out at once.

2123
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,840
Seok Jin, everyone is thinking that.

2124
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,340
That's why I'm just trying
to cheer you up here, you jerk.

2125
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,050
- For goodness' sake.
- Okay?

2126
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:10,050
He is getting hounded by both sides.

2127
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:12,180
If you win a point,
you will win Round One.

2128
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:13,330
Let's go.

2129
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,790
Let's shout it out.

2130
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:17,500
- Good
- Good

2131
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,200
- Good
- Good penalty

2132
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,700
- Good penalty
- Same

2133
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,390
- Good penalty
- Good penalty

2134
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,960
Only those
who have received a penalty know

2135
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,500
The taste of it

2136
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,170
- Jjan jjan jjan
- Jjan jjan jjan

2137
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:34,500
Since I have received
a lot of penalties

2138
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,470
I know the taste very well

2139
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:38,140
- Jjan jjan jjan
- Jjan jjan jjan

2140
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:40,180
I love penalties

2141
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:42,490
So much

2142
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:44,420
Me too

2143
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:47,530
I know what it's like

2144
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:50,460
I have received a lot of penalties

2145
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:52,890
If I don't receive a penalty

2146
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:55,790
I feel like something is missing

2147
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:57,390
Let's go

2148
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:58,960
Good penalty

2149
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,460
- Good penalty
- Good penalty

2150
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,540
Drawings on the face, four.

2151
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:06,300
- Drawings on the face.
- There you go.

2152
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,580
Getting caned on the sole, seven.

2153
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,320
- Getting caned on the sole.
- It's game over.

2154
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,880
It's game over.

2155
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,450
- It's game over.
- Nice.

2156
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:15,460
(Team Jong Kook won Round 1.)

2157
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:21,580
(Your days will be sunny again)

2158
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,030
His teeth look
especially annoying today.

2159
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,090
Seriously.

2160
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:26,570
- My goodness.
- Look at them.

2161
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:27,890
They look so annoying.

2162
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:31,930
Are you wearing dentures today?

2163
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:34,240
Why do your teeth look
so annoying today?

2164
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:36,800
I messed up the number of times.

2165
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,170
Why couldn't you do it right?

2166
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:39,280
All right.

2167
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,210
Focus like you are
on "How Do You Play?"

2168
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:44,120
Don't give "How Do You Play?"
a bad rap. You need to do better.

2169
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,640
- This is Running Man.
- You need to do better.

2170
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,660
- Seriously.
- You need to do well here as well.

2171
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,380
- You're not doing well here.
- "Gap," let's go.

2172
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:55,250
Team Jong Kook won Round One.

2173
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:57,330
- Okay.
- We lost points.

2174
01:13:57,330 --> 01:14:00,330
So Team Jae Seok
needs to carry out the penalties.

2175
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:02,240
Jae Seok, you will get
your sideburns pulled.

2176
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:04,000
- Okay.
- Why?

2177
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,260
You lost a point.

2178
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:06,610
(He lost a point
with a nasal voice.)

2179
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:08,170
So it applies to people
who lost points.

2180
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:11,280
Haha, you will get your sole caned.

2181
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:14,250
Chung Hwa, you will get
rosy cheeks drawn on your face.

2182
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:16,010
- What?
- Pull his sideburns.

2183
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:17,320
I'll do it since
I am sitting right next to him.

2184
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,380
What?

2185
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:19,790
I am sitting right next to you.

2186
01:14:19,790 --> 01:14:22,180
I don't want to do it,
but I am sitting right next to you.

2187
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:23,290
Take your time.

2188
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:25,460
I want to do it gently,

2189
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:27,360
but it won't be funny then.

2190
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,790
I will make sure the talk is funny.

2191
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,870
He is sensitive right now.

2192
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:35,220
- Come on.
- Are you negotiating?

2193
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,370
- Don't worry about it.
- Are you negotiating?

2194
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:37,790
- He will make up by talking.
- How will you make up?

2195
01:14:37,790 --> 01:14:39,330
- I can do it with ease.
- How?

2196
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:41,130
- Tell me how.
- What are your needs?

2197
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:42,610
I can meet your needs.

2198
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:43,800
- Really? Are you certain?
- Yes.

2199
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,750
How many times
will you make me laugh?

2200
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:47,640
I think 2 or 3 times will suffice.

2201
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,970
Of course not. Come here.

2202
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:50,120
For goodness' sake.

2203
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,450
- Rip off his sideburns.
- Two or three times isn't...

2204
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:52,750
- very impressive.
- Fine. Go ahead.

2205
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,380
(Ouch.)

2206
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:55,420
Don't grimace.

2207
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:58,120
If you grimace,
viewers will feel uncomfortable.

2208
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,750
I feel the most uncomfortable.

2209
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,550
I mean...

2210
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:03,130
- I feel the most uncomfortable.
- Smile.

2211
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:04,250
All right.

2212
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,170
- I will smile.
- Don't grimace.

2213
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:08,420
You will look pitiful
if you do that.

2214
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,570
What do you want me to do?

2215
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:10,740
- Just take them off.
- Okay.

2216
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:11,830
All right.

2217
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:13,800
He looks more pitiful
without the glasses.

2218
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,000
Just put them back on.

2219
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,910
- I will do this.
- Okay.

2220
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:19,140
For goodness' sake.

2221
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,750
There isn't much to grab.

2222
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:24,250
(Pinching)

2223
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:26,950
(The venomous snake's touch
really woke him up.)

2224
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:29,120
I used 1-4th of my strength.

2225
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,660
He didn't do anything wrong.

2226
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:32,250
Haha needs to get his sole caned.

2227
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,460
Since I am sitting close to him,
I will do it.

2228
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:36,790
I will do it.

2229
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:38,250
Come on, Jong Kook.

2230
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:40,630
- Yes?
- Why do you carry out penalties?

2231
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:42,000
- Seriously.
- Right now...

2232
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,170
Why do you carry out
all the penalties?

2233
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:44,760
Because I'm sitting close to him.

2234
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:47,130
I heard that it's healthy
to punch your sole.

2235
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:48,130
That's right.

2236
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:49,330
Put your feet up.

2237
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:51,080
Why do you carry out
all the penalties?

2238
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:52,800
- Se Chan, you should do it.
- Me?

2239
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,210
- Se Chan?
- He practiced caning.

2240
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:55,840
- He will hit harder.
- Why does it have to be Se Chan?

2241
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,140
- Come here.
- This is worse.

2242
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:58,750
- Oh, my goodness.
- This is how you do it.

2243
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:00,620
He has good wrist snap
since he plays badminton.

2244
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:01,880
I will hold his feet.

2245
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,320
- Oh, my goodness.
- This is how you do it.

2246
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,360
Right?

2247
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,080
- For goodness' sake.
- A mortar.

2248
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:09,160
- Be careful.
- Zoom in on Haha's face.

2249
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,700
Hit hard.

2250
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:11,700
(Slapping)

2251
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,070
Ouch!

2252
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:15,260
(The caning of love
was super effective.)

2253
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:17,790
It must hurt a lot.

2254
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:21,630
- I can't believe you.
- You hit the soles well.

2255
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:23,430
- I did it well.
- He is so annoying.

2256
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:25,300
- Draw rosy cheeks on her face.
- Chung Hwa.

2257
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,140
- This is the best.
- Draw rosy cheeks on her face.

2258
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:28,710
It's my first time
trying something like this.

2259
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:29,970
- They look good on her.
- You look nice.

2260
01:16:29,970 --> 01:16:31,280
- Seriously.
- Chung Hwa.

2261
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,510
You look like Jigsaw.

2262
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,880
- She does look like him.
- Yes.

2263
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:37,550
How am I so bad at this game?

2264
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:39,030
- I need to focus.
- Okay.

2265
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:41,960
For Round Two,
you will pick a new penalty.

2266
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,750
Getting rosy cheeks drawn.

2267
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:44,860
This is a hard one.

2268
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:46,130
- Do Kwon, what's yours?
- Show us.

2269
01:16:46,130 --> 01:16:47,200
(Getting the sideburns pulled)

2270
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,200
- Getting the sideburns pulled.
- Getting the sideburns pulled.

2271
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,540
- Mine is getting caned on the sole.
- Getting caned on the sole.

2272
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:51,760
Our penalties are easy.

2273
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,430
- "Gourd-breaking" is easy to say.
- Gourd-breaking.

2274
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:54,930
- Is there "Gourd-breaking?"
- Gourd-breaking.

2275
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:57,540
- Getting slapped with water.
- That's a good one.

2276
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:00,210
- Getting hit by a wet towel.
- That's a good one.

2277
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:02,040
- Eating your raw eggs.
- I won't say that.

2278
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:04,040
So Min should get a turn.

2279
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:07,120
- So Min won't get a turn.
- I want to play the game too.

2280
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,320
It's too hard to say.

2281
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,680
- Who will go first?
- Haha.

2282
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:10,790
- Okay.
- Okay.

2283
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:13,460
Good penalty

2284
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:14,920
- Good penalty
- Penalty

2285
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,200
Eagle, seven.

2286
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,720
- Eagle.
- That's it.

2287
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:21,070
- Getting slapped with water, two.
- Getting slapped with water?

2288
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:22,330
Getting slapped with water?

2289
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:23,570
Getting slapped with water.

2290
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:25,070
Gourd-breaking, seven.

2291
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:27,300
- Gourd-breaking?
- That's me.

2292
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:28,500
That's Jae Seok.

2293
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:29,780
That's Jae Seok.

2294
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:31,800
(Jae Seok got gourd-breaking.)

2295
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,280
(Seok Jin attacked his teammate.)

2296
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:35,780
That's Jae Seok.

2297
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:37,120
(He attacked his teammate
with a solemn face.)

2298
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,620
That's Jae Seok.

2299
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:40,040
- You didn't tell me.
- He attacked his teammate.

2300
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,180
I...

2301
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:42,290
You didn't tell me.

2302
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:43,550
- What?
- He told you.

2303
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:45,250
Why did you attack gourd-breaking
instead of me?

2304
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:47,030
Why did you attack me?

2305
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:50,050
If I made a mistake,
you should have just gone along.

2306
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:52,250
- This is so frustrating.
- He could have done that.

2307
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,000
He could have gone along, right?

2308
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,200
- He could have done that.
- It wouldn't have been a problem.

2309
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:58,200
Can't you improvise?

2310
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,110
What audacity!

2311
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:04,630
I am sitting right next to you.
You asked me a moment ago,

2312
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:05,800
"What's yours?"

2313
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,040
I said, "Gourd-breaking."

2314
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,640
I told you.

2315
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,170
People can forget.

2316
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:13,710
You asked me what mine is,
so I said that it's gourd-breaking.

2317
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:16,680
- So why did you attack me?
- Is that what he whispered earlier?

2318
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,250
Does it count?

2319
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:19,880
- Of course.
- Really?

2320
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,790
- Of course it does.
- It's too much.

2321
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:22,830
Let's resume.

2322
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:26,260
- Good penalty
- Good penalty

2323
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:27,670
Getting slapped with water, eight.

2324
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:30,630
Getting slapped with water.

2325
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:33,570
- Getting slapped with water.
- You are doing well.

2326
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:36,210
Getting rosy cheeks drawn, seven.

2327
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:37,670
Rosy...

2328
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:41,250
- Yes!
- We got him!

2329
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:44,880
- They are very happy.
- We got the big fish!

2330
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:45,950
Jong Kook.

2331
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:47,640
A singer should be better
at getting the rhythm right.

2332
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,050
I thought it started with "Rosy."

2333
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:52,530
- Rosy.
- That word stood out to me.

2334
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,180
My feet are sweating.

2335
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:55,720
- Jong Kook, you can start.
- Okay.

2336
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,220
So Min should get a chance.

2337
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:59,260
- Good penalty
- I keep getting nervous.

2338
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:00,700
- Good penalty
- But I haven't played the game.

2339
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,070
- Good penalty
- Penalty

2340
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:03,260
- Good penalty
- Good penalty

2341
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:10,040
Good penalty

2342
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,580
- Good penalty
- For goodness' sake.

2343
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,380
- Focus, Jae Seok.
- He is so scary.

2344
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:14,780
- Good penalty
- He'll lose a point at this rate.

2345
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:18,040
- Good penalty
- Yes.

2346
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:19,680
- Good penalty
- Of course.

2347
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:20,920
- Good penalty
- Penalty

2348
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:25,080
Good penalty

2349
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,460
Bowl, seven.

2350
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:27,660
(Bowl, seven!)

2351
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:28,720
What?

2352
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,220
- Bowl.
- It's "Gourd-breaking."

2353
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:32,390
Gourd-breaking.

2354
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:34,830
Isn't it "Bowl-breaking?"

2355
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:36,090
(Mr. Raw Raw Eggs messed up again.)

2356
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:37,390
Good job.

2357
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:39,000
That was incredible.

2358
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:41,210
Is it "Gourd-breaking?"

2359
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:43,000
- It's "Gourd-breaking."
- I thought it was "Bowl-breaking."

2360
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:44,280
We won.

2361
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,280
- Okay.
- Six.

2362
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,780
Jong Kook, you will get
rosy cheeks drawn on your face.

2363
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,170
- Rosy cheeks.
- Okay.

2364
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:51,010
This is the worst.

2365
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:52,620
Why won't you let me play the game?

2366
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,420
Why won't you let me play the game?

2367
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,380
- You need to draw rosy cheeks.
- That's what I am doing.

2368
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:57,460
You are doing great.

2369
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,460
So Min doesn't hold back.

2370
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:00,720
She is doing great.

2371
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,790
This is why Jong Kook
is uncomfortable with So Min.

2372
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:06,330
Jong Kook, why won't you let me
play the game?

2373
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:07,760
She goes overboard sometimes.

2374
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:08,870
Okay.

2375
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:11,260
Jigsaw.

2376
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:12,370
This pen is not working.

2377
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:13,570
Soles. Seok Jin.

2378
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:16,280
How will I cane Ji Hyo's soles?

2379
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,830
You can get your soles caned
instead.

2380
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:20,800
- Seriously.
- He wouldn't let that happen.

2381
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,970
I don't want to do that.

2382
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:23,450
Ji Hyo is...

2383
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:25,580
Aren't you going to receive
the penalty instead?

2384
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:26,620
Who?

2385
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:28,450
Aren't you going to receive
the penalty instead?

2386
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:29,680
- Who?
- Jong Kook.

2387
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,010
- Aren't you going to help her?
- She can grant your wish...

2388
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:33,360
- for your trouble.
- Hurry up and cane her soles.

2389
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:35,360
Do it.

2390
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:36,890
- Hold on.
- If I were you, I would...

2391
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:41,630
Will it look strange
if I receive the penalty instead?

2392
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:43,930
Okay. Give me that.

2393
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,710
- Will he receive the penalty?
- Okay.

2394
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:48,070
Okay. Give me that.

2395
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:50,170
(His request has been accepted.)

2396
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:52,000
- All right.
- What?

2397
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,410
- What?
- You said you will do it.

2398
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:55,040
- You said you will do it.
- When did I say that?

2399
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,250
When did I say that?

2400
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:57,380
You just did.

2401
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:58,820
When did I say that?

2402
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:00,140
I will get my soles caned.

2403
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:01,880
I... I didn't say that.

2404
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,750
- Just get your soles caned.
- When did I say that?

2405
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:04,750
- You did.
- This is so funny.

2406
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:06,380
Ji Hyo, I am doing this
in your stead.

2407
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:08,030
- Hey.
- Cane his soles.

2408
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,660
- My goodness.
- It's good for circulation.

2409
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:11,390
- It's good for circulation.
- It won't hurt at all.

2410
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:12,920
Watch. Ouch!

2411
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:15,720
Watch. Ouch!

2412
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,370
(Caning of love
left an electrifying sensation.)

2413
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:18,890
- The pain stays for a while.
- It hurts.

2414
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:20,630
- It doesn't hurt at all.
- It hurts.

2415
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:21,910
It doesn't hurt at all.

2416
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,800
- It hurts.
- It's good for circulation.

2417
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,240
That jerk!

2418
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:26,640
The pain intensifies over time.

2419
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,580
- He is in a different team too.
- It doesn't hurt at all.

2420
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:30,540
Why did our team get the penalty?

2421
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:32,540
- You should have kept quiet.
- Why did I get caned?

2422
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:33,790
You ran your mouth.

2423
01:21:33,790 --> 01:21:34,840
You helped her when you are
in a different team.

2424
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:37,050
- Is it the last round?
- You will play to three points.

2425
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:38,580
- Okay.
- All right.

2426
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:40,460
Can we have a 1-on-1 match?

2427
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:41,720
Just one match.

2428
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,090
- So Min hasn't played at all.
- I want to play.

2429
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:45,550
Let So Min have a 1-on-1 match.

2430
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:47,390
- A 1-on-1 match.
- Let's do this.

2431
01:21:47,390 --> 01:21:50,790
A representative from each team
will come out and play three turns.

2432
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:52,710
They can only use
each other's penalty.

2433
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:53,760
- Okay.
- That's a good idea.

2434
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:55,130
- Se Chan.
- You can do it, right?

2435
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:56,130
Put them here.

2436
01:21:56,130 --> 01:21:57,930
- My heart is racing now.
- Put them here.

2437
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,340
So Min versus Se Chan.

2438
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:01,950
Se Chan, come on out.

2439
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:03,380
So Min, let's do this.

2440
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:04,420
- Se Chan, come on out.
- Se Chan.

2441
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,950
If we win this round,
we will be the winning team.

2442
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:07,420
- Should I pick one?
- Yes.

2443
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:09,120
She needs to win.

2444
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,160
What is she doing this time?

2445
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,750
What is up with her?

2446
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:14,180
She is making him nervous.

2447
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:16,090
- What?
- She is making him nervous.

2448
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:18,130
- She is making him nervous.
- Will you be okay, Se Chan?

2449
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:20,030
- My heart is beating fast.
- They are so funny.

2450
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:23,170
- Is your heart beating fast?
- She is like that.

2451
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:24,790
Okay. Eating your raw eggs.

2452
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:27,300
- Suddenly...
- Why are you applying lipstick?

2453
01:22:28,630 --> 01:22:31,240
(Se Chan, give me a second.)

2454
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:35,250
What... A kiss.

2455
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,880
Does this game involve a kiss?

2456
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,340
- It doesn't matter.
- You are right.

2457
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:41,820
She is so funny.

2458
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,210
(She is playing dirty already.)

2459
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:44,710
- She is so funny.
- Seriously, Se Chan.

2460
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:47,050
Se Chan became nervous.

2461
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:48,250
- What's yours?
- Look at each other.

2462
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:49,660
It's so hard.

2463
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:50,890
Eating your raw eggs.

2464
01:22:50,890 --> 01:22:52,670
- It's so hard.
- Call her honey.

2465
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:53,870
Honey.

2466
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,720
Call her honey.

2467
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:57,000
My goodness.

2468
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,330
- He is our teammate.
- Oh, right.

2469
01:22:58,330 --> 01:22:59,430
But she has to say it, though.

2470
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:00,870
Don't say that
with paint on your cheeks.

2471
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:03,500
- It's so funny.
- Eating your raw eggs.

2472
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:07,040
Jong Kook likes
all kinds of romance,

2473
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:08,640
but I don't like this couple.

2474
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:11,420
I have my own taste.

2475
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:13,040
- I like them though.
- Shall I go first?

2476
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:15,540
- Getting hit by a wet tissue.
- Why can't you look at her eyes?

2477
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:17,160
- This is so funny.
- All right. I should look at this.

2478
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:18,920
Why would you look at it?

2479
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:20,990
(Laughing)

2480
01:23:24,090 --> 01:23:25,160
He can't look at her.

2481
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:26,920
- I knew it.
- Look at him.

2482
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,720
- So Min is really...
- I know.

2483
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,070
- She's really good at this.
- She's so skilled.

2484
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:32,260
Eating your raw eggs.

2485
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,430
- Se Chan is so shy.
- You should look at her face.

2486
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:37,580
(Give me your hands.)

2487
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:40,610
You should look at her face.

2488
01:23:40,610 --> 01:23:42,080
- Look at her face.
- I'm not supposed to do this.

2489
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,320
You don't hold her hands.

2490
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,040
(He almost lost his mind
and held her hands.)

2491
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,950
- Why would you hold her hands?
- He can hold them if he wants.

2492
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:49,420
This is what I should do.

2493
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:53,180
Good penalty

2494
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,080
Getting hit by a wet tissue, seven.

2495
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:58,250
Getting hit by a wet tissue.

2496
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,530
- Getting hit by a wet tissue.
- She's good.

2497
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:01,200
Eating your raw eggs, six.

2498
01:24:01,790 --> 01:24:02,830
Eating...

2499
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,500
- What's with him?
- That was...

2500
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:08,760
(Eating raw eggs, six.)

2501
01:24:08,930 --> 01:24:11,040
(Se Chan is knocked out.)

2502
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,080
- Wasn't she off the beat?
- She was off the beat.

2503
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:15,170
- She was off the beat.
- Even if she was,

2504
01:24:15,170 --> 01:24:16,450
- you should've done it right.
- You should've said your part.

2505
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:18,010
She was off the beat.

2506
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:19,010
Just let it slide this time.

2507
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:20,120
Okay. Just this once.

2508
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,950
- You go first then.
- Okay. I'll go first.

2509
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:24,790
I'm sorry,
but try not to sound too sweet.

2510
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:25,880
He was flustered.

2511
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,360
- Just say it nonchalantly.
- Or just say "your raw eggs."

2512
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:29,790
I'll change it to "your raw eggs."

2513
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:31,420
- "Your raw eggs?"
- "Your raw eggs."

2514
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:33,790
- "Your raw eggs?"
- My goodness.

2515
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:34,830
What was that?

2516
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,260
- "Your raw eggs?"
- Oh, dear.

2517
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,280
- Good penalty
- Good penalty

2518
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:45,710
Your raw eggs.

2519
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:48,110
(Your raw eggs.)

2520
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:51,120
(He gives up.)

2521
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,290
- What?
- What was that?

2522
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:57,120
- What?
- Will you stop that?

2523
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:58,820
- "Your raw eggs."
- What did I do?

2524
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:00,080
What was that?

2525
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,880
What is going on?

2526
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,700
- Why?
- My gosh.

2527
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,530
- What about it?
- What's wrong?

2528
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:07,920
- My ear hurts.
- You should just play the game.

2529
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,790
- What?
- She whispered into my ear.

2530
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:13,040
- You're not supposed to blow.
- Your raw eggs, five.

2531
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,330
Gosh, Jeon So Min.

2532
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:16,610
(Even her team members are
astonished by her pranks.)

2533
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:19,300
Gosh, Jeon So Min.

2534
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:22,610
Your raw eggs.

2535
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:24,710
Getting hit by a wet tissue, sesen.

2536
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:25,970
- "Sesen?"
- "Sesen?"

2537
01:25:25,970 --> 01:25:27,990
(Getting hit
by a wet tissue, sesen.)

2538
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:30,620
(Sesen?)

2539

My goodness.

2550
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:56,510
What on earth is "sesen?"

- You idiot.
- I can't believe this.

2552
01:25:58,170 --> 01:26:01,320
- You silly thing.

2553
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,880

2556
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:08,360
"Your raw eggs, sesen."

2557
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:11,160
(Team Jae Seok wins the second

2558
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:14,260

of a black tiger.)

2569
01:26:43,090 --> 01:26:45,420
(You will have
a strong sexual appetite.)

2570
