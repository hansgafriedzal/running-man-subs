1
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,300
- Now we have the final mission.
- Okay.

2
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,340
Here is the second recipe.

3
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,040
- Okay.
- It's a pancake.

4
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,070
- This is nice.
- That's easy to make.

5
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,600
It's delicious. I love it.

6
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,530
- How many eggs do we need?
- You need five eggs.

7
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,810
- Again?
- Then...

8
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,310
- We have 2.
- We have 2, so we need 3.

9
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,900
- How many?
- I'll bring one of mine.

10
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,650
Let's look for it first. If we don't
find anything, I'll give you mine.

11
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,920
- Me too.
- And you give yours.

12
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,450
- All right.
- Let's go.

13
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,310
- This is the last mission.
- Okay.

14
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,560
The last mission
will be an individual game.

15
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
Okay.

16
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,630
Three members of each team
will be taggers.

17
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,970
The rest of you are supposed
to hide in this room.

18
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,070
- Really?
- My gosh.

19
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,570
There's no place to hide.

20
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,360
This is what you're going to do.

21
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,040
The remaining 8 members excluding
the 2 taggers from each team,

22
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,370
will choose a spot...

23
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,150
somewhere in this room
and stand there.

24
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,970
Once the eight members
are done hiding,

25
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,410
one of the two taggers
from each team...

26
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,610
will wear an eye mask.

27
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,820
And the other will carry the tagger
on his back to a random spot.

28
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,180
The tagger with an eye mask on...

29
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,120
should tag the rest
of the members for one minute.

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,660
The ones who survive
until the end get one point each.

31
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,900
The tagger who finds more than
5 members gets 3 points.

32
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,940
There will be three rounds.

33
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,660
The three members with the highest
points get two eggs each.

34
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,740
We came up with a list of matches.

35
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,510
- Ha Do Kwon versus Haha.
- Okay.

36
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,940
Se Chan versus Chung Hwa.

37
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,940
(Se Chan versus Chung Hwa)

38
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,020
Jong Kook versus Jae Suk.

39
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,070
(Jong Kook versus Jae Suk)

40
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,910
But it's not
a head-to-head match though.

41
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,990
I see.

42
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,740
Right? Are you okay with that?

43
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,460
In Round One...

44
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,350
My goodness.

45
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,350
- Gosh.
- All right.

46
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,630
Round One is Do Kwon versus Haha.

47
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,100
I'll give you one minute.

48
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,160
(The tagger, Haha covers his eyes.)

49
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,270
- You can use anything in this room.
- Okay.

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,630
Can I hide in here?

51
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,270
(They try to find a place
where they can't be found.)

52
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,270
Where will you be?
Will you hold onto the wall?

53
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,970
There's no place to hide.

54
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,050
This is...

55
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,740
Here.

56
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,380
There's no place to hide.

57
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,790
You can put him down
anywhere you want.

58
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,130
(The old man hides.)

59
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,950
Do Kwon.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,350
This is
an individual game after all.

61
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,030
- Take me to where they are.
- Okay.

62
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,130
I'll do the same
when it's your turn.

63
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,540
I'll do the same.

64
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,380
(Se Chan finds out
that these two are joining forces.)

65
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,040
I think one minute is too short.

66
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,780
Okay.

67
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,750
(Over there.)

68
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,010
(Yong Gu is planning
to betray Haha.)

69
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,620
You have 20 seconds left.

70
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,450
Once the time is up, you can't move.

71
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,450
Ten.

72
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,560
Nine.

73
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,260
Eight.

74
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,500
Seven.

75
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,790
Six.

76
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,130
Five.

77
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,420
Four.

78
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,690
Three.

79
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,840
Two.

80
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,040
One.

81
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,040
Time's up. No one can move now.

82
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,280
Carry him on your back.

83
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,730
One, two, and three.

84
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,850
Haha, give me your hand.

85
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,820
(The tagger wears a flour glove.)

86
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,640
You have one minute
from the moment you're down.

87
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,640
- Take me to where they all are.
- Okay.

88
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,720
(Where should I put him down?)

89
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,320
I'll release a zombie.

90
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,390
(Send him to a place
where there's no one around.)

91
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,630
(Do Kwon's choice...)

92
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,700
(is a corner.)

93
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,730
Where am I?

94
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,410
(The little zombie is
right next to Chung Hwa.)

95
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,440
Do Hwon, put him down.

96
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,570
You have one minute.

97
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,620
(The time limit of 1 minute begins.)

98
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,140
Where am I?

99
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,480
Where is this?

100
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,010
Where am I now? I have no idea.

101
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,160
(I survived.)

102
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,820
(Haha heads to the back room.)

103
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,950
Where is this place?

104
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,100
I hear something.

105
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,190
I hear something.

106
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,940
(Haha steps back towards Se Chan.)

107
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,880
(Will Se Chan be
Haha's first victim?)

108
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,320
(He loses Se Chan within his reach.)

109
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,820
(Now Haha heads to So Min
feeling after the wall.)

110
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,960
(He goes close to So Min
covered in blankets.)

111
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,170
There's someone here.

112
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,900
So Min is out.

113
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,310
Sorry, So Min.

114
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,200
So Min, I'm really sorry.

115
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,140
- You have 15 seconds left.
- I don't want to do this.

116
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,250
(Jeon So Min is out.)

117
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,380
It's here.

118
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,060
I'm so upset.

119
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,560
You have 15 seconds left.

120
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,070
(The two members were relieved
outside the room.)

121
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,460
(The little zombie's
surprise attack)

122
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,770
There must be
someone behind the sofa.

123
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,240
- Here's one.
- Jae Suk is out.

124
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,330
(Jae Suk is out.)

125
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,420
(There is little time left.)

126
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,190
(Will he tag Jong Kook as well?)

127
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,820
There's one more here.

128
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,990
Jong Kook is out.

129
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,510
Time's up.

130
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,710
- Is it over?
- It's over.

131
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,430
- Haha.
- How did you find me?

132
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,090
Haha, you almost got me.

133
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,630
You were right over there.

134
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,930
- It was so close.
- Who was here?

135
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,170
- Haha, you just went past me.
- Where did you put me down?

136
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,500
Ji Hyo, Suk Jin, Se Chan,

137
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,700
Chung Hwa, and Young Ji
get one point each.

138
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,760
Okay.

139
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,010
This is really hard.

140
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,200
Now it's Do Kwon's turn.

141
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,770
- All right.
- It was really funny.

142
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,200
You have one minute.

143
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,640
Go ahead and hide.

144
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,940
- Should we hide again?
- I was out in the open.

145
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,990
I'll stay here.

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,690
Suk Jin, you can't go out.

147
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,690
Seo Jin, are you going in there?

148
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,630
Stay quiet.

149
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,830
(Suk Jin's location notice service)

150
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,070
Who do you want to find?

151
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,680
Jong Kook.

152
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,010
(Jong Kook!)

153
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,770
(Yong Gu cares
only about Jong Kook.)

154
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,580
(His target, Jong Kook is
trying hard not to get tagged.)

155
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,620
(Se Chan pretends he's a cameraman.)

156
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,990
This is tricky.

157
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,150
You have ten seconds left.

158
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,520
This is really hard.

159
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,880
(Se Chan's camera)

160
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,130
Five.

161
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,360
Four.

162
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,730
Three.

163
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,170
- Two.
- This is an individual game.

164
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,320
One.

165
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,530
- Move him now.
- Okay.

166
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,630
All right. One, two, and three.

167
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,980
My gosh.

168
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,280
- Sit here.
- Sit?

169
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,380
One minute starts.

170
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,060
(He starts searching.)

171
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,020
(Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, Jae Suk)

172
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,690
(Ji Hyo, Jong Kook)

173
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:03,130
(Do Kwon crawls toward Ji Hyo.)

174
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,310
(At that moment!)

175
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,330
(He changes his course
toward Jong Kook.)

176
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,710
(The hyena smelled Jong Kook.)

177
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,320
There's something here.

178
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,490
Out.

179
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,820
(Kim Jong Kook is out.)

180
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,730
(Yong Gu is
Jong Kook's natural enemy.)

181
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,030
He found Jong Kook right away.

182
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,870
He's really good at this.

183
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,480
This is really hard.

184
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,940
(He goes past Chung Hwa.)

185
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,420
(He's about to touch Se Chan.)

186
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,080
- What is this?
- I'm a cameraman.

187
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,210
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,320
(Do Kwon fell for Se Chan's
lame impression.)

189
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,380
(Se Chan survived.)

190
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,090
Five.

191
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,260
Four.

192
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,890
Five.

193
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,070
Four.

194
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,190
Three.

195
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,740
Two.

196
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,240
(An unwelcomed guest shows up
right before the ending.)

197
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,310
(Will Jae Suk be out first?)

198
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,180
(Will the time be up first?)

199
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,640
Time's up.

200
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,380
(Checking)

201
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,400
(Shouting)

202
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,450
That was so close.

203
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,220
That's amazing.

204
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,410
He was right in front of me.

205
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,510
I turned around.

206
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,260
How did you survive?

207
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,130
He just went past me.

208
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,360
This is really hard.

209
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,290
- It's difficult.
- It's hard.

210
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,600
Round Two is
Jong Kook versus Jae Suk.

211
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,730
Okay.

212
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,230
Please sit here.

213
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,130
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

214
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,340
All right.

215
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,610
Take me to a spot with many members.

216
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,400
Suk Jin and everyone. Okay?

217
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,170
All right. It's my turn.

218
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,880
I hear something.

219
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,550
I hear something on my left.

220
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,130
The back of my left.

221
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,130
(Yoo Zombie pretends
that he's sharp.)

222
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,630
At my seven o'clock.

223
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,730
I can see.

224
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,000
Someone's moving.

225
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,600
(Running)

226
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,710
I know who's running here.

227
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,610
It's Haha.

228
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,030
I can see it.

229
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,270
(Young Ji joins them
in messing with him.)

230
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,510
Yang Se Chan.

231
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,170
I smell his feet. It's Se Chan.

232
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,380
(I smell his feet. It's Se Chan.)

233
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,410
(They found out
something last week.)

234
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,330
(But last time she was here,)

235
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,280
(they were dirty too.)

236
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,460
(Young Ji's soles are always dirty.)

237
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,390
(Another fact is revealed today.)

238
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,760
(Her feet are not just dirty.
They smell too.)

239
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,890
I'm sure.

240
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,010
I'm sure it's him.

241
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,260
I can smell his feet.

242
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,870
(The idol artist is easygoing
when it comes to her feet.)

243
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,400
- Get him on your back.
- Okay.

244
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,510
(All the members are done hiding.)

245
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,770
- Jong Kook.
- Okay.

246
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,350
All right.

247
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,810
- You can start moving.
- Jae Suk.

248
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,180
- I'll make things easy for you.
- Okay.

249
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,960
- I'll do the same for you.
- Okay.

250
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,920
(Horse Jong Kook carries
Yoo Zombie on his back.)

251
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:29,400
- Jong Kook. Oh, gosh.
- Oh, dear. My gosh.

252
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,840
Oh, boy.

253
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,740
(Touching)

254
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,610
(Seok Sam got caught in 1 second.)

255
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,080
I found one.

256
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,120
Suk Jin is out.

257
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,170
Was it Suk Jin?

258
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,220
Hey, seriously.

259
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,880
- Jong Kook.
- Oh, another one is here.

260
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,360
- I think...
- Haha is out.

261
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,490
I can't believe you.

262
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,760
What was that?

263
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,230
Wait. I hear something around here.

264
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,520
- It's me.
- Oh, I see.

265
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,330
Hold on. I'll move to this side.

266
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,600
Be careful. Good.

267
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,200
Wait. What's this?
Someone put the table here.

268
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,210
- Who are you?
- Do Kwon is out.

269
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,480
I found you. All right.

270
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,770
(Do Kwon who tried to cheat is out.)

271
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,350
I think someone else is here.

272
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,810
(He eliminated 3 people
and needs 2 more to get points.)

273
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,490
(But he's moving
in the wrong direction.)

274
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,010
- They're all cameramen.
- Is that so?

275
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,830
Turn around.
There are only cameras here.

276
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,920
He doesn't believe him.

277
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,960
- Those are expensive cameras.
- He doesn't believe it.

278
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,500
He trusts no one.

279
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,160
(He keeps moving as he wants,
ignoring their advice.)

280
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,100
Jae Suk, don't act
like you know where everyone is.

281
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,630
- Hold on.
- You have ten seconds left.

282
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,430
I'll go this way.

283
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,760
Five.

284
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,030
Four.

285
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,670
Three.

286
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,350
Two.

287
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,250
One.

288
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,540
- Time's up.
- Okay.

289
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,580
(Time's up.)

290
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,220
- Gosh.
- Four of them were standing there.

291
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,310
- There were four people there.
- Oh, man.

292
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,180
- What a shame.
- I put you down where they were.

293
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,180
- That's a shame.
- My goodness.

294
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,230
- But I couldn't see at all.
- How could you put him down there?

295
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,830
- Exactly. How could you?
- I slipped.

296
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,130
- You're lying.
- Gosh.

297
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,260
- No. He wouldn't do it on purpose.
- I slipped just as I said.

298
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,200
Why would I have done it?
You know I'm strong enough.

299
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,560
Exactly. That's nonsense.

300
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,500
(Suk Jin pats off the flour
after losing the argument.)

301
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,760
- You're covered with flour.
- Look at Suk Jin.

302
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,970
Look at Suk Jin.

303
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,530
You got so much flour on you.

304
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,770
I got so much on me.

305
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,240
Please put on the blindfold.

306
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,350
- There's no place to hide now.
- Let's hurry up.

307
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,540
Guys, Viper is up next.

308
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,620
- Where should we hide this time?
- Exactly. There's no place to hide.

309
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,850
We've hidden at every place in here.

310
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,010
- They're all standing behind us.
- Okay.

311
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,990
- Are you two allies?
- No.

312
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,880
- You shouldn't do that.
- We're not allies.

313
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
I won't tell him.

314
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,920
Five.

315
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,960
(They decided to split up to fool
the 2 Grand Award winners.)

316
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
Four.

317
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,830
Three.

318
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,890
(Frog sat on the karaoke machine.)

319
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,060
- Two.
- I can hear you all moving.

320
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,060
One.

321
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,060
Now, please hop on his back.

322
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,610
- Got it.
- Okay. I'll do that.

323
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,110
- Someone's in the middle. Okay.
- Go straight once I put you done.

324
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,040
- Here we go.
- I should mark on them.

325
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,220
- All right.
- You're good to go.

326
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,120
(The allies start moving.)

327
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,590
We're going this way.

328
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,010
Excuse us. Oh, dear.

329
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,720
- Oh, my.
- I'll put you down over there.

330
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,860
Okay.

331
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,180
(Go over there.)

332
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,790
Where do you want us to go?

333
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,020
That way?

334
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,500
Over there?

335
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,740
(Flustered)

336
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,870
All right. Please excuse us.
Sir, I'm sorry.

337
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,340
- I think I just heard something.
- I'm sorry.

338
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,660
I'll put you down here.

339
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,900
Okay.

340
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,770
- All right. Go.
- Okay. Oh, dear.

341
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,270
(Jae Suk put him down
where he can find many people.)

342
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,010
- Oh, here?
- There's one on your right too.

343
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,250
Oh, here?

344
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,670
- Oh, dear. Who are you?
- Ji Hyo is out.

345
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,310
(Ji Hyo got eliminated right away.)

346
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,590
- Oh, my.
- Suk Jin is out.

347
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,720
Hey, Jae Suk.

348
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,380
- Who are you?
- You made it too easy.

349
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,220
- Jae Suk, come on.
- Gosh, seriously.

350
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,050
- I found another one.
- Gosh. What are you two doing?

351
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,420
- It's not like that.
- Oh, gosh. What's this?

352
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,000
- Is this a wall?
- You shouldn't have done it.

353
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,730
- He'd search the corners anyway.
- There must be a camera here.

354
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,660
Right? Oh, was I wrong?

355
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,160
Right? This is where a camera is.

356
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,240
No? No one's hiding here?

357
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,710
Okay. How about here?

358
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,840
This is the television.

359
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,400
(Young Ji barely survived.)

360
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,850
Here. This is the television.

361
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,310
Right. And next to it...

362
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,380
(Hitting)

363
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,040
Who was that?

364
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,220
(Frog is attacking him
with her tongue.)

365
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,090
She hit him with a fly swatter.

366
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,590
(Frog hit him since she was going to
get caught anyway.)

367
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,420
- Watch out for the table.
- Okay. Thanks.

368
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,730
And this is a wall. Okay.

369
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,830
Let's keep going.

370
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,630
I think I just heard someone moving
around here.

371
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,390
- Four people haven't been found.
- Who?

372
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,130
Do Kwon, Haha, Chung Hwa,
and Young Ji.

373
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,200
Okay.

374
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,130
You have ten seconds left.

375
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,740
- Oh, my. Who is this?
- Do Kwon is out.

376
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,880
(Do Kwon got eliminated
with only 10 seconds remaining.)

377
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,670
I thought he was going to
pass by him.

378
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,310
(The 3 of them haven't been caught
by Viper who's good at this.)

379
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,220
Time's up.

380
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,490
You picked a great place to hide.

381
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,720
You hid there twice
and never got caught.

382
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,420
- You went past Young Ji.
- Did I?

383
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,760
He found five people.

384
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,650
Jong Kook, you found five people.

385
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,050
- My gosh. That was fun.
- Five?

386
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,520
We'll begin the final round.

387
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,890
Se Chan versus Chung Hwa.

388
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,970
(Round 3, Chung Hwa versus Se Chan)

389
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,200
- Should I put it on now? Okay.
- Yes, please.

390
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
(Chung Hwa will go first.)

391
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,130
You have one minute. Go.

392
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,270
(Haha sits down
right in front of Chung Hwa.)

393
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,710
Playing games like this is
so hard for me.

394
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,170
It's so hard.

395
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,640
(The pranksters are gathering
1 by 1.)

396
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,090
(Even Suk Jin came
right in front of her.)

397
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,990
But I'll get better
at playing games eventually, right?

398
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,960
(This is called
the right-under-her-nose strategy.)

399
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,150
Be quiet and sit down.

400
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,370
(The dirty players are exchanging
signals without letting her know.)

401
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,000
I've never done this before.

402
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,560
It'll be so much fun.

403
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Put it on my hand now.

404
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,880
Five.

405
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,930
Four.

406
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,210
- Three.
- I'll take you to where they are.

407
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,350
Two.

408
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,080
- One. Carry her on your back.
- Stand up now.

409
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,620
Oh, he should carry me on his back?

410
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,220
Ready? One, two, three.

411
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,380
Let's go.

412
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,010
Here we go!

413
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,020
(Chung Hwa seems energetic enough
to catch everyone.)

414
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,420
- Where are you taking me?
- They're all hiding in here.

415
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,500
- Where are they?
- I'll put you down here.

416
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,340
I'll put you down. Be careful.

417
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,340
(Everyone is on the other side.)

418
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,670
(But he took Chung Hwa
to the empty space.)

419
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,900
You can start searching now.

420
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,880
(She started shadow boxing.)

421
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,550
Hang on a second.

422
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,730
Where are you?

423
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,680
Where did my pad go?

424
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,830
Oh, I found it.

425
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,100
(They're enjoying watching
the Cha Chung Hwa Show.)

426
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,760
What's going on?

427
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,870
Is there anyone here?

428
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,530
(Boxer Cha managed to come
to the other side of the room.)

429
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,010
Is no one here?

430
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,560
Is no one here?

431
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,300
Oh, this is where I hid before.

432
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,080
(She went past Young Ji and So Min
and is getting close to Ji Hyo.)

433
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,480
Is no one here?

434
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,850
(Will she find Ji Hyo?)

435
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,490
(Grunting)

436
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,230
(I found someone.)

437
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,190
- She's our writer.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.

438
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,400
(The unfortunate Boxer Cha hit
the audience member.)

439
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,700
I'm sorry.

440
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,900
(The gold mine)

441
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,000
What should I do?

442
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,510
(She went past the gold mine
without finding anyone.)

443
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,300
Oh, gosh. I haven't found anyone.
Where is everyone?

444
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,340
Five.

445
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,800
- Where is everyone?
- Four.

446
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,150
(This is her last chance.)

447
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,150
Three.

448
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,810
Two.

449
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,550
One.

450
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,690
- Time's up.
- No!

451
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,580
- That was hilarious.
- She almost found them.

452
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,580
Chung Hwa.

453
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,760
- Chung Hwa, look here.
- Take off the blindfold.

454
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,160
We all enjoyed your show.

455
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,960
(Plenty of people)

456
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,170
Cha Chung Hwa Show!

457
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,790
- That was very entertaining.
- Chung Hwa.

458
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,030
You went past us.

459
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,830
They're giving you
a standing ovation.

460
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,740
- That was amazing.
- I'm impressed.

461
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,830
- Thank you for your show.
- We really enjoyed it.

462
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,450
I can't believe
that they were all sitting there.

463
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,870
- Hey!
- Why?

464
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,480
- According to the results,
- Yes.

465
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,810
we'll give each of the top 3 players
2 eggs.

466
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,050
They're Young Ji, Chung Hwa,
and Jong Kook.

467
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,430
(Young Ji, Chung Hwa, Jong Kook)

468
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,520
- I'm so excited!
- That's a great benefit.

469
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,960
I can't believe this.

470
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,520
(Jigsaw is very happy that she won.)

471
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,860
Oh, my. She can jump so high.

472
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,940
- Young Ji, you jumped so high.
- That was impressive.

473
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,200
Do it again.

474
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,330
How do you jump so high?

475
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,970
That's amazing.

476
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,710
- Oh, my. She jumped so high.
- I'm impressed.

477
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,710
- She won.
- She's amazing.

478
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,710
We'll hand out the eggs
and reveal the last recipe.

479
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,540
The first team
to finish making pancakes...

480
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,540
- and the last dish we'll reveal...
- Can we start cooking now?

481
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,680
- wins the race.
- Okay.

482
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,890
- Got it.
- The winning team?

483
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,550
The third dish is deep-fried eggs.

484
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,430
You can just deep-fry
boiled eggs with bread crumbs.

485
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,050
- Got it.
- All right.

486
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,230
These are for the winners.
Take two of them.

487
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,730
(Chung Hwa, Young Ji,
and Jong Kook get 2 eggs each.)

488
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,670
- Jong Kook, these are your eggs.
- Thank you. I'm so glad we won.

489
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,200
- Exactly. I'm so happy.
- This is great.

490
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,100
- All my eggs were stolen.
- Really?

491
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,100
- Chung Hwa, hand in 1 egg.
- Jong Kook, give me 1 of them.

492
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,440
- How many eggs do we have?
- We can use them all.

493
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,600
- Are you sure?
- Bring your eggs.

494
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,840
- We can use them all.
- Really?

495
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,250
Young Ji lost a lot of eggs.
Hand in a few if you some left.

496
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,540
- I lost almost all.
- I'll bring mine.

497
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,950
- I didn't lose any of mine.
- Really? That's great.

498
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,810
- I'll bring one more egg.
- Bring your eggs.

499
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,310
- I'll hand in three eggs.
- Where we cooked?

500
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,490
Let's break the eggs we have
for now...

501
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,490
- and count the rest later.
- Okay. Let's do that.

502
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,930
Each of you should bring one egg.

503
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,050
I already handed mine in.

504
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,760
When? You should bring one more
for the new dishes.

505
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,590
- Right.
- Each of us should bring one.

506
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,670
Chung Hwa will pitch in 1 egg,
so each of us should bring 1.

507
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,970
- Okay.
- Okay.

508
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,240
- Bring your egg, okay?
- Let's do that.

509
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,740
- I'll go and find my egg.
- Right.

510
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,240
You have a 20-minute break
starting now.

511
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,710
Let's hurry up
and finish cooking quickly.

512
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,180
- Let's make a Hamburg steak.
- Okay. Good.

513
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,220
(They started making a Hamburg steak
with the 2 eggs they just got.)

514
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,680
- You need this too, right?
- Yes, I do.

515
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,280
Cha Chung Hwa.

516
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,960
Is it fully cooked?

517
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,550
- It's fully cooked.
- Good. Let's go.

518
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,660
- Really?
- Put it on the plate. Hurry.

519
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,460
I see that the other team made
their food halfheartedly.

520
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,660
(So Team Jong Kook made
their 1st dish.)

521
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,700
Okay.

522
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,670
(Currently, the 2 teams are tied.)

523
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,860
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

524
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,470
Let's find some eggs together.

525
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,530
- We need all five eggs.
- We can't start cooking yet.

526
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,210
We need to put in the eggs now.

527
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,770
We just need one more egg.

528
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,300
Suk Jin, we can't cook
because we need one more egg.

529
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,710
- Sorry?
- We need one more egg.

530
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,450
- Just one more egg...
- But I don't have any eggs now.

531
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,920
Darn. I have no choice but to bring
this one.

532
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,580
Darn it.

533
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,850
(Flustered)

534
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,120
Gosh. My egg is over there.
I'm in trouble.

535
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,850
(He found Ji Hyo
where he hid his egg.)

536
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,400
I'm sure they hid their eggs
at unimaginable places.

537
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,900
Our members would do that.

538
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,140
She's still searching there.
I think she found it.

539
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,560
Darn it.

540
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,940
(He's expressing his anxiety
with his entire body.)

541
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,510
(Surprised)

542
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,940
What's this?

543
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,650
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.
What's wrong with her?

544
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,150
(What Ji Hyo found was...)

545
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,280
(Suk Jin's egg.)

546
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,490
Hey, did you find some eggs?

547
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,760
- I'll break this egg.
- Wait. Hey.

548
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,930
- I'll break it.
- Go ahead.

549
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:49,960
- Just break it.
- I'll break it.

550
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,460
Come on, Ji Hyo.

551
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,850
- Tell me where the others' are.
- Deal.

552
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,470
I'll tell you. Jae Suk hid
his eggs upstairs.

553
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,120
- Exactly where?
- Right there. Come and see.

554
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,140
Stand up and look over there.
His eggs are right there.

555
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,140
Hey.

556
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,860
(She broke his egg.)

557
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,010
I broke it.

558
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,600
- Gosh.
- I'm sorry, Suk Jin.

559
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,480
I'm sorry.

560
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,540
Gosh, Ji Hyo.

561
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,510
Darn. How did she find it?

562
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,180
- Ji Hyo, did you find only that?
- Yes?

563
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,310
Yes, that was the only one I found.

564
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,010
I guess there's more there.

565
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,260
(Suk Jin was so anxious
that he made a mistake.)

566
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,460
There must be more eggs there.

567
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,760
That was all.

568
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,430
I'm sure she won't find it.

569
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,820
(He's leaving awkwardly
while pretending he's okay.)

570
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,730
I can't believe Ji Hyo.

571
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,860
- So Min.
- I'll make pancakes quickly.

572
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,830
We still need one more egg.

573
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,060
I brought an egg.

574
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,360
(He brought an egg?)

575
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,770
- I'll break it.
- Wait.

576
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,300
(When he was trying to negotiate
with Ji Hyo to save his egg,)

577
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:48,920
(he retrieved 2 of his eggs
while pretending to stop her.)

578
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,460
There's no place to hide this one.

579
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,760
(He left 1 of them
with a cameraman.)

580
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,990
Okay?

581
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,350
(And he came back proudly
with the egg he had left.)

582
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,930
Let's hurry up and make it.
Let's go.

583
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,970
Let's hurry up. Come on.

584
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,400
- It looks good.
- Right?

585
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,830
- What are you making?
- Pancakes.

586
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,510
- You don't make pancakes like this.
- I'm doing it right.

587
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,140
(What? It's too big.)

588
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,750
It'll be hard to flip it.

589
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,870
You should've poured
just one scoop in the middle.

590
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,870
It's okay.

591
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,010
(They must make 5 pieces.)

592
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,490
(Jae Suk is making the 1st piece
too big.)

593
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,660
Gosh. Are you making
green onion jeon?

594
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,660
(Are you making green onion jeon?)

595
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,730
What kind of pancake is that?

596
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,050
(Chef Yoo is making
Western style green onion jeon.)

597
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,930
- I could make five pieces at once.
- Exactly.

598
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,090
That's right, Jae Suk. For now...

599
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,320
Where could they be?
Where did Soek Jin hide them?

600
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,940
I don't think he hid them
at a place like this.

601
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,860
(Surprised)

602
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,480
(She found Suk Jin's egg.)

603
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,980
(She found 2 eggs, not just 1.)

604
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,250
This is like a gold mine.

605
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,840
(She found 3 eggs in total.)

606
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,720
- Okay. I found enough eggs.
- Do we have enough eggs?

607
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,280
- Yes, we do.
- Hurry up and start cooking.

608
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,550
Let's hurry up.
How many pieces must we make?

609
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,760
Pour it.

610
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,500
- We'll win if we finish first.
- Correct.

611
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,970
- We just have to make five pieces.
- True.

612
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,470
Is that enough?

613
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,560
(Team Jae Suk is speeding up
as So Min joins Jae Suk.)

614
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,060
That's good. You're doing great.

615
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,760
- I'll help you.
- Good. Okay.

616
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,360
You can use a spoon.

617
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,870
- Good.
- The eggs we have...

618
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,250
You just have to shape it now.

619
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,540
- Shape it, Se Chan.
- Okay?

620
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,680
You can use the ladle...

621
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,110
They haven't made pancakes yet.

622
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,510
- All right.
- Yes.

623
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,010
(The 2nd dish is done.)

624
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,690
To make deep-fried eggs,

625
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,920
- We should hurry up.
- we need three eggs.

626
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,820
I'll boil the eggs when we have
2 more eggs. We need 2 more.

627
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,660
- Where?
- So Min, start boiling the eggs.

628
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,500
- We need... We should peel them.
- Boil this one first.

629
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,760
Peel the eggs.

630
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,670
- I brought 1 egg too.
- The rest of the 2 eggs...

631
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,240
We have to mix them, right?
I broke them.

632
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,860
- I'm using one of mine.
- Okay.

633
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,170
(They collected 5 eggs.)

634
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,530
- Here.
- I'm relieved we had it. Okay.

635
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,640
- Done.
- Let's go.

636
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,840
- There.
- Okay. We're done.

637
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,210
- It's done. Put it on top of them.
- I'm boiling them.

638
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,110
- I'll put it on top of them.
- Hurry.

639
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,220
- Let's go.
- Go on.

640
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,840
- Okay.
- Cover the eggs with flour,

641
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,390
egg mixture, and bread crumbs.
Then deep-fry them.

642
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,810
(The 1st team to make
the last dish will win.)

643
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,350
Oh, gosh.

644
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,320
I lost all my eggs.

645
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,860
(Team Jong Kook needs 5 eggs
for the last dish.)

646
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,360
I lost mine.

647
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,470
I can't believe
that someone found it.

648
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,330
Oh, no. Wait.

649
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,480
(The other team found their eggs
with even stronger determination.)

650
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,770
- I was wrong.
- I didn't search here.

651
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,600
Oh, boy. Where on earth
did they hide their eggs?

652
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,310
(The place where Do Kwon came
to find an egg is...)

653
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,810
(where Jae Suk hid
all 10 of his eggs.)

654
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,850
No one will search this place.

655
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,010
(Jae Suk hid
all 10 of his eggs here.)

656
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:44,280
(Do Kwon had a hunch
about this place.)

657
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,500
Wait.

658
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,320
(Yong Gu is moving
straight to the eggs.)

659
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,140
(He's searching where the eggs are.)

660
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:56,140
(It's a crucial chance for him
to turn the game around and win.)

661
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,090
(But he fails to find them.)

662
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,450
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk
who almost lost all of his eggs...)

663
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,400
They made pancakes.
We should hurry up.

664
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,130
Guys, we should hurry up.

665
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,900
Oh, gosh.
When will the alarm go off?

666
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,230
How much longer should we wait?

667
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,530
I set the timer for 11 minutes.

668
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,000
- Now?
- It'll go off when 11 minutes pass.

669
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,030
- We have to cover it with flour.
- We need iced water.

670
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,530
- It helps to peel eggs easily.
- Wear gloves.

671
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,180
No, I'll do it. So Min.

672
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,700
- Yes, Suk Jin?
- Here are gloves.

673
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,350
We need to peel
the boiled eggs, right?

674
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,880
Yes, but the water isn't boiling.

675
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,690
- I think it's boiling.
- I set the timer for eight minutes.

676
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,510
You should wait a little longer.

677
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,550
We're running out of time.

678
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,930
No, Suk Jin. We should wait...

679
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,450
- until the alarm goes off.
- Shouldn't we roll the eggs?

680
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,900
No, we don't have to do that.
We just have to close the lid.

681
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,100
- Suk Jin, just be quiet.
- You know nothing about cooking.

682
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,260
Why must you keep nagging me
like this?

683
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,640
- Hey, I'm just...
- He asked a lame question.

684
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,610
- I see some cracks.
- I see them too. Okay.

685
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,940
- I think they're ready.
- They might be broken.

686
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,080
They're cooked well enough.
Don't worry.

687
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,540
(While they're arguing
whether to take the eggs out...)

688
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,970
- They won't be broken.
- Exactly.

689
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,350
- Hey, get out.
- Get out.

690
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,180
- Gosh, it's too hot.
- What are you doing?

691
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,650
Hey, Sesen, get out right now.

692
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,010
- Move, Sesen.
- Sesen.

693
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,150
Be careful.

694
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,660
(The quality of the food
doesn't matter anyway.)

695
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,020
(They can win the race
as long as they finish cooking.)

696
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,090
- It's hot.
- Okay.

697
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,490
- See? It's not cooked well enough.
- Be gentle.

698
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,520
(They're peeling
the eggs carefully.)

699
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,330
Oh, gosh. Darn it.

700
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,490
I knew this would happen.
We should boil them for longer.

701
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,600
Shall we boil them for longer?

702
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,230
We should hurry up.

703
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,110
- We still have a long way to go.
- Oh, no.

704
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,730
(Meanwhile, Team Jong Kook is
patiently boiling eggs.)

705
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,500
We still have a chance.

706
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,240
Okay. I peeled one.

707
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,040
- It's not easy.
- Right?

708
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,820
(She started deep-frying
the 1st egg.)

709
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,120
- Deep-fry it.
- Okay. Good.

710
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,360
- See? It's not cooked.
- No, this one first.

711
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,660
They're peeling the eggs now.

712
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,360
- Really? That's unbelievable.
- Yes.

713
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,020
How do they cook so fast?

714
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,160
- I wonder if they're ready.
- No, not yet.

715
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,020
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

716
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,830
The eggs seem to be cooked well.

717
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,870
- Hurry.
- Can we peel them? Be careful.

718
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,940
(Do Kwon took 1 of them out.)

719
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,230
- Okay. It's cooked.
- Good.

720
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,070
Cool them all down.

721
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,940
Each of us should peel one, okay?

722
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,970
Okay. Let's peel them.

723
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:10,700
But peel it gently.
It's not fully cooked.

724
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,850
- Is it intact? What should I do?
- Yes, it is.

725
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,440
Let's just use it as it is. Hurry.

726
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,540
Look at this. I kept it intact.

727
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,940
- Okay. Good.
- I told you so.

728
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,280
- It wasn't cooked well.
- No, this one first.

729
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,920
- Okay. Let me do it.
- Here.

730
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,120
- Sorry?
- Of course, it's undercooked.

731
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,720
It's about to hatch.

732
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,660
- Don't worry. The eggs were fresh.
- It's okay.

733
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,750
- It's okay. Absolutely.
- It'll taste great.

734
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,370
Why is it so sticky?

735
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,220
I see the yolk dripping.

736
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,230
- Gosh. What's this?
- I see...

737
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,700
(The 3rd egg is crying.)

738
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,000
- It's okay.
- I knew it. We should've...

739
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,940
- boiled them for 11 minutes.
- This is how we eat it.

740
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,700
- Like this.
- He's a troublemaker.

741
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,350
Gosh, it's so messy.

742
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,740
Boil another egg.

743
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,010
- We have no more eggs.
- We don't have any eggs left.

744
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,010
Give it to me.

745
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,650
- That's good.
- Look at this.

746
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,210
- Put it in there. Okay.
- Give me the egg.

747
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,050
- Put it in here, Jong Kook.
- Here? Okay.

748
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,750
- There.
- Let's go.

749
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,160
Good. That's great.

750
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,660
I'm sorry. I'll use my egg.

751
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,020
- Let's boil it quickly.
- In boiling water...

752
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,250
- Oh, we have an electric kettle.
- Boil some water.

753
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,490
Wait. Keep boiling it for now.

754
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,520
- Hold on. Move aside.
- Instead of waiting until it boils,

755
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,100
- we'll put it in cold water.
- So Min, I'm sorry.

756
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,640
- What's your plan?
- I'll explain.

757
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,070
- We'll just...
- We should boil it in this pot.

758
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,070
We'll put it in cold water
and boil it.

759
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,530
We have this one.
Will you use that pot?

760
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,880
(However, Se Chan passed by
right at that moment.)

761
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,140
(On the plate that he's holding,
there are deep-fried eggs.)

762
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,700
Where should we put this?

763
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,740
(So he put it on the table.)

764
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,540
One, two, three.

765
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,740
(Shooting a confetti cracker
to celebrate the victory)

766
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,510
- Put it in cold water...
- It's over.

767
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,160
- They won?
- They shot a confetti cracker.

768
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,280
Gosh.

769
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,750
The other team finished cooking.

770
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,830
Seok Sam ruined everything
once again. Gosh.

771
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,400
- Oh, yes!
- We won.

772
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,100
- Let's take a look.
- I'm relieved.

773
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,960
- Young Ji, did we win?
- I told you we'd win.

774
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,130
Are the eggs cooked well?

775
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,340
Their eggs don't seem
to be fully cooked either. Gosh.

776
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,500
- Gosh. I can't believe...
- What happened to your eggs?

777
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,530
- One was broken.
- You boiled them all earlier.

778
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,140
- One of them was broken.
- Because of Seok Sam...

779
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,800
Oh, no.

780
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,000
Collect your eggs and gather around.

781
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,380
- Gosh.
- What a shame.

782
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,480
Let's go and see
how many of them are still there.

783
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,280
Let's see if they're still there.

784
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,250
I hope no one took my eggs.

785
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,590
I thought that no one had hidden
an egg here. Really?

786
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,600
- Who was it? Do Kwon?
- I hid one here.

787
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,430
My gosh. I came here to search.

788
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,440
(He looks as if he was
digging relics.)

789
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,530
Sir.

790
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,580
Can I have my eggs back now? What?

791
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,740
(Jae Suk looks for his eggs too.)

792
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,510
(His 10 eggs are gone.)

793
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,540
Someone stole my ten eggs.

794
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,210
- Really?
- What's wrong?

795
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,510
- I should check.
- Someone stole mine.

796
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,950
Yours?

797
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,480
Who stole his eggs?

798
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,220
Hold on a second.
None of us found Jae Suk's.

799
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,330
(Who will receive the penalty
in this unpredictable race?)

800
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,490
Here's the final result.

801
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,190
The one who came in last
on the winning team...

802
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,940
could receive the penalty if chosen.

803
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,070
How many do you have left?

804
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,200
The one who came in last
could receive the penalty if chosen.

805
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,410
How many do you have left?

806
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,270
(Who came in last
on the winning team?)

807
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,200
- I have three left.
- No way.

808
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,380
- I have three left too.
- Three.

809
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,850
(The remaining number of eggs)

810
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,180
- I have five left.
- Five.

811
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,440
- Check Do Kwon out.
- I have nine left.

812
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,590
- Nine?
- See what I mean?

813
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,620
I have nine left.

814
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,590
(Do Kwon has 9 eggs left?)

815
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,190
You...

816
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,190
It's only because I found
what the others hid.

817
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,430
- Unbelievable.
- All right.

818
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,930
He's like the neighborhood jerk.

819
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,600
- Watch the show when it airs.
- We don't have any left.

820
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,790
It seems like...

821
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,170
Ji Hyo came in last.

822
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,730
(Did Ji Hyo come in last?)

823
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,100
- She has 1.
- Do you only have 1 left?

824
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,840
- Lucky you.
- Nice!

825
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,070
- Check out her expression.
- Really?

826
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,760
(Here's how she was only
left with one egg.)

827
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,300
(She hid most of them
in a staff member's van.)

828
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,820
- Sir.
- Yes?

829
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,940
- Promise me you won't leave.
- Got it.

830
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:40,010
(But that staff member
went home first!)

831
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,920
(Going home on time
was more important...)

832
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,830
(than his agreement with Ji Hyo.)

833
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,790
He's gone.

834
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,260
Sir?

835
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,930
(She desperately searched for him.)

836
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,870
I need my eggs back.

837
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,530
- I hid them in a van.
- It's as if she lost her world.

838
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,140
- I have three left.
- But the van is disappeared.

839
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,940
- Really?
- The van is gone!

840
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,300
Why did you hide them in a van?

841
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,140
- The van was gone.
- The driver took off.

842
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,800
The cameramen
get off work before we do.

843
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,080
- My gosh.
- He left.

844
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,380
Those who can receive the penalty...

845
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,120
are Ji Hyo and the five
from the losing team.

846
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,710
A vote will decide
which three will receive it.

847
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,660
- A vote.
- But I don't have any ballots.

848
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,450
You will all participate
in the vote.

849
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,830
Throughout the race,
you obtained ballots.

850
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,790
- Yes.
- How many do you each have?

851
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,720
- I have one.
- One.

852
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,190
- I found Young Ji's egg.
- I have none.

853
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,430
I gave mine to So Min.

854
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,790
- I have none.
- You have no ballots...

855
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,070
- and no eggs.
- I have nothing.

856
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,440
What have you been up to today?

857
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,000
I have two.

858
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,340
- Why do I have two?
- This is from So Min.

859
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,530
- You.
- What?

860
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,140
- Get over here.
- Why?

861
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,700
- You!
- What is this about?

862
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,040
- Why?
- Attention.

863
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
- But why?
- Attention.

864
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,120
- Tell me what this is about.
- Attention.

865
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,510
- Attention.
- Why?

866
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,650
- Se Chan.
- What?

867
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,320
- How many do you have?
- I have two,

868
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,420
but hear me out.

869
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,190
- These are from finding Young Ji's.
- Did you find mine?

870
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,190
I swear.

871
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,090
- It's not from finding yours.
- Isn't it odd...

872
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,780
- that he's saying it's mine?
- These are Young Ji's.

873
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,900
We agreed to give back
the eggs that belong to teammates!

874
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,190
- I gave them back.
- I found two of Young Ji's eggs.

875
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,330
I gave all that I found back.

876
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,490
Young Ji, how many do you have?

877
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,900
I have 11.

878
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,370
What? 11?

879
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,670
It was her.

880
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:04,030
(Young Ji has 11 ballots?)

881
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,700
- It was her.
- She must've found my eggs.

882
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,350
- My eggs!
- She has 11.

883
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,580
(How did she collect
so many ballots?)

884
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,680
I'm off to the restroom.

885
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,920
(During the cooking stage,
she went to the restroom.)

886
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,940
(But she actually went outside.)

887
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,950
I need to find someone else's eggs.

888
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,550
This isn't the time
for me to cook with the rest.

889
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,100
(She searched here and there.)

890
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,160
I think I saw something here.

891
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,940
(No way!)

892
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,530
No way.

893
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,500
(She found 10 of Jae Suk's eggs.)

894
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,610
Sweet.

895
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,580
(And those eggs...)

896
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,710
I'm cashing them all in.

897
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,880
(They were all swapped for ballots.)

898
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,650
Jae Suk, I'm sorry.

899
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,320
Sorry about that.
My stomach was acting up.

900
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,480
(Deceitful)

901
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,420
(Her restroom break
served as the perfect alibi.)

902
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,160
We were talking about
you being a spy.

903
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,830
- Eleven?
- She found my eggs.

904
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,900
But you didn't
give us any to cook with.

905
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,020
- She's a little thief!
- No way.

906
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,520
- How can she...
- My gosh.

907
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,530
- That's stealing.
- I'm impressed, Young Ji.

908
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,700
How did you find them?

909
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,870
(The number of ballots they have
was revealed.)

910
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,340
Anyway, let's begin the vote.

911
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,410
- With what you obtained...
- We get one more each.

912
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,610
(They get a ballot each
on top of what they obtained.)

913
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,880
Whose name should I write?

914
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,320
- Whose name did you write?
- I can't tell you that.

915
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,420
It's hard to choose.

916
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,890
- She has over ten.
- I can't believe it.

917
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:23,920
- My gosh, Young Ji.
- How can she have so many?

918
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,350
- No way.
- She has over ten.

919
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,820
The guest will decide on
the penalty for the members...

920
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,550
- and vice versa.
- Sure thing.

921
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,360
Getting hit by a wet tissue...

922
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,780
seemed good enough.

923
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,020
- Wet tissues?
- Yes.

924
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,860
- So the guests...
- Getting hit by a wet tissue.

925
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,760
- For the guests, right?
- Right.

926
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,900
We'll go with
getting hit by a wet towel.

927
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,400
Choose a penalty for the members.

928
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,990
The guests can decide.

929
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,960
- Then...
- Is it up to us?

930
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,170
Choose a penalty
for the members who lost.

931
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,230
- You may discuss.
- Let's discuss this.

932
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,680
(It's payback time for the guests.)

933
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,740
Wet tissue is better.

934
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,240
Let's take the annoying path.

935
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,510
They'll be at
the SBS Entertainment Awards,

936
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,590
so let's have them film themselves
getting ready for the event.

937
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,150
They'll be followed...

938
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,510
- from their homes.
- They'll be woken up too.

939
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,590
- Right.
- The staff will enter the house.

940
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,760
- And wake them up.
- They must be woken up too.

941
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,090
A camera will be set up.

942
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,260
- They'll hate it.
- Of course.

943
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,530
- From the day before.
- Must we go that far?

944
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,590
From the moment they go to sleep
the day before.

945
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,860
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

946
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,800
- Have you decided on a penalty?
- Yes, we have.

947
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,760
What kind of penalty
will the losing members receive?

948
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,400
(They carefully announce
the penalty they chose.)

949
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,800
You'll be at
the SBS Entertainment Awards soon.

950
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,110
I'm sure you all have been
nominated for awards.

951
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,670
Here's the penalty you'll receive.

952
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,340
The day before the event,

953
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,150
a camera will be set up
in your home.

954
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,970
- After you wake up...
- Not from the day before.

955
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,650
- No? Why not?
- You'll be followed.

956
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,220
Then start in the morning.
You'll go to the salon, right?

957
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,860
- From your house.
- From the moment you step outside.

958
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,590
- This is the worst.
- You'll leave the house...

959
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,590
and go to the salon.

960
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,090
- Look here.
- You'll get dolled up.

961
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,630
Not being regulars on the show
doesn't mean...

962
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,800
that you can make awful suggestions.

963
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,030
- Why not?
- It's the worst.

964
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,340
- Really?
- Hey.

965
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,590
I can promise you...

966
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,440
that this won't get more than
20 seconds of air time.

967
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,030
Just...

968
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,570
- decide on one we can do today.
- It's the worst.

969
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,880
Okay, fine.

970
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,070
- From the salon then.
- Sure.

971
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,900
- How's that?
- No, please don't.

972
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,150
The camera will
"fellow" you from the salon.

973
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,240
Fellow?

974
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,420
What do you mean by "fellow"?

975
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,840
- What was that?
- Fellow?

976
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,550
It'll be like a fellowship.

977
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,650
- Choose something we can do today.
- No way.

978
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,150
- It's our right to suggest this.
- Okay, fine.

979
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,320
Thank you for the fun idea.

980
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,030
(They will be followed around
on the day of the award ceremony.)

981
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,630
- Unbelievable.
- Here is your prize.

982
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,690
Of course.

983
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,590
- Is there a prize?
- It's my first time receiving one.

984
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,590
Do Kwon's getting a prize.

985
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,220
For a smooth transition
into the new year,

986
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,860
we have prepared body products.

987
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,070
A body wash.

988
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,360
And body lotion.

989
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,610
These will go to Young Ji,
Do Kwon, Jong Kook, and Se Chan.

990
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,010
(Young Ji, Se Chan, Do Kwon,
and Jong Kook receive the gift.)

991
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:30,340
- Lucky you.
- This is a first for me.

992
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,510
Look at Jong Kook smiling.

993
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,840
If only we took
three more minutes on the eggs.

994
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,970
- Yes, the eggs.
- I have the voting result.

995
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,220
A total of 31 votes were cast.

996
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,720
A total of 31 votes?

997
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,090
Here's the result.

998
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,820
- Being followed is the worst.
- Tell me about it.

999
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,920
Who will greet the fans more
on the day of...

1000
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,800
- the award ceremony?
- Oh, no.

1001
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,690
The one with 16 votes is...

1002
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,210
(Who came in 1st place
with 16 votes...)

1003
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,560
(and who came in 2nd and 3rd place?)

1004
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,980
Say that it's Jae Suk.

1005
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,060
It can't be me.

1006
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,390
The one with 16 votes is...

1007
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,960
(Who will receive the penalty?)

1008
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,460
(A week later)

1009
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,230
(December 18, on the day of
the SBS Entertainment Awards)

1010
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:18,980
(The three members
will receive their penalty.)

1011
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,440
(Which member
kicks it off at the salon?)

1012
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,750
Unbelievable.

1013
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,810
(Suk Jin enters.)

1014
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,640
I bet you're going to
follow me around all day.

1015
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,580
The one with 16 votes is Suk Jin.

1016
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,060
I can't believe this is happening.

1017
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,580
(That's why the camera
is already in his face.)

1018
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,750
As you know,

1019
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,790
I'm not one to get my makeup done
at a salon.

1020
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,060
It happens rarely.

1021
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,600
But since it's
an important day today...

1022
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,190
It's why I'm here
to get my makeup done.

1023
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:51,270
- I'll start with skincare products.
- I applied nothing today.

1024
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,710
(He's 100 percent bare-faced.)

1025
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,410
The last race's penalty...

1026
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,310
I'm curious though.

1027
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,540
Will the viewers...

1028
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,910
be interested in seeing me
get my makeup done?

1029
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,480
- I'm sure it will intrigue some.
- Really?

1030
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,160
I don't think they'll be interested.

1031
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,560
(The staff is taking a huge risk
since it could lower viewership.)

1032
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,390
- I doubt it.
- Really?

1033
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,430
- Running Man is a beloved show.
- Really?

1034
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,690
- You're not intrigued though.
- Of course I am.

1035
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,100
- I'll watch this part of the show.
- Really?

1036
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,770
The others receiving
this penalty are...

1037
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,730
(The others receiving
this penalty are...)

1038
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,460
It's us three.

1039
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,730
- Who intrigues you the most?
- In my case...

1040
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,410
(You...)

1041
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,580
(This is how they became
the number one salon.)

1042
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,810
Thank you for saying so.

1043
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,000
(This is how they became
the number one salon.)

1044
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,810
- Hello.
- Hi.

1045
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,080
(Another makeup artist enters.)

1046
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,140
We talked earlier...

1047
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,890
about the Running Man camera
following us.

1048
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,850
Who would you like to see the most?

1049
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,830
(Who would you
like to see the most?)

1050
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:43,890
Duly noted.

1051
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:44,890
(Duly noted.)

1052
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,060
I could tell from her silence
that she didn't mean me.

1053
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,500
You must not be good at lying.

1054
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,440
(The salon where another member is)

1055
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,000
How adorable.

1056
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,870
You look like a celebrity.

1057
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,210
Jeon So Min.

1058
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,500
(She received 8 votes out of 31.)

1059
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,000
Must the camera be this close?

1060
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:05,350
The director had to come to work
when it's his day off today.

1061
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,710
(The cameraman and director
have to work as well.)

1062
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,480
This is insane.

1063
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,980
I thought it'd be more like a Vlog.

1064
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,410
Here I am getting my hair dried.

1065
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,690
Don't I look awful?

1066
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,790
(The staff insists on filming
while she's getting her hair dried.)

1067
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,790
I bet I look awful.

1068
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,930
(The vicious production crew
even shoots her drying hair.)

1069
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,770
I haven't put on...
There's one over here too.

1070
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,830
(She protects her bare face.)

1071
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,540
I don't want to show this
to our viewers.

1072
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,080
How do I look on camera?

1073
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,250
It's not bad.

1074
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,180
I don't look ugly at all.

1075
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,040
(She finds her bare face
better than she thought.)

1076
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,250
Look over here.

1077
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,790
(She put up her poster
on the wall of a salon.)

1078
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,960
It's like before and after.

1079
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,750
Because I couldn't hide
my eggs well...

1080
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,060
(She got a penalty because of that.)

1081
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,500
I haven't watched this episode.

1082
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,020
It'll air tomorrow though.

1083
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,330
Do you watch our show every week?

1084
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,270
("Unanswered Questions")

1085
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,960
(Do Running Man members
watch the premiere of the show?)

1086
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,810
To be honest...

1087
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,870
I watched it every week
until three years ago.

1088
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,120
But now, I watch it through
the online streaming service.

1089
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,850
I watch the replay of it.

1090
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,410
Running Man is the number one show
on the online streaming service.

1091
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,730
Please watch it.

1092
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,190
(Trying to make it
sound nice instead)

1093
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,600
It's really nice to watch the show
while running on a treadmill.

1094
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,190
It helps the time go by quickly.

1095
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,270
It's the best.

1096
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,370
- Everyone, cardio...
- Then do you laugh...

1097
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,500
when you see yourself?

1098
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,890
I've laughed a lot
when I saw my parts.

1099
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,230
I laugh out loud
watching myself on it.

1100
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:41,210
I also laugh a lot
watching the guys.

1101
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,540
I don't laugh because
I find it funny...

1102
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,680
but because I'm proud to see myself
performing on the show.

1103
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,120
(She laughs because
she's proud of herself.)

1104
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,980
I've laughed a couple of times
because I was proud of myself...

1105
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,810
and I found myself cute.

1106
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,060
Because I was proud of myself.

1107
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,690
(The self-loving variety show star
finds herself cute and proud.)

1108
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,080
(Meanwhile, her poster
steals everyone's attention.)

1109
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,000
I should sign the poster,
but I couldn't.

1110
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,100
- I should sign it.
- You should do it today.

1111
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:07,640
Did you know? It's the poster
that the Running Man crew made.

1112
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,210
And I stole it.

1113
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:10,560
(She confesses her crime
while smiling brightly.)

1114
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,830
You remember, right?

1115
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,580
I brought my poster
to put it up on the wall here.

1116
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,140
You know the stickers
that the production crew makes?

1117
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,140
I love them so much.
They're very useful too.

1118
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,540
I take all of them with me.

1119
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,140
Remember the scratchcard
you guys made?

1120
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,710
I brought a bunch of them,
and people loved it.

1121
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,250
Actually, I also took
a couple of mission bags.

1122
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,350
There's a staff member
of our drama team...

1123
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,690
whose name is Jae Suk.

1124
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,230
When I brought him Yoo Jae Suk's
mission bag, he loved it.

1125
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,160
I love them so much.

1126
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,100
I wonder how you guys
can make them so creatively.

1127
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:45,870
(The last member
to receive the penalty)

1128
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:48,770
(Haha)

1129
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:49,810
He earned five votes.

1130
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,410
(The last member to receive
the penalty with 5 votes)

1131
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,810
Gosh, this is troublesome.

1132
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,520
I need to get changed,
so I'll be right back.

1133
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,960
I'm carrying out the penalty
of Running Man.

1134
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,830
And today, I'm attending
the 2021 SBS Entertainment Awards...

1135
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,960
where Suk Jin will be getting
the Grand Award.

1136
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,020
I'm at the salon to get ready.

1137
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,730
(There's regrettable news
we must share with the viewers.)

1138
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,460
(The Running Man members
sincerely wished...)

1139
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,080
(that Suk Jin would win
the Grand Award.)

1140
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,410
I'm actually looking forward to it.

1141
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:26,680
I really want Suk Jin
to win the Grand Award.

1142
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,480
I personally hope Suk Jin
will win the Grand Award.

1143
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,310
Kwang Soo called me.

1144
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,250
- Kwang Soo called.
- What did he say?

1145
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,690
"I think you'll win
the Grand Award tonight."

1146
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,870
And I told him that I don't think
I'll be winning it tonight.

1147
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:46,100
So he asked me
if I prepared an acceptance speech.

1148
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,940
I did prepare it though.

1149
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,060
And he laughed.

1150
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,680
(Even the makeup artist
burst into laughter.)

1151
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,080
You laugh a lot.

1152
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,540
I did prepare an acceptance speech.

1153
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,370
I think you'll really win it.

1154
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,640
- Me?
- Yes.

1155
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:01,580
- You can't lie, right?
- I can't.

1156
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,710
- Really?
- Yes.

1157
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:05,350
- Then can you foresee things?
- I have a good hunch.

1158
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,890
You do? Do you think
I'll win the Grand Award?

1159
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:07,960
Yes.

1160
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,690
He's gotten nervous.

1161
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,120
I'm so nervous.

1162
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,390
- I really have a good hunch.
- You do?

1163
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:15,750
What encourages me...

1164
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,870
are the viewers who root for me...

1165
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,540
on online forums.

1166
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,270
I'd be really grateful to win it,
but I'll be okay even if I don't.

1167
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,940
I'm going to look handsome soon.

1168
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,910
After the magical touch...

1169
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,410
I don't usually put this on,

1170
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:35,120
but they cover the empty spots
when I'm here.

1171
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,290
(After applying black hair powder,)

1172
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:42,080
(he's done with the makeup
for the award show.)

1173
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,750
Are you going to keep following me?

1174
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,160
You'll keep following me?

1175
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,960
There's nothing much to it.
I'm just leaving.

1176
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,270
Please make my hair look
cute yet sexy.

1177
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,160
(Transforming from little Haha...)

1178
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,680
(to cute yet sexy celebrity)

1179
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,250
What is this, a CCTV?
Why do you keep filming me?

1180
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,870
(Meanwhile, Actress Jeon
is getting transformed as well.)

1181
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,020
I look pretty now, right?

1182
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,290
(Thrusting herself)

1183
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,850
It won't focus.

1184
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,290
(Super overwhelming)

1185
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,890
I've become more confident.

1186
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,930
This part is a see-through.

1187
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,660
It's an off-shoulder black dress.

1188
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,210
I can say it suits me perfectly.
It's a really sexy dress.

1189
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,640
I think people will criticize me.

1190
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,210
Ever since I started
shooting the drama,

1191
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:35,770
I keep thinking that I'm sexy.

1192
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,440
Because of the drama...

1193
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,500
I'll get changed.

1194
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,580
(The pretentious actress
goes to get changed.)

1195
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:42,850
(She's done transforming.)

1196
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,190
I should wrap up.

1197
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,560
(Exuding the charisma
of an actress,)

1198
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,190
(she's transforming
into a sexy queen.)

1199
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,120
(The sexy queen is ready to go.)

1200
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,370
Do I look pretty?

1201
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,870
I thought it wouldn't be much
of a penalty...

1202
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,140
to have the camera follow me around.

1203
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,730
But it really is a penalty.

1204
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,270
I hear you'll be presenting
a special performance.

1205
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,770
Today, I'm performing
with Shin Hyo Bum,

1206
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,750
the forever diva. We'll be singing
a duet at the award show.

1207
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,750
We'll be singing a duet. My gosh.

1208
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,580
(He arrives first
with the pressure of performing.)

1209
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,390
Kwang Soo is calling me.

1210
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:28,830
Hey, Kwang Soo.

1211
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:30,290
- Suk Jin.
- Hey.

1212
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,870
You got ready really early.

1213
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:36,270
I'm singing
with an incredible singer today.

1214
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:37,810
Oh, really?

1215
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:40,440
(Laughing)

1216
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,940
I'm doing a celebratory performance
with an incredible singer.

1217
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:48,480
I'm so pressured
because I have to sing later.

1218
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,190
- Kwang Soo.
- Suk Jin.

1219
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:51,910
- I've been meaning to ask.
- Yes?

1220
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,750
Do you think I have a chance
to win the Grand Award?

1221
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:58,980
Didn't you say you'd get it
for sure when we talked earlier?

1222
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,520
(You said you'd get it for sure
when we talked earlier.)

1223
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,730
Hey.

1224
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,830
You told me what you'll say
and asked if it sounded okay.

1225
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,230
This guy... He's slandering me.

1226
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,600
Anyway, congratulations in advance.

1227
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,500
No, I won't be getting it.

1228
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,140
Anyway, I miss you.

1229
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,120
- Me too.
- Right.

1230
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,120
(Entering the waiting room
with excitement after the call)

1231
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,390
Hey, you're here.

1232
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,850
- Hello.
- Hello.

1233
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:26,620
She's my stylist.

1234
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,690
- The one who always...
- We're looking forward to it.

1235
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,290
puts me in shocking clothes.

1236
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,430
(What will he wear today?)

1237
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:33,660
Is this it?

1238
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,270
(It's an ordinary velvet tuxedo.)

1239
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,290
- It's pretty. It's velvet.
- Isn't it?

1240
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,140
- Is it dark blue?
- Gosh.

1241
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,370
- It's pretty.
- It's so cool.

1242
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:42,640
You think? What is this?

1243
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,330
I knew it wouldn't be ordinary.

1244
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,870
(Suk Jin's suit is extraordinary
even for an award show.)

1245
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:52,870
Goodness, this is...

1246
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,580
(He can't continue.)

1247
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,640
It'll make me look wealthy.

1248
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,710
It looks like gold.

1249
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,560
- I attached it myself.
- Oh, you did?

1250
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,960
I attached it myself.

1251
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,580
Today, I wanted to dress you nicely.

1252
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,660
Okay.

1253
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,520
Then does that mean you've been
dressing me ridiculously?

1254
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,100
She just blurted out the truth.

1255
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:11,120
That means the clothes she brought
so far weren't meant to be nice.

1256
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:14,140
You've been dressing me like that
on purpose.

1257
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,410
She said, "You should wear this.
You'll look really cool."

1258
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,810
It was all a lie.

1259
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:19,870
(While Suk Jin found out
that his stylist has been lying...)

1260
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,140
- Do I go up now?
- Yes.

1261
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,940
- Shall I go up now?
- Yes.

1262
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,180
Suk Jin is coming down.

1263
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,410
(He has a busy schedule ahead.)

1264
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:28,410
- Hello!
- Hello.

1265
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:34,580
(Hyo Bum finishes singing
the 1st verse.)

1266
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:39,730
(Here comes a senior singer.)

1267
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:45,460
(His appearance is supposed to be
a surprise for everyone.)

1268
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:49,390
(He fails to hold back
his laughter.)

1269
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:54,100
(It's his first time singing
on an award show...)

1270
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,210
(with a friend of his age.)

1271
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:02,020
(They show perfect chemistry
as they practiced a lot.)

1272
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:08,060
(Suk Jin sings
especially well tonight.)

1273
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,850
(Thumbs up)

1274
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,750
Give me a kiss.

1275
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,850
(The rehearsal was successful.)

1276
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,560
Suk Jin, your throat
is okay, right?

1277
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,160
- No, it's hoarse.
- Okay.

1278
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:24,100
(It's 2 hours before
Entertainment Awards starts.)

1279
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,230
Who is it?

1280
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,830
- Goodness.
- Hello, Suk Jin.

1281
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,770
(Suk Jin was waiting for the others
after getting changed.)

1282
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:31,100
It's obvious that you'll win
the Grand Award.

1283
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,250
You put a lot of effort
into your suit.

1284
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:34,680
That's not it.

1285
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:35,750
I hear you went to the salon at 1 p.m.

1286
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,290
- I had other works to do.
- I see.

1287
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,850
I'm doing so many things tonight.

1288
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,960
- Before I knew it...
- I'm certain.

1289
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,080
Of what?

1290
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,350
Why do you think they made you do
a lot of things?

1291
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:45,580
(Se Chan makes a fuss
as soon as he arrives.)

1292
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,730
That means you'll win for sure.

1293
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:48,660
- That's not true.
- No.

1294
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,600
Didn't they mention
that I was at the salon earlier?

1295
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,160
They did. They said you came at 1 p.m.

1296
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,500
And they said
you were really nervous.

1297
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,210
You were restless
while getting your makeup.

1298
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:01,600
(Laughing awkwardly)

1299
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,710
That's not true.

1300
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:04,370
- That's not it.
- Is that so?

1301
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:05,750
Didn't your wife say something?

1302
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:06,980
- My wife?
- Yes.

1303
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:09,020
She said I wouldn't win.

1304
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,020
Why not? You will.

1305
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,250
My wife is really rational.
She doesn't get swayed by others.

1306
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:15,690
She's always right.

1307
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:17,560
- And she doesn't think you'll win?
- She said this a few days ago.

1308
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,600
She said it's impossible for them...

1309
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,890
to give the Grand Award to our team
for three years in a row.

1310
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,290
- That's...
- Doesn't that sound convincing?

1311
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:28,270
That could be one of the reasons.
She's right.

1312
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,560
Jae Suk and Jong Kook won before.
Now it's you.

1313
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,870
So I'm actually at ease.

1314
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:35,770
But why are your legs shaking?

1315
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,370
You said you were at ease,
but your legs were shaking.

1316
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,350
They only get a bust shot.
If you didn't mention that...

1317
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:44,120
No, they're getting a full shot too.

1318
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,440
- Is that for a full shot?
- Yes.

1319
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,660
Push it up.

1320
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,190
(Push it up.)

1321
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:51,020
You can see how I feel from my legs.

1322
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:54,460
You're trembling. Gosh, seriously.

1323
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:58,160
I think no one else can beat you.
I'm certain that you'll win.

1324
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,370
Because there were so many articles
about it,

1325
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,710
I practiced...

1326
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,270
(So I practiced...)

1327
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,370
saying an acceptance speech at home.

1328
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,680
Oh, an acceptance speech
for the Grand Award?

1329
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:12,080
My wife went out to work out,
and I was alone at home.

1330
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,680
Where do you practice that?

1331
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,750
In the living room?
Or in your bedroom?

1332
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,850
I couldn't stand still,

1333
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,310
so I practiced it
while walking around.

1334
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,980
And I...

1335
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,830
You know
the typical acceptance speech.

1336
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:27,750
I mentioned my parents,
parents-in-law, family,

1337
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,230
- Your family.
- and the production crew.

1338
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:30,770
The production crew and the members.

1339
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:32,430
Then I mentioned the members.

1340
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:35,870
I mentioned Jae Suk and Jong Kook.

1341
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:38,060
- I'm not kidding when I say this.
- Did you get emotional?

1342
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,830
I didn't just get emotional.
I teared up.

1343
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,540
- Oh, really?
- I did.

1344
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,250
So I couldn't go on.
I was saying it all by myself.

1345
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,250
Then I...

1346
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,850
saw myself in the mirror...

1347
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,690
and thought,
"What on earth am I doing?"

1348
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,060
Imagine me saying the speech
all by myself.

1349
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,690
I was even wearing something shabby.

1350
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,690
- I get what you mean.
- Then I saw myself...

1351
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:00,620
in the mirror.

1352
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,660
- Gosh.
- Did you get choked up?

1353
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,560
I did.

1354
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,060
Because so many things
happened in the past 11 years.

1355
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,390
Of course.

1356
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:10,870
I could call them struggles
or hardships,

1357
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:12,870
but I could also say
that I was happy.

1358
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:16,140
We all shared it.

1359
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:17,370
I...

1360
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,370
How many of us are there?

1361
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,810
Come on, Suk Jin.

1362
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,640
What's wrong with you?

1363
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,410
- I was just joking.
- I thought so.

1364
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,210
- Haha is here.
- Hello!

1365
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,480
- Hey.
- You're here.

1366
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,660
- We've been talking.
- You're here.

1367
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,460
- Suk Jin.
- Hey, Jae Suk.

1368
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,460
- It's Jae Suk.
- Gosh, it scared me.

1369
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,430
- Jae Suk, you...
- Goodness, Jae Suk.

1370
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:37,160
Gosh, you punk.

1371
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,960
He's also one of the nominees
for the Grand Award.

1372
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,290
He is. He has always been
a nominee for the Grand Award.

1373
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:44,640
If Jae Suk wins the Grand Award,

1374
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,580
then Suk Jin can say his speech
in his place.

1375
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,940
You can say it in his place.

1376
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,440
And you'll cry for him.

1377
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,850
- You can cry for him.
- You'll cry for him.

1378
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:52,270
- I should accept it on his behalf?
- Yes, on behalf of him.

1379
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:55,870
"That's what Jae Suk said."

1380
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,810
- I hope you'll do that.
- If I cry,

1381
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:59,440
that'll make me look really lousy.

1382
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,850
And a headline will go,
"Suk Jin Cries out of Frustration."

1383
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:03,890
Goodness.

1384
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,430
But there's still a chance...

1385
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,620
that you can say the speech
you practiced if Jae Suk wins.

1386
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,730
The Grand Award isn't a big deal.

1387
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:13,560
It's not a big deal.

1388
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,500
Let's show our authentic selves...

1389
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,500
in the waiting room.

1390
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,310
You can make yourself at home.

1391
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:21,870
I know I'm a celebrity,

1392
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:23,440
- Have this.
- but I'm a human too.

1393
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,770
- I change my socks here too.
- Of course.

1394
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:28,180
I cut my toenails here too.

1395
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,440
I even pick my nose
with the hand that touched my feet.

1396
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:33,080
I fart a lot as well.

1397
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,850
He used to hang out
in the streets of Dongducheon.

1398
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:39,580
How could you say that?
In the streets of Dongducheon?

1399
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:41,850
There are so many people
from Dongducheon who watch this.

1400
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,870
He used to hang out in Itaewon
and Mapo. I'm only being frank.

1401
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,770
- What about you?
- Where did you use to hang out?

1402
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,770
Celebrities are no different.

1403
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:49,770
(Celebrities are no different.)

1404
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:52,140
Suk Jin,
imagine that this is a trophy.

1405
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:54,580
(A stinky sock trophy
that Haha just took off)

1406
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,580
Hold it.

1407
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,140
Although it may be smelly,
go ahead and rehearse.

1408
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:01,480
(Handing the trophy)

1409
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,810
(Bursting into laughter)

1410
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:05,810
This is so funny.

1411
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:07,060
(The spectators find it hilarious.)

1412
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,410
He's like a New Yorker.

1413
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:09,480
(The Grand Award nominee
is getting immersed.)

1414
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:12,250
Watching this alone chokes me up.

1415
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,960
(The tear-jerking acceptance speech
that he said to himself at home)

1416
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,120
I didn't know I'd win.
I came up the stage while eating.

1417
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,160
(I didn't know I'd win.
I came up the stage while eating.)

1418
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:20,560
It's American style.

1419
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,290
He's like a New Yorker.

1420
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:23,770
Here we go.

1421
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:27,940
You know how people say...

1422
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,870
that they don't dwell on awards?

1423
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,870
But after I got nominated,

1424
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,770
I realized it was all a lie.

1425
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,480
You should kiss your trophy.

1426
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,480
(You should kiss your trophy.)

1427
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,790
Kiss it like this.

1428
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:42,390
It's like a miracle for me.

1429
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:45,980
I've always wanted to do this
when I won an award.

1430
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,060
(Getting ready to kiss the trophy)

1431
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:53,870
(Mwah)

1432
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,660
(The nominee for the Grand Award
does anything to make us laugh.)

1433
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:58,060
- Thank you so much.
- He's amazing.

1434
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,480
I think I was given this award
on behalf of the Running Man team.

1435
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,940
Thank you!

1436
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:04,250
- He deserves the award.
- I got choked up.

1437
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,710
- Me too.
- My gosh.

1438
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:06,940
- Someone must be coming.
- I think So Min...

1439
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,180
will make a splendid entrance.

1440
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,540
I talked with her earlier
on the phone,

1441
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,910
and she said
she's really pretty today.

1442
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:12,940
She said she's
a cynical and haughty princess.

1443
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,210
Wait, she isn't. So Min.

1444
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,020
What are you doing?
Why are you acting so haughty?

1445
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,230
- Aren't we supposed to do this?
- We haven't even started.

1446
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:22,660
You can just walk normally.

1447
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:25,190
- She is acting cheeky.
- What's wrong with her?

1448
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:28,440
(Waving in the air)

1449
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:29,830
So Min.

1450
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:31,540
So Min, take a seat.

1451
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,710
(It looks like she's in love
with herself.)

1452
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,140
Should we make her pass out?

1453
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:37,140
- Why is she...
- What's up with you?

1454
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,480
Go away!

1455
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,580
There aren't many days
where I look this pretty.

1456
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,710
It was really traffic, wasn't it?

1457
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,020
- No, you look pretty every week.
- That's not true.

1458
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,040
You're pretty.

1459
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,390
You're always pretty. Take a seat.

1460
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:49,060
You look handsome today, Suk Jin.
You look extraordinary.

1461
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,390
- He looks different today, right?
- He does.

1462
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,660
- Haha is also...
- I know this is too much.

1463
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,460
wearing velvet.
Both are wearing velvet,

1464
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,560
but doesn't Suk Jin exude
the vibe of a Grand Award winner?

1465
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,430
Can you get grilled chicken skewers
in advance?

1466
00:55:58,430 --> 00:55:59,460
- Why?
- Why do you need them?

1467
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,190
He'd look weird
if he goes home empty-handed.

1468
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:02,270
(He'd look weird
if he goes home empty-handed.)

1469
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,560
(Haha wants Suk Jin to bring home
chicken skewers if he doesn't win.)

1470
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,770
- Chicken skewers?
- Or a sausage and rice cake skewer.

1471
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,500
That's original.

1472
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:11,480
Instead of a bouquet?

1473
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,680
At least get me plenty of skewers.

1474
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,540
How many times must I tell you?

1475
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:18,310
When you have
a long career like mine...

1476
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:19,940
No one asked you.

1477
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,060
- I heard him say this...
- No one asked you.

1478
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,560
so many times already.

1479
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,960
"When you have
a long career like mine..."

1480
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,930
You're the one who made
the most fuss through texts.

1481
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,330
"Suk Jin, you must prepare
an acceptance speech."

1482
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:34,100
"Call me Dong Hoon instead of Haha."

1483
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:36,160
- Hello, Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook.

1484
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,560
- You're here.
- You're here.

1485
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,560
Come on in.

1486
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,080
- You went to the salon.
- I did.

1487
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,830
I got dressed up at home.

1488
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:43,210
Ji Hyo.

1489
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:45,140
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

1490
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,770
- Look at her.
- Why are you wearing slippers?

1491
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:48,940
I can't wear heels.

1492
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,790
- Take a seat.
- Take a seat.

1493
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,040
We're all here?
It feels empty without Jae Suk.

1494
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,580
- He's here.
- It feels empty.

1495
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,580
- It does feel empty.
- I know.

1496
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,960
I talked with Jae Suk earlier,

1497
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,330
and it was his first time
to miss Entertainment Awards.

1498
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,430
- Of course it is.
- It's his first time?

1499
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:03,660
It is his first time.

1500
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,160
- It really feels empty.
- Right.

1501
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,660
At least it's consoling
because we have something...

1502
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,060
- to focus on.
- We're looking forward...

1503
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,270
- to Suk Jin's win.
- Right. He has a chance.

1504
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:13,370
That's true.

1505
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,680
- You look like a star today.
- Doesn't he look cool?

1506
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,940
- You're handsome.
- Ji Hyo.

1507
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,980
- It'll be funny if Jae Suk wins.
- You should hold it.

1508
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,250
(Stealing her mic)

1509
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:22,620
Gosh, seriously...

1510
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,620
That's Ji Hyo's mic.

1511
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:26,850
It's not yours.

1512
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,160
Everything seems to belong to you,
doesn't it?

1513
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,390
The trophy and the mic!

1514
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,290
I thought we were sharing it.

1515
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:33,790
Didn't Haha also win...

1516
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:34,830
the Top Excellence Award last year?

1517
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:35,850
- He did.
- He did.

1518
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:38,660
Haha did a lot of difficult works.

1519
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,890
He did.

1520
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,730
- For me...
- But this year,

1521
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:43,330
he worked too hard
on "How Do You Play?"

1522
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,540
- Right?
- He did.

1523
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:47,540
- Haha, are you really leaving?
- Jong Kook, what's even worse...

1524
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:50,580
is that Haha just posted something
about "How Do You Play?"...

1525
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:52,750
- on his Instagram.
- Oh, no!

1526
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,370
My gosh.

1527
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,540
- It's the day our album...
- He's seriously...

1528
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,940
- gets released.
- He came to Entertainment Awards...

1529
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,640
- as a member of Running Man.
- How could you do that?

1530
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,160
I told you,
the album is released today.

1531
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,560
- The album...
- That's really disappointing.

1532
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,660
Mi Joo and Jae Suk...

1533
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,480
Gosh, that jerk.

1534
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,960
(Gosh, that jerk.)

1535
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:09,290
He's eliminated
from the list of nominees.

1536
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:12,330
We should skip him.
He's not ready with his mindset.

1537
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:14,660
- Shall we try calling Jae Suk?
- He completely secluded himself.

1538
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,140
- Like the movie, "Oldboy."
- He's growing a mustache too?

1539
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:18,100
I was going to send him
fried dumplings.

1540
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:21,100
- Hey, Suk Jin.
- Hey, Jae Suk.

1541
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:22,370
- Where are you?
- Hey.

1542
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:24,180
We're all gathered here without you.

1543
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,710
- Jae Suk!
- Jae Suk!

1544
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,770
You guys...

1545
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:29,370
It feels empty without you.

1546
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,290
- Jae Suk, he's lying!
- It feels empty.

1547
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,560
He's only thinking about himself.

1548
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:35,460
He's...

1549
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,960
- I told this to Haha earlier.
- What did you tell him?

1550
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,690
I told him that there won't be...

1551
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:41,750
(There won't be...)

1552
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,120
a big twist.

1553
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,120
(There won't be a big twist.)

1554
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:46,560
A big twist?

1555
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,500
- Actually...
- I'm sure you'll win...

1556
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,060
You should join...

1557
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,660
"Same Life, Unlike Dreams"
next year with your wife.

1558
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,040
Right, you should.

1559
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,210
- Then you'll win the Grand Award.
- That'll be amazing.

1560
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:55,230
Then you'll win the Grand Award
for sure.

1561
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:56,270
He definitely will.

1562
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:57,370
Which show did you recommend to him?

1563
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,870
- "Same Life, Unlike Dreams."
- With his wife.

1564
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:02,270
But if he joins
"Same Life, Unlike Dreams,"

1565
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:05,020
it'll be very difficult
for him to win the Grand Award.

1566
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,310
- Why not?
- Because of his image.

1567
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,060
- Because of his image?
- His image.

1568
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,250
You'll be lying down the whole time.

1569
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,250
His image will be controversial.

1570
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,690
- This will guarantee him the award.
- Which one?

1571
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,930
You should join
"Invitation from Bachelor-agains."

1572
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,390
(Laughing awkwardly)

1573
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:19,020
- Then you'll win for sure.
- To win the Grand Award...

1574
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,060
- It'll guarantee you the award.
- That's a bit...

1575
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,960
It'll be too complicated.

1576
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,140
Joining "Same Life, Unlike Dreams"
is quite simple,

1577
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,080
"Invitation from Bachelor-agains"
is too complicated.

1578
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,480
It's nice to hear from Jae Suk.

1579
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,580
I miss him.

1580
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,580
All right, then.

1581
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:33,870
- See you.
- Bye!

1582
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:34,980
Good luck, everyone.

1583
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,180
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

1584
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:40,080
- Hello.
- Hello.

1585
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:42,660
(Placing Jae Suk's
life-sized cutout in the center)

1586
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,060
He's in the center.

1587
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,430
Of course, he should be
in the center.

1588
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,520
Put Jae Suk in the center.

1589
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:51,060
Here we go. Smile.

1590
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,520
In 1, 2, 3.

1591
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,160
- That's it.
- Let's take one more.

1592
00:59:56,830 --> 01:00:00,310
It's one minute
before the live show.

1593
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,940
Those who haven't taken their seats,

1594
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,980
please take your seats now.

1595
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:07,210
All right.

1596
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,410
Please take your seats.

1597
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:12,120
Look at Jae Suk. They tied him up.

1598
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,540
(Jae Suk is wrapped with tape
and forced to take a seat.)

1599
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:16,080
- You should sit here.
- The show is about to start.

1600
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:19,080
Everyone needs to be in their seats.

1601
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,000
(Suk Jin isn't at the table.)

1602
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,290
Please take a seat.

1603
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:23,660
Suk Jin is in the middle.

1604
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Suk Jin must be doing something.

1605
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,790
I know. He must be doing something
in the beginning.

1606
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,660
(Suk Jin is getting ready
to present the first award.)

1607
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,940
So what are we doing?

1608
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,580
I am not sure. Earlier, I heard...

1609
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,730
Suk Jin.

1610
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,000
What is the key point
of your fashion today?

1611
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:39,910
You can see it. It's the brooch.

1612
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,580
It looks nice.

1613
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,290
Fashion is all about confidence.

1614
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,140
I am not embarrassed at all.

1615
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:47,980
Do you want to wear it?

1616
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:49,250
Me?

1617
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:50,430
No, thank you.

1618
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:52,980
Let's go.

1619
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,330
(While Suk Jin talks about
his belief in fashion,)

1620
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:56,790
(the opening performance begins.)

1621
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:59,730
(aespa enters.)

1622
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:01,390
(Cheering)

1623
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,270
- aespa.
- Who are they?

1624
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:04,270
- aespa.
- aespa.

1625
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:05,310
This dance.

1626
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:07,140
They are cool.

1627
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:08,330
(They did the Digeut Dance often
on Running Man.)

1628
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:09,440
They are cool.

1629
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:13,080
(I know this song well!)

1630
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,140
(Perfect angle)

1631
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,790
(Last summer,
Young Ji taught them the dance.)

1632
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:22,890
Is this the only dance move?

1633
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:23,980
(Last summer,
Young Ji taught them the dance.)

1634
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:26,350
My arm doesn't twist like that.

1635
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,000
My arm doesn't twist like that.

1636
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:32,020
(Suk Jin mastered the Digeut Dance
as he lives young.)

1637
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,690
That's great.

1638
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:37,910
(The celebratory performance ends.)

1639
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:42,080
First comes the award...

1640
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,440
that will make your heart beat fast,

1641
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,910
the Best Rookie Award.

1642
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:49,040
The award will be presented
by the rising fashionista,

1643
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,210
Ji Suk Jin and the winner
of last year's Best Rookie Award,

1644
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,040
- Cha Eun Woo.
- The rising fashionista?

1645
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,460
You are a rookie
in the fashion scene.

1646
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,660
Cha Eun Woo.

1647
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:58,160
(The rising fashionista,
Ji Suk Jin)

1648
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,330
Gosh, he will do it with Eun Woo.

1649
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:04,120
(When Eun Woo waves,)

1650
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,190
(he waves as well.)

1651
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:08,770
They look very different.

1652
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:10,160
They look very different, Ji Hyo.

1653
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:13,060
- They look like a father and a son.
- I know.

1654
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:14,500
He looks like a father.

1655
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,640
All right.

1656
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:17,680
I was surprised
to hear them introduce me...

1657
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:19,600
as the rising fashionista.

1658
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,310
- As you know,
- He looks cool.

1659
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:26,520
Yoo Jae Suk always presented
this award.

1660
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:28,910
Unfortunately,

1661
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:31,290
he couldn't join us this year.

1662
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,060
He was quite disappointed as well.

1663
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:35,460
In any case,

1664
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,290
I hope he will get better soon.

1665
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,690
(After he is done,
he motions Eun Woo to talk.)

1666
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,190
Why do they look so awkward?

1667
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,770
They have no teamwork whatsoever.

1668
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:46,460
They aren't close at all.

1669
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,770
They have no teamwork whatsoever.

1670
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:50,330
You have been showing off
your fashion sense...

1671
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:53,140
on Running Man lately.

1672
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:54,580
- I can explain.
- Okay.

1673
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,310
That's an exaggeration.

1674
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,910
But my outfit did become
the talk of the town a few times.

1675
01:02:58,910 --> 01:03:00,120
That's right.

1676
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,690
(Chuckling)

1677
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,020
What was that awkward laugh?

1678
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,480
I feel very awkward.

1679
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,560
(The Running Man members' applause
saves the moment.)

1680
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,830
Let's keep going.

1681
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,330
Now,

1682
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:13,870
who will...
Who will win the Rookie Award?

1683
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:15,000
He stuttered.

1684
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,040
He stuttered once.

1685
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:19,560
- Jae Suk sent me a text.
- Okay.

1686
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,000
(Jae Suk was watching
the award ceremony at home.)

1687
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:24,540
He wrote that Suk Jin isn't good
with ad-libs.

1688
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:26,940
(Suk Jin isn't good with ad-libs.)

1689
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,480
(Everyone burst out laughing.)

1690
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,980
(His mind must be
on the Grand Award.)

1691
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:31,440
(There is no way he will win
the Grand Award.)

1692
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:33,410
(Jae Suk teases him in real-time.)

1693
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:34,560
That's so funny.

1694
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:36,520
Here comes the emperor of ad-libs.

1695
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,690
(The emperor of ad-libs returns.)

1696
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:38,960
Good work, Suk Jin.

1697
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,290
So Min.

1698
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:43,060
(Se Chan and So Min are
the next presenters.)

1699
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,060
(Despite being presenters,
they practice the dance.)

1700
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,960
- Then I go right.
- It has to be done fast.

1701
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:50,290
In any case,
I will go right after you.

1702
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,060
You are here
to present an award, right?

1703
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:53,730
No. I plan to use this opportunity
to become a star.

1704
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:56,680
This is our only chance
to get some screen time.

1705
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,980
That's why we need to do well.
Isn't that right?

1706
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:00,620
You need to charm everyone.

1707
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:01,750
Se Chan, this is your chance.

1708
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,480
This is a live broadcast...

1709
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,390
and many producers are watching.

1710
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:06,940
- Se Chan, you need to focus.
- Right now.

1711
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,660
- Would you give me a pen?
- Here you go.

1712
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:11,830
(He picks up a pen and works hard.)

1713
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:12,850
It's "Present", right?

1714
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:14,620
It's "Present," not "Pleasant."

1715
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,330
I am so nervous.

1716
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:18,270
Se Chan will be on the right...

1717
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,730
and So Min will be on the left.

1718
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:22,140
The next award will be presented
by the husband and wife...

1719
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,960
of Running Man,

1720
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,000
Yang Se Chan and Jeon So Min.

1721
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,540
(Now comes the performance
they worked hard on.)

1722
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:40,520
(Se Chan seems to be drunk
on his sexiness.)

1723
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,980
(So Min follows.)

1724
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:50,060
(They begin to compete
for screen time.)

1725
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,500
(They suddenly scold the camera.)

1726
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:58,210
(They begin to shake their hips.)

1727
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:02,370
What a grand entrance.
They don't disappoint.

1728
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,270
- Is that even allowed?
- I guess so.

1729
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:07,270
(The rebels of the award ceremony)

1730
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,750
I don't know what's going on.

1731
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:09,980
(For some reason,
this presenter is angry.)

1732
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,250
It's like a musical.

1733
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,120
(For some reason,
this presenter is angry.)

1734
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,290
(The husband goes wild.)

1735
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,160
Yang Se Chan is going wild.

1736
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:20,330
(The wife is the same.)

1737
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:23,560
It's nice to meet you.

1738
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,060
I am the man
who flirts for his gain,

1739
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,390
Yang Se Chan.

1740
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,290
Hello, I am the woman
who flirts for her gain,

1741
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:29,870
Jeon So Min.

1742
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:31,040
It's nice to meet you.

1743
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:36,080
We will briefly check
the teamwork of the couples...

1744
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,310
who were nominated...

1745
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:40,770
for the Best Couple Award.

1746
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,520
Jong Kook is well-known...

1747
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,440
- for Absolutely Game.
- It's a fun game.

1748
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,750
That was a long time ago.

1749
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,480
Would it be okay
if we ask a question?

1750
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,890
- Is it for Absolutely Game?
- Yes.

1751
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:49,890
Okay.

1752
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:51,830
You want to win
the Best Couple Award with Ji Hyo...

1753
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:55,020
more than you wanted to win
the Grand Award last year.

1754
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:58,060
Would you hold this?

1755
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,890
(He hands over the microphone
and covers her ears.)

1756
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,060
(My goodness.)

1757
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:04,310
My answer is the Grand Award.

1758
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,330
- That was romantic.
- "My answer is the Grand Award."

1759
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,480
He chose to be funny.

1760
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,980
(Kim Grand Award
reenacted the famous scene.)

1761
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,250
The winners...

1762
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:14,640
(The winners...)

1763
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,350
will be revealed soon.

1764
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:17,390
My goodness.

1765
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:20,410
(He succeeded to be flippant
on SBS Entertainment Awards.)

1766
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:22,480
My goodness.

1767
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:23,690
My goodness.

1768
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:25,890
(They finish presenting
the Best Couple Award.)

1769
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:27,830
Good job.

1770
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,620
He is so funny.

1771
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,020
(The presenters come back.)

1772
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,460
You did so well. It was so funny.

1773
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,690
It was funny.

1774
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:38,660
(Suk Jin gets called over again.)

1775
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:41,140
- He is busy today.
- I know.

1776
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,310
- He really is busy today.
- Good luck.

1777
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:43,810
Seriously.

1778
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:45,980
- Why does he have so many tasks?
- Seriously.

1779
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,640
He has so many tasks today.

1780
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:50,690
The next event...

1781
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:53,790
of 2021 SBS Entertainment Awards...

1782
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:56,580
is the celebratory performance.

1783
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,520
(Suk Jin showed up to work
earlier than anyone today.)

1784
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,750
(Will he be able to perform
without any mistakes?)

1785
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:08,330
("I Knew I Love" by Shin Hyo Bum
and Ji Suk Jin)

1786
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:15,830
(The members are already absorbed
in Hyo Bum's performance.)

1787
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,370
It's so cool.

1788
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:18,810
(It's so cool.)

1789
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:33,160
(They wave the flashlight
and wait for Suk Jin to come out.)

1790
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,660
I will turn on the flashlight.

1791
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:40,770
(Suk Jin enters.)

1792
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:46,440
(Suk Jin enters relaxedly
like a proper singer.)

1793
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:54,210
(Suk Jin's diehard fans get up.)

1794
01:07:55,850 --> 01:08:02,160
(He looks much happier
than he did as a presenter.)

1795
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:04,790
He is doing well.

1796
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:12,270
(It's rare to see him look
so cool and relaxed.)

1797
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:24,850
(This year as well,
Suk Jin didn't hold back.)

1798
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:26,980
(Despite his fragile body...)

1799
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:31,440
(and weak ad-libs,)

1800
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:36,060
(he made people laugh out loud.)

1801
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:41,390
(The production crew wants to work
with him until the end.)

1802
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:46,830
(He is the winner
of the Grand Award in our hearts!)

1803
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:50,540
(And everyone hoped...)

1804
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,410
Yang Se Chan.

1805
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:55,140
(that Se Chan would win
the Top Excellence Award.)

1806
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:57,640
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1807
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:05,750
I have been on Running Man...

1808
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:08,390
for a little over five years now.

1809
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:09,890
(He talked about the past 5 years.)

1810
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:12,580
For over four years...

1811
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:15,790
Well, it's not like
I have gotten a lot better.

1812
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,890
But for four years,
I struggled a lot.

1813
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:21,190
It was difficult for me.

1814
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,410
The Running Man family
cheered me on until the end...

1815
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:29,040
so that I wouldn't get intimidated.

1816
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,480
Suk Jin, Jong Kook,

1817
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,180
Haha, Ji Hyo,

1818
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:36,250
So Min, and Jae Suk
who must be watching at home.

1819
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:38,210
I will work harder next year.
Thank you.

1820
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:40,690
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1821
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:45,480
Se Chan, congratulations on winning
the Top Excellence Award.

1822
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,120
(They said goodbye to 2021
with a round of applause.)

1823
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,520
- This place is pretty.
- Hello.

1824
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,870
- Hello.
- Hello.

1825
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,120
- Jae Suk...
- Yes.

1826
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,290
used a self-test kit.

1827
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:58,140
Since the result was
a bit suspicious...

1828
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:00,100
- He received a proper test now.
- Yes.

1829
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,270
- The result isn't out yet.
- He is waiting for the result.

1830
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:03,810
That's why we are here by ourselves.

1831
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:05,250
- That's right.
- Isn't this the first time...

1832
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:06,980
we had an opening without Jae Suk?

1833
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:08,140
- It's the first time.
- That's not true.

1834
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:10,080
- Really?
- He was gone momentarily.

1835
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,250
- Really?
- He was gone momentarily,

1836
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:12,710
so we had an opening
by ourselves at a park.

1837
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:13,940
It was a complete mess.

1838
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:15,310
- Suk Jin.
- I remember that.

1839
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:18,790
(In Episode 97 which aired in 2012,
Jae Suk wasn't in the opening.)

1840
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:20,190
We are in Thailand.

1841
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:21,930
- Suk Jin.
- Running Man in Thailand!

1842
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:23,030
- It's 2012.
- Did you sleep well?

1843
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:24,730
People will think
that this is an old video.

1844
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:26,990
- We are in Thailand.
- Jae Suk, where are you?

1845
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,490
Things are getting frustrating.

1846
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:30,570
It was a complete mess.

1847
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:32,740
- Suk Jin, this is your chance.
- I remember that.

1848
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:34,530
- Suk Jin, you are the main host.
- This is Jae Suk's hardship.

1849
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:37,240
- I won't think of it as a chance.
- You are the main host.

1850
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,700
We need Jae Suk.

1851
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,780
- Go ahead and lead us.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1852
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:42,370
- We are in this together.
- Suk Jin might cry.

1853
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,540
This is our Running Man.

1854
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:47,490
- We are in this together.
- That sounds awkward.

1855
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:50,110
I am sorry, but raise your pitch
so that you sound cheerful.

1856
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:51,890
How much do you want me to raise it?

1857
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,620
Do you want me to shout?

1858
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:55,820
- Raise your pitch.
- Listen.

1859
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:57,490
- Your gestures are too much.
- Seriously.

1860
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:58,860
Just how much
do you want me to raise it?

1861
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:00,940
- You should raise your pitch.
- My throat will go hoarse.

1862
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:04,030
Viewers watch this show happily
on weekends.

1863
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:05,440
Use a cheerful tone.

1864
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:10,240
There is something we always do
when a new year comes around.

1865
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:14,240
You will have your fortunes read for fun.

1866
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:16,240
- I love it.
- It isn't for fun.

1867
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,820
It's shocking
when you hear something bad.

1868
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,250
- So Jong Kook wore pink last year.
- That's right.

1869
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,750
- That was the reason.
- Which color will it be this year?

1870
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:26,280
Today, we invited a fortune teller.

1871
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,360
- Gosh.
- I am excited.

1872
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,230
I am nervous.
I heard that he is very talented.

1873
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:32,320
- Seriously.
- He is well-known.

1874
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,270
The man who will do
the fortune-telling is...

1875
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,200
Oh Wang Geun.

1876
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,940
- Hello.
- Hello.

1877
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:41,180
He is handsome.

1878
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:42,500
- Hello.
- He is young.

1879
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,610
He is really young.

1880
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:45,000
- Please sit down.
- I am nervous.

1881
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,650
- Seriously.
- He is dressed casually.

1882
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:50,110
You know, you look very cute.

1883
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:51,610
- Really?
- He looks like a teddy bear.

1884
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:52,820
Is it okay to say that?

1885
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:54,040
- He is handsome.
- He is handsome.

1886
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,320
- He is handsome.
- Please sit down.

1887
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,650
- Please sit down.
- It looks like he studied abroad.

1888
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:59,430
Old man, sit down.

1889
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,650
- Please sit down.
- It looks like he studied abroad.

1890
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:02,950
He does.

1891
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:06,320
Do fortune tellers
read their own fortunes?

1892
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,530
Of course.

1893
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:08,830
- Really?
- How was your fortune?

1894
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:11,700
My three years of misfortune began,
so the result wasn't very good.

1895
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:16,240
When I pray often,
I can see what will happen.

1896
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,310
Beware of people.
Beware of accidents.

1897
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:22,280
Shouldn't everyone be aware
of people and accidents?

1898
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:25,540
But there are times
you get attacked for no reason.

1899
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,650
- You experienced it.
- You are right.

1900
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:29,710
You got attacked for no reason.

1901
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:31,990
- It was an unprompted attack.
- That's right.

1902
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:33,780
Sometimes, people throw rocks at you
for no reason.

1903
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,430
- Seriously.
- That happens due to bad luck.

1904
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:36,600
Seriously.

1905
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,200
You are a perfectionist.

1906
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,200
So you can't stand it
when people badmouth you.

1907
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,990
- I hate it.
- It makes you struggle.

1908
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:44,460
He hates getting criticized
for no reason.

1909
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,240
- Did he begin already?
- If there is a reason, it's okay.

1910
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:47,700
Did he begin already?

1911
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,000
- Now...
- All right.

1912
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

1913
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:53,000
I am struggling these days.

1914
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:56,410
- Ji Hyo has strong energy.
- I am excited about her fortune.

1915
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:57,910
- She has strong energy.
- No, I don't.

1916
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:59,280
I don't have strong energy, right?

1917
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,410
(How will be Ji Hyo's fortune
in 2022?)

1918
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:02,360
- Her energy isn't that strong.
- Really?

1919
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,690
- Her element is wood.
- Are you sure?

1920
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,820
- Isn't it strong?
- I don't have strong energy.

1921
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:09,860
You are like a flower that bloomed
in the middle of summer.

1922
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:11,100
- A flower?
- Yes.

1923
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:12,790
You are a beautiful flower,

1924
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:15,100
but there are too many knives
by your side.

1925
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,700
- Do they hurt her?
- Thus,

1926
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:19,570
these knives keep hurting the tree.

1927
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:22,140
So that makes you sensitive.

1928
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,400
- It's true.
- And...

1929
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,500
- you blame yourself a lot.
- It's true.

1930
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,780
Instead of blaming the others,
you think, "Why did I do that?"

1931
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,680
- She does that.
- "I am pathetic."

1932
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,520
You currently have low self-esteem.

1933
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:35,990
In 2020 and 2021,

1934
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:38,560
the tree almost broke.

1935
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,650
- Yes.
- You were very unlucky.

1936
01:13:40,690 --> 01:13:42,750
So you want
to change everything now.

1937
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:44,360
- Yes.
- You want to move too.

1938
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,490
That's why I got a haircut.

1939
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:48,790
- I wanted to change.
- Yes.

1940
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:50,900
But you don't need to worry.

1941
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,270
In 2022, good fortune will come.

1942
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,400
- Next year?
- Yes. It will begin in 2022.

1943
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,370
Next year will be good for you...

1944
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:02,070
because you will get a chance
to challenge yourself.

1945
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:04,450
- What do you mean?
- You will be asked to star in...

1946
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:07,190
a movie or a drama.

1947
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,390
I see a Netflix project.

1948
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:10,390
- Really?
- Yes.

1949
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:12,120
It will be a big and global project.

1950
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:15,530
People will applaud you
and acknowledge you.

1951
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:18,600
It will be a fruitful year.

1952
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:20,660
Will she meet a man?

1953
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:22,270
- A wedding?
- That's right.

1954
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,530
- A relationship.
- A wedding.

1955
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:26,200
Running Man members
will need to help her.

1956
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:29,530
She has really bad taste in men.

1957
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:31,610
- I think that's the case.
- She has really bad taste in men.

1958
01:14:31,610 --> 01:14:32,650
- Yes.
- It's true.

1959
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:33,810
- It's true.
- Seriously.

1960
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:38,240
Thus, she could get used
by a horrible man...

1961
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:40,410
who plays with a woman's heart.

1962
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:43,360
She used to date someone horrible.

1963
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,930
A man like that.

1964
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:45,990
(Glaring)

1965
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:49,100
But when you fall for someone,
you get blinded by love.

1966
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,290
You give everything to your love.

1967
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:53,200
- You are a romantic.
- Yes.

1968
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,030
You can't multi-task.

1969
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:57,030
- It's true.
- You can't do two things at once.

1970
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:58,740
If she has rice and soup,

1971
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:00,200
she can't eat them at the same time.

1972
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:03,140
- She puts the rice in the soup.
- So she eats the soup first.

1973
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:04,780
- She puts the rice in the soup.
- I thought, "Why does she do that?"

1974
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:07,480
"Why does she finish one
before the other?"

1975
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,540
She can't cross the road...

1976
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,150
- while chewing gum.
- She can't do that.

1977
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:11,780
She needs to swallow it first.

1978
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:13,890
- She needs to swallow it first.
- I don't know why she does that.

1979
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:15,890
- My goodness.
- She can only do one thing.

1980
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:17,890
- She can only do one thing.
- She can't multi-task.

1981
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:19,890
It's so strange.

1982
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:22,750
When you fall for a man,
you get blinded by love.

1983
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:23,790
Seriously.

1984
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:25,620
It can make your life
very difficult.

1985
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:29,030
So Min is a good judge of character.

1986
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:30,290
- I am a good judge of character.
- Yes.

1987
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:31,830
She is intuitive.

1988
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,240
- No way.
- I will judge the man for you.

1989
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,500
Her intuition is useless...

1990
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,070
when she finds a man for himself.

1991
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:39,480
- It's useless.
- She falls for bad men too.

1992
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:42,020
If So Min likes the man,
she will fall in love with him.

1993
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:44,180
It will be a complete mess.

1994
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,450
She shouldn't judge a man
for Ji Hyo.

1995
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:46,950
- It will be a complete mess.
- If that happens...

1996
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:49,210
"Ji Hyo, that man isn't for you."

1997
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:50,650
"Because I love him."

1998
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,890
- That won't do.
- She will fall in love with him.

1999
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:55,530
She will fall in love with him.

2000
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,070
- Okay.
- Okay.

2001
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:01,270
- Thank you.
- Thank you. That was fun.

2002
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:02,530
- Next.
- That was fun.

2003
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:03,700
- Who will go next?
- So Min.

2004
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,460
- This is fun.
- Good luck.

2005
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:06,570
- So Min.
- Hello.

2006
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:07,830
- This is fun.
- Good luck.

2007
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:09,070
- So Min is the type...
- Be careful.

2008
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:10,680
- to become absorbed.
- I like getting my fortune read.

2009
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:11,900
I like getting my fortune read.
It's fun.

2010
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,280
You like it, right?

2011
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:14,910
I bet you wanted to sit down
right away.

2012
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:16,870
(He begins to read
So Min's fortune.)

2013
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:18,740
So Min.

2014
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:19,910
(The fortune teller is serious.)

2015
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:21,360
So Min is nervous.

2016
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,450
I am nervous.

2017
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:23,750
So Min is nervous.

2018
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:24,820
(I am nervous.)

2019
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:27,890
I had my fortune read for this year,
but not next year.

2020
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:28,990
(What will happen to So Min
in 2022?)

2021
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:31,060
She believes in these things.

2022
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,400
- How old are you this year?
- I am 36 years old.

2023
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,490
- I see.
- In 2022, I will turn 37.

2024
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:38,640
You have spiritual power.

2025
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,740
- Me?
- Yes.

2026
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:40,900
(You have spiritual power.)

2027
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:42,180
- Me?
- Yes.

2028
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,310
She does, right?

2029
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:44,810
I see it in your eyes.

2030
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,980
You have spiritual power.
If you hadn't become an actor,

2031
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,650
you might have become a shaman.

2032
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:51,070
- A shaman?
- Yes.

2033
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:54,110
She might have become a shaman.
I am serious.

2034
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,250
But she is so bad
at reading people's minds.

2035
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,450
- She is so bad at it.
- She gets things wrong often.

2036
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:00,490
(To the members,
So Min is a clumsy woman.)

2037
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:02,620
- Do you get a sense of it?
- Of course.

2038
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:04,250
I see it in her eyes.

2039
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,460
How about me? I don't have it, do I?

2040
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:06,820
Be quiet.

2041
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:09,140
Had you had it,
he would have mentioned it.

2042
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,460
He is being selfish again.

2043
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,330
- I was curious.
- Everything is about him.

2044
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,700
The element
you were born with is gold.

2045
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:18,570
Since it's gold, you shine a lot.

2046
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:20,310
You are like a jewel
that is difficult to own.

2047
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:22,180
- A jewel...
- A jewel that is difficult to own.

2048
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:24,280
Is that the reason why...

2049
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,890
I can't have a boyfriend?

2050
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:27,710
That's one reason.
You have many charms.

2051
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:31,820
Sir, you are a good man.

2052
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:32,950
You have many charms.

2053
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:34,730
- You are saying many good things.
- You are quite sensitive.

2054
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:36,250
You don't behave that way here,

2055
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:38,230
but you whine a lot
when you have a boyfriend.

2056
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:39,790
It's true.

2057
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:42,270
She is the queen of whining.

2058
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,490
You are a bit like a baby.

2059
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:46,960
If your boyfriend
doesn't coddle you, troubles arise.

2060
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:52,480
If he is even a bit neglectful,
you become annoyed.

2061
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,910
Hey, he knows you inside out.

2062
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:58,280
- He is right.
- Have you dated her?

2063
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:01,560
Are you her ex-boyfriend?

2064
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,950
I got goosebumps.

2065
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:06,190
They might cry
while looking at each other.

2066
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,930
- That would be a twist.
- My goodness.

2067
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,990
Only a few people would know.

2068
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:12,230
- You get very lonely.
- You are right.

2069
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,620
I bet you tell other people,

2070
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:17,030
"I will focus on work.
I don't need a man."

2071
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:18,940
But you think to yourself,

2072
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:21,740
"When will I meet someone?
I want to be loved."

2073
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:24,440
Since you are very feminine,
you keep thinking that.

2074
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,110
He must have dated her.

2075
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:27,110
She says that all the time.

2076
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:28,350
Honey.

2077
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:30,370
Honey.

2078
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:32,020
(She suddenly calls him "Honey.")

2079
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:33,710
Then he goes, "Yes, So Min."

2080
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,780
- "Have you been well?"
- "Have you been well?"

2081
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:37,450
"How have you been?"

2082
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:39,390
You are a bit distracted.

2083
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:40,860
- That's right.
- It's a serious problem.

2084
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:43,930
You go around asking things
because you are nosy.

2085
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:47,120
Even if it's unrelated to you,
you have to know what's happening.

2086
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,640
- You have to know.
- It's true.

2087
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:52,160
Even if it's 12 a.m.,
you call people for information.

2088
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,310
You have to know.

2089
01:18:53,310 --> 01:18:54,440
You know her so well.

2090
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:56,140
- It's true.
- I can't believe it.

2091
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,400
He knows her inside out.

2092
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,650
You have to do it to find peace.

2093
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:01,370
- I can't sleep otherwise.
- That's right.

2094
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:02,370
(She can't sleep
when she wants to know something.)

2095
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:04,910
But you don't need to go
to that extent.

2096
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:08,580
This woman has a special ability.

2097
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:09,750
She does? Like how?

2098
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,650
- She can attach a spoon.
- On her forehead.

2099
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:15,200
(She has the title
of a human magnet.)

2100
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,100
This is quite unique.

2101
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:36,060
You have the ability to curse.

2102
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:37,900
(So Min has the ability to curse.)

2103
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:40,230
(Does So Min have
the ability to curse people?)

2104
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:43,160
That's what she told me.

2105
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,470
She says people she hates
always end up with bad luck.

2106
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:46,970
You have the ability to curse.

2107
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:50,110
Let's say there's a man
who betrayed you.

2108
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:53,040
So you curse him
and wish him bad luck.

2109
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,740
- That's what she does.
- Then it comes true.

2110
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:56,150
Hey... No, I mean...

2111
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:58,040
- Did you call him hey?
- Hey.

2112
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,320
So Min, what are you doing?

2113
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,320
- Call him sir.
- He's not your friend.

2114
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:03,360
I'm sorry. There were people...

2115
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:07,120
who betrayed me, and I hated them.

2116
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,260
None of them were successful.

2117
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:09,600
- Did they all have hard times?
- They all did.

2118
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,100
But the curse might
come back to you someday.

2119
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,600
- So you should be careful.
- Stop cursing people.

2120
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,360
That's the ability you have.

2121
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,360
Did you curse her?

2122
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,100
- What's wrong?
- Did you curse So Min?

2123
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,160
What's wrong, Ji Hyo?

2124
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:21,110
- He says it's okay.
- It's okay, Ji Hyo.

2125
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:22,730
- She's shocked.
- Hey, it's all right.

2126
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:23,980
- She's startled.
- It's okay.

2127
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:25,030
She's not mad.

2128
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:26,150
Forgive Ji Hyo.

2129
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:27,740
- I won't curse people anymore.
- Good.

2130
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:28,850
That's what you should do, So Min.

2131
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:30,570
So I'll stop cursing people.

2132
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:32,580
- Don't curse me.
- You want to do it even more now.

2133
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:34,280
So Min, don't hate us.

2134
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,150
Don't curse us.

2135
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,390
This is my ability.

2136
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:39,890
All right.

2137
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:41,390
- Please stop.
- Don't come to me.

2138
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:43,430
- No.
- She will do it even more.

2139
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:46,690
It turns out she's the one
with supernatural powers.

2140
01:20:46,690 --> 01:20:48,790
But I'm not a bad person.

2141
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:51,190
- Right. She's nice.
- She's good-hearted.

2142
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:52,470
Will my career go well?

2143
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:54,110
Yes. Things started...

2144
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:56,370
going well for your work this year.

2145
01:20:56,370 --> 01:20:58,110
You will keep getting good luck.

2146
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:00,280
- Things will get better over time.
- Congratulations.

2147
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,410
Now you should focus
on your work, not dating.

2148
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:03,410
What about dating?

2149
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:05,220
So Min cares more
about her love life.

2150
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:06,890
- Love always comes first.
- Does that mean...

2151
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:08,980
I won't have a boyfriend?

2152
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:12,650
In 2022 and 2023,
you will gain honor.

2153
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:15,260
Your acting ability will be
recognized by many people.

2154
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:18,490
But some flirting might...

2155
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:20,690
- tarnish your reputation.
- Oh, no.

2156
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:22,990
You might end up with someone
who could damage your reputation.

2157
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:27,140
So I'd like you to focus only
on your work for the next two years.

2158
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:29,330
Isn't it okay to flirt with Se Chan?

2159
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:31,230
I'm busy playing soccer.
Forget about it.

2160
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:33,350
I should play soccer.
I can't flirt with you.

2161
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:35,040
- Soccer...
- He can't date anyone now.

2162
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,280
- I'm busy.
- He should play soccer.

2163
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:39,580
Actually, that's what upsets me.

2164
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:41,320
It's not like...

2165
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:44,190
I'm not interested in him anyway.
But why doesn't he like me?

2166
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,320
- Does everyone have to like you?
- What are you talking about?

2167
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,580
The question is weird.

2168
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:49,120
Why would I like you
when you're not interested in me?

2169
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,790
You should be careful.
She might curse you.

2170
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:53,270
- Still, I want him to...
- I guess that's what motivates you.

2171
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:55,290
- Right. It motivates me.
- I knew it.

2172
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:56,770
- "Why isn't he falling for me?"
- Why won't he fall in love with me?

2173
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:58,730
I won't date him anyway. But why...

2174
01:21:58,730 --> 01:22:00,230
This is about your self-esteem.

2175
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:02,370
- But why do you even care?
- Isn't this strange?

2176
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,180
Do I have to fall for her
when she doesn't love me?

2177
01:22:04,370 --> 01:22:05,870
But Se Chan...

2178
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:07,780
likes young women.

2179
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:12,390
(But Se Chan likes young women.)

2180
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:15,150
Yes, that's true.

2181
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:17,110
- Jong Kook.
- That's right.

2182
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:18,980
- It's true.
- It is.

2183
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:19,980
My goodness.

2184
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:22,080
- He likes young women.
- You're unbelievable.

2185
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:24,290
- That's true.
- He doesn't like women his age.

2186
01:22:24,290 --> 01:22:26,620
- That's right.
- He can't play jokes...

2187
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:27,900
to women he likes.

2188
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:30,860
- He becomes serious.
- He looks very playful now,

2189
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:33,570
but he feels nervous
around someone he likes.

2190
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:36,230
I was shocked
when he said "young women."

2191
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:40,280
So she shouldn't date anyone
this year. She should focus on work.

2192
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:43,220
That's right. You will do
some TV commercials too.

2193
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:44,940
You will have good lucks
with documents.

2194
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:47,390
For celebrities, it means
TV commercials.

2195
01:22:47,390 --> 01:22:50,220
You will get to do TV commercials
and dramas you like.

2196
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:53,360
You will get to keep
signing documents.

2197
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,150
You'll be very busy.

2198
01:22:55,150 --> 01:22:57,120
Good. You should
focus on work this year.

2199
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,320
But what I want to do is kiss.

2200
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:00,690
What's wrong with her?

2201
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:02,770
- Instead of signing documents.
- What's with her?

2202
01:23:02,770 --> 01:23:04,070
Stop it and come back here.

2203
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:06,110
That was too short for me.

2204
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:08,830
I'm glad that
I'll be busy next year.

2205
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,370
All right.

2206
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:12,370
I'm curious about yours, Pouty Mouth.

2207
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:13,370
Okay.

2208
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:15,480
Let's talk about young women first.

2209
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,410
Let's start with that.

2210
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:18,740
Young women...

2211
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:20,520
Can you see that I like young women?

2212
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,480
Of course. You do like young women.

2213
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:26,080
You don't like women
who're relatively old.

2214
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,320
You're not interested in them.

2215
01:23:28,890 --> 01:23:30,360
He sees right through you.

2216
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:31,400
Really?

2217
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,530
This is crazy.

2218
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:35,530
- My gosh.
- You like women anyway.

2219
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:38,160
In the coming year,

2220
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:41,570
your sexual desire will increase.

2221
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:44,330
That means you're healthy.

2222
01:23:44,330 --> 01:23:47,040
- You're healthy.
- You're healthy.

2223
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,410
You should have
your hormone level checked.

2224
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:52,480
It also means
you will have good luck.

2225
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,780
Your sexual desire
increases with good luck.

2226
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,950
You might start exercising as well.

2227
01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:59,950
Don't waste your energy
and exercise with me.

2228
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:01,150
I guess I should play soccer.

2229
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:02,190
Play soccer with me.

2230
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:05,490
Se Chan, you're a comedian.

2231
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:08,120
You're a comedian, but you might get
a chance to do a legitimate drama.

2232
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,490
- He's a great actor.
- A legitimate drama?

2233
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:11,570
Yes. You might get a chance...

2234
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:13,330
to do a drama or a movie...

2235
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:14,570
- as an actor.
- You should do a movie.

2236
01:24:14,570 --> 01:24:15,610
- You should do it.
- Se Chan, do a movie.

2237
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:17,280
- So you should get ready.
- That sounds good.

2238
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,480
- Get ready?
- Yes. You should be ready.

2239
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:19,780
- You should learn acting.
- Practice acting.

2240
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:21,740
- So you can do a good job.
- Try to cry on cue.

2241
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:22,870
Sure.

2242
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,680
Try crying.

2243
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:28,280
Then you laugh all of a sudden.

2244
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,280
(He suddenly wails
just like a comedian.)

2245
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,260
(Now he's told to laugh
all of a sudden.)

2246
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:33,230
- Start laughing now.
- Laugh.

2247
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,580
- Laugh.
- You're laughing, but you're sad.

2248
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:38,150
(You're laughing, but you're sad.)

2249
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:39,990
Curse someone.

2250
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:41,320
(Curse)

2251
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,600
He's good.

2252
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:43,730
Something like this?

2253
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:44,940
You're good.

2254
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:47,310
Who do you live with now?

2255
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:49,680
I used to live with my brother,
but I live alone now.

2256
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,400
- I moved out.
- Where do you live?

2257
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:52,680
I moved to Yongsan.

2258
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,940
What? Why did you not tell me?

2259
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:56,180
(What? Why did you not tell me?)

2260
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:57,870
- Why did you not tell me?
- Why did you not tell her?

2261
01:24:57,870 --> 01:24:59,690
- Is that true?
- It's her neighborhood.

2262
01:24:59,690 --> 01:25:01,220
I moved on Wednesday.

2263
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:03,360
- But you...
- Right. He moved on Wednesday.

2264
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,520
- Last Wednesday.
- Why did you not tell me.

2265
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,580
That's why he couldn't
come to play soccer, right?

2266
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:07,950
Why did you not tell me about it?

2267
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:09,820
- He's not looking at her.
- Hey.

2268
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:12,230
- That's good.
- Is there a possibility that...

2269
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:13,490
- things will work out for them?
- Not at all.

2270
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:16,330
Actually, So Min has
feelings for Se Chan.

2271
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:17,600
- Me?
- Yes.

2272
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,310
- I don't.
- She has feelings for him.

2273
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:20,400
I guess she's just pretending.

2274
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,110
But Se Chan has...

2275
01:25:22,110 --> 01:25:24,940
someone else in his mind.

2276
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:26,980
(But Se Chan has
someone else in his mind.)

2277
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:29,370
Who is that wench?

2278
01:25:29,370 --> 01:25:31,280
(Who is that wench?)

2279
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:34,110
- Tell me.
- She will curse the woman.

2280
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:35,690
- Hey, does she live in Yongsan?
- You're scaring me.

2281
01:25:35,690 --> 01:25:37,220
- You said you weren't dating.
- Hey, does she live in Yongsan?

2282
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:38,580
You're scaring me.

2283
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:41,390
- Does she live in Yongsan?
- She will curse you.

2284
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:43,950
- I'm not interested in anyone.
- He moved to Yongsan.

2285
01:25:43,950 --> 01:25:46,070
- He didn't tell me.
- That's funny.

2286
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:47,790
What about investing in stocks?

2287
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:49,530
That's not good for Se Chan.

2288
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,790
What about coins?

2289
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:52,360
- I told you not to do it.
- It's...

2290
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:53,730
minus 70 percent now.

2291
01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:55,310
Minus 70 percent?

2292
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:56,830
It's minus 70 percent.

2293
01:25:56,830 --> 01:25:59,810
I'm about to be swept away.

2294
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:01,370
I have no money to invest.

2295
01:26:01,370 --> 01:26:03,370
I'm better than you.
It's minus 63 percent for me.

2296
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:04,680
(I'm better than you.
It's minus 63 percent for me.)

2297
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:07,410
- Why do you guys invest in stocks?
- Stocks.

2298
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:08,980
- I want to ask about stocks.
- I don't do that.

2299
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:11,820
Today's fortune reading is
different from what I had before.

2300
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:14,360
It's not that he reads what
he prepared. It's spontaneous.

2301
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:15,620
And it's detailed.

2302
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:17,760
He says things right on the spot.

2303
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,360
(The detailed fortune-reading...)

2304
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,600
(of the members continues.)

2305
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,640
Jong Kook,

2306
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:26,310
(When you first met Ji Hyo,
your heart fluttered.)

2307
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:30,230
(The shocking past is revealed.)

2308
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:32,870
(I'm not sure
if it's okay to say this.)

2309
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,780
(His secret is revealed as well.)

2310
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:40,480
(How things will go for the members
of Running Man next year?)

2311
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:44,890
(And one day...)

2312
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:50,690
(A man comes to a fortune-teller
after his self-quarantine period.)

2313
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,860
(Is this place...)

2314
01:26:55,030 --> 01:27:00,200
(Forehead Fortune-teller makes
her debut only for Jae Suk.)

2315
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:03,680
(Top Secret Revealed,
Forehead Fortune-teller)
