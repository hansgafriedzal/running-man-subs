18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,920
Isn't this Mabbaki?

to see the big-time client.)

20
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,030

Aren't you the girl who seeks
revenge in "Show Window"?

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,150
Hey.

26
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,470
You're supposed to carry him
on your back.

27
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,110
Oh, dear.

28
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,220
Hey.

29
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,310

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,060
I heard the cracking sound.

31
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,160
- Gosh.
- Does it hurt?

32
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,330
How does it stick?

33
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,860
Did you not hear
the sound of a breaking gourd?

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,060
- Hey.
- It was loud.

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,130

in the drama, "Show Window".

He's the best entertainer.

49

Welcome back.

66
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,990
I can tell...

67
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,990
that you got it.

68
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,430
Pardon? What did I get?

69
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,430
The booster shot.

70
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,400
- What?
- The booster shot.

71
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,660
- How did you know?
- My goodness.

72
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,660
(How did you know
that I got the booster shot?)

73
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,030
- I know everything.
- The booster shot?

74
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,060
- I know it.
- How did you know?

75
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,600
- How did you know that?
- And...

76
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,240
you had a chicken breast sandwich
when you were home.

77
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,070
- How did you know?
- How did you know? Is that true?

78
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,780
Well... Your family...

79
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,570
- who lives with you...
- She called me every other day.

80
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,570
(She called me every other day.)

81
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,810
It's impossible not to know.

82
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,410
How dare you say such things
about the fortune-teller?

83
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,490
- Hey.
- Hey.

84
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,560
You know what?

85
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,030
- So Min actually studied psychics.
- Right.

86
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,060
Back in college.

87
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,060
She's interested in stuff like that.

88
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,250
- She reads people's palms.
- So she sometimes...

89
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,790
reads our writers' palms.

90
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,970
You know that, right?

91
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,190
- I have superficial knowledge.
- She does it on the side.

92
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,340
She's amazing.

93
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,560
I'm not sure if I can say this.
It's fake.

94
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,060
- She's a fake.
- You look much better now.

95
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,410
- Pardon?
- You look great.

96
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,500
Yes. I'm doing well.

97
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,840
What have you been up to?

98
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,910
Did you just get some rest?

99
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,570
- I'll make it short.
- Okay.

100
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,250
I got up early in the morning.
At around 6:30 a.m. or 7 a.m.

101
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,620
That's when I woke up.

102
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,060
And I had some friends
who were in self-quarantine.

103
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,960
- Your quarantine colleagues.
- Your colleagues.

104
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,130
Colleagues.

105
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,220
Your colleagues you could talk to.

106
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,930
They were like,
"Jae Suk, what are you doing?"

107
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,900
"Jae Suk, are you up yet?"

108
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,790
"You got up early."
"How are you doing?"

109
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,340
"I'm doing fine.
I feel great today."

110
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,910
"Have a nice day."
"I'll talk to you later."

111
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,710
I talked to them like this
and had breakfast.

112
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,340
Then it was about nine o'clock.

113
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,600
I watched "AM Plaza" every morning.

114
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,810
(He watched "AM Plaza" at 9 a.m.)

115
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,070
I watched "AM Plaza" to see
who the guests on the show were.

116
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,940
Then Sae Ho called me
at around 9:40 a.m.

117
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,690
- He did?
- "Jae Suk, what are you doing?"

118
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,490
So I talked to him on the phone.

119
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,690
- At around ten, Bong Sun called me.
- Bong Sun.

120
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,720
And So Min called me at around 12 p.m.

121
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,350
- So Min did?
- She called me.

122
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,500
So until around four
in the afternoon...

123
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,760
You were busy.

124
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,970
- I was very busy.
- That was a tight schedule.

125
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,190
Seriously, I made a lot of calls.

126
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,470
So I got a hoarse throat
at around four.

127
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,680
That sounds very tiring.

128
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,110
You should take
good care of your throat.

129
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,200
Seriously, I got a hoarse throat.

130
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,620
And he got like four calls on
the line while I was talking to him.

131
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,050
I'm serious. I was shocked.

132
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,010
- I found this funny.
- Were they collect calls?

133
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,010
"What are you doing, Jae Suk?"

134
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,380
"Well, I'm alone in my room again."

135
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,860
He was alone in his room.

136
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,820
- Like the movie, "Oldboy".
- "Oldboy".

137
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,890
- That's hilarious.
- Kyung Eun left...

138
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,730
- some food...
- She left food?

139
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,060
in front of my room.

140
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,560
- You just reached out your hand?
- In disposable containers.

141
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,630
Then I put on plastic gloves...

142
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,940
and sprayed some sanitizer.

143
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,130
- My gosh. It must've been tough.
- It wasn't easy.

144
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,900
- My family went through a lot.
- I guess so.

145
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,070
Then tell us
why you're here to see me.

146
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,120
Right.

147
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,140
- Already?
- I bet something's bothering him.

148
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,210
We don't have time.

149
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,580
Oh, right. I watched
the SBS Entertainment Awards.

150
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,320
I was really heartbroken.

151
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,450
It's not just about
winning an award.

152
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,600
Without me, the atmosphere
there was a little...

153
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,800
- Because you weren't there...
- It didn't feel right.

154
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,390
It felt like something was missing.

155
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,560
I should've been there
talking and everything.

156
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,200
The most fun part of the awards
ceremony was texting you.

157
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,610
- Right. That's what he did.
- We kept exchanging texts.

158
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,330
I thought Jong Kook and Ji Hyo
would win the Best Couple Award.

159
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,140
- Me too.
- That's what I expected.

160
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,850
- We presented the award.
- Right.

161
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,880
If they kissed,
they would've won the award.

162
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,350
They have to do it this year.

163
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,580
And we also want to win
the award this year.

164
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,940
- We need to plan a strategy.
- We will...

165
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,580
try to win the award this year.

166
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,520
- Which one?
- The Best Couple Award.

167
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,990
- Really?
- We will win the Best Couple Award.

168
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,630
Then we will have to kiss on TV.

169
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,390
- Seriously.
- I need to think about it.

170
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,600
- We have no choice.
- She wants to kiss.

171
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,930
- Then we will definitely win.
- Are you really a fortune-teller?

172
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,500
You seem too superficial
to be a fortune-teller.

173
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,240
But I told you about that.
You two don't make a cute couple.

174
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,900
- You think?
- It's not like...

175
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,200
- I like all couples.
- Right.

176
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,610
I have my likes and dislikes.

177
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,810
I'm not interested
in couples whom I don't want.

178
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,980
- You're not interested at all.
- Who do you think I should be with?

179
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,980
- What?
- Who do you think I should be with?

180
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,980
What do you think you're doing now?

181
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,010
You're supposed
to read his fortunes.

182
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,140
- All right.
- Have some charisma.

183
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,510
- You should ask about his concerns.
- About So Min...

184
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,710
(So Min's drama,
"Show Window" made a big hit.)

185
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,630
So Min's drama,
"Show Window" made a big hit.

186
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,930
- That's true.
- I told you.

187
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,450
I knew this would happen. I said
Jae Suk would do all the talking.

188
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,190
She was right about that.

189
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,800
- Hey. You know what?
- He can talk for a whole week.

190
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I had nothing to do at home,
so I kept watching TV.

191
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,670
- Did you watch my drama?
- Sure. I watched "Show Window".

192
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,770
- So Min's acting was impressive.
- She's really good.

193
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,610
Right before you kissed
a guy in the storage,

194
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,500
- Song Yoon A found you.
- You watched it.

195
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,880
I was watching it with my
mother-in-law, so I rushed out.

196
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,120
(I was watching it with my
mother-in-law, so I rushed out.)

197
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,080
It's awkward to watch it alone
and to watch it with someone else.

198
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,310
You know what?

199
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,420
- It feels weird.
- I know.

200
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,990
It feels strange to watch it alone
and to watch it with someone else.

201
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,060
I can't watch it with my family.

202
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,730
Actually, I can't even
start watching it.

203
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,690
It feels like
I get caught doing something.

204
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,450
I feel somewhat guilty.

205
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,190
Oh, no.

206
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,390
I should watch it alone.

207
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,190
All right. What's your concern?

208
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,460
- Pardon?
- What's your concern?

209
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,960
The thing is,

210
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,130
I couldn't join you last week.

211
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,570
- So I didn't have my fortune read.
- Right.

212
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,250
Are you here
to have your fortune read?

213
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,400
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Yes.

214
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,570
- Born on August 14, 1972.
- Your nose is all sweaty.

215
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,010
She's nervous. So Min,

216
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,710
- don't be nervous.
- Just do what you want to do.

217
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,010
- Be yourself.
- What's wrong?

218
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,060
The thing is,

219
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,420
I can't be absorbed
in the fortune-teller character.

220
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,990
You don't have to do anything.
Just be yourself.

221
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,360
It doesn't matter.
Just do what you want to do.

222
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,630
- All right.
- She seems solemn.

223
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,320
- The Yoos of Gangneung.
- Yes.

224
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,960
Your show size is 270mm.

225
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,300
That's right.

226
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,600
- Well...
- Is this Naver?

227
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,830
Is this Namu Wiki?

228
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,500
Your father was born in 1943,
and your mother was born in 1947.

229
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,330
Your father and mine are
of the same age.

230
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,500
- Are they?
- The year of the Sheep.

231
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,680
- That's right.
- We should make them friends.

232
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,050
(We should make them friends.)

233
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,710
Your fathers will be friends.

234
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,510
My father is shy, so he doesn't
take up with just anyone.

235
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,120
My father is ENFP.

236
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,620
I bet my father is an I.

237
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,060
Jae Suk, you're ISFJ, right?

238
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,860
- We're an I.
- I'm ISFP.

239
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,460
You're ISFP. I guess you're...

240
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,760
- the curious artist type.
- We're the same.

241
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,240
- I'll read your fortune then.
- All right.

242
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,600
Jae Suk,

243
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,900
you were born with a weak fortune.

244
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,870
- I was?
- It's weak.

245
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,400
You weren't born under a lucky star.

246
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,610
But you've overcome your fate
with your relentless effort.

247
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,510
- You're timid and distrustful.
- That's right.

248
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,920
Is it his mind that's weak?

249
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,710
- Something else?
- Or is it something else?

250
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,790
- What is it that's weak?
- I bet it's my mind.

251
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,250
- My mind is weak.
- His mind is weak.

252
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,250
(Jae Suk is weak.
What is it that's weak then?)

253
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,430
And his lower body is weak too.

254
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,690
(And his lower body is weak too.)

255
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,200
So he's weak all over.

256
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,830
You just see through him.

257
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,100
There you go again.

258
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,200
- She's unbelievable.
- She sees through him.

259
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,000
- Hey.
- Forehead Fortune-teller

260
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Forehead Fortune-teller

261
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,670
What should I do to prove myself?

262
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,210
- Do you have anything to show?
- My goodness.

263
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,950
You can't show anything though.

264
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,510
You won't have more children.

265
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,670
- Not anymore?
- It's over.

266
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,680
Actually, that's what
Kyung Eun and I planned.

267
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,910
And those who were born
in the Year of the Rat...

268
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,990
will be caught in three years
of misfortune next year.

269
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,790
I think you drove away the bad luck
by catching COVID-19.

270
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,600
Your fortune changed for the better.

271
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,830
- Really?
- He overcame misfortune already?

272
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,500
- I did?
- So it's all over now.

273
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,970
He overcame it again
with his relentless effort?

274
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,570
Of course. And he is
destined to be a celebrity.

275
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,710
Your great fortune began last year.

276
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,300
- Me?
- Hey.

277
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,900
His great fortune started
20 years ago.

278
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,900
It's been a really long time.

279
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,140
- Will it be even greater?
- Jae Suk... Yes.

280
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,410
- Jae Suk maintains...
- Are you serious?

281
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,640
his great fortune
with his effort and hard work.

282
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,490
I guess that's what it is.

283
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,280
Next year, you will have trees.

284
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,680
They will make a big flame.

285
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,880
Trees mean work.

286
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,280
- Work?
- Yes. Trees mean work.

287
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,420
- Really?
- Jae Suk...

288
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,630
I'll have a lot of work to do
starting from January.

289
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,750
Are you starting a new show?

290
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,500
I'm starting something.

291
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,130
- That's unbelievable.
- That's what's happening.

292
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,840
And he's so lucky...

293
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,870
that he can break
the three years of misfortune.

294
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,300
Then it's not misfortune.

295
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,750
- So it's all about popularity.
- What?

296
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,800
We can't call it misfortune.

297
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,850
Will I break
the three years of misfortune?

298
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,040
He even changes his fate.

299
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,320
- I'll break off my misfortune.
- His lower body is weak,

300
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,540
- His lower body is weak.
- but he has this energy.

301
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,620
- He has a strong upper body.
- That's amazing.

302
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,490
- He has energy.
- He has a weak lower body...

303
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,920
and strong arms.
So he breaks off his misfortune.

304
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,200
I usually work out my upper body.

305
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,730
So he will break off his misfortune.

306
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,200
Since Jae Suk is perfect,

307
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,470
there are people
who want to disturb him.

308
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,430
- They are jealous of him.
- Are they his colleagues?

309
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,300
- His colleagues or strangers?
- That's possible.

310
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,740
- Someone in here?
- Someone in here?

311
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,380
(Who is jealous of Jae Suk...)

312
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,670
(when he can
even break off his bad luck?)

313
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,640
It might be an older comedian
who made his debut after you.

314
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,140
(An older comedian
who made his debut after Jae Suk)

315
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,950
There's Suk Jin.

316
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,010
Seok Sam?

317
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,410
- I'm not sure who it is.
- Myung Soo.

318
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,910
- Jun Ha.
- I don't know who it is.

319
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,150
- Myung Soo.
- You know what?

320
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,020
I know that Myung Soo talked
behind my back a few times.

321
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,750
- He does that even on TV.
- Right.

322
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,290
He does that even on TV.

323
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,290
He talked to a few producers
behind my back.

324
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,100
I actually heard about it.

325
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,000
- But it didn't bother you, did it?
- What?

326
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,130
- Not at all.
- Never.

327
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,530
I even called Myung Soo
and told him this.

328
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,110
"Why are you talking
behind my back?"

329
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,110
("Why are you talking
behind my back?")

330
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,580
- What did he say?
- "Who told you that?"

331
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,800
"Who said that?"

332
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,480
He asked, "Who said that?"
So I told him who it was.

333
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,590
"I heard this from him."

334
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,590
"That's true."

335
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,120
("That's true.")

336
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,960
He admitted that he talked
behind your back.

337
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,150
"That's true."

338
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,250
(Myung Soo was caught
feeling jealous of Jae Suk.)

339
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,380
You should be careful too.

340
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,860
I'm sorry. My apologies.

341
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,730
- Be careful.
- I did it only once.

342
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,230
Just be careful.

343
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,260
You two don't have good chemistry.

344
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,760
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

345
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,390
you two are like enemies.

346
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,400
- We are?
- Yes.

347
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,570
- The fate of these two?
- Yes.

348
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,760
- But we overcame it.
- Haha is...

349
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,710
I talked about this before.

350
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,170
He, of all people,

351
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,110
will always be there for me
no matter what.

352
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,120
- Of course.
- For my whole life.

353
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,380
- I will.
- Until he dies.

354
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,910
I can guarantee
that he's a loyal friend.

355
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,990
Thank you.

356
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,880
Your great fortune has begun.

357
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,990
I'm not sure if it's okay
to say this, but Haha is...

358
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,380
like a fetus in my belly.

359
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,630
(Haha is like a fetus in my belly.)

360
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,100
How many months pregnant are you?

361
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,230
When is your baby due?

362
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,830
Suk Jin is a toddler.

363
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,100
Yes. I hold his hand.

364
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,760
- But Haha is still in your belly.
- I wipe his nose.

365
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,390
That's right. He's in my belly.

366
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,030
I'm not even fertilized yet.

367
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,130
- You're not fertilized?
- I want to be fertilized.

368
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,930
I want to be fertilized
after Haha is born.

369
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,250
I'm not fertilized yet.

370
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,610
You found a new agency last year.

371
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,480
- What?
- That's unbelievable.

372
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,450
It's been over six months.

373
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,350
How did you know that?

374
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,010
You had movement
in your fortune last year,

375
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,910
- and it's the same for this year.
- Again?

376
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,630
I guess you're planning to move.

377
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,860
- Is that right?
- True.

378
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,920
Seriously?

379
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,200
- Yes.
- That's what your fortune says.

380
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,230
- Transfer?
- The thing is,

381
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,630
your new place will...

382
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,870
Hang on.

383
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,870
It's not like
I don't believe in you,

384
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,890
but this is
what I told you on the phone.

385
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Excuse me.

386
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,160
Are you a journalist or what?

387
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,210
Well...

388
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,900
You can't just repeat what he said.

389
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,450
- What are you doing?
- You need something new.

390
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,380
I said Jae Suk has
the fate of a weak fire.

391
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,350
- You should avoid black clothes.
- I should?

392
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,350
- Black has the energy of water.
- He doesn't wear black.

393
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,860
You should avoid black
for your underwear or house.

394
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,550
- I rarely wear black.
- Right.

395
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,650
- Red is good for you.
- Why?

396
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,890
And yellow which symbolizes wealth.

397
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,020
- Yellow is good for you.
- I like yellow.

398
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,390
- He likes green and yellow.
- So I...

399
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,030
bought a yellow cardigan before.

400
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,130
You should wear
yellow underwear too.

401
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,030
But I don't wear underwear
in primary colors.

402
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,610
Why are you swinging the fan?

403
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,400
- Why would you do that?
- Excuse me.

404
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,580
- Ma'am.
- Excuse me.

405
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,640
- It's...
- It might upset him.

406
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,140
- When you choose your underwear...
- Don't point it at me.

407
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,450
- Your underwear...
- Stop it.

408
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,320
You should wear underwear
and socks in those colors.

409
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,750
It will give you good energy.

410
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,090
But I don't wear yellow underwear.

411
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,090
Do men wear
skin-colored underwear too?

412
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,380
I...

413
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,630
- Do you?
- Yes.

414
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,830
- I wear all kinds of colors.
- Why?

415
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,130
- Skin colors?
- I love underwear.

416
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,870
Do you wear thongs too?

417
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,100
- A thong.
- Some men wear a thong.

418
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,290
A thong? I don't wear it.

419
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,570
- He can't wear it.
- Even out of curiosity?

420
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,630
I once bought it though.

421
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,370
Some wear a thong...

422
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,380
- not to show their underpants.
- Some guys do.

423
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,240
I can't wear it though.

424
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,710
It would feel like
sitting on a tightrope all day.

425
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,980
(It would feel like
sitting on a tightrope all day.)

426
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,750
I mean, all day...

427
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,250
It would feel like...

428
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,910
sitting dangerously on a tightrope.

429
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,220
It would feel like
someone is poking me like this.

430
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,630
I would be shaky all day.

431
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,680
- Sitting on a tightrope?
- Yes. Sitting on a tightrope.

432
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,830
I don't like it.

433
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,570
This year, you will be a good match
with certain Chinese zodiac signs.

434
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,790
- Like what?
- Certain Chinese zodiac signs.

435
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,030
Jae Suk will be...

436
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,930
(Thinking carefully)

437
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,110
The Year of the Tiger.

438
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,580
(The Year of the Tiger)

439
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,670
- Tiger?
- And the Year of the Ox.

440
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,140
We were born
in the Year of the Tiger.

441
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,140
- We're Tigers.
- The Tiger and Ox go well with you.

442
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,120
- Tiger and...
- It's the Year of the Black Tiger.

443
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,140
This is the Year of the Black Tiger.

444
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,250
We are Black Tigers.

445
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,880
Growl!

446
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
Go away.

447
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,320
I mean, those who
will be born this year.

448
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,910
- This year?
- The newborn babies of this year.

449
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,250
- Tigers have different colors?
- What are you doing?

450
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,920
You guys are not the Black Tigers.

451
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,200
The coming year will be
the Year of the Black Tiger.

452
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,290
- You fool.
- The year 2022.

453
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,790
- I didn't know.
- The year 2022.

454
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,000
Watch your words.

455
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,530
This year,

456
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,430
Jae Suk,

457
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,130
you will meet someone important.
If you are nice to the person,

458
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,530
- you will make it big.
- Who is it?

459
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,710
Who is it?

460
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,130
Well...

461
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,670
The name has an "S" in it.

462
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,980
An "S"? Like So Min,
Se Chan, or Suk Jin.

463
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,540
And...

464
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,040
(And...)

465
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,540
Let me see.

466
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,850
- Yong...
- Yong?

467
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,910
Yong?

468
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,490
The person lives...

469
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,490
in Yongsan.

470
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,420
- You live in Yongsan.
- And you too.

471
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,330
Look at her.

472
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,100
She's a fraud.

473
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,600
Just get up.

474
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,890
You shouldn't listen to her.

475
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,600
- You're a fraud.
- We should kick her out.

476
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,430
- You're a fake.
- You...

477
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,030
- You don't have to pay.
- When I talked...

478
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,770
to So Min on the phone,
she was upset with you.

479
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,270
Because you moved to Yongsan,

480
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,540
- but you didn't even tell her.
- He didn't tell me.

481
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,170
- The thing is...
- I was really upset.

482
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,120
I'm not done moving my stuff.

483
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,270
But you know what?

484
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,910
There's a misunderstanding.
Some people think...

485
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,550
I like Se Chan.

486
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,650
Of course I do.

487
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,050
But it's not like
I have feelings for him.

488
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,780
- Of course not.
- Let me make things clear.

489
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,830
It's not like So Min
has feelings for Se Chan.

490
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,360
She just thinks he's a nice guy.

491
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,870
If Se Chan expresses his affection
and asks her out,

492
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,070
she's willing to go out with him.

493
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,630
- That's it.
- There's a possibility.

494
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,970
Right. It's possible.

495
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,660
"What are you doing on Sunday?"

496
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,530
- Right.
- Something like this.

497
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,110
- "Do you want to go for a walk?"
- Right.

498
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,480
("What are you doing?
Do you want to go for a walk?")

499
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,670
If you do that...

500
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,010
for about a couple of months,

501
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,590
So Min will think
about going out with you.

502
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,820
"Do you want to have some
gimbap at a convenience store?"

503
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,910
Something like that.

504
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,460
That sounds sentimental.

505
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,420
I have a lot of...

506
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,230
fellow comedians around me
including Se Chan.

507
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,970
So Min is a nice person.

508
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,570
So some of them could've asked me
about So Min.

509
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,500
- But...
- He means...

510
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,610
- But no one asked me about her.
- Me, Chang Hee,

511
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,670
Sae Ho, Se Hyeong, Byung Jae...

512
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,950
No one asks me about her.

513
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,380
That's surprising.

514
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,770
It really is.

515
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,910
The guys you mentioned
aren't my type. I don't like them.

516
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,540
- Sae Ho and Chang Hee...
- That's good.

517
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,510
Sae Ho doesn't like her either.

518
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,550
- I don't like him.
- I once thought...

519
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,550
about setting up So Min with Sae Ho.

520
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,330
I was going to set them up together.

521
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,290
Honestly, I was
surprised to see Sae Ho.

522
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,960
I've never seen him have
such a serious look on his face.

523
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,520
Sae Ho seemed so serious.

524
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,630
- But...
- He lost some weight.

525
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,900
I know a guy
who does leather crafting.

526
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,040
- A three-generation business.
- Leather crafting?

527
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,810
- That sounds great.
- Is he single?

528
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,810
He's single.

529
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,880
Is he single?

530
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,940
He's single.

531
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,440
Of course he is.

532
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,210
- It's like...
- He has to be single.

533
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,590
- I mean...
- That's because of the drama.

534
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,880
- It's the drama.
- I see.

535
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,180
She's like that
because of her drama.

536
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,410
I'm sensitive about it.

537
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,920
That's what I've been
seeing and hearing lately.

538
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,490
You feel like it can happen to you.

539
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,830
Anyway...

540
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,830
Please make a conclusion.

541
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,130
- Right.
- A conclusion?

542
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,570
A conclusion of what?

543
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,540
Why don't you read his palm?

544
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,270
This is what I learned in college.
Your left palm shows...

545
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,230
the destiny that you were born with.

546
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,340
And the right one shows
what you have carved.

547
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,940
So I should compare them.

548
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,110
Jae Suk, you are...

549
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,380
- You have to compare the two.
- You were very sensitive.

550
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,440
He was born sensitive.

551
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,380
- But he's become not sensitive.
- He changed.

552
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,380
- Seriously?
- He tried to change himself.

553
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,560
Clench your fist.

554
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,680
- Does she want to see the bumps?
- Yes.

555
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,180
Hey, this is...

556
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,360
- This is what little kids do.
- I did it when I was little.

557
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,390
This is what
elementary school kids do.

558
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,890
No. I can tell how many
sons and daughters you have.

559
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,220
- Seriously?
- This is what little kids do.

560
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,840
Clench your fist.

561
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,370
- This is for little kids.
- Right. A son and a daughter.

562
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,310
- That's right.
- A son and a daughter.

563
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,430
- That's ridiculous.
- And...

564
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,780
you have good luck with money.

565
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,780
- This is interesting.
- What?

566
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,470
You have the lines
that popular people have.

567
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,670
- Really?
- I know what it is.

568
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,670
Those who have
two separate lines here...

569
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,940
are very popular
with the opposite sex.

570
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,260
He was asked out a lot
after he became famous.

571
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,530
No one asked him out
before he became famous?

572
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,590
Of course not.

573
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,830
So it's all about popularity.

574
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,130
Hey.

575
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,420
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

576
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,270
- How dare you...
- I'm serious.

577
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,960
A lot of people around me...

578
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,690
- liked him a lot.
- He was very popular.

579
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,400
There weren't a lot of people
who asked me out.

580
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,840
There were a lot. I know that.

581
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,170
They just had a secret crush on you.

582
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,550
- Really?
- That's probably the case for me.

583
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,400
- Who?
- Me.

584
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,940
People don't talk about it,
but they have a crush on me.

585
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,170
- On you?
- Yes.

586
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,180
No. He seemed very serious.

587
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,950
Can you have Sae Ho on our show?

588
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,480
We should invite him over.

589
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,680
I'm serious.

590
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,950
The fortune-teller opens up easily.

591
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,630
She talks about herself a lot.

592
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,030
- I...
- She's humane.

593
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,160
- She's humane.
- She is tender-hearted.

594
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
She's easily hurt.

595
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,800
She's not strong-minded at all.

596
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,370
I'm tender-hearted.

597
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,870
- I know.
- I'm soft-hearted.

598
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,610
- What about me?
- You?

599
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,110
Let me take a look.

600
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,430
- Why would you have yours read?
- I'm curious.

601
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,610
Haha is a very sensitive person.

602
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,200
- Why? I wasn't sensitive before.
- You're such a sensitive person.

603
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,400
You've always been sensitive.

604
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,620
- Was I born this way?
- Yes.

605
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,350
- My parents fought very often.
- My, you'll meet so many women.

606
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,790
- Did you hear what she said?
- He was born to meet many women.

607
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,350
- She said you were born that way.
- He was born to meet many women.

608
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,640
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not lying.

609
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,650
- Get lost. Just get out of here.
- Listen.

610
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,290
- Just get out of here.
- You were meant to be a flirt.

611
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,420
- I'm happily married. Leave now.
- Let me explain.

612
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,130
- That's not what I meant.
- My gosh.

613
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,990
- I guess he hasn't changed.
- I said to leave.

614
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,960
- That's not what I meant.
- Stop it.

615
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,220
Anyway, I'm so happy.

616
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,390
I felt this way yesterday as well.

617
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,340
- It's so good to be on set again.
- It's fun, right?

618
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,730
This is where I belong.

619
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,960
- That's right.
- Of course.

620
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,130
I felt like a prisoner.

621
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,310
- We waited so long.
- It's so true.

622
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,580
- And honestly,
- Yes.

623
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,310
it feels as if the entrance
has changed.

624
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,850
- What do you mean by that?
- You feel like you should leave?

625
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,080
Exactly. I feel like I'm the guest.

626
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,980
"Goodbye."

627
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,820
- But still, Ms. Fortune-teller,
- Wait.

628
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
you should tell him the conclusion.

629
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,760
- Please tell me the conclusion.
- Right. Ouch.

630
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,560
I'll tell you the conclusion.
All right.

631
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,450
You seem so distracted somehow.

632
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,990
- She's all over the place.
- Now, here's the conclusion.

633
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,660
Jae Suk, reading your fortune...

634
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,300
- made me realize this.
- What is it?

635
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,490
Jae Suk, the pillar of Running Man,

636
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,460
is meant to have good luck
this year.

637
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,780
And that means that 2022 will be
a great year for Running Man.

638
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,810
For the sake of Running Man
that relies greatly on Jae Suk,

639
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,550
I pray...

640
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,380
Long live, Jae Suk!

641
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,280
- Thank you!
- Forehead Fortune-teller!

642
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,440
Thank you!

643
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,680
(Has Jae Suk's worry been solved?)

644
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,480
(The fortune-teller gets
the most excited when she's dancing.)

645
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,130
(Forehead Fortune-teller solved...)

646
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,540
(the pillar of Running Man
Jae Suk's worry.)

647
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,660
Let's go!

648
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,610
- Forehead Fortune-teller
- Forehead Fortune-teller

649
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,540
(The fortune-teller was reported
for unlicensed practice right away.)

650
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,730
- That was good.
- Princess Aurora!

651
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,740
Jae Suk, I missed you.

652
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,970
This is not good enough.

653
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,320
- Today,
- Yes.

654
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,140
we're shooting the first episode
of 2022.

655
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,640
Now that Jae Suk had
his fortune read as well,

656
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,180
every member has had
their fortune read.

657
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,530
Okay.

658
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,480
(Last week, the cast members had
their fortune read.)

659
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,920
(Haha will have good luck
from 2022.)

660
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,770
(Haha will become extremely focused
this year.)

661
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:34,310
(It's good for entertainers
as they need acting abilities.)

662
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,400
It happens in 2022.

663
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,110
(Next up was Suk Jin.)

664
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,240
(He's like a piece of gold
that's frozen.)

665
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,350
(But his wife is there for him,
melting the frozen gold.)

666
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,590
(Without his wife,)

667
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,680
(he would've been arrested
while running a business.)

668
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,790
(Suk Jin will be very lucky
in 2022.)

669
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:59,130
(The general on the battlefield
finally found his horse and sword.)

670
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,030
(On the contrary, Jong Kook...)

671
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,630
(You were lucky until 2021.)

672
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,540
But unfortunately, in 2022...

673
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,370
(Jong Kook won't be as lucky as
he was in 2021.)

674
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,970
(Since you won't be so lucky,)

675
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,840
(you'll become very short-tempered.)

676
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,350
(I'll be good to you, Jong Kook.)

677
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,240
(He'll get a new business offer
in the new year.)

678
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,980
(But starting a new business won't
be good for him.)

679
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,820
(It might ruin the reputation
he's been building.)

680
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,830
All seven of you had
your fortune read.

681
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,090
So you should pay for the service.

682
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,190
The total fee for all 7 of you is
7,000 dollars.

683
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,300
- Seven thousand dollars?
- What? Are you serious?

684
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,330
- That's too expensive.
- I think that's too expensive.

685
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,570
We prepared today's race
to start the new year off right.

686
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,460
It's Pay Fortune-teller's Fee Race.

687
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,580
You have to pay the fee by 3 p.m.

688
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,780
You will work together
to make money...

689
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,580
and pay the fee by 3 p.m.

690
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,670
If you pay the full amount,

691
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,910
none of you will get a penalty.

692
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,050
- Oh, my.
- That's good.

693
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,050
- Let's work together.
- We've got this.

694
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,120
- Let's work together.
- Of course.

695
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
- We can do this.
- Let's work it out.

696
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,120
- We've got this.
- We can pay it all.

697
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,290
- We can do anything together.
- Absolutely.

698
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,560
The less you pay,
the more of you will get a penalty.

699
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,790
- Okay.
- Got it.

700
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,100
There are several ways
to pay the fee.

701
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,270
In the place upstairs
you will go to later,

702
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,960
you can complete a mission
or finish labor tasks.

703
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,610
You can try the mission
up to ten times.

704
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,630
(Complete a mission in 10 attempts
or finish labor tasks)

705
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,840
At the end of the shoot,

706
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,810
we'll use penalty balls
to pick the ones to get a penalty.

707
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,850
The number of your penalty balls
has been decided...

708
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,780
based on the scores
of your fortune for the new year.

709
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,980
The person with the highest score
who got 95 out of 100 points,

710
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,340
Haha will be the captain
of the team.

711
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,240
- He has no penalty balls for now.
- Captain Ha.

712
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,420
- I knew it.
- Captain Ha.

713
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,690
- It's time for him to be one.
- He got 95 points?

714
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,840
But Haha said that he didn't believe
in fortune-telling.

715
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,810
- He said he didn't believe in it.
- How was it on "How Do You Play?"

716
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,420
Did it say that he'd be lucky
on "How Do You Play?" too?

717
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,350
We heard that he'd be very lucky
for the next ten years.

718
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,790
- Really? But he doesn't believe it.
- You all should be good to me.

719
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,960
- You don't believe it, right?
- For the next ten years.

720
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,730
- Jong Kook keeps saying...
- You don't believe it.

721
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,790
- that he doesn't believe it.
- He doesn't.

722
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,170
- Haha, you should have...
- He said that.

723
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,260
You should've released
your new song "Get" this year.

724
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,400
- It's "Gap".
- That's not the song title.

725
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,830
- It's "Gap".
- Suk Jin, you're unbelievable.

726
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,300
- You should've released it...
- It's not "Get".

727
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,380
- this year.
- Suk Jin, it's "Gap", not "Get".

728
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,140
- I'm working on another song.
- Dynamic Duo.

729
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,500
Haha, you should play
your new song for me...

730
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,070
- before releasing it.
- Right.

731
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,010
Why didn't you play it in advance?

732
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,340
- Gosh, seriously.
- To be honest,

733
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,620
- I liked the song, but...
- I was quite shocked that day.

734
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,950
Everyone, zip it!

735
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,460
- Sadness and loneliness
- Haha.

736
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,280
I'll produce your next song.

737
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,550
- I'll think about it.
- I just can't believe him.

738
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,660
- Remake your song as we suggested.
- Right.

739
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,260
Mix it with "Sunny Day".

740
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,400
Haha, as today's team captain,

741
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,790
- you can cast a curse...
- My goodness.

742
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,940
on anyone you don't like
up to five times.

743
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,140
I can cast a curse?

744
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,980
(He can cast a curse...)

745
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,340
(on anyone he doesn't like.)

746
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,100
- I can cast a curse?
- They just teased him.

747
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,720
Can I curse a person five times
at once as soon as we begin?

748
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,190
Oh, no. Jong Kook is in trouble.

749
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,580
- He can cast a curse on any of us.
- You know who that is, right?

750
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,810
(You know who that is, right?)

751
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,050
I'm sure that that person knows.

752
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,850
- He always makes me uncomfortable.
- This is so funny.

753
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,490
- I wonder who that is.
- What?

754
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,160
- Who could that be?
- He doesn't know...

755
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,590
that he makes others uncomfortable.

756
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,170
- I wonder who that is.
- Curse him before we begin.

757
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,060
- Who could it be? I'm curious.
- It's not that I hate him.

758
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,370
- I'm just uncomfortable around him.
- Who could it be?

759
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,060
This is so unexpected.

760
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,410
- Who is he?
- Hey.

761
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,970
- I'm sorry, okay?
- He might be cursed.

762
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,070
I just hope things will work out
well for you.

763
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,300
The member who gets cursed
by Haha...

764
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,980
will get
additional ten penalty balls.

765
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,380
- Oh, gosh. That's so many.
- Ten penalty balls?

766
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,680
- For each time he curses someone?
- He has absolute power.

767
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,150
(They will get 10 penalty balls
each time they get cursed.)

768
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,810
However, there's a way
for the other members...

769
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,220
- to cast a curse.
- Really?

770
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,490
I'll explain it after we move
to the next location.

771
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,520
Got it.

772
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,550
The 2 people tied for 2nd place...

773
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,660
who got 90 points are...

774
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,850
Jae Suk and Se Chan.

775
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,960
(2nd place with 90 points:
Jae Suk, Se Chan)

776
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,090
- Five penalty balls?
- Yes.

777
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,170
Suk Jin came in fourth place...

778
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,170
with 85 points,
so he has 10 penalty balls.

779
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,760
The rest 3 were tied for 5th place...

780
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,670
with 80 points and will begin
with 15 penalty balls.

781
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,410
Fifteen penalty balls? Okay.

782
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,530
We'll gather upstairs again.

783
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,680
- Okay.
- Got it.

784
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,480
I'll cast all five curses
at the end.

785
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,120
(The members gathered again
after changing their clothes.)

786
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,570
- Had I had any gaps
- Let's cast some curses.

787
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,990
I'm ready to cast a curse.

788
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,850
- In my life
- That's good. I like you.

789
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,960
I would be so happy

790
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,630
- Good. Great job.
- Thank you.

791
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,350
Had I had any gaps

792
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,960
- Good job. Okay.
- In my life

793
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,750
I won't curse you two. Sit down.

794
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,820
- Good. Great job.
- What is this?

795
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,400
- That's the main camera.
- Which camera is this connected to?

796
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,970
- So Min.
- Which is the main camera?

797
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,800
Hey, come and sit down.

798
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,300
Don't block the camera.

799
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,100
- Move. You're blocking us.
- I'm so sick of it.

800
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,680
- Do you want to be cursed?
- Hey.

801
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,510
I told you to move.
You're blocking us, you brat.

802
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,420
You're going to get beaten up
by Ji Hyo if you keep doing that.

803
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,840
What is she doing?

804
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,220
(So Min won't give in.)

805
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,550
Haha, cast a curse on her.

806
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,080
(She's returning
while making a weird noise.)

807
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,690
(The childish frog gets motivated
as she's been told not to do it.)

808
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,430
You have to repay your debt now.

809
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,790
We never borrowed any money.

810
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,200
Why are you saying
that we owe you money?

811
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,470
Nothing is free in life, you know.

812
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,170
Suk Jin is an honorary employee.

813
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,590
- He should be exempt from it.
- Exactly.

814
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,870
I'm an employee.

815
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,210
- Why would you charge me?
- True. That's cool.

816
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,800
- Great. He reacted as he should.
- Yes, he did.

817
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,640
- That's so cool.
- Doesn't he get paychecks?

818
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,980
- I'll get my paycheck soon.
- He should be paid.

819
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,450
Give him just ten R coins.

820
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,070
- We'll pay you with R coins.
- Great.

821
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,070
Anyway, you have to pay off
7,000 dollars.

822
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,340
- Some of you may get a penalty.
- I see.

823
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:04,010
You'll get additional penalty balls
in only two situations.

824
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,550
- First, when Haha curses you.
- Yes.

825
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,990
Here's how the others cast a curse.

826
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,320
If you go downstairs,
you'll see a dartboard.

827
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,090
(There's a dartboard
to cast a curse downstairs.)

828
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,740
If you successfully hit the center,
you can curse a person.

829
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,640
But if you fail, you only end up
getting additional penalty balls.

830
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,770
(If they hit the center, they can
give anyone 10 penalty balls.)

831
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,450
- Here's the list of what to do.
- Okay.

832
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,710
- What is it?
- You can do work anytime you want.

833
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,810
But you have only ten chances
to try each mission.

834
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,540
- Why do we have to work?
- We should do it...

835
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,720
- to repay the money.
- We have two different lists.

836
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,750
- Let's check it out.
- We have a lot of options.

837
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,230
(Game Research Lab,
Contribution in Production Cost)

838
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,430
"Bobbling Basketball,
1,000 dollars."

839
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:47,290
"While one member keeps bouncing
on a gym ball under the hoop,"

840
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,030
"the other makes the ball bounce
on that person's head..."

841
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,970
- "and get through the hoop..." No.
- What?

842
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,030
- Next up is Pirate Roulette.
- If you just throw it...

843
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,800
"Every member sticks a knife twice."

844
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,180
"You succeed
if the pirate doesn't pop out."

845
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
"Singing".

846
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,270
"Set your target score
before singing."

847
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,950
"Sing the 1st verse and get a score
within a 1 point margin to pass."

848
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,150
- One point?
- One point?

849
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,890
- One point more or less, right?
- Yes.

850
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,390
The most common score range is
from 80 to 89 points.

851
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,960
- "Immortal Chan Hee".
- "Chan Hee"?

852
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,080
"All the members must
stand together..."

853
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,160
"in the frame of Chan Hee's camera
within three seconds."

854
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,590
- We can do that.
- In the frame?

855
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,090
- I think that's possible.
- Of course, we can do it.

856
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:23,170
All right then. You can try those
missions only ten times.

857
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,740
Check the list of the works now.

858
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,740
What kind of works should we do?

859
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,140
Let's take a look.

860
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,940
- First up is Game Lab.
- I see.

861
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,880
We can get up to 500 dollars
from it.

862
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,840
"Come up with a fun game
using objects you can find."

863
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,120
"Play the game you created."

864
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,010
"The staff members will evaluate
the game."

865
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,460
"Based on the quality of the game,
you can get..."

866
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,190
- "up to 500 dollars."
- Up to 500 dollars? Okay.

867
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,520
- That sounds great.
- But it's up to them.

868
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,020
- I see. We have to...
- It won't be easy.

869
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,820
- create a game.
- We can make a game they'd like.

870
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,930
But he seems to let his mood
affect his decisions these days.

871
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,430
Let's not try that one.
We'll only get upset.

872
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,820
I bet they won't give us
a high score.

873
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,030
"Support Production Cost".

874
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,870
"Eat the chicken dish we have
for an indirect advertisement..."

875
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,100
"and describe the taste
with your faces and exclamations."

876
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,370
- I specialize in this.
- Let's try this one several times.

877
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,030
Can we have cooked rice with it?

878
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,140
I'm like an expert.

879
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,240
- Make faces and exclamations. Good.
- Yes.

880
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,950
There's also New Year's Card
on the list.

881
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,840
"Write New Year's cards
to the hard-working staff members."

882
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,620
- That sounds meaningful.
- We get 50 dollars for each card.

883
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,840
- I like that one too.
- "Feet Washing Ceremony".

884
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:17,350
"Get 100 dollars by washing
a member's feet."

885
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,080
"If you wash Se Chan's feet,
which must be hard,"

886
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,390
- "you get 200 dollars."
- Come on. It's worth 500 dollars.

887
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,020
We deserve to get more than that
for washing his feet.

888
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,230
You should pay at least 500 dollars.

889
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,930
We'll have to wear a protective suit
to wash Se Chan's feet.

890
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,370
- A protective suit?
- The smell will get on the clothes.

891
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:33,410
You may start trying anything
you want with some other members.

892
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,330
Let's think. What kind of game
could we make?

893
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,940
Shall we start with Pirate Roulette
to test our luck?

894
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,480
- Okay.
- Let's try Pirate Roulette.

895
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,710
- We'll bring you the toy.
- Let's do that.

896
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,880
- Let's play Pirate Roulette.
- Do two people play it?

897
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,770
We win if we all stick two knives,
and the pirate doesn't pop out.

898
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,450
- We have a chance to win.
- We've got this.

899
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,990
All right. Let's begin.

900
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,010
Okay.

901
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,890
Let's take turns
starting with Jae Suk.

902
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,050
If the pirate pops out,

903
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,750
- Yes.
- I'll cast a curse on that person.

904
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,850
- Good.
- Okay.

905
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,230
Are you ready?

906
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,430
- Of course.
- We're ready.

907
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,430
- We're ready.
- Is it worth 500 dollars?

908
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,670
It's worth 500 dollars.

909
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,020
- I'll give you two knives each.
- Two knives?

910
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,400
- Okay.
- I didn't know you would go first.

911
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,140
- I'm done.
- You have one more knife.

912
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,560
You win if everyone sticks two,
and the pirate doesn't pop out.

913
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,100
- I put one in it.
- Okay.

914
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,140
- I'll stick one in it too.
- Well...

915
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,710
I'm sure we'll succeed
because Kwang Soo isn't here.

916
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,980
- Next.
- Who's next?

917
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,180
Are you done?

918
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,740
(Their 3rd attempt...)

919
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,620
- Great. You did it.
- Okay.

920
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,620
It's loose.

921
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,490
- Next up is the award winner.
- The Honorary Employee Award.

922
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,620
I'll show you how I won
the Honorary Employee Award.

923
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,130
Wait, Suk Jin. Are you confident?

924
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,290
- Then put it right below...
- Gosh. What was that?

925
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,590
(The honorary employee failed.)

926
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,730
Suk Jin.

927
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,590
- How could that happen?
- It popped out.

928
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,030
I can't believe you made it pop out.

929
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,300
- You're an honorary employee.
- Exactly.

930
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,940
He deserves to be cursed.

931
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,480
- He deserves a curse.
- You should curse him.

932
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,380
- I don't understand...
- Why did he...

933
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,770
- Let's try again.
- Gosh. I'm so upset.

934
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,410
- We failed too quickly.
- Some didn't even get to put it in.

935
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,840
We don't lose 500 dollars, right?

936
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,510
- No, but you lose one attempt.
- Let's try again.

937
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,010
- Why would you get so mad?
- Let's try again.

938
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,720
- Gosh, seriously.
- Hold on, everyone.

939
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,920
- You have only ten attempts.
- Ten attempts.

940
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,520
- Oh, really?
- We didn't know that.

941
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,750
- We'll start over. We didn't know.
- Oh, really?

942
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,930
(What? We didn't know that.)

943
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,590
- You failed on your first attempt.
- You should've told us...

944
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,230
- before we began.
- We didn't know.

945
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,870
- We really didn't know.
- You should've told us before.

946
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,490
- This is so unfair.
- We really didn't know.

947
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,140
Exactly. You should've told us.

948
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,830
- We didn't know about that rule.
- Right. We really didn't know.

949
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,000
I told you about the rule
four times.

950
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,710
- When did you tell us that?
- I didn't know.

951
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,240
(As they always do,)

952
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,740
(they forgot about the rule
as soon as they heard.)

953
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,810
(They were so distracted that they
barely continued shooting.)

954
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,310
Let us start over again.

955
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,620
- You should've told us.
- You didn't tell us.

956
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,080
- Trust me. We didn't know.
- You didn't tell us.

957
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,520
- I clearly told you...
- Give us some slack just this once.

958
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,550
Just this once.
I'm the honorary employee.

959
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,230
- Right. He's the honorary employee.
- How about Jae Suk...

960
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,630
kicks a jegi 20 times?

961
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,530
- Okay.
- We accept it.

962
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,030
- If he kicks it 20 times, okay?
- Okay.

963
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,140
- That's a promise.
- Who will do it?

964
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,300
- I'll kick it 20 times in a row.
- If he catches it, he can continue.

965
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,210
- Okay. Let me catch it only twice.
- If he catches it...

966
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,500
- Just twice.
- That's allowed...

967
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
- in the traditional game.
- You can kick it 20 times?

968
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,340
- Of course, I can.
- So if he catches it...

969
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,740
- I mean, if he succeeds...
- We'll get to start over again.

970
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,490
- If I kick it 20 times, okay?
- It'll be good for us.

971
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,620
- He can catch it.
- Jae Suk, make sure to succeed.

972
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,190
- Okay.
- You can do this.

973
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,810
(An extra attempt is on the line.)

974
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,820
(Could he be able to pull it off?)

975
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,490
- Okay.
- You can do this.

976
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,730
- One, two, three...
- He's good at it.

977
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,730
- Four, five...
- Six...

978
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,090
- Darn.
- I knew it.

979
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,230
- Jae Suk.
- Gosh.

980
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,400
- Five...
- Six... Darn.

981
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,240
(He couldn't kick it
any more than 6 times.)

982
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,560
- Come on, Jae Suk.
- He's so bad at playing games.

983
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,680
You did a great job
when you were practicing.

984
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,140
- Hang on. Why were you so tense?
- Were you nervous?

985
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,500
- Why were you tense again?
- Were you nervous?

986
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,000
- Why would he be nervous?
- Why were you tense?

987
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,040
Even his lips are dried out.

988
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,510
Why did you get so nervous?

989
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,920
- What's wrong with him?
- Why do you always get nervous?

990
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,120
- What is your problem?
- Give me one more chance.

991
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,460
- No. You failed.
- Give me just one more chance.

992
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,010
- Try kicking it.
- Okay. How about he kicks it...

993
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,430
- twenty-five times?
- He's the honorary employee.

994
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,580
- Come on. Give me another chance.
- He just finished his quarantine.

995
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,130
- I'm back now.
- That's right.

996
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,790
- Right. Give him another chance.
- I'll try again.

997
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,930
- What was that?
- He sounds so bossy.

998
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,290
- Give him another chance.
- Let me try again.

999
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,440
- I'm the honorary employee.
- He sounds bossy.

1000
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,760
- I couldn't even attend the awards.
- He's bossy only on variety shows.

1001
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,140
- Only on variety shows.
- Okay.

1002
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,740
- Twenty times.
- Twenty times.

1003
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,380
- This is your last chance, okay?
- Sorry?

1004
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,600
- I won't ask for any more chances.
- Jae Suk, make sure...

1005
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,240
- I think I should...
- He's getting nervous.

1006
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,840
- I should put this on.
- Just don't get nervous.

1007
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,950
- Okay.
- Why are you intimidated?

1008
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,220
- Okay.
- Just relax. Stay focused.

1009
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,240
I just have to do
as well as I always do.

1010
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,450
- Just do as you always do.
- Okay.

1011
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,460
- Think that no one is watching you.
- Okay. I'll do that.

1012
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,310
- You can kick it 20 times.
- Think that there's no camera.

1013
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,580
- Think that you're just practicing.
- Okay.

1014
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,320
- You're quarantining in your room.
- One, two, three...

1015
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,580
(You're alone in your room.)

1016
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,230
- You're quarantining in your room.
- One, two, three...

1017
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,230
(Surprised)

1018
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,200
- He said it was practice.
- You're quarantining in your room.

1019
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,030
(His fear of playing games
came back.)

1020
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,400
- He said it was practice.
- You failed.

1021
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,410
No, he said it was practice.

1022
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,100
- I told you to relax.
- He said it was practice.

1023
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,830
- He didn't say he'd begin.
- I'll begin now.

1024
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,240
- He didn't say he'd begin.
- Catch it if you think it'll fall.

1025
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,680
- He didn't say he'd begin.
- Now...

1026
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,950
- I'm ready.
- Go.

1027
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,040
- I'll begin now.
- Catch it if you can't kick it.

1028
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,840
- Jae Suk, don't get nervous.
- He did well when practicing.

1029
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,570
- You see...
- Don't pressure him. Move back.

1030
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,890
You're getting so worked up.

1031
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,220
Why couldn't you even catch it?

1032
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,920
- Just catch it.
- I'll kick it 20 times.

1033
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,120
- All right. You can do this...
- I'm ready. I'll begin.

1034
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,130
- He'll begin now.
- This is so funny.

1035
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,230
- Here we go.
- I don't think he can make it.

1036
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,930
- One, two...
- I don't think he'll pull it off.

1037
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,730
- three, four, five...
- Good.

1038
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,290
- Great. You're doing well.
- six, seven...

1039
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,290
(Catch it!)

1040
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,020
- That's it.
- Catch it!

1041
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,330
(He received it.)

1042
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,090
Nine, ten...

1043
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,100
- Catch it.
- Eleven... Gosh.

1044
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,240
(He missed it.)

1045
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,910
I told you to catch it!

1046
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,680
Didn't I? I told you to catch it.

1047
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,000
- What a shame.
- Darn it.

1048
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,680
- Fail.
- Gosh, seriously.

1049
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,040
That means what we did still counts.

1050
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,810
- Cast a curse on him.
- Yes, you have nine attempts left.

1051
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,920
I told him to catch it.

1052
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,650
Listen, everyone.
I'll cast a curse...

1053
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,280
- Let it slide just this once.
- on one of these two.

1054
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,180
He's the one to blame.
I did nothing to deserve it.

1055
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,390
- You acted up too, Jae Suk.
- He failed.

1056
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,490
- You had your chance.
- He failed to kick it 20 times.

1057
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,350
- Why did you say you could do it...
- No, I mean...

1058
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,200
- in the first place?
- I thought I could do it.

1059
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,770
- But I was wrong.
- So you were not sure.

1060
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,240
Then should we play
rock-paper-scissors?

1061
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,390
Staying at home would be better
than being treated this way.

1062
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,470
- My gosh.
- You said you could do it.

1063
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,740
I would rather chat with you
over the phone at home.

1064
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,140
- Why did you say you could do it?
- He's right.

1065
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,250
Hey, you said such kind words to me
during my quarantine.

1066
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,310
- I know, but it ended.
- But you're back now.

1067
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,520
- Why did you get nervous?
- Darn it.

1068
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,750
Why do you get nervous
every time you play a game?

1069
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,180
- Both of you...
- Yes.

1070
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,020
I'll let you slide if you write
ten New Year's cards each.

1071
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,490
- Let me do something else.
- I promise.

1072
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,120
- Writing ten New Year's cards...
- That's too much work.

1073
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
- Hurry up and start writing them.
- I'll do it.

1074
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,120
We can write up to 100 cards, right?

1075
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,430
- I'll write 10 of them.
- Each of you write 10 cards.

1076
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,520
Good. Write ten cards.

1077
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,560
- Are 10 cards worth 500 dollars?
- You must write...

1078
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,740
the name of a staff member
on each card.

1079
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,040
- Their names?
- Yes.

1080
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
I'll write one to Chan Hee.

1081
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,160
Then I'll write a card to Bo Pil.

1082
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,270
"Bo Pil, don't live your life
like that."

1083
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,000
- "Dear Chan Hee."
- The message...

1084
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,100
"Bo Pil, I wish you..."

1085
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,410
"Chan Hee, thanks to you,"

1086
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,870
"a happy New Year."

1087
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,810
"I look younger."

1088
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,310
(Thank you. I wish you
a life full of happiness.)

1089
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,620
"Thank you."

1090
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,450
Here you go, Bo Pil.

1091
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,290
Thank you.

1092
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,620
(Remaining time: 2 hours and 55
minutes, Fee: 6,900 dollars)

1093
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,850
It's okay.

1094
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,930
I bet he doesn't know
ten staff members' names.

1095
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,600
- Next... Hold on.
- Yes.

1096
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,160
Jae Suk's handwriting is bad.

1097
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,040
Hey, is it Kang Hyo Im?

1098
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,040
(He's asking the name of the writer
who's been on the team for 7 years.)

1099
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,580
He just asked me for your name.

1100
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,250
- No, I didn't.
- He asked...

1101
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,680
He asked if Hyo Im's family name was
Kang.

1102
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,140
(He can't send the card
even if he wants to.)

1103
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,490
(Meanwhile, the others are
practicing another mission.)

1104
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,490
- No, that didn't work.
- It won't work.

1105
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:57,410
- He can't aim it in that position.
- How about I don't move?

1106
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,490
- Just make it bounce on my head.
- That's a good idea.

1107
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,520
- Go ahead.
- You must keep bouncing on it.

1108
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,930
- Oh, I see. He must keep moving.
- Hey.

1109
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,600
- Let's try again.
- This is too difficult.

1110
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,830
- No, not like that.
- Gosh, you punk.

1111
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:10,930
Jong Kook.

1112
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,330
- Throw it...
- He just wanted to hit you.

1113
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,600
- and let him head the ball.
- Hey, did you...

1114
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,040
- Did you hit me hard intentionally?
- No, it wasn't intentional.

1115
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,500
- Go on. Try again.
- Okay.

1116
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,600
- This is...
- Hit the back part...

1117
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,770
No, it didn't work.

1118
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,310
(He stood up
as he couldn't stand it anymore.)

1119
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,410
That wasn't my intention.
Trust me. I'm not lying.

1120
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,680
I didn't do it on purpose. I swear.

1121
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,680
Didn't you just throw it to hit him?

1122
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,180
- No, never.
- He threw it like this.

1123
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,910
- That was not intentional? Really?
- It wasn't intentional.

1124
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,390
- Let's give it a try.
- Se Chan, sit on it.

1125
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,830
It was close.

1126
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,220
- Jong Kook will shoot the ball.
- Watch me.

1127
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,660
- I hope he'll make it.
- Wait.

1128
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,330
Let's see how lucky the winner
of the Top Excellence Award can be.

1129
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,390
Watch me.

1130
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,100
- That's good.
- You should throw it like this.

1131
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,140
- You almost succeeded.
- You should hit the right spot.

1132
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,140
You're good at throwing the ball.

1133
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,290
It's difficult.

1134
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,770
- Great. That's how you should move.
- I see.

1135
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,770
- Again.
- It's so difficult.

1136
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,640
- Try to hit it to the back. Great.
- Great.

1137
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,330
- That's good. You almost did it.
- That was great.

1138
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,100
- Remember how you headed it.
- Hit it with your forehead.

1139
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,580
- Where? Here?
- Right here.

1140
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,580
- Good.
- I think they can pull it off.

1141
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,520
It'd be better if I didn't...
I should just...

1142
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,910
- Start.
- Head it with your forehead...

1143
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,660
- They did it.
- Okay.

1144
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,450
- Start.
- Head it with your forehead...

1145
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,120
(The ball went into the hoop.)

1146
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,580
- Okay.
- We did it!

1147
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,350
- He said, "Start."
- He wasn't the player.

1148
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,620
- He said it.
- He said, "Start."

1149
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,620
It doesn't count because I said it?

1150
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,720
- He's on our team.
- Why not?

1151
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,560
- He's on our team.
- Why doesn't it count?

1152
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,430
- He just finished his quarantine.
- He's on our team.

1153
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,740
- Why doesn't it count?
- Why?

1154
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,740
- What?
- You said it, right?

1155
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,830
- Then...
- It doesn't count?

1156
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,240
He'll kick a jegi 20 times.

1157
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,470
- Okay.
- If he kicks it 20 times...

1158
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,040
- Make it count if I succeed.
- But we made it.

1159
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,640
- Kick it...
- Make it count if I succeed.

1160
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,350
- Make it count if I succeed.
- If he kicks it 20 times.

1161
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,040
- Okay.
- It counts if I kick it 20 times.

1162
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,450
- Just relax.
- Okay.

1163
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,450
No one is around you.

1164
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,750
Last time, you did it
for another chance, but this time,

1165
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,580
- we'll actually complete a mission.
- If you fail again,

1166
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,060
you'll have to write
20 New Year's cards.

1167
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,120
- Okay.
- Good luck.

1168
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,120
- Thanks.
- You've got this.

1169
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,100
- You can catch it.
- Don't worry. You can catch it.

1170
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,430
Catch it if you can't receive it.

1171
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,450
- Catch it.
- I think he'll succeed this time.

1172
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,720
- Look how his legs are shaking.
- He did some practice.

1173
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,930
(His legs are wobbly too.)

1174
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,830
He did some practice.
He'll pull it off this time.

1175
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,410
(After tidying up
the jegi carefully)

1176
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,240
- One, two...
- I caught it.

1177
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,540
- Good job. Well done.
- Jae Suk.

1178
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,600
- Relax.
- You got better.

1179
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,200
- I'm sorry, but Jae Suk,
- Just relax.

1180
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,200
have you ever succeeded in
kicking it 20 times?

1181
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
Yes, I have.

1182
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,120
- You have?
- Of course, I have. I can do this.

1183
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,870
- You've done it before, right?
- Of course.

1184
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,450
One, two, three...

1185
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,020
- Good. Four, five...
- Great. Keep going.

1186
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,620
- You're doing great. Keep going.
- six, seven...

1187
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,810
- Good.
- eight, nine...

1188
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,810
- Catch it.
- Ten.

1189
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,450
- Eleven, twelve.
- Yes. That's good.

1190
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,390
- Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.
- Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

1191
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,120
- Keep going. That's great.
- Sixteen, seventeen.

1192
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,350
- Eighteen.
- You'll make it.

1193
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,430
(Will he succeed?)

1194
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,600
- Eighteen.
- You did it.

1195
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,770
- Nineteen.
- You're there.

1196
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,040
(He manages 20.)

1197
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,410
(An opportunity was obtained
through constant protesting...)

1198
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,080
(and the jegi boomer
didn't let it go to waste.)

1199
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,180
I did it!

1200
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,410
I actually did it!

1201
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,410
I did it.

1202
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,750
(He powered through
his performance anxiety.)

1203
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,120
- Nice.
- I did it.

1204
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,950
I did it.

1205
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,220
- Nice.
- You did it.

1206
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,410
- I did it.
- You did it!

1207
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,910
- Nicely done.
- I did it.

1208
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,410
- You succeeded.
- You paid back 1,000 dollars.

1209
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,580
We paid back 1,000 dollars.

1210
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,750
I've never kicked it
20 times in a row before.

1211
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,660
But...

1212
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,890
- It's a first for me.
- Well,

1213
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,390
you said "start"
at the perfect moment.

1214
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,700
- Nice.
- At the right timing.

1215
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,770
It was right before you began.

1216
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,100
I can't believe
you managed to say "start."

1217
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,700
I'm amazed.

1218
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
We paid back 1,000 dollars.

1219
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,330
- This is hilarious.
- What next? Some singing?

1220
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,370
- Right.
- Yes, let's sing.

1221
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,370
- Look.
- What do we need to do?

1222
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,910
You'll have to sing
one of your favorite songs.

1223
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,100
- So 99 points...
- Plus or minus a point.

1224
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,020
- A score of 99 would be the best.
- No way.

1225
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,580
The best option would be
a score of 85.

1226
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,250
Let's sing one for a practice round.

1227
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,310
We'll put it to the test.

1228
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,790
- Which song should we sing?
- Hold on a second.

1229
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,080
- We need to check the settings.
- How about "At Andong Station"?

1230
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,790
- "At Andong Station"?
- Sounds good.

1231
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:23,250
("At Andong Station" by Jin Sung,
popularized by Yoo San Seul)

1232
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,290
This will be a test run.

1233
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,430
- Here we go.
- Let's see how we do.

1234
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,720
The train is leaving Andong Station.

1235
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,500
Please get ready for departure.

1236
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,040
Your support gave me the strength
to come out of quarantine.

1237
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,160
Once again, I extend my gratitude.

1238
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,470
The fact that
you're back to full health...

1239
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,910
I wish the same
to all of you as well.

1240
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,770
All right.

1241
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,910
(Gone with the wind)

1242
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,350
(Oh, gone)

1243
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,290
(Gone with the wind)

1244
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,450
(The wind whisked it away)

1245
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,890
(Was it only an empty promise?)

1246
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,830
(What an empty promise)

1247
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:01,200
(Backup singer Big Nose
gets lost in the tune.)

1248
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,970
At the entrance of Andong Station

1249
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,770
(We promised to meet)

1250
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,330
(That person)

1251
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,200
(The one I love)

1252
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:17,950
(The snow that fell all night)

1253
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,580
(Not rain, but snow)

1254
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,890
Now reaches my knees

1255
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,310
(Check out the snow,
it's up to my knees)

1256
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,580
(Are you not coming?)

1257
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,250
(That must be the case)

1258
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,160
(Or is something stopping you?)

1259
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,330
No, that's not it

1260
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,500
(Big Nose
is running out of ad-libs.)

1261
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,290
Hurry over here!

1262
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,370
(The song is now almost over.)

1263
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,080
(Suk Jin can't think
of anything else.)

1264
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:52,410
On this night where now
the last train has left

1265
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,220
(The song ends with
a bad impression of a train horn.)

1266
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,390
Let's check out the score.

1267
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,520
- Let's see.
- I call 90.

1268
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,390
- See?
- No way.

1269
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,830
- I knew it.
- You're right.

1270
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,160
- Trot songs get you 100 points.
- So a trot song of 99 points.

1271
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,250
The score's higher than I expected.

1272
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,060
- If we go for 99 points...
- It has a generous scoring system.

1273
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,160
I bet we'll get 100 points.

1274
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,540
You're bad at ad-libs
even as a backup singer.

1275
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,930
Wasn't I incredible?

1276
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,270
Suk Jin, go ahead.

1277
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,970
- I'm not sure.
- Choose a recent song.

1278
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,700
- "Meant to Be" could be good.
- It didn't get me dancing though.

1279
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,240
- "Meant to Be"?
- Or maybe...

1280
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,700
- "Wrongful Encounter."
- How about "Southbound Train"?

1281
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,100
- "Wrongful Encounter"!
- Let's go with "Southbound Train."

1282
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,470
- "Southbound Train"?
- But those...

1283
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,870
They were all released decades ago.

1284
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,680
- But they get you dancing.
- How about that one?

1285
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,450
- Which one?
- "Jintobaegi"?

1286
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,720
- No.
- Then what?

1287
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,910
"Youthful You."

1288
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,520
- Which one?
- "Youthful You."

1289
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,290
- "Youthful You"?
- Hold on.

1290
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,990
Youthful you

1291
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,700
Hold on a second.
Did you all just hear that?

1292
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,660
It's what I sang
during my teenage years.

1293
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,200
- Wouldn't it bring down the mood?
- It's by Kim Soo Chul.

1294
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,560
- No way.
- I think it will.

1295
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,560
Then "Youthful You."

1296
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,930
- It won't bring down the mood.
- No?

1297
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,060
- This...
- It cheers you up.

1298
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,330
Can you get a full score?

1299
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,770
- Of course.
- A full score?

1300
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,080
Are you taking on the challenge?

1301
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,180
(He hesitates for a bit.)

1302
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,200
Go ahead.

1303
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,700
- Or pass...
- I'll give it a shot!

1304
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,350
- Really?
- What's the estimated score?

1305
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,680
- What will be your goal?
- A score of 99.

1306
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,810
- Okay.
- Then you must get from 98 to 100.

1307
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,140
The song's number is 1, 2, 3, and 8.

1308
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,290
(The song's number indicates
how old the song is.)

1309
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,390
I have never punched in a number
this low before.

1310
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,250
- It's an upbeat song.
- Of course.

1311
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,580
How does it go?

1312
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,390
- All right!
- I'm loving the beat.

1313
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,160
(Intro)

1314
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,390
His dance moves are just as old.

1315
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,370
(He vocalizes the beat.)

1316
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,040
- The beat's lost on me.
- This...

1317
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,060
- I'm finding it hard to sway to it.
- Was...

1318
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,310
Was the song always this slow?

1319
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,500
I remember it being a faster beat.

1320
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,810
(When Seok Sam used to strut down
the streets of Bangbae-dong.)

1321
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,540
What's with this slow song?

1322
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,450
- Was the song always this slow?
- Why...

1323
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,270
- Why is it this slow?
- We see TWICE on screen though.

1324
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,310
- This song...
- There's TWICE.

1325
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,720
- It used to be a fast song.
- Why is it this slow?

1326
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:35,910
(He remedies the situation
by turning up the tempo.)

1327
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:36,990
I turned up the tempo.

1328
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,910
- Let's run to
- No, not yet.

1329
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,160
- No?
- And go!

1330
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,500
(Let's run to the rough plain)

1331
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,020
- All right!
- Let's run.

1332
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,560
Keep running!

1333
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,970
(Drink in the sun of youth)

1334
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,330
Drink it in!

1335
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,870
(He acts like
he's drinking in the sun.)

1336
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:56,870
- This isn't getting us to dance.
- More blissful than jewels

1337
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,040
(They begin to pull back
from participating in the song.)

1338
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,640
- Should I turn up the tempo again?
- This isn't fun at all.

1339
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,080
Tomorrow's

1340
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,310
Hey, stop fidgeting with that.

1341
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,220
It calls for us

1342
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,350
- It picks up from here.
- Then let us party.

1343
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,390
All right!

1344
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:13,560
(Those in their youth, wake up)

1345
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,430
Don't you dare sleep!

1346
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,560
Wake up!

1347
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,890
(Those in their youth, wake up)

1348
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,870
(Even he's embarrassed
by his poor ad-libs.)

1349
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:22,970
What are you talking about?

1350
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,560
Get him out of here!

1351
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,430
Get the honorary employee
out of here.

1352
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,500
(He tries his best
to seem young and cool.)

1353
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,540
(However, it's painful to listen
to this old man's song.)

1354
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,750
- You are youthful and like the sun
- Haha, stick one on him.

1355
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:39,640
(He keeps singing
unaware of the pain he's causing.)

1356
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,890
(A curse gets stuck on him.)

1357
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,520
(The old Suk Jin
receives 10 more penalty balls.)

1358
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,290
(A score between 98 and 100
is what he needs to succeed.)

1359
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,350
(So what's his score?)

1360
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:52,430
Wasn't he too old for that song?

1361
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,660
- What?
- Does it say 47?

1362
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,660
- You know you deserve it, right?
- No way.

1363
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,790
You know you deserve it.

1364
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:00,060
Here you go. What would
you have done without this?

1365
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,870
- I can't believe it.
- How can he get 47 points?

1366
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,770
That song should
be called "Old You."

1367
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,240
How is that "Youthful You"?

1368
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,200
That was "Old You."

1369
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,450
- How was that youthful?
- It's only because...

1370
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:10,810
you guys didn't have fun with me.

1371
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,040
Was it too slow?

1372
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,020
- The machine...
- It wasn't fun at all.

1373
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,450
You need to sing a trot song
to get 100 points.

1374
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,660
Anyway, you failed this round.

1375
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,080
How about this then?

1376
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,180
Can I sing one? I really want to.

1377
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,390
- Go ahead.
- Go for it.

1378
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,930
- Is it a trot song?
- No.

1379
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,660
- I want to sing "Daring Woman."
- What?

1380
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,390
"Daring Woman" by Suh Joo Kyung.

1381
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:29,500
Exactly.

1382
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,370
- So Min only wants...
- I'm shocked by my score of 47.

1383
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,870
I bet you want
a certain someone to see this.

1384
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,200
- Of course not.
- I'm sure of it.

1385
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,470
It's a song I like.

1386
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:39,580
- Go for 100 points.
- You know, it suits you.

1387
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,870
Men like this song as well.

1388
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:41,910
Are you going for it?

1389
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,370
- Go for it.
- Yes, go for it.

1390
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,990
("Daring Woman" by Suh Joo Kyung,
performed by Jeon So Min)

1391
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,790
- I didn't call out a score.
- Go for it.

1392
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,450
What should be my goal?

1393
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,220
- What should it be?
- Decide on one now.

1394
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,120
- Around 80.
- I'll go for 82.

1395
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,720
- How about 85?
- Okay, 85.

1396
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,850
All right, 85.

1397
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,430
Is it 85?

1398
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,100
A score of 90 wouldn't be so bad.

1399
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,290
Really?

1400
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,160
Aim for 90 instead.

1401
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,160
I'll go for 90.

1402
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,040
- Is this on purpose?
- Isn't 99 better?

1403
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,160
(She already begins
with her daring steps.)

1404
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,500
- Is it 90?
- Yes, 90.

1405
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,870
The only difference...

1406
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,810
is that I'll be
the backup singer again.

1407
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,000
No, don't do it.

1408
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:14,910
We're done hearing from the old man.

1409
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:18,540
(You're forcing yourself
not to smile)

1410
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,540
Absolutely!

1411
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,180
(You're only cold toward me)

1412
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,180
- Absolutely!
- Absolutely!

1413
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:27,060
(The fake backup singer is gone
and enters Psychorus.)

1414
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,660
(A big fuss)

1415
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:33,020
(That is what makes
you charming though)

1416
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,100
- That's right!
- That's right!

1417
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,720
(Your nonchalant gaze and words)

1418
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,790
- Your gaze!
- Your gaze!

1419
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:40,770
- But I can still feel your gaze
- Nice!

1420
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:42,910
(She gets the part going
after the "Youthful You" fiasco.)

1421
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,770
I'm throwing in my jegi performance.

1422
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:47,970
- Are you on your way home?
- That's right!

1423
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,580
The weight of the world
seems to be on your shoulders

1424
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,870
It's a festival!

1425
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:55,250
(They're having a blast.)

1426
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,720
(Would you buy me a drink?)

1427
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,450
- Nice!
- Any time!

1428
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:02,620
Yayaya, look at me

1429
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:06,160
(They all show off
what they can do.)

1430
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,890
(Saying that you
were waiting for me)

1431
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,890
(Doesn't make you
lose out on anything)

1432
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:13,910
It does!

1433
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:17,410
(The gummy backup singer is thrilled
to be back at his day job.)

1434
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,040
Say that you want me as yours

1435
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:22,100
(They're having fun
regardless of their mission.)

1436
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,270
This is great.

1437
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:28,790
(Despite all the distractions,
she managed to finish the song.)

1438
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,140
- All right.
- Let's see.

1439
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,160
That was great.

1440
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,520
- I have a good feeling about this.
- Give us 90.

1441
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,060
- Right.
- Give me 90.

1442
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,350
- Right.
- Give me 90.

1443
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,160
- We guessed correctly.
- I did it!

1444
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,250
- I did it.
- Really?

1445
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,970
(Changing the goal at the end...)

1446
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,500
(led them to a victory.)

1447
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,640
- It was 90.
- Yes!

1448
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,540
No way.

1449
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,660
Ji Hyo suggested
that we change it to 90.

1450
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,040
- I'm glad you said so.
- Our goal was 90.

1451
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,600
- Amazing as always.
- We actually did it.

1452
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,640
The machine knew
that I was singing from the heart.

1453
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,910
No way.

1454
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:56,040
I can't believe we actually did it.

1455
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,680
I bet you're punching in the scores.
There is no way I'd get a 47.

1456
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,850
Who gets a karaoke score of 47?

1457
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,720
What's more insane is
he got a score in the forties.

1458
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,810
- How can that be?
- It's giving me the chills.

1459
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:06,950
A score of 47
doesn't make any sense.

1460
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,560
Manual labor is always an option.

1461
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,700
- Washing the feet or...
- Of course.

1462
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,350
Let's come up with a game.

1463
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,220
(Game Lab, Worth up to 500 dollars)

1464
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,220
You can come up with a game.

1465
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,560
- It's worth more money.
- Sure. What should it be?

1466
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,640
Let's think about it.

1467
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,970
- There's a jegi...
- I saw many props...

1468
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:22,310
including an eye mask.

1469
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:23,560
Yes, and a jegi.

1470
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,740
There are a lot of props.

1471
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,270
- Game Lab?
- How about blindfolded hacky sack?

1472
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,970
When we can't do it
with our eyes open?

1473
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,950
We can't even do it
with our eyes open.

1474
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,490
But I did 20 a few minutes ago.

1475
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:35,620
- But...
- How about this?

1476
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,910
- How about this?
- Go ahead.

1477
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,220
We'll stand in a circle...

1478
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,250
- and toss the jegi around.
- It'll be a team mission.

1479
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:42,250
- That sounds good.
- Everyone must kick it.

1480
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,430
- So we'll go around in a circle?
- And when...

1481
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,620
- the seventh person kicks it...
- That's like...

1482
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,200
It's like a trapping drill
in soccer.

1483
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,520
- Absolutely.
- That's what you mean.

1484
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,520
But we'll do it with a jegi.

1485
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,620
- Who will go first?
- Let's give it a shot.

1486
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:51,370
Go ahead.

1487
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,770
What on earth? Keep a steady rhythm.

1488
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,200
- Why didn't you use your left foot?
- This is the problem.

1489
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,970
- This can happen though.
- I know.

1490
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,370
What do you think
of the game we came up with?

1491
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,970
I'm sure they approve.

1492
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:02,970
What kind of games do you prefer?

1493
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,620
It may not be fun,
but it'll be rewarding for us.

1494
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,020
It's not the most creative idea.

1495
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,850
- They must value creativity.
- Not the most creative idea?

1496
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:09,140
Come up with one yourself then.

1497
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:10,660
Don't be like that.

1498
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,290
- How about this then?
- We'll just do it.

1499
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,390
Someone will stand here
with his or her mouth open.

1500
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,890
A snack will be thrown
from across the room...

1501
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:20,890
and someone can eat it from here.

1502
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,000
- What do you say?
- That's impossible.

1503
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,040
- That's weird.
- What?

1504
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,790
- That won't be easy.
- That's weird.

1505
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:28,830
- It will be so much fun.
- Or...

1506
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,060
(Or...)

1507
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,370
How about we keep kicking...

1508
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:33,810
- and the last person scores?
- The last person scores?

1509
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:34,950
That will be so hard.

1510
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,020
- I think we've done that before.
- That's hard.

1511
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,040
Give it a try.

1512
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,250
The seven of us kick,
and the last person must score.

1513
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,520
- All seven of us?
- Yes.

1514
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,520
- Will that work?
- Will that work?

1515
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,180
We have to keep passing.
It doesn't matter who's next.

1516
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,020
- Let's kick once.
- That's so hard.

1517
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,020
That's funny.

1518
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,520
- One. Two.
- Okay.

1519
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,200
- Suk Jin.
- You can kick again.

1520
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,830
- You'll have to kick again.
- Right.

1521
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,200
- Let's try it again.
- One.

1522
00:48:54,200 --> 00:49:00,430
It's fine
as long as we don't drop it.

1523
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:01,540
(Crazy jegi skill)

1524
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,740
Wait.

1525
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,430
- We got it.
- I don't want to do it.

1526
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:05,700
- You can play jegi with both feet.
- You're good.

1527
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,410
- Why am I so good?
- Young jegi.

1528
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,270
- Aren't you the young jegi?
- He's using both feet.

1529
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:10,850
It doesn't matter how many times
you kick.

1530
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:12,180
You just have to keep kicking
until you score.

1531
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,180
- Okay.
- Just pass it.

1532
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,490
Pass it.

1533
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:15,910
- Okay. Good.
- Why am I so good?

1534
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:18,080
- I was surprised.
- Okay.

1535
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,910
Is there a magnet? One. Two.

1536
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:21,560
- Keep it going.
- I'll take over.

1537
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,100
- Save it.
- Save it.

1538
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,290
(It's a mess.)

1539
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:27,700
Save it.

1540
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,560
- Are we doing this?
- You should...

1541
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,060
What do you think? Is it fun?

1542
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,560
- You can get it evaluated.
- Do you like it?

1543
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,740
We should give it a try.

1544
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,810
- Let's get it evaluated.
- How much is it worth?

1545
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,100
The jegi game.

1546
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,700
How much?

1547
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,220
(1.50 dollars,
there is a similar game.)

1548
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,640
I thought that said 15,000 dollars.

1549
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,640
- There is a similar game.
- There's a similar game.

1550
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,790
So we have to come up
with something new.

1551
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:52,490
What about guessing
whose hair it is?

1552
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,620
Who guesses it?

1553
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,660
It.

1554
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,930
- Who's it?
- The loser.

1555
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:59,520
We all pull out a strand of hair.
Isn't that new?

1556
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,830
We have to guess whose hair it is.

1557
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:02,430
- Is this a DNA test?
- Guess whose hair it is?

1558
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,430
- Is this a CSI game?
- Is this a DNA test?

1559
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:06,330
- Is that from CSI?
- How is that funny?

1560
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,270
- From the smell.
- Who films strands of hair?

1561
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:10,810
How are we going to film it?

1562
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,540
She's still suggesting an idea.

1563
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,950
We're having a meeting.

1564
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,640
Stop being an old fossil.

1565
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,680
- That's not it.
- Oh, I have one.

1566
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,540
How about pot tennis?

1567
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,890
- Let's see if it works.
- Let's try.

1568
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:23,620
(It's the best idea so far.)

1569
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,160
- Did you hear that?
- It works.

1570
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:28,990
Do I catch it?

1571
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:30,180
(Do I catch it?)

1572
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,620
- Hey.
- Is this a catch ball?

1573
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,250
- Are we supposed to catch it?
- Is this a catch ball?

1574
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,220
What are you doing?

1575
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:36,620
- Is this a catch ball?
- You have to hit it.

1576
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,640
- Do I hit it?
- He didn't hit it.

1577
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,290
- What are you doing?
- Why did you catch it?

1578
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,290
- Hit it.
- Hurry up.

1579
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,810
- Hit it and grab it.
- Give it a try.

1580
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,330
Give it a try.

1581
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,740
Just wait.

1582
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,200
- It should be a rally.
- Hit it.

1583
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,450
It's supposed to be a rally.

1584
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,220
- Hey!
- Hit it.

1585
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,310
- Hit it.
- Hit it.

1586
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,350
(Jegi catch ball won't
become a rally.)

1587
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,580
- You have to hit it.
- I will.

1588
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,890
- You have to hit it.
- I'll hit it.

1589
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,490
Why can't you hit it?

1590
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:00,310
How many times
do you have to do it to succeed?

1591
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:01,930
- Ten times.
- What's the rule to win?

1592
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:03,350
But,

1593
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:04,520
he's funny.

1594
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,520
- What's the rule?
- Why do you blame me for trying?

1595
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,520
- What's the rule?
- We should draw the line.

1596
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,930
- We should draw the line.
- We should draw the line.

1597
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:11,200
- Jegi tennis looks fun.
- Yes.

1598
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,100
- What do you think of jegi tennis?
- Try.

1599
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:14,470
It's so fun.

1600
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:15,560
Come on.

1601
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,310
- It's only fun for you?
- It's only fun for you?

1602
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:18,310
Hey.

1603
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:19,910
Hey. It's not fun for us either.

1604
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:22,910
- What are you talking about?
- We're forced to play.

1605
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,370
Jae Suk. How about this?
Since you're having a snack,

1606
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:29,140
we'll all close our eyes...

1607
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,990
and guess which one you're eating.

1608
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:32,890
- Awesome.
- That's so fresh.

1609
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,350
I've never seen anything
like that before.

1610
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,830
- We'll guess what you ate.
- I swear...

1611
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:37,890
that will cost like 15 cents.

1612
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:39,450
- Eat any random snack.
- It'll be 15 cents.

1613
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:40,620
What if he writes,

1614
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,970
"Only the person eating enjoys it."

1615
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,640
- We're not enjoying it either.
- How about...

1616
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,540
you put five in your mouth,

1617
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:50,040
and you have to explain it
until you finish eating.

1618
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:51,330
Like a speed quiz.

1619
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,680
Because you can't talk properly.

1620
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,250
You have to eat it fast.

1621
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,250
A speed quiz.

1622
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,250
- Eat it fast in time?
- While answering,

1623
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,580
you have to eat it fast.

1624
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,490
If you whistle after eating,
you win.

1625
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:05,810
(Punching)

1626
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:07,930
- Wait.
- Why are you talking to me?

1627
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,180
What's that reaction?

1628
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,520
- It won't work.
- What's that reaction?

1629
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,560
What else is there?

1630
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,770
- Hey. We have the best teamwork.
- That's right.

1631
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,740
Hey. Why are you all running away?

1632
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,560
(Running away)

1633
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,810
- Look at them.
- That's ridiculous.

1634
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:24,930
- Is it fun or not?
- How about...

1635
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:28,040
one person stands here
and the rest line up.

1636
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,080
We pass the ball with a header.

1637
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,450
- Let's try.
- With this?

1638
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,040
If the last person grabs it
and says,

1639
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,450
"Go, go, let's go." Then we win.

1640
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,560
That's so fresh.

1641
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,560
What do you think?

1642
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,680
Like Pac-Man game.

1643
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,830
Something that involves
product placement.

1644
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:44,220
Let's eat fried chicken
for product placement...

1645
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,720
- and have a speed quiz.
- A speed quiz.

1646
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,720
Until you finish the fried chicken.

1647
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,330
- And we measure time.
- Let's do product placement.

1648
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,540
And the number of answers.
What do you say?

1649
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,740
You have a speed quiz
while having fried chicken.

1650
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:58,200
We set the time and finish
fried chicken within that time.

1651
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,930
Hurry up and write it.

1652
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:01,850
That's worth more
than 1,000 dollars...

1653
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:02,950
because it involves
product placement.

1654
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:04,410
- Hurry up and write it.
- That's worth more than 500.

1655
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:05,850
It also involves product placement.
It's nice.

1656
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,390
- It will be worth 1,000 dollars.
- Write it already.

1657
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:09,890
(Whispering)

1658
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,680
Write what you think.
Don't ask the person next to you.

1659
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,060
It's okay. We can make money
from product placement.

1660
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:17,330
(200 dollars)

1661
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,430
- Really? 200 dollars?
- I still got 200 dollars.

1662
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,120
- Let's try it.
- Yes. Let's try.

1663
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,290
You don't have to do it.
Just share your ideas.

1664
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:24,140
- Only the ideas?
- It's a good idea.

1665
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,430
- Really?
- We only have to share our ideas?

1666
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,000
- We don't have to do it?
- I earned 200 dollars.

1667
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,770
- We don't have to do it?
- Really?

1668
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:31,930
- Only the idea.
- Hey.

1669
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:33,700
- Line up.
- Everyone. Jump off.

1670
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,450
What if we jump off
with our heads down?

1671
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:36,810
Wouldn't that be fun?

1672
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,020
No variety show has ever tried that.

1673
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,580
How about we all line up...

1674
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,850
and slap each other with a smile on?

1675
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,720
The person who cries has to pay
a dollar.

1676
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,810
- Let's do it.
- What?

1677
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:47,290
The person who cries has to pay
a dollar.

1678
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,990
(They demonstrate it right away.)

1679
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,200
- Stand here.
- What do you think?

1680
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,790
- What do you think?
- We didn't have to try?

1681
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:55,290
We only have to explain it.

1682
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,790
- It's a popular computer game.
- A lot of people play it now.

1683
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:00,370
- What's this?
- What is it?

1684
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,270
It's pretty simple.

1685
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:04,640
You use the mouse to move it.

1686
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,930
Are we playing the game?

1687
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,580
You can play it at any time.

1688
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,750
(A jar game where you have to
pass the obstacle using the mouse)

1689
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:12,540
- I see. Okay.
- What?

1690
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,540
You just have to pass that tree.

1691
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,950
- Here?
- Yes.

1692
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,990
(If he passes that tree,
he wins 500 dollars right away.)

1693
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:19,410
- How do you do it?
- How does it work?

1694
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:21,180
- You have to hang it.
- You have to hang it.

1695
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,620
I see.

1696
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:25,520
Or you can't pass the tree?

1697
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,430
- Just like that.
- Do it one more time.

1698
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,520
There.

1699
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,930
(It may look easy,
but it will upset you.)

1700
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,470
Oh, gosh.

1701
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:34,370
It's not easy to pass the tree.

1702
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,540
(He slowly gets frustrated
and angry.)

1703
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,080
I'm actually pretty good at games.

1704
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,750
- Really?
- Yes.

1705
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:42,500
I don't use it in the gym.

1706
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:45,040
Wait.

1707
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,580
Do you even know how to play?

1708
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:48,950
It doesn't seem like
you know how to play.

1709
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,520
It's my first time.

1710
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,910
You said...

1711
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:55,330
- you feel confident.
- Yes.

1712
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:56,890
You have to go up.

1713
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:58,430
You have to get on the tree.

1714
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:00,660
That's right. You finally hung it.

1715
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,870
Bite the branch with your teeth.

1716
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,790
How did this guy end up in a jar?

1717
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:08,100
What's wrong with him?

1718
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,540
- Just do it.
- I don't understand this game.

1719
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,330
He can just break the jar with it.

1720
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:14,470
Exactly.

1721
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:17,540
Why did he go in there
with a hammer?

1722
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:20,120
He can just break the jar
with that hammer.

1723
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,350
You shouldn't take that long.

1724
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:22,350
- You got it.
- You got it.

1725
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:24,080
If you let it go,
he'll get stuck in it.

1726
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,160
Yes.

1727
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,990
- Let go of his arms.
- I got it.

1728
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,060
- You did it.
- I'm up here.

1729
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,720
You got that far.
You just have to hang it right.

1730
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,520
- You did it.
- It went up.

1731
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,790
Now hang it. That's right.

1732
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:38,060
Now, go over it.

1733
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,200
I should move.

1734
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,640
Take it slow.

1735
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,870
You can go up.

1736
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,810
Hang it.

1737
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,670
(Jae Suk becomes nervous when he
just needs to go over the tree.)

1738
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,250
- You did it!
- I went over.

1739
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,750
(He went over the tree.)

1740
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,190
(He wins 500 dollars.)

1741
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,250
- I went over the tree.
- You got 500 dollars for that.

1742
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,960
Jae Suk.

1743
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,080
- Good job.
- Well done.

1744
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,520
If you pass the next round,
you get another 500 dollars.

1745
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,020
Do I get 500 dollars for this round?

1746
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,250
- If you pass the rocky mountain?
- How much do we have left?

1747
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,830
- Hey. What's that?
- No.

1748
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,290
Fried chicken is here.

1749
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:16,960
This must be the fried chicken.

1750
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,940
- It must be new.
- That looks good.

1751
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,000
Amazing.

1752
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,940
How are we supposed to do it
without saying any words?

1753
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,350
Use your expression...

1754
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:26,440
- and exclamations.
- Only exclamations.

1755
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,810
(Support Production Cost:
Worth up to 500 dollars)

1756
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,120
It smells so nice.

1757
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,140
(Only facial expressions
and exclamations are allowed.)

1758
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,140
It smells so nice.

1759
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,810
- Is it good?
- It's good. You should try it.

1760
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,850
Describe it only with your facial
expression and exclamations.

1761
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:39,580
(Cock-a-doodle-doo)

1762
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,580
(A philosophical reaction to
represent the sacrificed chicken)

1763
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,660
Did you become a chicken?

1764
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:43,350
Are you a chicken?

1765
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:47,270
(Peep peep)

1766
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:50,190
(Everyone's making facial
expressions and exclamations...)

1767
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:51,330
(with no specific words.)

1768
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:53,500
- It's still warm.
- It's sweet.

1769
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,600
It's savory.

1770
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,540
(The small fortune-teller
seems to be possessed.)

1771
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,710
I like it.

1772
00:56:58,710 --> 00:56:59,710
(The small fortune-teller
seems to be possessed.)

1773
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,520
Here.

1774
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,710
- Yes.
- It's really good.

1775
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:04,980
It's stuck.

1776
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,390
(Laughing)

1777
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,920
Do you understand
why people play that game?

1778
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:10,960
If you pass it, you get 500 dollars.

1779
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,520
(The delighted middle-aged man
is totally into the game.)

1780
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,330
Jong Kook. Calm down.

1781
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:17,330
(Totally immersed)

1782
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:21,270
(What's the definition
of game addiction?)

1783
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,790
(How do we decide it?)

1784
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:25,100
(Kim in his 40s chose the game
over the muscle loss.)

1785
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,730
- No.
- He has a game machine at home...

1786
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:28,980
and spends over five hours
on the game on weekends.

1787
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,210
(Kim in his 40s chose the game
over the muscle loss.)

1788
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,370
I went up so high.
It's unbelievable.

1789
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,310
(Kim in his late 40s)

1790
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,140
This is unbelievable. I got so high.

1791
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,890
- Jong Kook. Are you playing a game?
- Yes.

1792
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:44,560
Jong Kook. This is not a real fight.

1793
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,790
(Everyone is worried
about Jong Kook.)

1794
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:48,790
- Nice.
- It's delicious.

1795
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:52,390
(He hung the hammer.)

1796
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,140
(Nervous)

1797
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,390
Did you get there?

1798
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,810
I went down and climbed up again.

1799
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:00,870
That's worth 500 dollars.

1800
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,000
(If he passes the rocky mountain,
he'll get 500 dollars.)

1801
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,140
You must pass it.

1802
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,210
(If he passes the rocky mountain,
he'll get 500 dollars.)

1803
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:06,100
- You got it.
- You got it.

1804
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,100
(You must pass it.)

1805
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,040
I'm not used to using the mouse.

1806
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,120
(What's the result
of Mr. Kim the game addict?)

1807
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,850
(He barely saves the jar man
who almost fell.)

1808
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,730
- You got it.
- You got it.

1809
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,580
You can do it.

1810
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,600
(Almost there)

1811
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:23,020
Hurry up.

1812
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,370
- Gosh.
- Hurry up.

1813
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,890
- You did it!
- You did it!

1814
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:29,370
- Yes! I did it.
- You did it!

1815
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:30,370
(Jong Kook did it!)

1816
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:32,270
(The impressive result
of the game addict)

1817
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:33,810
That's another 500 dollars.

1818
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:34,910
(The impressive result
of the game addict)

1819
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:35,910
(Remaining time, Remaining fee)

1820
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:36,910
(Jong Kook won 500 dollars.)

1821
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:38,410
Do you understand
why people play that game?

1822
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,370
If you pass it,
you'll get another 500 dollars.

1823
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:42,020
(Laughing)

1824
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,870
Oh, no. Where are you going?

1825
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:44,980
Well...

1826
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,940
Can we have a Feet Washing Ceremony?

1827
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,710
But we just ate.

1828
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:49,810
Feet Washing Ceremony?

1829
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:51,080
- Come on.
- What?

1830
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,830
- Don't you think that's too much?
- That's too much.

1831
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,190
You're going to wash your hands
anyway.

1832
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:55,190
Oh, come on.

1833
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:56,730
Let's have a Feet Washing Ceremony.

1834
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:57,770
But we just ate.

1835
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:58,960
How much is
the Feet Washing Ceremony?

1836
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,500
- How much is it?
- It's 200 dollars.

1837
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,270
- That's not enough.
- Only 200 dollars?

1838
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:04,000
- That's never enough.
- Only 200?

1839
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,170
- That's so cheap.
- Medicine will cost more.

1840
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:08,270
You could wash your loving friend's
feet without getting paid.

1841
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:10,170
- That's not it.
- Here's what we should do.

1842
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,640
Make it 200 dollars per foot.

1843
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,080
His feet stink so bad.

1844
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:18,480
I'll clean between his toes.
Count each toe.

1845
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,390
You should do it.
You can do it for him.

1846
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,480
Do we have latex gloves?

1847
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,850
I can't do it without gloves.

1848
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,830
It's the best
after having fried chicken.

1849
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:31,870
How can he be so shameless?

1850
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:35,190
This is great. My feet are actually
in a bad condition.

1851
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:37,540
Do we have to hold
the Feet Washing Ceremony?

1852
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:38,940
My goodness.

1853
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,140
- I'll be right back.
- What floor is it?

1854
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,310
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk and Suk Jin
move to curse.)

1855
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,370
- I'm ready.
- Can I wash my hands?

1856
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:45,500
(Doctor Jeon is in charge
of the Feet Washing Ceremony.)

1857
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,750
Pour water first.

1858
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,980
- Water first.
- Your toenails are so ugly.

1859
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,420
Hurry up and pour water.

1860
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,710
(She tries to get rid of bacteria
with hot water.)

1861
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:58,290
My goodness.

1862
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:00,560
Both of his big toes are rotten.

1863
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,190
(His two feet are perfectly ripe.)

1864
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,770
It's warm.
Can you pour water up to here?

1865
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:08,040
I think we need to soak your feet,
Se Chan.

1866
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:10,730
I can't wash them now.
We need to soak them first.

1867
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:13,540
Something's floating.

1868
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,500
I'm not joking.
Something is floating.

1869
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,750
- Something is floating, Haha.
- That's called dead skin.

1870
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:19,810
(That's called dead skin.)

1871
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,420
- Try.
- Don't curse me.

1872
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,040
- I won't.
- How can he do that after this?

1873
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,810
But you're doing this
because you love him.

1874
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:28,390
No. This is too much for me.

1875
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:30,920
We're colleagues.
I can wash your feet too.

1876
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,290
(Grabbing)

1877
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:34,460
Gosh.

1878
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:37,100
(Grunting)

1879
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:42,000
(Locking her fingers with his toes)

1880
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,560
What's going on?

1881
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,560
(Delightful Feet Washing Ceremony)

1882
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:49,710
- You see,
- This is disgusting.

1883
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:51,670
that's what a married couple
looks like.

1884
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:53,000
Whatever.

1885
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:56,520
- This is disgusting.
- My goodness.

1886
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,710
(Locking her fingers
with his toes again)

1887
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,390
Poor So Min.

1888
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:03,810
(She massages each of his toes.)

1889
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:08,250
(He expresses how nice it is
by exposing his gum.)

1890
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:10,020
Lift it.

1891
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:16,330
So Min. Thank you for doing this
in the new year.

1892
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,100
My colleague is washing my feet.
I'll wash your feet too.

1893
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:20,330
I'm good.

1894
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,670
- I'll wash your feet.
- No, I'm good.

1895
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,500
Right. You should wash
each other's feet.

1896
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,270
- No, I'm good.
- Let me do it please.

1897
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:28,920
- I'm good.
- Erase her makeup with that water.

1898
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:30,920
- For 500 dollars.
- For 1,000 dollars.

1899
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:32,810
I'll kill you then.

1900
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,890
(She locks her fingers
with his left toes.)

1901
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:38,460
(He's going crazy
with his colleague's love.)

1902
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,190
Poor So Min.

1903
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:42,390
- Hey. So Min.
- Yes?

1904
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:44,830
My goodness.

1905
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:47,500
Can you smile?

1906
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,670
(Forced smile)

1907
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:49,690
Hey.

1908
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,230
Thank you.

1909
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:53,460
To the end. One foot at a time.

1910
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,480
(She even dries his feet.)

1911
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,770
- The towel. Done.
- Thank you.

1912
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:59,480
It's my first time
to wash anyone's feet.

1913
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,500
I've never done this before.

1914
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,640
This is my first time
aside from my mom. That's good.

1915
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,420
Wait. There's dust.
Is this dust or what?

1916
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,120
- That's good.
- Is that dry skin?

1917
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,810
Thanks.

1918
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,020
- Is that 200 dollars?
- Yes.

1919
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:15,020
My hands feel weird. They're dry.

1920
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,790
Is this okay?
What's wrong with my hands?

1921
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:18,290
Do you want to touch it?
It feels really weird.

1922
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:21,390
This is strange.
I'm getting heated up.

1923
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:22,940
What?

1924
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,290
He's arousing.

1925
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:26,000
- It turned you on.
- Watch your mouth.

1926
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,100
No. That's not it.

1927
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,500
He's turned on.

1928
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,910
- No.
- Gosh.

1929
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:32,640
Jong Kook. Don't be mad.

1930
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,750
(He tries to calm down
while playing the game.)

1931
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,750
I got it.

1932
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:36,440
Oh, I got it.

1933
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:40,940
(His control skill improved
so much.)

1934
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,480
Are you really playing it?

1935
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:48,290
This is why Jong Kook never plays
any games.

1936
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:49,660
He's afraid he'll go crazy.

1937
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:50,660
(The venomous snake never lets it go
once he bites it.)

1938
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:53,690
- Yes. Once I'm into something...
- He finds the way.

1939
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,500
That's right.

1940
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,460
It seems his muscles have
gotten bigger.

1941
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,370
- He worked out.
- He bulked up.

1942
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:00,460
He worked out.

1943
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,330
- Come on.
- That's amazing.

1944
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:04,410
Come on.

1945
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:07,040
What's this? How does this work?

1946
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:09,040
(The dartboard shrine
where you can curse someone)

1947
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,420
Throw the dart
at the target in front of you.

1948
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,660
If you hit the center, you succeed.

1949
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:18,160
The person you choose
gets ten penalty balls.

1950
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:22,850
However, if you hit anywhere
other than the center,

1951
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:27,290
you'll get penalty balls
according to the number on it.

1952
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:28,600
Only here?

1953
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,940
Yes. But you can practice
as much as you want.

1954
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,140
My goodness.

1955
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:34,270
You have only one chance.

1956
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:35,330
(You can practice
as much as you want.)

1957
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:36,410
(But once you go for it,
you only get one chance.)

1958
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:37,810
This isn't going to work.

1959
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:41,940
Before you try, you have to say
the name of the person...

1960
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,350
you want to curse.

1961
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,420
He got it.

1962
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,060
- You didn't say you'll go.
- I know.

1963
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:51,580
I used to play darts so much
in the past.

1964
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:52,750
Can you get out of there?

1965
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,730
(He used to be
the king of dart in Apgujeong.)

1966
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,250
Gosh.

1967
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,390
(Bull's-eye)

1968
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:01,560
- You should've said you'll go.
- My gosh.

1969
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,870
My. I did it again.

1970
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:07,770
(He hit the center twice in a row.)

1971
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:09,540
I used to play darts so much.

1972
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:11,080
I should try.

1973
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,140
All right.

1974
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,710
(He decides to give it a try
right away.)

1975
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:17,350
Say the name of the member
you want to curse and say go.

1976
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:20,890
Who should I curse?
Let's curse the same person.

1977
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,310
- Yes.
- What about Haha?

1978
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:24,390
- Yes, Haha.
- I'll curse Haha.

1979
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:28,120
I'll say go before I try.
This is a practice.

1980
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,250
- You have to say go.
- I'll say go before I do it.

1981
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:31,690
When it's time.

1982
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:33,120
(He plans to practice
and say go when it's time.)

1983
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:35,870
When I finally get it.

1984
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:40,210
I'm getting there.

1985
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:43,210
Okay. I'll go.

1986
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:44,850
(I'll go.)

1987
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:48,940
(Will the old king of dart
save his only chance?)

1988
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:52,020
(He fails.)

1989
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:54,420
(He hits 5.)

1990
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,980
Suk Jin.
You get five penalty balls.

1991
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,620
- I almost had it.
- What are you doing?

1992
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,190
(The king of dart cursed himself.)

1993
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:03,390
I almost had it.

1994
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:04,390
- How do you play?
- What?

1995
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:05,500
Hit the center?

1996
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,890
Do you see the circle in the center?

1997
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:08,960
You have to hit that.

1998
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,500
Gosh. This isn't easy.

1999
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:18,040
(Jae Suk keeps missing the center.)

2000
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,310
(I'll go.)

2001
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:21,370
I'll go.

2002
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:23,270
(Glancing)

2003
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:24,310
Now is time.

2004
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:25,310
Haha?

2005
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:26,920
Suk Jin.

2006
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:28,710
(He curses Suk Jin
in front of him.)

2007
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:29,810
Hey.

2008
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:33,460
(Laughing)

2009
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:35,460
How could you?

2010
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,790
How can you do that?
Fine. Go ahead. Do it.

2011
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:41,270
You're going to fail anyway.

2012
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:52,940
(Bull's-eye)

2013
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:55,940
(Shocked)

2014
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:58,580
Jae Suk did it.

2015
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:02,580
Suk Jin gets ten penalty balls.

2016
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:05,080
(Suk Jin gets 10 penalty balls.)

2017
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,560
- Ten?
- I never thought I'd do it.

2018
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,100
- That was awesome.
- How does that happen?

2019
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,020
- That was amazing.
- I concentrated so much.

2020
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,370
You missed it 9 times out of 10,
and yet you hit it?

2021
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:15,270
(Suk Jin gets
15 penalty balls alone.)

2022
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:17,690
I'll go. Whose name should I say?

2023
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:19,270
Suk Jin.

2024
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:21,640
- Say you'll go.
- Suk Jin. I'll go.

2025
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:23,310
I'll go. Suk Jin.

2026
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:25,310
- She keeps failing.
- I'll go. Suk Jin!

2027
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:27,100
- Hey.
- That's all yours.

2028
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,120
- That's all yours.
- That's a negative ten.

2029
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,020
- She gets a negative ten.
- Is that all on me?

2030
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,020
- Yes.
- Yes.

2031
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,020
You cursed yourself.

2032
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:35,420
If you miss it, it goes to you.

2033
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,920
Come on. Yes.

2034
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:39,290
Yes.

2035
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:41,330
Somebody stop Jong Kook.
He's going crazy.

2036
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:43,600
- He's about to...
- He's about to spend money on it.

2037
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,000
He's going crazy.

2038
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,870
- Jong Kook. You should stop.
- I said he can stop, but he won't.

2039
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,500
- Stop playing.
- Come on.

2040
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,460
The man in the jar is begging us
to save him.

2041
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,870
If he gets on the red bar,
he gets 500 dollars.

2042
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:56,210
(If he passes the red bar,
that's an additional 500 dollars.)

2043
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:58,910
Hang on. That punk.

2044
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,890
(Pro Gamer Kim moves the mouse
a few times.)

2045
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:08,920
- He did it.
- I got it. I'm on it.

2046
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,390
(He succeeds easily.)

2047
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,660
- I'm on it.
- You get 500 dollars.

2048
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:13,690
(He gets additional 500 dollars.)

2049
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:15,600
- How much...
- I know what to do.

2050
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,290
- How much have you earned?
- What?

2051
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:18,460
- Didn't you earn a lot?
- I earned a lot.

2052
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:20,420
- Please stop playing.
- Shall I stop?

2053
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:21,600
I got the hang of it.

2054
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,640
It's such a difficult game.

2055
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:25,170
We earned more than 1,000 dollars.

2056
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,670
- How much did we pay off?
- You paid off 4,100 dollars.

2057
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:28,810
That's good.

2058
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,500
What can we do now?

2059
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,000
- You can either work or...
- How about missions?

2060
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,440
Five chances remain for missions.

2061
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,310
- Shall we try Immortal Chan Hee?
- Immortal Chan Hee?

2062
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:37,770
Let's try it.

2063
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:39,640
- We should try all the missions.
- That's right.

2064
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,940
The camera will move this way.

2065
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:43,350
I remember playing this game
in the early days.

2066
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,890
- That's right.
- We played this game.

2067
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,520
Once you say, "Start..."

2068
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,250
All of us need to be in the angle...

2069
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:49,660
- once the camera moves.
- That's right.

2070
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:50,690
- Left.
- Let's practice.

2071
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:51,790
- Right.
- It's just our faces, right?

2072
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:53,170
It's just your faces.

2073
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:55,500
As soon as the camera stops,

2074
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,440
- I will count down three seconds.
- Okay.

2075
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,640
You succeed if all of your faces are
in the angle.

2076
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,770
Wouldn't we succeed if we move back?

2077
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:02,000
Tall people should move back.

2078
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,500
- Ji Hyo and I...
- I think it will be easy.

2079
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,870
The time frame will be very tight.

2080
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:06,410
- So Min should go down.
- I just think...

2081
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:07,910
you should look at the angle
and judge for yourself.

2082
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:09,020
- So Min.
- Let's go.

2083
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:12,390
Once you yell "Start,"
you will lose one chance.

2084
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,250
In 1, 2, 3.

2085
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:16,350
- Start.
- Start.

2086
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,480
It's going to the right.

2087
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,850
- Down.
- Look at the top.

2088
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:22,190
Look at the camera.

2089
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:23,330
It's going to the right.

2090
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:25,000
Up. Down.

2091
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,870
- Down.
- Look at the top.

2092
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:28,940
- Look at the camera.
- The camera.

2093
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:30,960
- Three,
- It stopped.

2094
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,560
two, one.

2095
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:35,430
Three, two, one.

2096
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:38,210
(Se Chan's facial features
aren't visible.)

2097
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:39,410
You failed.

2098
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:41,470
- Why?
- We were in the angle.

2099
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:42,640
My knees.

2100
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,840
My knees hurt.

2101
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,720
- We were in the angle.
- My knees hurt.

2102
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,720
Chan Hee, you made this
impossible for us.

2103
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:48,810
- Seriously.
- Chan Hee.

2104
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:50,220
We were in the angle.

2105
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:51,510
- That was too difficult.
- We were in the angle.

2106
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:52,980
Chan Hee, you are too much.

2107
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:53,980
Chan Hee.

2108
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:55,520
You completed the mission too late.

2109
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:57,390
- Did we complete it too late?
- You should look at the angle,

2110
01:08:57,390 --> 01:08:58,890
not the screen.

2111
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:00,060
For goodness' sake.

2112
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:01,670
You lost one chance.

2113
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,370
I think this is doable.

2114
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:04,470
- I know.
- Does that mean...

2115
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:06,010
- we lost a chance?
- Yes. Four chances remain.

2116
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:07,300
Only four chances remain.

2117
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,300
- We need to complete this mission.
- Shall we try again?

2118
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:10,680
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2119
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:11,880
- Say, "Start."
- Start.

2120
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,910
- Start.
- Start.

2121
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:14,970
Look at the camera. That's better.

2122
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:16,220
- Okay.
- Look at the camera.

2123
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:19,010
He tends to point the camera
to a corner.

2124
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,620
Go!

2125
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:22,760
- Three, two, one.
- Is my face showing?

2126
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:24,180
He tends to point the camera
to a corner.

2127
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:27,180
(The camera pointed to a corner.
What will be the result?)

2128
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,390
One.

2129
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:30,160
- I fell down.
- You failed.

2130
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,690
- Why did we fail?
- Hey.

2131
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:33,090
- Go!
- Three,

2132
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,330
- two,
- Is my face showing?

2133
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:35,340
one.

2134
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:36,340
(On the floor)

2135
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,340
You failed.

2136
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:38,600
- Why did we fail?
- Hey.

2137
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,910
- She fell down.
- She fell down.

2138
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,930
So Min, I am sorry.

2139
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:44,180
I slipped.

2140
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,940
- My goodness.
- Are you okay?

2141
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:47,300
I slipped. I am sorry.

2142
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,080
I thought we were successful.
Didn't we succeed?

2143
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,180
So Min was nowhere to be seen.

2144
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,440
So Min wasn't in the snapshot.

2145
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,620
So Min, were you nowhere to be seen?

2146
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:54,290
So Min even washed Se Chan's feet.

2147
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:55,850
So Min, were you nowhere to be seen?

2148
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:56,850
(Giggling)

2149
01:09:56,850 --> 01:09:58,010
"Were you nowhere to be seen?"

2150
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:00,590
(She makes him quiet
with a forced fist bump.)

2151
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:01,720
- In that case...
- We were close.

2152
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:02,830
Right.

2153
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:04,460
It can't be helped. Let's stop.

2154
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:05,560
Let's try it one more time.

2155
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,000
- Really?
- Let's try it one more time.

2156
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:09,000
Let's try it one more time.
I will do well this time.

2157
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:10,470
We tried it multiple times already.

2158
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,930
- We are invested. Let's try it.
- Okay.

2159
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:14,540
Just look at the camera.

2160
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:16,080
- That's right.
- Just look at the camera.

2161
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,180
(They try it for the third time.)

2162
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:18,270
- Just look at the camera.
- Say, "Start."

2163
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:19,300
- Start.
- Start.

2164
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:21,140
- Just look at the camera.
- Look carefully.

2165
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:22,270
If he points the camera upward...

2166
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:23,940
- That's impossible.
- Spider-Man.

2167
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,310
We can't go midair.

2168
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:26,440
Just look at the camera.

2169
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:28,620
- Three,
- Down!

2170
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:30,050
two, one.

2171
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:33,220
- Where am I?
- We succeeded?

2172
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:34,380
- Where am I?
- You failed.

2173
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:35,960
- Why...
- So Min, where are you?

2174
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,090
- Where am I?
- You failed.

2175
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:38,670
- Why...
- So Min, where are you?

2176
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:40,260
- I am here.
- Why didn't you look at the camera?

2177
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:41,760
This is driving me crazy.

2178
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:42,930
- The camera.
- The camera.

2179
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,060
It's impossible to like her!

2180
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:47,260
Why did you hide from the camera?

2181
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:49,800
Why did you hide your face?

2182
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:52,600
Why did you hide?

2183
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:54,300
Are you an X-Man?

2184
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:55,840
- So Min, don't look at the screen.
- Don't look at the screen.

2185
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,010
Look at the camera.

2186
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:58,980
Why did you look at the GoPro?

2187
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:00,590
Hold on.

2188
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,480
Shouldn't So Min be a referee?

2189
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,290
Are you an Ax-Man?

2190
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:05,480
- Ax-Man?
- Ax-Man?

2191
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,380
Are you an Ax-Man?

2192
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:08,500
- Ax-Man?
- Ax-Man?

2193
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,350
- Ax-Man?
- That was obviously intentional.

2194
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,520
Ax-Man?

2195
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,560
That was obviously intentional.

2196
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,870
- You keep doing that.
- Do you admit it?

2197
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:16,000
- My goodness.
- Don't be ridiculous.

2198
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,170
You are an Ax-Man.

2199
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:18,470
(He tried to make the fourth video
about his verbal blunders.)

2200
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:19,760
- That was so obvious.
- You are embarrassed, right?

2201
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,010
Seriously.

2202
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,710
"Ax-Man" was obviously intentional.

2203
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:24,630
Do you keep in touch...

2204
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:26,840
with the person who is in charge
of the official YouTube channel?

2205
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,720
"We need two more verbal blunders
to create another video."

2206
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:30,940
(We need two more verbal blunders
to create another video.)

2207
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:31,940
Ax-Man.

2208
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:33,620
- Let's try it for the last time.
- The last time.

2209
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:35,380
I will use a curse
on the member who fails this time.

2210
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:36,380
- Okay.
- Okay.

2211
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,290
Aren't we out of chances?

2212
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:39,630
Two chances remain.

2213
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:40,680
I think we will succeed this time.

2214
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:41,890
- Let's do this.
- After this,

2215
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:44,330
- we can make money through labor.
- Yes.

2216
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:46,800
- Will we be able to succeed?
- I am so nervous.

2217
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,000
We can do it.

2218
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,430
(They try again with perseverance.)

2219
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:50,670
Chan Hee.

2220
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:52,410
- Down.
- Hey.

2221
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:54,300
- Down.
- Hey.

2222
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:56,100
- Three, two,
- I am in the angle, right?

2223
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,130
one.

2224
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:58,640
- Down.
- Hey.

2225
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:01,180
- Three, two, one.
- I am in the angle, right?

2226
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:03,840
Are they in the angle?

2227
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,250
(What will be the result
of their last attempt?)

2228
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,140
- Okay.
- Okay.

2229
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:08,290
(They finally succeed.)

2230
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:09,380
You succeeded.

2231
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,620
I lifted up your face.

2232
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:12,220
We struggled because of the Ax-Man.

2233
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:13,380
Ax-Man.

2234
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,830
It's okay.

2235
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,830
We did it. We succeeded, So Min.

2236
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:19,560
I am happy that you succeeded.

2237
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,970
You made 4,600 dollars so far.

2238
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:23,870
I can't believe
we only made 4,600 dollars.

2239
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:25,760
Is that all we have?
I will slice the rice cake.

2240
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,010
I will slice the rice cake.

2241
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,930
- So Min and I will slice the rice cakes.
- Which game can we play?

2242
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,540
We need to hurry up and work.

2243
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,300
Only one chance remains.

2244
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,750
There is a simple game we recommend.

2245
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:35,840
Okay. That sounds good.

2246
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,220
It's the last chance.

2247
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:41,180
All seven members need to take turns
to bounce the ball once.

2248
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:43,420
Then the seventh member
needs to score a goal.

2249
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:44,980
- That sounds simple.
- We can do it.

2250
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:46,930
- Okay.
- I think we can do it.

2251
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:48,760
- You can't bounce it twice.
- Just once.

2252
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:50,690
We need to go in the right order.

2253
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:52,970
- Who will score a goal?
- You don't need to go first.

2254
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:54,190
- I will go first.
- So Min.

2255
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:56,230
- Sit next to her.
- To do it like Ji Hyo,

2256
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:57,590
bounce it high.

2257
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:58,710
There you go.

2258
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,930
- Do we bounce it twice?
- Once.

2259
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:02,340
- It's my turn.
- Ji Hyo.

2260
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:03,430
There you go.

2261
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:04,840
Put it in there.

2262
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,440
- That doesn't count.
- Doesn't it count?

2263
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:09,120
- That doesn't count.
- Doesn't it count?

2264
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:10,720
- Why not?
- It went in.

2265
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,250
- Why not?
- It was a dunk shot.

2266
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:13,790
- Why not?
- It was a dunk shot.

2267
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:15,460
You held the ball for two seconds.

2268
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,850
We didn't say, "Start."

2269
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:19,480
It was a practice round.

2270
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,520
- Let's do it like that.
- Okay.

2271
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,850
- Pass.
- Let's go. Start.

2272
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:23,890
- Start.
- Already?

2273
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:25,050
- Pass it over.
- Go.

2274
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:26,560
Is this an actual round?

2275
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,800
Let's practice once more.

2276
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,370
- Let's practice once more.
- Once more.

2277
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:31,430
Is this a practice round
or an actual round?

2278
01:13:31,630 --> 01:13:33,010
- Start.
- Which one is it?

2279
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:36,510
All right. We told you.

2280
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:38,910
- It was a practice round.
- A practice round.

2281
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:39,910
- It was a practice round.
- Yes.

2282
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:41,340
- Jae Suk told you.
- We told you.

2283
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,270
- We told you.
- We told you.

2284
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:45,620
It's an actual round
when we say "Start" together.

2285
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:46,680
What?

2286
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,940
- It was a practice round.
- We didn't say, "Start."

2287
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,010
What's the problem?

2288
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:50,420
- Start.
- Why are you so sensitive?

2289
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:51,790
- Start.
- Go.

2290
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:53,430
- Start.
- Go.

2291
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:54,980
- Is this an actual round?
- Is this an actual round?

2292
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,000
- Shall we go?
- Start.

2293
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Let's say it together.

2294
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,160
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2295
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,190
- Start.
- Start.

2296
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:04,890
Go. That's good. Slowly.

2297
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:07,470
Hey.

2298
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:09,180
(Suk Jin's toss was shaky.)

2299
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:10,910
Put it in there.

2300
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:14,410
(They failed.)

2301
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:15,750
Put it in there.

2302
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,310
(They can't even protest.)

2303
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:19,720
- We failed.
- That was...

2304
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:20,790
- Suk Jin, sit here.
- You messed up.

2305
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,180
- Suk Jin.
- It wasn't like that.

2306
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:23,590
- Listen.
- Ji Hyo passed it badly.

2307
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:24,620
Here.

2308
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:26,050
- You need to keep it short.
- Bounce it like this.

2309
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:27,050
- Like this.
- That's right.

2310
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:28,830
You need to keep it short.

2311
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:32,170
If someone gets five penalty balls,
I will let you try again.

2312
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:33,500
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

2313
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:34,930
- Why me?
- You send it far.

2314
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:36,690
- Ji Hyo passed it badly.
- Let's have a vote then.

2315
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:37,840
Who should receive
five penalty balls?

2316
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,410
- In 1, 2, 3,
- In 1, 2, 3,

2317
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:40,410
- You.
- It's you, Suk Jin.

2318
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:41,510
(Swearing)

2319
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:42,910
Come on.

2320
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,470
You got picked.

2321
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:46,800
- You made everyone vote for me.
- What is your problem?

2322
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,340
- Let's have a fair vote.
- Come on.

2323
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:50,550
- What is your problem?
- Suk Jin, do well just this once.

2324
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:51,680
- What are you talking about?
- Aren't you an Ax-Man?

2325
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,010
- Just this once.
- What are you talking about?

2326
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:54,640
- You seem like an Ax-Man.
- Ax-Man.

2327
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:56,590
- Ax-Man.
- I will receive five penalty balls.

2328
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:58,090
- Let's go.
- Ax-Man.

2329
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:00,350
(They resume after Suk Jin receives
5 penalty balls.)

2330
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:01,660
All right.

2331
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:04,330
- I will pass to Haha.
- Ji Hyo.

2332
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:06,330
- Haha.
- All right.

2333
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:07,690
- We did it.
- We did it.

2334
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:10,130
For goodness' sake!

2335
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:11,390
We didn't say, "Start."

2336
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:12,510
- We didn't say, "Start."
- No.

2337
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:13,710
We didn't say it.

2338
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,300
- They are incredible.
- We didn't say, "Start."

2339
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,100
Keep the ball in here.

2340
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:19,680
- We didn't say, "Start."
- Here.

2341
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,880
- Let's go.
- Start.

2342
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,140
- in 1, 2, 3.
- in 1, 2, 3. Start.

2343
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:23,970
Go ahead.

2344
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:27,480
Keep going like that.

2345
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:28,720
- Keep going like that.
- There you go.

2346
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:29,850
- That's good.
- Good job.

2347
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:30,880
- We got this.
- It will go in.

2348
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,790
(They failed again.)

2349
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:34,960
- We didn't say "Start" properly.
- We didn't say it.

2350
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:35,960
We didn't say it properly.

2351
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,830
- We didn't say it.
- This is our strategy.

2352
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:39,470
I wanted to see
how you would react. Good job.

2353
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:40,890
If someone gets penalty balls,

2354
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:42,560
- I will give you one last chance.
- One last chance.

2355
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,040
Haha should get them since he said
he is good at basketball.

2356
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,760
If I had said
that I am good at soccer,

2357
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,600
I would have gotten
the penalty balls.

2358
01:15:49,730 --> 01:15:51,210
- It goes without saying.
- Haha?

2359
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:52,840
- I would have gotten them.
- No!

2360
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,470
- You deserve five penalty balls.
- Go ahead.

2361
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:56,770
Then I will give you
two curses each.

2362
01:15:57,050 --> 01:15:59,250
- That's 20 penalty balls each.
- Don't be like that.

2363
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:00,680
- Go ahead.
- From here...

2364
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,350
- Jong Kook should go last.
- Jong Kook.

2365
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:04,180
- It's difficult.
- I will do it.

2366
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:05,630
- It's difficult.
- Because of that hole,

2367
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:06,980
it's impossible to score a goal.

2368
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,160
It's too small.

2369
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:09,390
What are you doing?

2370
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:10,390
Can't I stretch it?

2371
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:12,560
- Don't do that.
- Leave it as it is.

2372
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,330
- It won't go in.
- Leave it as it is.

2373
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,340
- Let me stretch it.
- Leave it as it is.

2374
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:18,630
- It won't go in.
- What are you doing?

2375
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:20,470
- Come on.
- You know,

2376
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:22,930
this is exactly why
Suk Jin can't win the Grand Award.

2377
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:25,010
I can't believe him.

2378
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:26,800
- It won't work.
- It won't go in.

2379
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,440
It went in. Watch.

2380
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,250
It was much harder
when the opening was like this.

2381
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:33,140
- It didn't go in.
- You are doing it wrong.

2382
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,880
(He hit it hard on purpose.)

2383
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,460
You hit it hard.

2384
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:38,510
Come on.

2385
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:39,680
I am telling you
it's better this way.

2386
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,720
- Watch.
- Even if we succeed...

2387
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:42,930
See? It's nearly impossible.

2388
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:45,000
Even if we succeed,
you will get criticized.

2389
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,060
It works better this way. Trust me.

2390
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:50,060
- See? It goes in more easily.
- Sit there.

2391
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:51,390
- Try it.
- It goes in more easily.

2392
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:52,840
- It doesn't matter, right?
- It doesn't matter.

2393
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,100
- It's because...
- Try it.

2394
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:55,730
- Try it.
- Try it.

2395
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,680
I will give you a curse if you fail.

2396
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,770
- This way,
- It's the last chance.

2397
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:01,010
the ball will bounce more.

2398
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:02,440
- Start.
- The edges...

2399
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,880
It will bounce off the edges.

2400
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,440
- It's better this way.
- It's better this way.

2401
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,590
It's science.

2402
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,250
Use your hands only.

2403
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,180
(It's the last chance.
Will they manage to succeed?)

2404
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:13,460
Hey.

2405
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:14,590
Pass it.

2406
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:16,190
All right.

2407
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,330
All right.

2408
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:20,500
All right.

2409
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:23,040
(Ax-Man had a grand plan.)

2410
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,890
(Will he succeed?)

2411
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:27,710
- Gosh.
- You failed.

2412
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:28,880
(He failed.)

2413
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:29,930
You failed.

2414
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:32,080
- What was that?
- You tossed the ball wrong.

2415
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,770
You should have bounced it
on the spot.

2416
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:35,620
- Let's slice rice cake.
- It's impossible.

2417
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,550
- Gosh.
- The current time...

2418
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:40,250
- is 2:40 p.m.
- For goodness' sake.

2419
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:41,720
Let's do labor.
We will slice rice cake.

2420
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:43,310
- We will slice rice cake.
- Let's slice rice cake.

2421
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:44,980
How do we slice the cake?

2422
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:48,800
We will pay you 50 dollars
for every bag of sliced rice cake.

2423
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,930
Every bag?

2424
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:52,220
The rest of the members
should write New Year's cards.

2425
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:55,590
Let's be happy always.

2426
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:56,760
In the new year...

2427
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:59,340
You currently have 5,700 dollars
and 10 minutes remaining.

2428
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:01,130
- What?
- Did you say ten minutes?

2429
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:03,510
If the race ends this way,
three members will get the penalty.

2430
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:04,970
(Remaining time: 10 minutes
Fee: 1,376.50 dollars)

2431
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:06,800
(They need to make 300 dollars more
to lessen the number by 1.)

2432
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,580
Hold on. In that case,

2433
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:12,840
why don't we kick jegi 100 times?

2434
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:14,510
That's a good idea.

2435
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:15,550
In total?

2436
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:17,050
We will kick jegi 100 times
in total.

2437
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:18,680
We will do that for 300 dollars.

2438
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,720
I will let you do that.

2439
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,660
Okay. Clear the table.

2440
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,160
- Clear the table.
- Let's kick jegi.

2441
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,020
We need to kick jegi
100 times in total.

2442
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:26,170
How will we do that?

2443
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:27,390
- Did you say 100 times?
- It's doable.

2444
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:29,340
- You came up with a good idea.
- It's doable.

2445
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:31,540
- Clear the table.
- There are seven of us, so yes.

2446
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:32,930
- Did you say 100 times?
- There are 7 of us,

2447
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:34,540
- so it's doable.
- Of course.

2448
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:36,540
- You can't catch it.
- Good.

2449
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:37,710
We can't catch it?

2450
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:38,910
Se Chan is good at it.

2451
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:40,550
We can't catch it?

2452
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,310
Then I am a bit nervous.

2453
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:44,140
- Then...
- All right.

2454
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:46,090
- Let's go.
- Hey.

2455
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,090
It's the last try of the day.

2456
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:51,260
- Let's say, "Start."
- In 1, 2,

2457
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,760
- three.
- Start.

2458
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:55,130
One person can catch it once.

2459
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:57,220
- Okay.
- You can't catch it afterward.

2460
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:58,460
I will go first.

2461
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:00,500
- This isn't a practice round.
- Okay.

2462
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:03,130
- No more practice rounds.
- One.

2463
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,300
One.

2464
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:05,510
(She kicked it 1 time.)

2465
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:07,060
One.

2466
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:08,430
(Oh.)

2467
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:09,430
Good job.

2468
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:10,540
It's okay. Good job.

2469
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:11,730
- So Min.
- It happens.

2470
01:19:11,730 --> 01:19:12,750
- Gosh.
- All right.

2471
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,750
- So Min.
- I think I will kick it once.

2472
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,270
So Min kicked it
three times earlier.

2473
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:20,940
Three. Good job.

2474
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:22,460
- How many times did she kick it?
- Three times.

2475
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:23,550
The total is four.

2476
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,050
Currently, the total is four.

2477
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:26,520
- You need to kick it 96 times.
- That's not a lot.

2478
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,520
(They need to kick it 96 times.)

2479
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,660
How many times? 96 times?

2480
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:30,720
- Here I go.
- We can do it.

2481
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,720
Good luck.

2482
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,220
- This is nothing.
- You are right.

2483
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:35,630
- You can kick it 50 times.
- How many times?

2484
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:36,760
- How many times?
- You need to kick it 96 times.

2485
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,130
- The remaining number is 96.
- Will it be okay?

2486
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:40,340
- You can kick it 100 times.
- Jong Kook, kick it 30 times.

2487
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:42,910
- Will it be okay?
- Give us some screen time.

2488
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:44,630
Viewers won't like it
if I succeed at once.

2489
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:45,940
Of course not.

2490
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:47,050
Will it be okay?

2491
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:49,970
Jong Kook, the more you talk,
the more nervous you seem.

2492
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:51,620
- I will kick it 50 times.
- Okay.

2493
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,750
There won't be any suspense
if I kick it too many times, right?

2494
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:56,620
- All right.
- How do I usually kick jegi?

2495
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:57,960
- Just kick it.
- I don't remember.

2496
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,550
Okay. Here I go. This is nothing.

2497
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:14,000
- There you go.
- Counting 3, 4,

2498
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,370
- There you go.
- five...

2499
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:18,040
- There you go.
- Four, five...

2500
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,910
(The end)

2501
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,580
Hey!

2502
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:24,380
(What was that?)

2503
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:25,530
Gosh.

2504
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:27,420
(Hey!)

2505
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:28,420
What? Didn't you say 50 times?

2506
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:29,830
I should have known
from the way he talked too much.

2507
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:31,070
- You know,
- Seriously.

2508
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:33,400
I overdid it in the beginning.

2509
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,590
- Five.
- It wasn't my usual rhythm.

2510
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:38,830
The remaining number is 91.

2511
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:40,040
Fourteen. He is just doing it.

2512
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,830
- You are good.
- Counting 16, 17,

2513
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:44,370
- eighteen, nineteen, twenty,
- Why didn't you do that earlier?

2514
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:46,610
twenty-one, twenty-two,
twenty-three.

2515
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:48,980
- For goodness' sake.
- You are good at it.

2516
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,490
All right.
The remaining number is 91.

2517
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:53,210
(Suk Jin is up next.)

2518
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:55,910
You are the king of jegi.

2519
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:57,830
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Darn.

2520
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:59,730
- Darn.
- Darn.

2521
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:00,900
- Seriously.
- Darn.

2522
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,500
- He is the real deal.
- You are young.

2523
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:06,230
People who pull up their socks
can kick jegi more than 30 times.

2524
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:08,790
- That's what uncles do...
- More than 30 times.

2525
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:10,590
- during the holidays.
- Always.

2526
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:13,500
Yes. They do this
before they show off to the kids.

2527
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,610
The honorable and young Ax-Man.

2528
01:21:15,610 --> 01:21:16,610
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2529
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:18,150
Why am I so nervous?

2530
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:19,870
- It's nerve-racking.
- You are sporty.

2531
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:21,210
I am so nervous.

2532
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:22,510
You are sporty.

2533
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,510
- Here I go.
- Go.

2534
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:26,840
- Start.
- Okay.

2535
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,250
All right. He is good.

2536
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:32,080
- He is steady.
- That's good.

2537
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:34,290
Go slow.

2538
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:35,920
- Go slow.
- He doesn't disappoint.

2539
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,920
- Go slow.
- Take this to the end.

2540
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,900
- That's good.
- Don't give up until the end.

2541
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:42,130
- His record is 19.
- Good job.

2542
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:43,130
(The Honorary Employee
defended his honor.)

2543
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:45,040
- Uncle is the best.
- Good job.

2544
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,300
- You know...
- You did so well.

2545
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,580
- Good job.
- I kicked it 19 times.

2546
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:49,110
- Good job.
- That was incredible.

2547
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:51,000
- Good job.
- You did so well.

2548
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,700
- Good job.
- The last kick was off.

2549
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:55,040
- Good job.
- The remaining number is 72.

2550
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,150
- What?
- Did you say 72?

2551
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:58,510
- You can do it.
- Se Chan is good at kicking jegi.

2552
01:21:58,510 --> 01:22:00,120
- Se Chan is good at it.
- Se Chan, do what you want.

2553
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,320
- That's right.
- Se Chan.

2554
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,750
- My goodness.
- Se Chan.

2555
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:04,050
Just kick it 40 times.

2556
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:05,750
You will look cool
if you kick it many times.

2557
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:07,790
- He looks cool already.
- He is good.

2558
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,330
- You are going too fast.
- Counting five,

2559
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:14,440
six, seven, eight,

2560
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,940
nine, ten,

2561
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:20,610
- eleven, twelve...
- Gosh!

2562
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:22,910
(The remaining number is 72,
but he only kicked it 12 times.)

2563
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:26,150
I really did my best.

2564
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:27,910
- I am serious.
- Hey!

2565
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:29,280
What was that?

2566
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,320
- It should be a close call.
- I think...

2567
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,820
Haha should go next,
and Jae Suk should go last.

2568
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:37,210
I should have kicked it more times.
What have I done?

2569
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:40,530
- I could have done better.
- That broke the rhythm.

2570
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:41,530
(Haha steps up
in the moment of crisis!)

2571
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:43,500
Will you be able to kick it
30 times?

2572
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,900
The remaining number is 60.

2573
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:46,290
- Did you say 60?
- Did you say 60?

2574
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:47,700
The remaining number is 60.

2575
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,760
- You never know.
- He might do well.

2576
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,460
- He might do well.
- Counting one,

2577
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:55,670
- two, three,
- Never mind.

2578
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:56,800
four...

2579
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,300
- Two, three,
- Never mind.

2580
01:22:58,300 --> 01:22:59,910
four, five...

2581
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:02,320
- Hey.
- Five...

2582
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,120
(Swinging)

2583
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,290
Why did you give up?
Give him a curse.

2584
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:07,320
How could you do that?

2585
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,490
Why did you give up?

2586
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:09,750
You have messed up
multiple times today.

2587
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,530
- Bring a curse.
- You said you are good at this.

2588
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:13,230
Why did you decide to go later?

2589
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:15,050
Why did you do that?

2590
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:16,290
Give yourself a curse.

2591
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:17,660
Your belly is sticking out.

2592
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,830
Give yourself a curse.

2593
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,240
- Only Jae Suk remains.
- Okay.

2594
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,940
- Jae Suk, kick it 65 times.
- What's the remaining number?

2595
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:25,700
- It's 55.
- What?

2596
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:28,300
- It's 55.
- You can catch it once.

2597
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,500
- It's a bonus.
- You can catch it once.

2598
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,200
- We will step back.
- Okay.

2599
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,840
- Jae Suk.
- Don't look.

2600
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,670
- We won't look.
- And...

2601
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:37,340
- Don't talk.
- Don't talk.

2602
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:40,120
- Just count the number.
- I messed up because you looked.

2603
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,320
- Don't say, "Go slow."
- We don't need to count.

2604
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,620
- He will count himself.
- Let him count.

2605
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:45,330
- Let's leave it to himself.
- Let's be quiet.

2606
01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:47,420
- All right. Be quiet.
- Let's go.

2607
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,700
- Kick it 30 times right away.
- Okay.

2608
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,790
- That's right.
- I need to do that much...

2609
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:55,130
- to make it doable.
- Kick it 30 times smoothly.

2610
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,130
Heroes are born
out of turbulent times.

2611
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:58,300
Okay. I will kick it 55 times.

2612
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,300
You should do this much
after the quarantine.

2613
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:01,910
- All right.
- We won't say anything.

2614
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:03,110
Be quiet!

2615
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:04,110
(Be quiet!)

2616
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:05,110
He looks nervous.

2617
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:06,280
Who is being loud?

2618
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,780
(He is shouting at the air
because he is nervous.)

2619
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:11,380
He is in a good condition.
His voice is strong.

2620
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:13,880
(He overcame his nervousness
regarding games earlier.)

2621
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:17,050
(Will he be able
to overcome it once more?)

2622
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:22,360
All right.

2623
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:27,530
- Hey.
- Why did you laugh?

2624
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:28,940
Why did you laugh?

2625
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:32,940
(Chuckling)

2626
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:35,300
Why did you laugh?

2627
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:37,300
(Jong Kook's laughter
broke his concentration.)

2628
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,480
- Why did you laugh?
- Why did you laugh?

2629
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:42,410
- Hey.
- Why did you laugh?

2630
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:43,840
- Why did you laugh?
- Hey.

2631
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,380
- Why...
- Why did you laugh?

2632
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:46,510
- Why did you laugh?
- Why are you blaming me?

2633
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:49,010
You should let me start over.

2634
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:51,120
- Why did you laugh?
- Why are you blaming me?

2635
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,160
- Hey, he laughed.
- Why are you blaming me?

2636
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,590
For goodness' sake.

2637
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:56,420
- You were nervous.
- Jae Suk.

2638
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:58,230
- I mean...
- Give him another chance.

2639
01:24:58,230 --> 01:24:59,660
It's Jong Kook's fault.

2640
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:00,920
You failed.

2641
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,400
Since 2 minutes remain,
2 people should write a card.

2642
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,540
Let's write a card.

2643
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:05,910
Go ahead and write it.

2644
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:07,110
(If they write 2 cards,
3 people will receive the penalty.)

2645
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:08,280
I don't know the name.

2646
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,280
It's 2:59 p.m. One minute remains.

2647
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,700
Gosh, nothing goes our way.

2648
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,750
Why is that? What's wrong with us?

2649
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:17,120
- It's 3 p.m.
- Okay.

2650
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,840
The total amount of money
you made is 5,523 dollars.

2651
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:20,840
We made a lot of money.

2652
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:24,010
I will now announce
the final number of penalty balls.

2653
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:26,330
- Jae Suk has 15 balls.
- Did you say 15?

2654
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:28,620
- He doesn't have a lot.
- Haha has 25 balls.

2655
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,000
- Why?
- That's not a lot.

2656
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:33,500
Jong Kook has 45 balls.

2657
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:34,590
He has a lot.

2658
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:36,240
Se Chan has 28 balls.

2659
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,760
- I thought I would have more.
- Ji Hyo has 25 balls.

2660
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,500
So Min has 32 balls.

2661
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,500
You don't have a lot.

2662
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,700
Suk Jin has 52 balls.

2663
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:45,110
- What?
- Did you say 52?

2664
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:46,110
Did you say 52?

2665
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:47,480
- It's close to your age.
- Isn't that his age?

2666
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,040
- It's less than his age.
- Really?

2667
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,170
Did you say 52?

2668
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:51,840
Let's do this.

2669
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,320
Hey, about ten more balls went in.

2670
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,410
No.

2671
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:56,010
- Let's see.
- You will get electrocuted.

2672
01:25:56,010 --> 01:25:58,160
- You will get electrocuted.
- For your information,

2673
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:00,050
one person will receive the penalty
if three balls have the same name.

2674
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:01,420
- Hey.
- This is bad.

2675
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,900
- My ball might not come out.
- Let's go.

2676
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:05,230
- My ball might not come out.
- That's all that matters.

2677
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:07,290
- Let's go.
- This is how you win at life.

2678
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:08,330
Okay.

2679
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:10,460
I don't think I will get picked.

2680
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:12,700
A ball came out. Two balls came out.

2681
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:14,300
Okay.

2682
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:17,110
(Who will receive a penalty
in the new year?)

2683
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:18,500
Two balls came out.

2684
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,410
Okay. It's fine
as long as I don't get picked.

2685
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:24,410
- It's the New Year.
- Kim Jong Kook.

2686
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:26,510
(The first member
to get a penalty is Jong Kook.)

2687
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:28,380
- Yang Se Chan.
- Se Chan!

2688
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:30,580
(The second member is Se Chan.)

2689
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:32,190
Okay.

2690
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:34,790
(And the last member
to get a penalty...)

2691
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:35,900
Yang Se Chan.

2692
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,500
(It's Se Chan again.)

2693
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,420
- You two will get a penalty.
- How many balls did Se Chan have?

2694
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:40,500
I didn't have many balls.

2695
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,240
I can't believe
Suk Jin's ball wasn't picked.

2696
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,540
My ball wasn't picked.

2697
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:45,410
I can't believe this.

2698
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:48,280
So Se Chan and Jong Kook
will get a penalty today.

2699
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,780
- I'll announce today's penalty.
- Okay. What is it?

2700
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:52,980
This is the first day
of the New Year.

2701
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:55,320
And we're shooting
this episode on Sunday.

2702
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,250
So we picked something
you can do only on Sundays.

2703
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,690
- What is it?
- Cooking Chapaghetti?

2704
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,040
- Is that it?
- Seriously?

2705
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:02,910
You will watch our show
that will begin soon.

2706
01:27:03,210 --> 01:27:04,490
My goodness.

2707
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:06,420
You will make a video of one minute.

2708
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:08,000
I have to go to the gym.

2709
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,960
You should laugh out loud
every time your face is on TV.

2710
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,400
- That's horrible.
- Excuse me.

2711
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,330
You should laugh out loud
watching yourself on TV.

2712
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:16,500
For how long?

2713
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,160
For about 30 seconds to 1 minute.

2714
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,910
You should wait
until our show begins.

2715
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:21,000
Okay.

2716
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,110
(The shoot ended like that.)

2717
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:24,610
(It was 5 p.m. that day.)

2718
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:28,510
(Gym Jong Kook works out
at the gym watching Running Man.)

2719
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:30,320
Okay. There it is.

2720
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,750
(When his face is on TV...)

2721
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:33,620
(Laughing)

2722
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:37,360
I'm not supposed to take
a break for over a minute.

2723
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:41,250
(He watched the show to the end
working out his muscles.)

2724
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:43,620
(Se Chan is
getting the penalty too.)

2725
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:45,730
(Laughing)

2726
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,230
There he is.

2727
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:51,240
(He just laughs out loud
for the penalty when no one's on.)

2728
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:52,440
Hide!

2729
01:27:53,630 --> 01:27:55,780
Good.

2730
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:58,000
(A mansion in Seongbuk-dong)

2731
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,410
(Senior Candidate A Jeon So Min)

2732
01:28:00,610 --> 01:28:02,410
(In a corner of the same building)

2733
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:05,040
(Empty Head is the future,
Senior Candidate B Yang Se Chan)

2734
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,620
(Between Yang and Jeon,
who's last in the hierarchy?)

2735
01:28:08,010 --> 01:28:13,160
(Which one is more mature?)

2736
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:17,230
(How to avoid being
the last in the hierarchy?)

2737
01:28:17,230 --> 01:28:18,760
Which one?

2738
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:22,000
(They can't fall
for the false propaganda.)

2739
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,240
(Defeat your rival no matter what.)

2740
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,980
(And there's one more way.)

2741
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:30,000
(Buying votes with money.)

2742
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,580
(You should be a spy.)

2743
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:33,040
(The youngest members...)

2744
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:36,120
(keep betraying the members.)

2745
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,840
(Once they escape from
being the last in the hierarchy,)

2746
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:41,010
(they can become free
from the old fossils.)

2747
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:45,580
(Who will be
the last in the hierarchy?)

2748
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:48,590
(The Seniority War
of the Youngest Members)
