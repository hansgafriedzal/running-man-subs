1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,850
(It's the second day of
a two-day-long shoot which is rare.)

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,760
Okay. Do we keep
our shoes on in the house?

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,420
- Hello.
- What do we do in this fancy house?

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,460
I know.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,150
My eyes are all puffy, right?

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,250
Yes. Did you sleep a lot?

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,520
No. I just had
six packs of ramyeon last night.

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,570
Why?

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,000
I had an eating show.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,500
- An eating show?
- It's so cold.

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,970
- Hello.
- Gosh, Ji Hyo.

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,970
You're all dressed up today.

13
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,910
Today...

14
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,910
- I like your outfit.
- I dressed up.

15
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,070
- It's so cold.
- My gosh, Ji Hyo.

16
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,700
What's with my pants?

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,120
Jong Kook, see? You should
dress up like Ji Seon.

18
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,520
She looks so fashionable.

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,090
- Look at her.
- What's the difference?

20
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,710
- We look the same.
- No, you're different.

21
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,160
I look even better.

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,630
- You think you look better?
- Yes.

23
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,690
(Unusual fashion philosophy)

24
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,230
Did you wear
the same pants yesterday?

25
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,230
Yes.

26
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,330
They are the same pants,
but these are new.

27
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,130
- Ji Seon...
- With the same design.

28
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,130
I heard Ji Seon is having a hard time.

29
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,200
Why?

30
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,600
She feels like she's being paid
for doing nothing.

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,910
- She does work hard though.
- Really?

32
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,620
It's not easy. She needs to buy
five outfits with the same design.

33
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,540
That's not an easy thing to do.
We run out of clothes soon.

34
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,090
I should take a picture of this.
It has Se Chan's face on it.

35
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,410
This is Se Chan.

36
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,260
I heard he paid for this.

37
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,650
(Se Chan ordered a coffee truck
for the members of Running Man.)

38
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,820
That's right.

39
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,700
He should pay the membership fee
for our soccer team.

40
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,070
Right. And...

41
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,540
A coffee truck doesn't cost a lot.

42
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,260
Hey. My goodness.

43
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,400
Why would you say that
while drinking the coffee?

44
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,350
What's wrong with you?
You're unbelievable.

45
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,910
(There's a sound of grinning.)

46
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,260
(Se Chan and So Min were
watching the whole thing.)

47
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,490
What did he say?

48
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,150
(The evening before)

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,060
(Tomorrow, we will pick a member
who's last in the hierarchy.)

50
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,320
(The last in the hierarchy will
take on all the difficult tasks.)

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,430
(So Min: Difficult tasks?)

52
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,930
(Se Chan: My gosh. Okay.)

53
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,740
Hello.

54
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,600
Dear directors, I will order
a coffee truck next week.

55
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,150
I will appreciate your votes.
I love you all.

56
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,110
I love you, dear directors.

57
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,110
(She woos the crew members
with her open display of affection.)

58
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,370
Did you enjoy the coffee?

59
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,740
(Did you enjoy the coffee?)

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,990
I wish I would get all the votes.

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,620
Unanimous votes.

62
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,150
Like a score of 95 to 3.

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,180
Are you wearing the microphone?

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,620
Hey. Why did you get us
a coffee truck today?

65
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,190
I told you. It was supposed
to come yesterday.

66
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,770
You know this is a bribe.

67
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,640
- It's not a bribe.
- Seriously, this is bribery.

68
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,430
I didn't even know
about today's mission.

69
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,030
Actually, I want to be
the last in the hierarchy.

70
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,030
- Why?
- I like it.

71
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,110
But I don't want my name
to be at the end.

72
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,110
- I see.
- That's what bothers me.

73
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,610
Why would you even care about that?

74
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,740
Even your name?

75
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,470
Because it makes me...

76
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,120
look unpopular.

77
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,120
(She thinks the order of names
is based on popularity.)

78
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,650
- That's not true.
- You know what? Suk Jin's name...

79
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,390
- comes...
- Before Jae Suk's?

80
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,020
No. His name comes after Jae Suk's.

81
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,960
But Jae Suk is younger
than Suk Jin.

82
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,360
- That's ridiculous. Listen.
- It's not based on our ages.

83
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,520
But it's not based on popularity.
His name comes before Jong Kook's.

84
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,270
That doesn't make sense.
So there's no fixed rule.

85
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,900
Then it should be
So Min, Suk Jin, and Se Chan.

86
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,140
No, So Min. Let me make this clear.

87
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,140
You are going to lose today.

88
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,110
I think I'm losing already...

89
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,900
- because of the coffee truck.
- Hello.

90
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,270
- This is amazing.
- The other members...

91
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,440
don't know you are watching them.

92
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,340
(They are going
to have a secret poll.)

93
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,620
Paying for it is no big deal.

94
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,390
This is from Se Chan.

95
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,890
He got the coffee. Enjoy it.

96
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,590
Se Chan's fans did it for us.

97
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,330
- Se Chan paid for it himself.
- Se Chan got it himself.

98
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,930
- Really?
- Yes.

99
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,170
He paid for this.
That's why I said that.

100
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,800
I wouldn't say it didn't cost a lot
if it was from his fans.

101
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,060
I'm not that crazy.

102
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,370
(He feels dizzy
just at the thought of it.)

103
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,740
I thought...

104
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,240
I just thought you were so gutsy.

105
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,900
(I just thought you were so gutsy.)

106
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,550
- Gosh, this is...
- My goodness.

107
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,240
He's the one who's gutsy.

108
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,020
- What?
- What? Who is he?

109
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,280
It looks like
he's wearing a straw mat.

110
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,210
- He's the one who's gutsy.
- Why?

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,360
He's so gutsy.

112
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,180
(A beggar shows up
at a fancy house.)

113
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,220
- Suk Jin.
- What's going on?

114
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,750
I heard my stylist say something
on my way up here.

115
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,770
"My gosh. He looks amazing."

116
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,020
As I always say, for celebrities,

117
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,190
I wonder how Haha likes it.

118
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,800
it's important to have
good people around.

119
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,970
- Do you not like it?
- I admire the spirit of challenge.

120
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,500
- I agree.
- It's cool.

121
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,310
Honestly, I was ashamed at first.

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,440
But I've tried many unique outfits,

123
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,610
so this is no big deal.

124
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,120
You were told not to wear black.

125
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,550
- It brings you bad luck.
- I will break my fate.

126
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,180
- My fate.
- That sounds scary.

127
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,250
Even Jong Kook's parents can't...

128
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,060
- break his obstinacy.
- Right.

129
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,490
No one can stop him.

130
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,300
He will probably cave in
if he meets a woman he loves.

131
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,230
No. The woman he loves will cave in.

132
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,800
You think?

133
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,690
What?

134
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,800
Why?

135
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,330
- What did you say?
- Isn't that true?

136
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,330
- How could you say that?
- Isn't that true?

137
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,470
Jong Kook.

138
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,370
Marriage isn't about
being obstinate or caving in.

139
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,310
Mind your own business.

140
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,000
Suk Jin, mind your own business.

141
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,440
- He already caved in.
- Mind your own business.

142
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,850
I don't want to hear it from you.

143
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,080
- You can't be obstinate.
- Speak for yourself.

144
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,620
Then what is marriage about?

145
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,860
You should be understanding
and considerate of each other.

146
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,950
- Mind your own business.
- But why do you...

147
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,230
yell at your wife
when you talk on the phone?

148
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,080
When we talk on the phone,

149
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,100
he's like, "Su Jung,
I'm talking on the phone."

150
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,320
(He throws tantrums.)

151
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,390
- Really? That's the worst.
- That's...

152
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,040
- what we usually say to kids.
- "Su Jung."

153
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,740
People might take it the wrong way.

154
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,330
- I wasn't throwing a tantrum.
- Yes, you were.

155
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,500
You might take it the wrong way.

156
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,640
You were throwing a tantrum.

157
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,370
I just said, "I'm on the phone."

158
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
But she didn't hear it
and talked to me again.

159
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,120
So I was like,
"I said I was on the phone."

160
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,510
I just said that out loud.

161
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,720
Gosh, this is...

162
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,290
Haha.

163
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,380
- Why are you being so quiet?
- What do you mean?

164
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,620
Are you like this
even on "How Do You Play?"

165
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,860
(Are you like this
even on "How Do You Play?")

166
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,030
I'm sorry, but...

167
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,120
Look at him.

168
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,190
We keep talking,

169
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,560
- but he's being quiet.
- "How Do You Play?" doesn't...

170
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,930
have a member like you.

171
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,130
I feel comfortable there.

172
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,540
You should talk more.

173
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,670
You were talking,
so I was showing some responses.

174
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,280
That's not enough. You need to talk.

175
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
You should bring up something.

176
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,000
(Making a funny sound)

177
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,370
Hey.

178
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,720
Isn't he acting up?

179
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,810
(Isn't he acting up?)

180
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,220
Hey.

181
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,880
I think he's defying me.

182
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,810
You're even worse than him
to your seniors.

183
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,080
(Meanwhile...)

184
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,320
This is what he always does.

185
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,390
(They forget about the youngest
members and keep chattering.)

186
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,120
He thinks it's big.

187
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,360
I'm not sure about that.

188
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,120
I have an objection.

189
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,240
Why aren't they talking about us
when we're not around?

190
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,470
They didn't ask them about us yet.

191
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,670
They don't even find it strange.

192
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,170
I flinch at a time like this.

193
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,330
Everything goes well without us.
You know what I mean?

194
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,000
This is why we should work hard.

195
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,500
- They don't realize our absence.
- They don't.

196
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,110
That's why we should try hard.

197
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,620
Everything goes well
even without Suk Jin.

198
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,880
- Are you showing it off?
- You're wearing a yellow shirt.

199
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,240
Are you showing off your shirt?

200
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,860
You're wearing yellow.

201
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,790
- Yellow brings him good luck.
- Right. Yellow is good for him.

202
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,730
- He believes in fortune-telling.
- Suk Jin.

203
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,290
I can break
the three years of misfortune.

204
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,120
He's amazing.

205
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,690
- I can break misfortune.
- There's nothing you can't break.

206
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,870
All right. Today...

207
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,630
- What?
- Is it started already?

208
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,470
So Min and Se Chan aren't here yet.

209
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,130
Between the two youngest members,
Jeon So Min and Yang Se Chan,

210
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,440
we will pick
the last in the hierarchy.

211
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,550
What do you mean?

212
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,850
That's important. We need
to have a pecking order.

213
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,420
- It was tricky for us.
- They are of the same age.

214
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,440
(The order of their names has been
a tricky issue for crew members.)

215
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,510
(Jae Suk, Suk Jin, Jong Kook,
Haha, Ji Hyo, So Min, Se Chan)

216
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,120
(The order of the names got
mixed up in press releases.)

217
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,560
(Yang Se Chan and Jeon So Min,
Jeon So Min and Yang Se Chan)

218
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,820
(The youngest member's task 1:
Closing the clapper board)

219
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,560
(The two youngest members
did it in turns.)

220
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,540
(The youngest member's task 2:
Running errands)

221
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,830
(The youngest members did
all the difficult tasks.)

222
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,110
In alphabetical order,
Se Chan's name comes first.

223
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,000
But sometimes
So Min's name comes first.

224
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,570
So before we start the race,

225
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,070
- I'd like to hear your thoughts.
- Okay.

226
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,310
So Min and Se Chan are waiting
somewhere else.

227
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,680
Between Se Chan and So Min,

228
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,420
who do you think is more mature?

229
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,880
More mature?

230
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,820
I'm not sure. The thing is...

231
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,530
I'm feeling nervous.
My name is called.

232
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,600
(The members don't know
that they are listening.)

233
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,560
Se Chan is more mature.

234
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,670
- Se Chan is.
- He's more mature.

235
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,200
That's not true. That's just
how we look on the show.

236
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,610
The reason we pick the last
in the hierarchy is...

237
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,810
to decide who will...

238
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,870
take on chores and run errands.

239
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,370
I think it's easier
to have Se Chan do all the work.

240
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,620
If that's the case,

241
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,120
Se Chan is better
because he's quick-witted.

242
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,790
- We can't send So Min on errands.
- My point.

243
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,380
But you let her run errands.

244
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,530
You're the one
who always sends her on errands.

245
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,690
That's true.

246
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,220
- You know what?
- I was surprised to see him.

247
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,930
- He does that all the time.
- Hey.

248
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,400
I just asked for a favor.

249
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
This is sending her on an errand.

250
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,190
"Hey, So Min. Go bring that to me."

251
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,060
But I was like, "So Min,
will you pass me that thing?"

252
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,830
That's the same thing.

253
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,330
- He let her run errands.
- It's the same.

254
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,930
That's what old people always do.

255
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,100
"Bring that to me."

256
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,880
When I'm about to eat something,

257
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,470
Suk Jin asks,
"Are you going to eat it?"

258
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,310
- He wants it.
- Exactly.

259
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,750
- This is what he always does.
- It's the same thing.

260
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,250
"Are you going to eat it?"

261
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,890
- "Are you going to eat it?"
- You let her run errands.

262
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,660
Suk Jin,
you make her uncomfortable.

263
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,660
- She's right.
- What are you talking about?

264
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,850
That's the worst.

265
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,590
I'm really upset
when he takes my food.

266
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,950
He knows what I'm having.

267
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,950
- Let's say I'm eating jjamppong.
- Right.

268
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,360
But he asks, "What is this?"

269
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,060
You know what it is.

270
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,770
- We had jjamppong yesterday.
- That's horrible.

271
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,360
- "What is this?"
- Rice was delivered by mistake.

272
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,770
- But he ordered noodles.
- Right.

273
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,040
And So Min was there.

274
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,640
He said,
"Mine doesn't have noodles in it."

275
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,570
(I want you to give
your noodles to me.)

276
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,310
- He's the worst.
- And So Min said,

277
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,970
"You can have mine."

278
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,750
- So Min ordered fried rice.
- "No, it's okay."

279
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,160
- "I'm fine."
- He's the worst.

280
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,950
That means,
"Give me your noodles now."

281
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,530
- Right?
- So Min...

282
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,890
Thankfully, So Min
gave me her noodles.

283
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,900
And Ji Hyo was eating already.

284
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,160
"Does yours have noodles in it?"

285
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,590
(Does yours have noodles in it?)

286
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,690
She was about to eat noodles.

287
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,590
- She could see it.
- We all could see it.

288
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,090
Anyway, I think
Se Chan is more mature.

289
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,770
(The conclusion is that
Se Chan is more mature.)

290
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,910
The conclusion is that
you're more mature than me.

291
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,540
I'm more mature.

292
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,750
But Jong Kook and Jae Suk think
it'd be better to have me...

293
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,150
run errands.

294
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,570
Hang on. The last in the hierarchy?

295
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,940
Se Chan might look mature,

296
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,610
- but So Min is also thoughtful.
- I agree.

297
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,390
- She's right.
- They say good things about us.

298
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,480
They just don't know.

299
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,900
You two talked a lot
on the phone late at night.

300
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,130
To be honest,

301
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,690
neither of them looks
like the youngest member.

302
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,130
They are quite old.

303
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,800
- They are...
- How old are they?

304
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,190
We can't say they are young.

305
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,430
- They are 37 now.
- They are 37?

306
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,730
- To be honest...
- Are they 37?

307
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,330
- Se Chan and So Min...
- I said they were old.

308
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,200
are the youngest ones here,

309
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,280
- but they are not quite young.
- How old are you?

310
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,380
I'm 44.

311
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,840
(I'm 44.)

312
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,970
I'm 44 and have 3 children.

313
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,070
Will you give me a break now?

314
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,650
Hey.

315
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,110
(The 44-year-old boy is
a father of 3 children.)

316
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,310
- Jong Kook said...
- He's old too.

317
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,820
it would never happen
even if I had five children.

318
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,890
He would never give me a break.

319
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,930
- Not until he dies.
- He's old.

320
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,220
- Are you 44? He's old.
- He's 44.

321
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,300
- He's 44, but...
- You seem surprised.

322
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,720
- If you're 44...
- You're shocked, right?

323
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,540
- Hey.
- That means he's old, right?

324
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,270
I told you before.
When Se Chan is...

325
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,460
on "Comedy Big League,"

326
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,860
he's like a king.

327
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,070
- Right.
- He's like a king.

328
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,180
You have a commanding
presence there, right?

329
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,840
Kind of.

330
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,470
I'm different there.

331
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,180
- I'm like, "Hey."
- I'm curious.

332
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,610
- Are you like them?
- I'm like them.

333
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,080
I'm like, "Hey, you guys."

334
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,210
- "You punks."
- Little Kim Jong Kook.

335
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,420
When Ji Hyo goes to her hairdresser,

336
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,680
everyone makes a bow to her.

337
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,680
Jae Suk.

338
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,320
- Hey.
- That's true.

339
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,000
- Look at her. They should do that.
- That's what they do.

340
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,190
She looks young
because she's with us.

341
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,460
"Give me some water."

342
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,540
This place looks
like Ji Hyo's house.

343
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,170
I have a question.

344
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,040
You're not going to start
the shoot without us, are you?

345
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,180
This is so fun.

346
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,570
The opening is really fun.

347
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,100
I want to join them...

348
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,020
and be part of it.

349
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,110
What is going on?

350
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,390
We won't be on TV for long.

351
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,790
That's the main part.

352
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,480
We will be on a small screen
at the bottom, right?

353
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,430
You should say that on
"Invitation from Bachelor-agains."

354
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,130
(They are chattering
without the youngest members.)

355
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,760
- Suk Jin.
- I'll save it for the show.

356
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,460
See? They don't talk about us.

357
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,300
Why aren't they talking about us?

358
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,690
Let's go. Pick up the water gun.

359
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,170
- What's that water gun for?
- What's that water gun?

360
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,600
I'm supposed to shoot
those who say boring things.

361
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,680
(The 37-year-olds are upset
that they had fun without them.)

362
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,380
Suk Jin, I don't like your jacket.

363
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,340
- What's this?
- What's with your outfit?

364
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,840
You talk a lot
on "How Do You Play?"

365
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,280
- What?
- Why are you being quiet?

366
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,050
And a coffee truck
doesn't cost a lot?

367
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,520
It doesn't cost a lot?

368
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,290
Did you hear all that?

369
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,710
- We heard it all.
- In there?

370
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,980
- The whole thing?
- I had no idea.

371
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,820
I like your jacket.
It looks good on you.

372
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,980
I like your outfit today.

373
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,950
- It looks great on you.
- You know what?

374
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,860
Jae Suk bought me this.

375
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,300
- I see.
- It looks nice.

376
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,560
- You picked a good one.
- It does look good on you.

377
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,670
You shouldn't dress up
on a day like this.

378
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,860
What are you talking about?

379
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,460
Se Chan is quite a dresser.

380
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,510
- I don't look young today.
- That's nice.

381
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,830
He got us the coffee truck
today of all days.

382
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,330
I can't believe this.

383
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,340
- That doesn't matter.
- It has nothing to do with this.

384
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,550
It doesn't cost a lot.

385
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,550
(It doesn't cost a lot.)

386
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,810
(The stubborn voter is
not swayed by pin money.)

387
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,050
Thank you.

388
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,940
When Jong Kook said
it didn't cost a lot,

389
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,420
I found it hilarious.

390
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,610
Let me tell you about today's race.

391
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,080
Among Running Man's lucky charms,
So Min and Se Chan,

392
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,430
we will pick a member
who's last in the hierarchy.

393
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,560
It's called The Seniority War
of the Youngest Members,

394
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,460
- Who Is the Last in the Hierarchy?
- All right.

395
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,040
The loser of this race...

396
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,300
will be the last in the hierarchy.

397
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,810
The loser will get a penalty today.

398
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,510
And the loser's name will
come last in all press releases.

399
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,570
The last in the hierarchy.

400
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,810
The loser will be
the last one in everything.

401
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,380
- I see.
- It's good to be the youngest...

402
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,750
- except for having more jobs to do.
- It can be a good title.

403
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,020
- You'd be considered the youngest.
- Exactly.

404
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,020
- The order kept changing, right?
- Yes.

405
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,450
I couldn't fall asleep because of it
several times.

406
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,480
- Why?
- Are you serious?

407
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,130
It makes me worry for no reason.

408
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,560
I know that it doesn't
mean anything.

409
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,560
- I see.
- No way.

410
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,400
I'm serious. Someone must've decided
the order of our names.

411
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,360
- Right. Does it bother you?
- "Haven't I been doing well?"

412
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,140
- "Why is Se Chan before me?"
- Are you serious?

413
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,460
- Really?
- Such thoughts come into my mind.

414
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,960
- It keeps you up at night?
- Actors and actresses do care...

415
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,010
- about the order of the names.
- I didn't know that.

416
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,600
I see that she makes things
too complicated.

417
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,730
- The order of yours and my names?
- Yes.

418
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,550
Hey, if we all think as you do,
Suk Jin would've died.

419
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,610
- I... You should just let it go.
- I guess So Min...

420
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,290
- I think...
- It's not a big deal.

421
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,980
- She's worried for nothing.
- I've seen my name behind yours.

422
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,160
- Don't let it bother you.
- Sometimes it's behind Chan Hee's.

423
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,180
Exactly.

424
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,090
I felt pressured to do better.

425
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,560
- Really?
- It's unusual.

426
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,630
- It must've been stressful.
- You should let it go.

427
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,190
- Try not to let it stress you out.
- The youngest will get more tasks.

428
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,830
- I see.
- From now on...

429
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,930
It's easy to give you more tasks.

430
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,330
We'll take advantage of the title
as the youngest.

431
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,830
- But...
- I find it funny...

432
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,410
that So Min gets annoyed.

433
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,010
- So I'll win no matter what.
- Right.

434
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,340
- She'll hate being the youngest...
- True.

435
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,680
- and having more tasks.
- Good.

436
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,750
I'll enjoy watching her like that.

437
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,940
- That's good.
- Yes.

438
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,750
The loser will be the last
for all that's in order of age.

439
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,350
Also, the youngest will slate on set
throughout this year.

440
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,790
- That wouldn't be a problem.
- I want to slate on set.

441
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,980
- Would you like to be the youngest?
- Do you want to compete with us?

442
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,350
- Can Haha join the competition?
- I'd be happy to slate.

443
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,350
- It's easy.
- Do you want to be the youngest?

444
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,560
- Are you in or not?
- Do you want to compete with us?

445
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,300
You know I'd do anything
to look younger.

446
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,560
- But a crane camera can't find you.
- He's obsessed with being youthful.

447
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,690
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

448
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,400
Wouldn't you mind if we treat you
as someone younger than us?

449
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,060
Would you call us
a big brother and a big sister?

450
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,330
- You should use honorifics to us.
- It's a match between you two.

451
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,100
You two are so rude.

452
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,880
He's acting so bossy.

453
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,600
- He can't be the youngest.
- I'm 44 years old, you know.

454
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,050
- He has three children too.
- You know he acted so bossy...

455
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,710
- on "Music Bank K-Chart" too, right?
- Yes, that's right.

456
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,810
- Yes, he did.
- Jang Won Young and the other MC...

457
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,080
(The old fossil on "Music Bank K-Chart"
drew a lot of attention.)

458
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,520
- It was totally unacceptable!
- Really?

459
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,390
How dare you look at the script?

460
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,560
(Haha yelled at the MCs
while reminiscing the old days.)

461
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,630
Let's move on.

462
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,270
The youngest will do petty tasks
like slating or serving water.

463
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,040
And we'll ask the youngest to relay
messages to the other members.

464
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,400
Hey, he's the director.

465
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,510
And we'll ask the youngest to relay
messages...

466
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,910
(She shot the water gun.)

467
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,830
How could you shoot him
with the water gun?

468
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,910
I've never seen anyone
who did that to a director.

469
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,410
I must say, So Min can be
really crazy.

470
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,110
- She shot the director.
- He's the director of our show.

471
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,810
- During a shoot.
- I was surprised.

472
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,420
- During a shoot.
- Exactly, during a shoot.

473
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,390
- She can be really crazy.
- She does as she pleases.

474
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,680
- I wasn't joking.
- Why did you do that? I'm curious.

475
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,350
- I bet she hates him.
- I just wanted to shoot him.

476
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,060
- Oh, I see.
- Don't you want to shoot him?

477
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,190
We all do, but none of us would
actually shoot him.

478
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,530
We wouldn't actually shoot him.

479
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:59,460
Anyway, we'll ask the youngest
to do many things for us.

480
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,640
Here's how to decide the youngest.
After all the missions end,

481
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,140
- you'll vote for the true youngest.
- My goodness.

482
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,880
Each of you will have one vote.

483
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,880
And to be fair, a few staff members
will vote too.

484
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,920
- I understand.
- Okay.

485
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,440
The two youngest members will be
the leaders of their teams.

486
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:21,660
The other members can choose
the team leader in each round.

487
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,790
The winning team of each mission
will get extra ballots.

488
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,030
(The winning team will get
extra ballots.)

489
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,820
We'll give the two youngest members
So Min coins and Se Chan coins.

490
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,320
You two can give your coins...

491
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,640
- to anyone you want.
- I see.

492
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,280
The coins of the loser of the race
will be invalid.

493
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,650
The two members who have
the most coins of the winner...

494
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,050
will be exempt from a penalty.

495
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,210
(2 members with the most coins
of the winner won't get a penalty.)

496
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,680
(Staring)

497
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,750
- will be exempt from a penalty.
- Hold on. Suk Jin...

498
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,390
- About 30 seconds ago,
- Yes?

499
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,080
- He couldn't understand the rule.
- you lost him.

500
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,080
- He got caught.
- My gosh.

501
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,560
- He wasn't listening.
- I'm 100 percent sure.

502
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,350
- Exactly.
- He seems so lost.

503
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,190
- You should've listened carefully.
- I admit it.

504
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,860
I was going to ask Se Chan
about the rule later.

505
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,330
My gosh.

506
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,470
- Honestly, I wasn't listening.
- All right.

507
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,830
In summary, the winning team members
will get extra ballots.

508
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,840
- You'll vote at the end.
- Okay.

509
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,050
- One of them will win the race.
- Yes.

510
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,410
Only two members with the most coins
of the winner won't get a penalty.

511
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,450
- Got it.
- Only two members?

512
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,490
Yes. That means you have to get
as many coins as you can...

513
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,850
- to be in the top two.
- We should give them many coins.

514
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,500
Now, it's time for you to choose
your team for the first round.

515
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,090
So Min and Se Chan,
please wait in your rooms.

516
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,730
- Okay. Please join my team.
- All right.

517
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,890
Okay.

518
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,770
I'll give away at least 300 coins.
Consider yourself informed.

519
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,770
Today, I'll play the role
of the youngest as I've been doing.

520
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,210
But I'll win this race
and no longer act like one.

521
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,540
Which of you will go first?

522
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,980
- Why are we going there again?
- To choose your team.

523
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,280
- "Why are we going there again?"
- I mean...

524
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,170
- You can go home now.
- I can't believe him.

525
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,580
- We're going home.
- Director,

526
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,190
why can't we take a break as always?

527
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,960
- We're going home.
- I usually ask the others...

528
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,060
about the rules during a break.

529
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,560
You just have to choose
1 of the 2 of them.

530
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,120
- Oh, between the two of them?
- Yes.

531
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,060
- The one you support... Correct.
- "I'm rooting for you."

532
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,800
- Okay.
- You go first.

533
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,200
- Me?
- Yes.

534
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,530
- Okay. Got it.
- It's hard to decide.

535
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,360
Should I choose So Min or Se Chan?

536
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,830
(Walking wearily)

537
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,830
- Look how he looks from behind.
- Wait.

538
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,010
(He looked unsure from behind.)

539
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,740
- Who wants to be the youngest?
- He looks as if he just came out...

540
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,210
- covering himself with a blanket.
- No one wants to be the youngest.

541
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,020
Oh, right. The one who doesn't want
to be the youngest...

542
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,720
I'm so worried.
Can he be funny on the show?

543
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,410
Back in my days, he would've been
scolded harshly.

544
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,960
How would he be funny
when he doesn't understand the rule?

545
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,960
(Big Nose trudges to the front
of the youngest members' rooms.)

546
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,590
Neither of them wants to be
the youngest, right?

547
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,500
And I have to choose
the person whom I support.

548
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,830
I'm sure that Suk Jin will join
my team in the first round.

549
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
There's no doubt.

550
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,200
(The 2 captains are waiting
for their supporters to come.)

551
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,210
(Sliding a coin)

552
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,330
Didn't he see it?

553
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,480
(She slid a coin
under the door to lure him.)

554
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,750
(But Big Nose couldn't see
the coin.)

555
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,450
He couldn't see my coin.

556
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:06,110
(He keeps wandering
without finding the coin.)

557
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,110
(So Min's Room)

558
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,220
Suk Jin.

559
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,560
Suk Jin, didn't you see it?

560
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,420
- What do you mean?
- I slid a coin under the door.

561
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,420
Where is it?

562
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,700
(He received the coin
that So Min threw as well.)

563
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,160
- Just two coins?
- I'll throw them better next time.

564
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,620
- I see that Suk Jin chose her.
- I gave you three.

565
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,630
Okay.

566
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,240
(Big Nose who didn't understand
the rule joined So Min's team.)

567
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,970
The youngest.

568
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,100
We have to decide
which should be the youngest.

569
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,310
- Thank you for choosing me.
- Haha is here.

570
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,100
(So Min quickly goes
to lure another member with coins.)

571
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,070
I should choose one of them
as the youngest.

572
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,640
What's this?

573
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,780
(Haha found a bait on the floor.)

574
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,380
(1 coin added)

575
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,950
She already gave me two coins.

576
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,220
If Se Chan gives me three coins,
I'll choose him.

577
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,260
(He'll go if Se Chan gives him
3 coins?)

578
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,350
(She gave him the 3rd coin.)

579
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,350
I got three coins.

580
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,730
This is awesome.

581
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
Then I guess Se Chan should give me
four coins to recruit me.

582
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,270
(Right then,
Se Chan approaches him too.)

583
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,390
Why?

584
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,090
(Right then,
Se Chan approaches him too.)

585
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,770
- Haha, just come on in.
- Yes?

586
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,360
- Give me some coins first.
- I'll give you...

587
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,940
- I'll give you some if you come in.
- Coins first.

588
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,570
I'll give you ten coins
if you join my team.

589
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,710
I'll choose you
once you give me coins.

590
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,340
- I'll give you ten coins.
- Give me your coins first.

591
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,550
Then I'll give you five coins first.

592
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,110
- Okay.
- Here you go.

593
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,720
Will you give me five more
when I come in?

594
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,190
Come on in. I have five more coins
for you.

595
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,020
Really? Honestly, So Min would be
better as the youngest.

596
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,790
Do you have a thread?
I want to attach it to a thread.

597
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,120
(Candidate Jeon is anxious.)

598
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,260
Do you have any threads?

599
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,530
I'll give you 10 coins.
I'll give you 5 more if you come in.

600
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,560
- Really?
- Yes.

601
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,650
Let's begin with ten coins.

602
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,860
- All right. Come on in.
- Thank you.

603
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,160
I can't believe Dong Hoon.

604
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,400
- Dong Hoon?
- Honestly...

605
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,470
(Following Dong Hoon who chose
his team just to get more coins...)

606
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,160
I didn't know he would do that.

607
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,010
(Ji Hyo is about to choose
her team.)

608
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,810
(Rolling)

609
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,450
(Candidate Jeon is trying to lure
another member with her coins.)

610
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,910
She'll come, right?
I know she'll come.

611
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:46,990
Are you tempting me?

612
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,530
I can't let him talk her
into joining his team.

613
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,730
(She threw another one
since Ji Hyo didn't take the bait.)

614
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,000
- So Min.
- Come on in already.

615
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,350
- I have an idea.
- What is it?

616
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,270
Ji Hyo, can you be a spy for me?

617
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,660
(Can you be a spy for me?)

618
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,060
If you give me ten coins,
I'll sabotage the other team.

619
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,100
If I give you ten coins,
can you disturb him?

620
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,900
- I'll make the team lose.
- Really?

621
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,370
- I promise.
- And then join my team...

622
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,370
- in the next round, okay?
- Of course.

623
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,280
If you succeed in making them lose,
I'll give you five more coins.

624
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,880
- Okay.
- Can you promise me?

625
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,410
- Yes, I promise.
- Make sure they'll lose.

626
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,790
- I'll do that.
- You're my spy.

627
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,110
I'll be a spy for you.

628
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,060
- Trust me.
- I trust you.

629
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,290
I can always trust you.

630
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,700
- Ji Hyo is my spy now.
- She's a spy?

631
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,420
I gave her ten coins for now
as a retainer.

632
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,890
I'll give her five more coins
if they lose. She'll join us later.

633
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,940
Ji Hyo. How many coins did she
give you? How many do you have?

634
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,060
(Ji Hyo comes to talk
to Se Chan naturally.)

635
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,440
- How many did she give you?
- Give me your coins first.

636
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,600
How many did you get?

637
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,210
- I'll tell you if you give me.
- I'll give you five coins now.

638
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,570
Here. I'm giving you five.

639
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,980
I'll give you more than So Min did.
How many did she give you?

640
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,610
- She gave me ten coins.
- Okay.

641
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,170
Oh, my. You're here.

642
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,380
- Yes.
- Here you go.

643
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,720
(Will Ji Hyo help So Min as her spy
as she promised?)

644
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,260
- Okay.
- Good. Okay.

645
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,190
He's athletic too.

646
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,350
(Next up is Jong Kook.)

647
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,350
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- He didn't even get any coins.

648
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,350
(He chose Se Chan right away.)

649
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,620
- This is...
- Oh, my.

650
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,770
It's a given.

651
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,860
You must be touched, Se Chan.

652
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,300
I didn't even think twice.

653
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,090
My gosh. He went there
without even looking back.

654
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,040
Jong Kook said that he would join
Se Chan's team.

655
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,570
(Opening the door)

656
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,570
Where are you going?

657
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,140
(She's putting her coins
along the path toward her room.)

658
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,910
I must say, So Min is perfect
for a variety show.

659
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,420
(The person whom the coins are for
is here.)

660
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,290
I have to choose who doesn't look
like the youngest member, right?

661
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,390
(Chuckling)

662
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,970
Impressive. But I hate
things like this.

663
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,160
This is the worst as I always say.

664
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,670
(The cheesy coin path seems
to dissatisfy him.)

665
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,840
Gosh. She can never be
simple and nice.

666
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,810
Jae Suk can't seem to decide.

667
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,550
(Se Chan noticed it
and went to convince Jae Suk.)

668
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,610
I mean why...

669
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,550
Will you take the poison
or just join my team?

670
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,290
You don't need any coins
in the beginning, Jae Suk.

671
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,060
Take all her coins and come to me.

672
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,620
I was going to join her team,
but this might change my mind.

673
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,560
It'll put you in trouble.
You know that, right?

674
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,530
Gosh, seriously.

675
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,660
(Picking up)

676
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,440
The coins will be helpful though.

677
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,010
- He says he doesn't like it,
- He actually likes it.

678
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,740
but he's picking them all up.

679
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,050
(The coins lead him
to So Min's Room.)

680
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,910
(Turning around)

681
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,020
Jae Suk.

682
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,340
(Jae Suk took the coins
and turned around.)

683
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,250
- Jae Suk.
- Why? What is it?

684
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,960
You can't do that.

685
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,560
(I'm alone with Suk Jin here.)

686
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,650
I'm alone with Suk Jin here.

687
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,730
Why?

688
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,150
(They could end up forming
the weakest duo.)

689
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,820
I'm alone with Suk Jin here.

690
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,830
- I've chosen your team.
- Thank you.

691
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,360
I chose your team because it seemed
there were so few here.

692
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,470
(Bowing)

693
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,370
- Hey, you should know...
- Jae Suk.

694
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,900
You would've teamed up
only with Seok Sam.

695
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,570
There could've been just the two
of us. He complained a lot.

696
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,340
- The team selection is over.
- Okay.

697
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,140
- I feel so confident.
- This is great.

698
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,810
- We're going to have fun.
- The New Zealand team gathered.

699
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,290
- Let's win!
- You're right.

700
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,120
We teamed up together again
after a long time. Great.

701
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,350
We'll begin the first mission
after you change your clothes.

702
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,800
- Okay. I'm excited.
- Got it.

703
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,420
- Okay.
- This is good.

704
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,200
Why are there so many wearing red?

705
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,700
- It looks intense, right?
- The red color...

706
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,210
Take this. One, two.

707
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,210
Are you happy
with your team members?

708
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,810
- They're just perfect.
- Yes.

709
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,630
We can beat them in any game.

710
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,900
That's ridiculous.

711
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,950
So Min would've been in trouble...

712
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,710
- if I hadn't chosen her.
- True.

713
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,070
I would've been alone with Suk Jin
in that room if he hadn't.

714
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,140
Suk Jin would've been happy.

715
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,690
He would've been excited.

716
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,260
The first mission where you can get
extra ballots is...

717
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,650
Musical Chairs with No Hierarchy.

718
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,650
What kind of game is it?

719
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,920
All of you will put on
special swimming goggles.

720
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,820
(They'll wear swimming goggles
that will block their sight.)

721
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,270
While holding hands,

722
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,630
move in a circle
to the music we play.

723
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,000
When the music stops,

724
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,160
find one of the chairs
and sit on it.

725
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,470
- We have to find it?
- Yes.

726
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,210
Until the last person finds a chair
and sits on it,

727
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,750
you're allowed to take
someone else's chair.

728
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,340
- Oh, gosh.
- Really?

729
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,840
- Can we push one another?
- That's not fair.

730
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
- That's not fair.
- If that's allowed,

731
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,050
- we can never win.
- There's no point.

732
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,020
- It's unfair.
- What if the four of them push me?

733
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,460
That's not possible
because you can't see anything.

734
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,460
- Oh, I see. We can't see.
- But still...

735
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,060
- Let's begin the first round.
- Yes.

736
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,150
- Please put on the goggles.
- Okay.

737
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,420
We're at a disadvantage.

738
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,420
- That's not true.
- Don't worry.

739
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,860
- We're not at a disadvantage.
- Right. You have a chance to win.

740
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,160
Suk Jin, this blocks my sight
completely.

741
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,600
- You can't see anything?
- Anything at all.

742
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,830
Oh, my. I can't see anything.

743
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,100
It's pitch dark.

744
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,830
Hey, I can't see anything.

745
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,640
- Gosh. I can't see at all.
- Right?

746
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,050
- I can't see anything.
- It won't be easy.

747
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,980
Jae Suk, you really look
like a locust in the goggles.

748
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,110
(You really look
like a locust in the goggles.)

749
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,610
- Indeed.
- It makes you look...

750
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,640
- like a real locust.
- Locust Man.

751
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,640
(He turned into a locust
with a simple item.)

752
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,650
- All right.
- You look cool.

753
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,460
Please stand in a circle
next to the other team members.

754
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,820
- I can't see anything.
- I'm So Min.

755
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,760
- It's me. Jae Suk, it's me.
- Okay.

756
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,060
- You're Se Chan.
- Jae Suk, it's me.

757
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,800
- Who are you?
- Ji Hyo is on my left side.

758
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,920
- Who are you?
- I should hold Jong Kook's hand.

759
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,000
- Who is this?
- Where are you?

760
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,090
- Hey, Se Chan, don't hold my hand.
- Hold my hand.

761
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,540
- It's just a game.
- Don't hold my hand.

762
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,060
I have no choice.
We should move in a circle.

763
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,810
- Don't hug me.
- We'll play a song now.

764
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,830
- While the music is...
- Give me your hand.

765
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,370
Move in a circle
while the music is being played.

766
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,710
- Got it.
- I can't see anything.

767
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,810
- Exactly.
- Now... Play the music.

768
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:13,840
I can't see anything.
I'm in trouble.

769
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,410
(Round 1 begins.)

770
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,480
I like the song.

771
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,060
("Kiss Kiss" by LABOUM)

772
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,590
This is one of my favorite songs.

773
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,420
Is this LABOUM's song?

774
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,760
- Where are the chairs?
- Yes, it's LABOUM's song.

775
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,920
Where... Hold on.

776
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,070
You shouldn't check
where the chairs are now.

777
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,490
Don't do it now.

778
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,770
He says we're not allowed to do it.

779
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,690
Hey, don't drag a chair toward you.

780
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,510
Gosh. Stop doing that.

781
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,010
- That's not fair.
- Keep moving, everyone.

782
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,010
Move in a circle. Don't stop.

783
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,780
- Who are you?
- We should keep moving.

784
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,400
- Hey.
- Gosh.

785
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,900
(They have to find and sit
on a chair before one another.)

786
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,670
Gosh, my legs. Hold on.

787
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,350
Who are you? Who is this?

788
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,680
(Jong Kook and Se Chan found
and sat on chairs.)

789
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,680
Be careful. Who are you?

790
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,090
Two chairs are taken now.

791
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,520
(2 people on Team Se Chan
already secured chairs.)

792
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,860
There are still three chairs
you can take.

793
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
(Suk Jin)

794
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
(Ji Hyo)

795
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,560
There are three empty chairs left.

796
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,490
- Two chairs are left now.
- I can't see anything.

797
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,870
There are two empty chairs left.

798
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,070
- Two?
- Yes.

799
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,130
Where are those chairs?

800
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,300
Hey, I...

801
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,310
- Where are those chairs?
- Where are they?

802
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,400
(They got into a brawl.)

803
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,540
Who is this?

804
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,110
- I found Jae Suk.
- It's me, So Min.

805
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,240
- Give me your chair, Ji Hyo.
- It's me, So Min.

806
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,910
- How many chairs...
- There are two empty chairs left.

807
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,520
- Hey, It's me.
- Ji Hyo, give me your chair.

808
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,120
- Hurry up and give me your chair.
- There are two empty chairs left.

809
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,710
- Hey.
- You promised you'd help me.

810
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,520
- Hey, quiet down.
- Come on. Help me win.

811
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,680
- You promised you'd be my spy.
- I'll help you.

812
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,150
- Come on. Act naturally.
- All right.

813
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,880
Gosh. What was that?
Whose butt is this?

814
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,390
- Pass me the chair.
- Where are those chairs?

815
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,830
There are two empty chairs left.

816
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,370
- Are there empty chairs left?
- Yes.

817
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,570
Good. I found one.

818
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,840
There's one empty chair left.

819
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,070
I can't find it.

820
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,400
- Haha, hurry up.
- Where is it?

821
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,930
- There's only one left now.
- I found a chair.

822
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,040
There's only one...

823
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,080
(Finding a chair in the dark
made him happier than he thought.)

824
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,440
I can't find it. Who are you?

825
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,350
- Haha, is that you?
- Hey.

826
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,470
Who was that?

827
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,020
- It's you, So Min, right?
- There's one empty chair left.

828
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,260
It's me.

829
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,130
Jae Suk.

830
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,480
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

831
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,490
Come over here. Hurry.

832
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,690
(The tactful Little Zombie goes
toward her right away.)

833
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,460
Stop. Who are you?
Whose arm is this?

834
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,570
I asked who you were! Who are you?

835
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,700
(They began to tussle
over the chair.)

836
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,040
Ji Hyo, they're near you.

837
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,040
- Take her chair.
- What is this?

838
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,200
(Little Zombie got more ruthless
since he couldn't see anything.)

839
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,900
Who are you? Ji Hyo, it's me.

840
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,780
- Take the chair from her.
- Jae Suk, help me.

841
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,580
- If you sit on it, it's over.
- Take it.

842
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,320
Ji Hyo, take the chair from her.

843
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,480
There's one empty chair left.

844
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,020
Hey, I already found one.

845
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,060
(So Min sat on a chair too.)

846
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,090
Okay. How did it go?

847
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,150
Who was it? Oh, it was Dong Hoon.

848
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,560
Ji Hyo is out.

849
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,760
(Ji Hyo is out.)

850
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,860
What happened? Did I take yours?

851
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,260
- No.
- You took mine.

852
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,070
- You took my chair.
- How did I end up here?

853
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,890
- Why am I here?
- What happened?

854
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,340
- Why are you facing that way?
- This is awkward.

855
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,190
I was sitting with my back
against them.

856
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,200
(While Ssaebssaeb was
talking loudly,)

857
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,770
(So Min whispered,
"I'll give you five more coins.")

858
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,040
- Sorry?
- I'll give you five more coins.

859
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,080
We'll begin the next round
without Ji Hyo.

860
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,010
Ji Hyo, tell us
where the chairs are.

861
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,640
When I find a chair,
I'll go, "Woof, woof."

862
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,940
This game is difficult.

863
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,710
My gosh. I couldn't see anything.

864
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,210
Can anyone see ahead
with the goggles on?

865
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,620
- No, not at all.
- I can't see anything.

866
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,790
- So Min.
- Whose hand is this?

867
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,790
- It's me Se Chan.
- One.

868
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,180
- Your hand is so big, Suk Jin.
- Dong Hoon, your hand is huge.

869
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,180
Play the music.

870
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,220
Right?

871
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,800
- Here we go again.
- Let's go.

872
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,990
Don't kick the chairs.

873
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,030
- Who just kicked a chair?
- Hey.

874
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,070
- Hey!
- Stop it.

875
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,490
- That hurts.
- Don't do that.

876
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,230
- Hey, stop it.
- I warned you.

877
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,510
- Keep moving in a circle.
- Keep moving.

878
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,580
- Keep moving.
- Let's keep moving.

879
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,280
- Let's keep moving.
- Don't stop.

880
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,470
(Dun dun dance)

881
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,710
- Keep moving.
- Okay.

882
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,090
(They didn't forget to dance
in the chorus part.)

883
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,950
Hey, don't swing your leg.

884
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,860
- Okay.
- Gosh. Hold on.

885
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,130
Who was that? Hey, who are you?

886
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,300
(Jong Kook and Suk Jin got
into a fight.)

887
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,660
(Jong Kook won.)

888
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,920
- Oh, isn't this...
- Gosh, stop it.

889
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,160
- It's me.
- These are plastic pants.

890
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,460
It's him. I'm sure of it.

891
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,570
Who are you?

892
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,770
Hey, who are you?
What are you doing?

893
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,900
(They're like a couple in the dark
joking around with each other.)

894
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,510
- These are plastic pants.
- I'm already sitting on it.

895
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,080
Who are you? It's mine.

896
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,710
(The spy is giving So Min a signal.)

897
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,020
- Who are you?
- Move.

898
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,590
There are three empty chairs left.

899
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,120
- We have so many empty chairs.
- Here.

900
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,260
Hey, what are you doing now?

901
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,290
(So Min survived again
with Ji Hyo's help.)

902
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,130
- Go that way.
- Jong Kook, did you find a chair?

903
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,650
- Hey, who are you?
- Jae Suk, it's me.

904
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,390
- Go to the opposite side. Go.
- I'm holding Suk Jin down.

905
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,300
(Ji Hyo helps Jae Suk
on Team So Min as well.)

906
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,460
To the opposite side.

907
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,190
- There must be one here.
- No. Jae Suk.

908
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,700
(Grunting)

909
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,070
- There must be one here.
- No.

910
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:48,080
(The skeptical locust ended up
falling on his butt.)

911
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,110
- There's nothing over there.
- What is this?

912
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,850
Give me those. Whose are these?

913
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,410
These are Suk Jin's glasses.

914
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,970
Jong Kook, did you find a chair?

915
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,090
- Yes, I did.
- Hey.

916
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,320
Haha, where are you?

917
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,480
I'm holding Suk Jin down
in the middle.

918
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,620
- Hey, let go of me.
- There must be one here.

919
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,720
- Haha.
- Hurry up and find a chair.

920
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,180
Haha, come over here.

921
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,630
- Okay.
- What is this?

922
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:07,860
It's me.

923
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,460
- Haha, is that you?
- Yes.

924
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,890
There are two empty chairs left now.

925
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,340
(There are 2 empty chairs left
including what Haha is holding.)

926
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,340
We have two chairs left?

927
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,730
Yes. Hurry up and find it.

928
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,510
Roll around.

929
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,400
Roll around quickly.

930
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,240
- Hey, it's me.
- Sorry.

931
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,780
I heard the noise.

932
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,790
(Ssaebssaeb found another one.)

933
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,210
(Rattling)

934
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,020
(I heard the noise.)

935
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,090
(Crawling)

936
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,860
- I heard it.
- It wasn't like that.

937
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,290
There's someone in front of me.

938
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,490
- Jong Kook, kick him away.
- Okay.

939
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,720
Knock him down.

940
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,160
I heard the noise over there.

941
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,460
It's me, Suk Jin. You came
in the wrong direction again.

942
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,990
Where is it? Where is the chair?

943
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,010
(Screaming)

944
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,400
(The man in plastic pants started
doing a B-boy dance move.)

945
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,700
(The game is over, but they won't
blow the whistle.)

946
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,820
Where is it?

947
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,740
- Why? Is it over?
- It's over.

948
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,410
- Gosh.
- Who got eliminated?

949
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,210
- Suk Jin is out.
- Great.

950
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,210
- There were two chairs here.
- I see.

951
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,650
What kind of strategy is that? Hey.

952
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,680
(Round 3 turned
into a mixed martial arts match.)

953
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,680
So Min, bite him.

954
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,890
- That's good.
- Good job.

955
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,560
That's good. Hit him hard.

956
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,890
(The match between the foul king
and the foul queen)

957
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,390
- Keep hitting him.
- Hey, stop it.

958
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,540
That's not my underwear.

959
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,840
Hey! Stop groping me!

960
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,510
Fine, I won't do it again.

961
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,840
That's not nice.

962
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,900
Okay.

963
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,110
How did it go?

964
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,350
- What?
- You're playing dirty!

965
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,580
That's not nice at all.

966
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,740
- Behind you.
- Turn around.

967
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,910
- No, not there.
- Right there.

968
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,590
- That's Se Chan.
- Steal his seat.

969
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,740
Wait.

970
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,680
(Slap)

971
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,060
(He gets thrown.)

972
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,130
Nice!

973
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,130
Sit in the chair.

974
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,690
He got on it.

975
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,870
(Jae Suk defeats
his fellow pouty mouth.)

976
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,460
- Okay!
- Jae Suk wins.

977
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,930
He slapped me!

978
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,930
He slapped me
while I was in my seat.

979
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,930
- Nicely done.
- Nice.

980
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,270
- He can't see you though.
- I did it.

981
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,510
- Now...
- He's good at this game.

982
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,670
Only Jae Suk remains
on Team So Min.

983
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,310
- This is what it came to.
- Defeat them all.

984
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,880
I'm the last man standing
on this team.

985
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,580
- Yes, defeat them all.
- Oh, no.

986
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,440
Is it my turn to be activated then?

987
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
Okay.

988
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,950
Someone has to stop Jae Suk.

989
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,950
(Jong Kook announces Jae Suk
as his prey.)

990
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,860
Jae Suk, you must make it.

991
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,560
- Go, Jae Suk.
- Let's hold hands.

992
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,600
Who's next?

993
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,030
- Go, Jae Suk.
- Here we go.

994
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,300
Cue music.

995
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,460
(Cue music.)

996
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,830
It's one of my favorite songs.

997
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,040
("Journey to Atlantis" by LABOUM)

998
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,190
Just enjoy the song, Jae Suk.

999
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,310
Wait.

1000
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,660
And dance.

1001
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,700
Did you kick the seats away already?

1002
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,740
- Jae Suk...
- You can take on Jae Suk.

1003
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,620
(Out of the blue)

1004
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,910
(An uninvited guest performer)

1005
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,050
(Laughing)

1006
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,680
(The fake artist
takes command of the stage.)

1007
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,300
(Peck)

1008
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,100
(Gosh...)

1009
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,100
He's the worst.

1010
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,230
Jong Kook's the worst.

1011
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,010
(The whistle is blown.)

1012
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,310
Look.

1013
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,470
Jong Kook has grabbed Jae Suk.

1014
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,540
Hold on.

1015
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,400
Seriously?

1016
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,510
Gosh.

1017
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,050
Oh, no.

1018
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,440
(Groaning)

1019
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,550
He's the worst.

1020
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,710
Things seem too easy for Haha.

1021
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,790
Look how strong he is.

1022
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,150
Haha has found his seat.

1023
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,880
I...

1024
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,130
- It's over.
- But...

1025
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,630
Is this even allowed?

1026
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,100
(Jong Kook holds Jae Suk
so that he can't move.)

1027
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,720
This shouldn't be allowed.

1028
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,200
Jae Suk!

1029
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,470
Let me go!

1030
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,470
(Mr. Muscle loves
to have fun with Jae Suk.)

1031
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,640
Darn it.

1032
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,570
Hey.

1033
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,200
Jae Suk, free yourself
and you might get a chance.

1034
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,530
The round only ends
when one of you finds a seat.

1035
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,840
- Break free and you could win.
- Really?

1036
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,880
Is that so?

1037
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,050
There's a seat left.

1038
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,010
(What's happening?)

1039
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,450
He's dragging Jae Suk along.

1040
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,010
(Jong Kook rolls Jae Suk
along with him.)

1041
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,160
He's dragging Jae Suk along.

1042
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,050
- Hey!
- That's how he'll locate the stool?

1043
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,680
But...

1044
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,990
Haha's getting to safety.

1045
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,160
- You...
- No way.

1046
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,030
Jae Suk, beside you.

1047
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,160
- Beside you. Use your foot.
- Good.

1048
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,340
- Use your foot.
- My foot?

1049
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,030
- His foot?
- Your left foot!

1050
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,930
- His foot?
- Your left foot!

1051
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,430
- Your foot.
- Your left foot.

1052
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,530
His left foot.

1053
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,240
Jong Kook, it's near your head.

1054
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,300
Jae Suk, it's right above you.

1055
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,550
- Above you.
- Above my head?

1056
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,880
- Above your head.
- Your head.

1057
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,410
My head?

1058
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,510
Hey.

1059
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,610
It's above his head?

1060
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,510
Jong Kook has the stool!

1061
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,820
He's going to sit on it.

1062
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,990
He'll sit on it.

1063
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,990
Go, Jong Kook. Just end it.

1064
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,530
Hold on a second.

1065
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,760
He hasn't sat on it yet.

1066
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,930
It's still in his hand.

1067
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,300
- He hasn't sat on it yet.
- It's still in his hand.

1068
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,740
- In his hand?
- Yes, his hand.

1069
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,360
(Team So Min loses
if Jae Suk is eliminated.)

1070
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,070
(Will Locust Warrior
turn the tables?)

1071
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,240
It's in his hand.

1072
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,530
(Jong Kook goes
for the Adam's apple.)

1073
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,680
It's over.

1074
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,780
- Look.
- My gosh.

1075
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,550
- You...
- Goodness.

1076
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,840
- Nice!
- Seriously?

1077
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,950
- He was able to tease you.
- That was fun.

1078
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,220
That wasn't fun at all.

1079
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,510
- He didn't have fun.
- It was the worst.

1080
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,890
- Gosh.
- Unbelievable.

1081
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,930
- That was fun.
- Here you go.

1082
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,590
You finished your first game...

1083
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,360
and Team So Min was eliminated.

1084
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,640
Members of the winning team
will each get a ballot.

1085
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,640
(Members of Team Se Chan
each get a ballot.)

1086
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,660
Goodness.

1087
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,760
- What's this?
- It's the ballot...

1088
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,930
- you cast your votes with.
- I see.

1089
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,160
(They'll cast their votes
with this ballot.)

1090
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,030
- So this is a ballot.
- It's a ballot.

1091
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,110
- This is what's important.
- We need this.

1092
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,280
So Min, I suddenly feel motivated.

1093
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,340
You see...

1094
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,950
You were eliminated pretty fast...

1095
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,340
for someone who was motivated.

1096
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,740
I'll make sure that Se Chan
ends up beneath you.

1097
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,910
So Min.

1098
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,320
- I'm on your side.
- I'm worth a lot.

1099
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,180
I'll devote myself to you.

1100
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,260
- I'm motivated.
- You can have ten.

1101
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,680
You already gave him a lot.

1102
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,050
I'll give you eight coins.

1103
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,360
What about me? Three?

1104
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,590
No, you get four.

1105
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,030
How about five?

1106
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,030
Next up is...

1107
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,860
the bonus round.

1108
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,260
For lunch, you will play
The Food I Ordered.

1109
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,530
- The Food I Ordered?
- The Food I Ordered.

1110
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,700
- The Food I Ordered
- The Food I Ordered

1111
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,010
You will each order the dish...

1112
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,340
you wish to eat.

1113
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,640
The number of ballots you receive
will depend on how fast it arrives.

1114
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Goodness.

1115
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,110
Then Chinese is the way to go.

1116
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,180
- Or street food.
- The faster the better.

1117
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,280
The dish or restaurant...

1118
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,160
- can't overlap.
- Is that so?

1119
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,130
The one who orders it first
will receive the right to the dish.

1120
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,820
Do we only order one each?

1121
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,130
The number of dishes
will be selected randomly.

1122
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,300
(The number of dishes
will be selected randomly.)

1123
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,840
The least number of dishes
will be two.

1124
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,430
- Right.
- The maximum will be eight...

1125
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,200
which will be shared
among the staff.

1126
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,340
It's over if you must order a lot...

1127
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,910
and one has to be jokbal.

1128
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,030
It will take too long.

1129
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,610
Only one of us has to win.

1130
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,700
You are not in teams.

1131
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,110
- Really?
- It's an individual game.

1132
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,240
Really?

1133
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,740
So every man for himself.

1134
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,490
We each have to order
a certain amount of dishes.

1135
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,410
- Okay.
- What's the minimum?

1136
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,660
- Two dishes.
- Two dishes.

1137
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,820
One or two?

1138
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,180
(Jae Suk only has to order
2 dishes.)

1139
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,260
Darn it.

1140
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,720
- I have to order 6.
- I have to order 4.

1141
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,390
Three dishes. Not bad.

1142
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,930
- I have to order 5.
- Does this say 8?

1143
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,530
- Yes, 8.
- I have to order 7.

1144
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,890
I'll order from a nearby restaurant.

1145
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,890
Okay. You may now order...

1146
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,140
- from your own cell phones.
- I'll use the app.

1147
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,030
- What's the address?
- I'll write it down for you.

1148
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,470
- Are you already ordering?
- Of course.

1149
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,410
I only have to order
two bowls of jjajangmyeon.

1150
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,550
Darn it.

1151
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,140
I can order anything I want, right?

1152
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,570
- Eight dishes though?
- That's right.

1153
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,640
- This is bad.
- I hate this.

1154
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,610
You can't order
two of the same dish.

1155
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,780
- Must they be different?
- Are you serious?

1156
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,890
Unbelievable.

1157
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,510
- That's insane.
- Must they be different?

1158
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,050
I can't order two of the same dish?

1159
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,280
- Then...
- Hey.

1160
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,430
This is crazy.

1161
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,590
(Jae Suk is the only one
who doesn't use a delivery app.)

1162
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,530
- Hello?
- Yes, hello.

1163
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,260
- I'm here at Seongbuk-gu, Seoul.
- Let me order from there.

1164
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,660
I'd like to order
1 jjajangmyeon and 1 jjamppong.

1165
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,570
- One jjajangmyeon, one jjamppong.
- Right.

1166
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,700
Thank you.

1167
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,880
All right. I'm all set.

1168
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,280
(Jae Suk placed his order,
so no one else can order Chinese.)

1169
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,470
No one else can order Chinese.

1170
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,320
I'm ordering street food.

1171
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,410
No, that's mine.

1172
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,220
What can be made in a hurry?

1173
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,390
Cheese gimbap and tuna gimbap.

1174
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,760
(Laughing triumphantly)

1175
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,910
- I ordered seven.
- He's so annoying!

1176
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,220
Darn it!

1177
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,320
I'm done. It cost me 35 dollars.

1178
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,660
- I placed my order.
- What did you order?

1179
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,300
- Dumplings and...
- Street food is off the table.

1180
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,200
How can a burger take
40 minutes to make?

1181
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,990
I offered the cafe owner
Jae Suk's autograph...

1182
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,260
in exchange for fast delivery.

1183
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,430
- What?
- I offered your autograph...

1184
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,340
- in exchange for fast delivery.
- Six dishes of jokbal...

1185
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,640
I ordered pork cutlet!

1186
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,050
- A rush order of 40 minutes?
- I ordered kalguksu.

1187
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,820
It cost me 84 dollars.

1188
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,910
(It cost me 84 dollars. Darn it.)

1189
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,780
Call 114 and ask...

1190
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,510
which restaurant offers
the fastest delivery.

1191
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,510
Get the phone number from them...

1192
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,760
and place your order.

1193
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,260
- Are you good with sandwiches?
- Sure.

1194
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,860
Okay, I'm done.

1195
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,890
(Old man Suk Jin
manages to order 8 dishes.)

1196
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,030
My order is being confirmed.

1197
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,390
- It'll take 43 minutes.
- Okay.

1198
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,430
I placed my order.

1199
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,990
I'm sure that my order...

1200
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,700
- Eight dishes.
- is being wrapped as we speak.

1201
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,700
I bet they're on the wrapping phase.

1202
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,300
How can Jae Suk not win this?

1203
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,280
Chinese restaurants offer
the fastest delivery.

1204
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,780
Who's the current
youngest member then?

1205
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,680
- It's Suk Jin, of course.
- It's just that...

1206
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,740
Yes, Suk Jin.

1207
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,220
- It's just that I want some water.
- Got it.

1208
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,490
This is what I call habitual.

1209
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,640
(Se Chan is used
to running errands.)

1210
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,050
This is what
the youngest member will do.

1211
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,410
- These things...
- Go ahead and take one.

1212
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,820
Haha.

1213
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,220
Haha, here.

1214
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,050
- Thanks.
- Haha,

1215
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,130
- here you go.
- Thank you.

1216
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,160
Here you go.

1217
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,700
The water is cold as ice, isn't it?

1218
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,640
The water in my van froze.

1219
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,470
I bought a lightweight padded jacket.

1220
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,140
One to wear indoors?

1221
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,360
- Indoors?
- Yes, to wear indoors.

1222
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,700
Back home,

1223
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,340
my father wears the padded jacket
he wears outdoors.

1224
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,780
(My father wears the padded jacket
he wears outdoors.)

1225
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,510
(They wear padded jackets
to reduce heating bills.)

1226
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,410
- And turn the heater down?
- Yes.

1227
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,910
And in the summer...

1228
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,780
Se Chan and I went to his house
to film something.

1229
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,050
It was summer and he stepped outside
covered in sweat.

1230
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,010
The living room
was pretty hot as well,

1231
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,280
but he was like,
"Gosh, it's cool out here."

1232
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,430
- He doesn't turn the AC on.
- No, he doesn't.

1233
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,430
You don't turn on the one
in your room?

1234
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,550
I only turn on the one in my room.

1235
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,300
- But you will once you're married.
- Once I'm married,

1236
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,570
that'll be up to my wife.

1237
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,030
But you'll complain though.

1238
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,470
"That's a lot in utilities."

1239
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,800
Of course not.

1240
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,680
- He'll be like that for sure.
- No way.

1241
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,340
I'm not one to bother
with the utility costs.

1242
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,450
- I'm not like that.
- He's frugal.

1243
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,450
I'm saving up the money
for my wife and children to spend.

1244
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,910
- What about...
- I have no use for it.

1245
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,990
Does that include
the wet wipes you received...

1246
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,510
- as a housewarming gift?
- Of course.

1247
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,450
Even after all these years?

1248
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,590
- We bought that for him.
- Are they for your kids too?

1249
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,780
Of course.

1250
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,390
What about
the toilet paper I got you?

1251
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,930
- Exactly.
- Jong Kook...

1252
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,630
Ji Hyo, seriously?

1253
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,860
- What?
- That tissue.

1254
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,640
She used it to wipe her nose
and put it back in her sack.

1255
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,860
I saw that.

1256
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,300
His future wife!

1257
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,280
- Gosh.
- I can't believe it.

1258
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,970
- Seriously?
- It wasn't a clean one either.

1259
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,640
- She didn't throw it away?
- Like husband, like wife.

1260
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,050
Actions speak louder than words.

1261
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,970
- Unbelievable.
- Nothing else is needed since...

1262
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,550
- actions speak louder than words.
- It went back in your sack?

1263
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,340
- After wiping her nose with it,
- Good one.

1264
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,890
she put it back in her sack.

1265
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,510
Is this your way
of flirting with him?

1266
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,360
Words aren't needed in this case.

1267
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,220
You saved the used tissue.

1268
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,530
- I can't believe it.
- How thoughtful.

1269
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,530
- No way.
- She's just as frugal.

1270
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,030
I'm amazed, Ji Hyo.

1271
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,530
(Food is delivered.)

1272
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:54,430
(Which dishes are first to arrive?)

1273
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:58,110
- He doesn't buy it.
- So the standard is based on...

1274
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,110
Someone is here!

1275
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,510
(While they were chattering,
someone's food arrived.)

1276
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:05,510
(Which food has arrived first?)

1277
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,570
- Someone is here! It's pork cutlet.
- No way!

1278
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,570
(It's pork cutlet!)

1279
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,700
(The pork cutlet that Ji Hyo ordered
arrived first.)

1280
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,840
- That's mine! It's unbelievable.
- The pork cutlet got here first.

1281
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,870
For real?

1282
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,140
That was possible because
the restaurant is right in front.

1283
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,870
- Is that so?
- The pork cutlet got here first?

1284
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,470
- She is...
- The pork cutlet arrived first.

1285
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,780
She's the most practical one.

1286
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,340
- You're right.
- Ji Hyo...

1287
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,050
- It's the pork cutlet.
- She is the lucky one for sure.

1288
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,260
- I even called the owner myself.
- They're not coming.

1289
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,780
Ji Hyo, we'll give you three ballots
since you won.

1290
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,680
That's incredible.

1291
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,720
Mine should be here soon.

1292
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,320
Ji Hyo, you don't mind
if I have this, do you?

1293
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,360
Not at all. Go ahead.

1294
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,590
- Thanks.
- They don't need to give this.

1295
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,590
Here he goes again.

1296
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,640
Just leave it.

1297
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,030
- No.
- It's a waste, isn't it?

1298
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,110
Give it to me.
Ji Hyo can use it as her pouch.

1299
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,660
Come on. She'll use it as her pouch.

1300
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,800
- No.
- Here. Use it as your pouch.

1301
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,340
Use it as a reflecting plate.

1302
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,700
There you go.

1303
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,970
Something else is here.
It's jjajangmyeon and jjamppong.

1304
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,010
Is it mine?

1305
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,140
Yes! It's jjajangmyeon
and jjamppong.

1306
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,680
Jae Suk is lucky.

1307
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,090
Since you won 2nd place,
we'll give you 2 ballots.

1308
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,090
All right!

1309
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,340
I heard the doorbell ring.

1310
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,360
(The doorbell rang again.)

1311
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,820
It's street food.

1312
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,120
- It's yours.
- Se Chan, you get two ballots.

1313
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,120
That's right.

1314
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:15,990
- It's Subway, Jong Kook.
- It's Subway.

1315
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,760
(Jong Kook's healthy sandwiches
arrive as well.)

1316
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,120
I wish it came a little earlier.

1317
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:22,200
Until when will you make my food?

1318
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,490
This is driving me crazy.

1319
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,800
- The emoji keeps going like this.
- It keeps...

1320
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,570
- It keeps cooking.
- The emoji keeps going like this.

1321
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,700
The emoji.

1322
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,910
Look at this.

1323
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,870
Oh, I got a call.

1324
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:37,680
What is it?

1325
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,320
(Right then, Haha gets a call
from the deliveryman.)

1326
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,890
- Hello?
- Please leave it by the front.

1327
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,320
Just ring the bell, please.

1328
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,820
The bell? The address says
it's a construction site.

1329
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,050
- A construction site?
- A construction site?

1330
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,200
(Startled)

1331
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,530
- There's a construction site.
- It's next to the site.

1332
00:43:55,490 --> 00:44:00,240
(Haha's deliveryman missed
the place and drove past it.)

1333
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,510
Tell him it's the house
with many cars.

1334
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,530
There's a house where there are
many cars parked.

1335
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:05,370
(He's in a hurry.)

1336
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,410
This is worth a shot.

1337
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:11,010
Do I have to go down the hill
from the construction site?

1338
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:15,740
(But...)

1339
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,360
(Right then)

1340
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,320
(Another deliveryman arrives.)

1341
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,660
- It'll take two minutes.
- I'm waving my hands here.

1342
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,700
Over here.

1343
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,720
(But...)

1344
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,820
(So Min's deliveryman
goes back the way he came.)

1345
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,030
(Halting)

1346
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,970
- Come to this side. Thank you.
- All right.

1347
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:41,780
Hurry! You need to come faster
than that man!

1348
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,140
Two deliverymen arrived
at the same time!

1349
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,470
(Two deliverymen arrived
at the same time!)

1350
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,450
- Really?
- You need to hurry!

1351
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:50,140
- Sir! Please hurry!
- Please hurry!

1352
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,450
- This won't do!
- Hey.

1353
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,860
Sir, please hurry!

1354
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,760
- Please hurry up!
- Please come in faster than him.

1355
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,660
- They're...
- You need to come in faster.

1356
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,720
(The deliveryman who enters first
will win.)

1357
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,320
You need to come up
faster than he does.

1358
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,430
I think it's mine.

1359
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:04,840
You need to come in before he does.

1360
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,890
You ordered a lot though.

1361
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,570
(So Min wins.)

1362
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,870
That's mine. All right! Thank you.

1363
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:13,970
That was close.

1364
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,870
My deliveryman came in
before the other guy.

1365
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,320
So Min takes fifth place,

1366
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,640
and Haha comes in sixth place.

1367
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,990
What did you order?

1368
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,820
Suk Jin is in seventh place.

1369
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,890
(Suk Jin takes last place
as his food hasn't arrived.)

1370
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,010
He's in last place.

1371
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,820
You guys can have the food
when it arrives.

1372
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,590
Thank you so much.

1373
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:31,120
- All right.
- I think he's sullen.

1374
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,360
Are you upset
that you spent 100 dollars?

1375
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,070
- No.
- Why do you sound so blunt?

1376
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,090
He'll say this to Bo Pil later.

1377
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,300
- To pay for it?
- To wire him money?

1378
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,030
"I'm sorry, Bo Pil,
but for the food..."

1379
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,070
"Wire me money."

1380
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,640
("Please make it look like
I paid for the food.")

1381
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,610
- "Let's split the bill."
- "Bo Pil."

1382
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,680
"Bo Pil."

1383
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:51,720
(Laughing awkwardly)

1384
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,370
Please enjoy the food.

1385
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,780
This is a really delicious sandwich.

1386
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,640
And we'll continue
the mission afterward.

1387
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,010
- I'm so full.
- Look at this.

1388
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,260
You'll need to choose your team
before the second mission.

1389
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,950
Who should I pick this time?

1390
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,820
- First...
- I think they'll win for sure.

1391
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,660
- So Min is so stingy with coins.
- Is that so?

1392
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,390
- But So Min gave me a lot.
- She's really stingy.

1393
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,300
- How many do you have?
- Wait a minute.

1394
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,700
He's not giving me any coins.

1395
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,030
He's not?

1396
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,110
- The number of coins matters a lot.
- Did he give you any coins?

1397
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,680
Look at this punk.

1398
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,240
- Right?
- He made us forget about it.

1399
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,470
- He didn't give you any?
- Two, four, six, eight.

1400
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:25,970
I have about 20 coins.

1401
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,780
- You got about 20?
- Yes.

1402
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,820
- You got about 20 coins?
- Yes.

1403
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:33,120
- You must let So Min win.
- You must let So Min win.

1404
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,360
- I got 20 or more coins.
- You need to go all-in.

1405
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:36,990
Why don't we start with Jong Kook
this time?

1406
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:37,990
- Shall I?
- Yes.

1407
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:40,090
- This is ridiculous.
- Jong Kook, join our team.

1408
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:44,390
I think we should stick to one team.

1409
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,160
Should I join his team again
and ask for more coins?

1410
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,070
Se Chan is so stingy with his coins.

1411
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,970
He really is.

1412
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,700
(He has arrived on the 2nd floor
with wrath.)

1413
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:57,370
I should go and scout them.

1414
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:03,090
I realized you haven't given us
any coins since earlier.

1415
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,990
You gave us coins only once.

1416
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,760
I'll give you ten coins
if you come into the room.

1417
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,280
We worked hard with the game,
so shouldn't you have given us...

1418
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,050
some coins?

1419
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,620
- We won the game for you.
- I...

1420
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,530
Jae Suk already has
more than 20 coins.

1421
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,090
- More than 20 coins?
- That's right.

1422
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,990
How come you're not giving us any?

1423
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:20,800
Jong Kook, I can guarantee you
ten coins once you come in.

1424
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,030
(At that moment)

1425
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,570
Jong Kook.

1426
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,550
(Fisherwoman Jeon throws a bait
while showing him the coins.)

1427
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,050
How can you give them to me
like this? Hold on.

1428
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,110
Jong Kook.

1429
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,010
- Hey.
- There are 20 coins in there.

1430
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:34,240
Even if you get 20 coins,
you can't win against Jae Suk.

1431
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,410
It's better for you to get
20 more coins from me.

1432
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,160
- I'll give you incentives.
- She won't be able to win.

1433
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,450
So Min won't be able to win.

1434
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,950
Okay, then.

1435
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,550
- All right.
- There are 20 coins in there.

1436
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,870
I... All right, then.

1437
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:49,620
I choose this team.

1438
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,700
It's snowing, and it's so pretty.

1439
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,930
- It's really pretty.
- Right.

1440
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,570
- It's snowing.
- The white snow is coming down

1441
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,800
(The gangster is in a good mood
after receiving coins.)

1442
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,370
Jong Kook, if you do well this time,

1443
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,200
- You'll give me incentives, right?
- I'll give you more coins.

1444
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,910
Right, you know how to boost our morale.

1445
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,570
(Next up is Ji Hyo.)

1446
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,590
I hope Ji Hyo joins my team.

1447
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:10,860
I'm sure she'll join my team.

1448
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,910
(Ji Hyo has been performing
as So Min's spy.)

1449
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,510
Ji Hyo is my spy.

1450
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,390
I'll give you coins.

1451
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,890
Ji Hyo, you should remember this.

1452
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,870
Even if you join that team,

1453
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:25,530
you'll be short on coins.

1454
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:29,030
You should join my team and enjoy
the eight coins I'll give you.

1455
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,430
What's worse is that
So Min doesn't have coins now.

1456
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,110
She gave Jae Suk 30 coins.

1457
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,070
- Se Chan, did you know?
- What?

1458
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,550
I have a lot of ballots.

1459
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:38,570
How many do you have?

1460
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,840
I got plenty.

1461
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,890
I'll give you 15 coins to start with.
What do you think?

1462
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,720
Why don't you show me...

1463
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,050
I'll write her name
if you give me the coins.

1464
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:48,360
- Okay. Keep your promise.
- I promise.

1465
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,590
You'll write her name,

1466
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:51,200
- Give me 5 coins since I'm here.
- and I'll give you 5 coins.

1467
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:54,470
Goodness. This is...

1468
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,660
I'm not thinking of giving Suk Jin
any coins.

1469
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:58,990
(I'm not thinking of giving Suk Jin
any coins.)

1470
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,260
So Min.

1471
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,010
So Min, he's offering me six coins.

1472
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:07,410
(Click)

1473
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,280
(So Min blocks Suk Jin
from entering.)

1474
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,280
Good job. He's good for nothing.

1475
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,570
I realized he's not very helpful.

1476
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,490
Did she just shut the door on me?

1477
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,390
She shut the door on me?

1478
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,180
Aren't you going to scout me?

1479
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:23,490
No.

1480
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:25,120
I see.

1481
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:28,800
Gosh, no. I won't join your team.
You're giving me eight coins?

1482
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:30,660
Eight coins?

1483
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:32,640
I'll think about it.

1484
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,370
I think he's acting alone.

1485
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,840
- It's so obvious.
- Right?

1486
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,470
He's acting on his own.

1487
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,570
You're giving me eight coins?

1488
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:42,910
- Eight coins?
- You see?

1489
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,280
He should come in last
in the hierarchy.

1490
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,340
(You see?)

1491
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,450
He's 57 years old this year.

1492
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:49,490
(He's 57 years old this year.)

1493
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:52,050
And he's still faking a deal.

1494
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,990
Who's immature here?

1495
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:58,300
Look at him.

1496
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,700
He's 57, and yet...

1497
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,800
"Give me one more, will you?"

1498
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,720
Did you just have a daydream?
I didn't say anything.

1499
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,160
What do you mean by eight coins?

1500
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,740
How many do you have?

1501
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,370
So Min gave me eight coins.

1502
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:11,180
Let me see. I'll give you ten coins.

1503
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,780
- Ten?
- I'll give you ten.

1504
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,070
- Give it to me.
- Come in first.

1505
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,070
You should give it to me first.

1506
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,640
He's inside the room.
He's done, right?

1507
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,120
- It's confirmed.
- It's confirmed. Great.

1508
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,280
(Suk Jin, who had nowhere to go,
chose Team Se Chan.)

1509
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,910
- All right.
- This is great.

1510
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:23,120
- I hope they give us a quiz.
- All right.

1511
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,280
- Gosh, we're a strong team.
- Well done, Jae Suk.

1512
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,590
- All right.
- We're so strong.

1513
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:26,590
We don't need anyone else.

1514
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,090
Shall I lock the door
since I don't need anyone else?

1515
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:30,700
I'll give you 12 coins.

1516
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,200
- I think we'll win this time.
- All right!

1517
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,990
- All set.
- I can't help it.

1518
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,890
- Of course not.
- It can't be helped.

1519
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:38,090
Of course I should choose this team.

1520
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:39,990
Let's go.

1521
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,160
So Min must be high-spirited.

1522
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,280
Jong Kook, how could you
join that team?

1523
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,070
- Of course.
- I was startled.

1524
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,570
I should test my luck on both teams.

1525
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:51,820
All right. Let's move on
to the second mission right away.

1526
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,990
The second mission with
the two youngests' pride at stake...

1527
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,910
is called
The Youngest's Winning Game.

1528
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,220
The youngest members,
Se Chan and So Min,

1529
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,550
will write down five simple games
that they're good at.

1530
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,260
Then they'll play the game
that's randomly picked.

1531
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,870
- Between the youngest members?
- Yes.

1532
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,300
- But...
- Between the youngest members?

1533
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:12,490
When they're done with it,

1534
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:16,070
the members can play the same game.

1535
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,640
- Between the members?
- The members on each team.

1536
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,240
We'll only count the final score.

1537
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:21,370
- So this is pretty fair.
- So...

1538
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,240
the team that acquires
four points first wins.

1539
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,050
Let's play a quiz.

1540
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,390
- Submit the final...
- Play a quiz.

1541
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:30,050
Using the same questions from last time.
Something like this.

1542
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:31,550
- The results will...
- Let's go for gonggi.

1543
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,680
Choose a game where you can win.

1544
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,030
- A game that guarantees your win.
- A memory game.

1545
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,360
Both teams,
please write down the games.

1546
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,360
Of course. I'm good at it.

1547
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,200
I'll include jegichagi.

1548
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,300
- Yes, go for it.
- I'll add jegichagi.

1549
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,870
(They're after a win
with games So Min is bad at.)

1550
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:45,840
- Let's choose that.
- Good one.

1551
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,530
- Let's...
- You'll win that for sure.

1552
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,260
A game he can win.

1553
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,640
- Gonggi. You're good at that.
- Gonggi.

1554
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,430
- That's it.
- That's it. That's right.

1555
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:53,530
And...

1556
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,450
(Gonggi, memory game)

1557
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:56,910
- What else?
- That sounds great.

1558
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:59,050
What about this?
Shedding tears fast.

1559
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,550
- That's a good one.
- Right?

1560
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:04,450
Shedding...
What if he sheds tears faster than me?

1561
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,120
- Shedding tears fast.
- He won't be able to.

1562
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,450
(So Min is also writing a list
of things only she's good at.)

1563
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,160
What else is So Min good at?

1564
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,550
(What else is So Min good at?)

1565
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,550
How do you play that?

1566
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,160
Keeping composure?

1567
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,140
Keeping composure. What else?

1568
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,700
What about boxing?

1569
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,840
- Why don't you name comedians?
- Boxing?

1570
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,930
- Boxing. What's wrong?
- You want boxing?

1571
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:26,530
- The one whose nose bleeds first loses.
- With me?

1572
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:28,050
- With me?
- Boxing.

1573
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,550
The one whose nose bleeds
loses. What's wrong with it?

1574
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,620
I need to win to survive.

1575
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,090
Boxing.

1576
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:36,090
What about a quiz on stocks?

1577
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,860
- A quiz related to stocks.
- That's a really good one.

1578
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,450
You'll be...

1579
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,220
- He'll be at an advantage.
- This is totally...

1580
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,930
I know stocks well, so...

1581
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,450
- You'll win for sure.
- What about this one?

1582
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:47,760
It'll be funny if they use
the same questions from last time.

1583
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,320
Gosh, what were they? All right.

1584
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:53,200
Using the same questions
from the same quiz is boring.

1585
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,140
Something like an isothermal line?

1586
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,740
Something like
the five duties of a citizen?

1587
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,910
Yes. Using the exact same questions.

1588
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:59,370
- The exact same ones.
- I remember them.

1589
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,550
- Do you think she remembers them?
- I just tried to recall them,

1590
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:02,640
but I couldn't.

1591
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,840
What about flicking on a forehead?

1592
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,370
- That doesn't sound good.
- It's cute.

1593
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:09,090
You shouldn't include that...

1594
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,760
because it'll be too painful
for some.

1595
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,760
We have Jong Kook.

1596
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,090
What's the point of winning
on your own?

1597
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,720
Or we should do something like
stealing a bike.

1598
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,720
- You're good at that.
- You should do that.

1599
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,030
It'll only take me 15 seconds.

1600
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,720
(It'll only take me 15 seconds.)

1601
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,140
I can steal it in 15 seconds.

1602
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,530
It takes me 30 seconds
to steal a motorcycle.

1603
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:26,530
(It takes me 30 seconds
to steal a motorcycle.)

1604
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:28,370
- Drinking water fast.
- Okay.

1605
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:30,530
- Hey, I got Jae Suk and Jong Kook.
- You'll win for sure.

1606
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:32,740
They can cover any games.

1607
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,280
- This is...
- You'll win these for sure.

1608
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,640
They're too...

1609
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,110
- They're too mean.
- Bring it on.

1610
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:38,910
- That's how it is.
- They're too simple though.

1611
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,450
- How reassuring.
- Do we have to play all of them?

1612
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,740
I'll pick one now.
There are ten games here.

1613
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,010
- All right.
- Okay.

1614
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,820
(Among the 10 games,)

1615
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,320
Which one is it?

1616
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,950
(which game will they play first?)

1617
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:54,590
It's shedding tears fast.

1618
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:55,870
(Shedding tears fast)

1619
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,430
(He picked So Min's game.)

1620
00:53:58,430 --> 00:53:59,640
- All right.
- You're good at acting too.

1621
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,010
- You can do it, right?
- Okay, this is...

1622
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,340
- Don't start already.
- We haven't started yet.

1623
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,930
Stop it. Don't start.

1624
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,550
You started crying
even before receiving...

1625
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,910
- Think of that moment.
- the Top Excellence Award.

1626
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,140
- Think of that moment.
- You can start when I tell you to.

1627
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,140
Close your eyes.

1628
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,340
Close your eyes. Ready, start.

1629
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:17,950
You can do it.
Don't blink your eyes.

1630
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:20,010
The first one to drop a tear
will win.

1631
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:21,030
(The youngest ones get emotional.)

1632
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:23,360
- Don't blink your eyes.
- The first one...

1633
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,490
(A comedian who is
an expert in skits...)

1634
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,470
So Min can cry right away.

1635
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,470
(versus a great actress)

1636
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,160
- Hey, you should imagine...
- So Min...

1637
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,240
that you fell
into the bottomless pit.

1638
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,140
This is my killer move.

1639
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,910
(This is my killer move.)

1640
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,570
Why are you doing this to me?

1641
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,800
(Why are you doing this to me?)

1642
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,550
(So Min suddenly talks
to Jong Kook.)

1643
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,680
Why are you staring at me?
It's scary.

1644
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,490
Gosh.

1645
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,300
(So Min gets emotional
while looking at Jong Kook...)

1646
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,660
(and sheds tears in only 3 seconds.)

1647
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,470
(It's unbelievable.)

1648
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:08,740
You're the best. So Min is the best.

1649
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,840
- How...
- You're the best.

1650
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,300
Ji Hyo, you should give this a try.

1651
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,570
I seriously thought...

1652
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,840
- You can do it, right?
- No, I can't.

1653
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:16,450
- I can't do it.
- You're incredible.

1654
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:17,840
How is that possible?

1655
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,340
I killed everyone I know in my head,

1656
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,410
but I couldn't cry.

1657
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,910
I killed everyone I know,
but I couldn't cry.

1658
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,550
You'll be able to shed a tear
if you just look at Jong Kook.

1659
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,720
- Am I that terrifying?
- He's so scary.

1660
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,720
- Am I that bad?
- All the things you did...

1661
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,030
flashed before my eyes.

1662
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:29,950
It didn't even take 15 seconds.

1663
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:31,260
All the things he did,
flashed before my eyes.

1664
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,360
It's one to nil.

1665
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,870
How did she shed a tear that fast?
She's amazing.

1666
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:37,660
- It's unbelievable.
- They should pick your game.

1667
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,530
- Either jegichagi or...
- You need to play your game.

1668
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:41,370
- Aren't you going to play?
- No.

1669
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:42,370
- You won't?
- You won't?

1670
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:44,340
Suk Jin and Jae Suk
should give it a try.

1671
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,470
- I can never shed a tear.
- I can't shed a tear.

1672
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:47,550
Will you play if Suk Jin does?

1673
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,570
- I'll make you shed tears.
- You should play if Suk Jin does.

1674
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,240
- If Suk Jin plays?
- I'll make you shed tears.

1675
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,470
Okay, I'll play if he does.

1676
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:53,780
You should play, Suk Jin.

1677
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,550
- You should try playing it.
- I can never shed a tear.

1678
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,720
I'll accept it if your eyes get red.

1679
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,660
- Do you want to give it a try?
- Okay.

1680
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,450
I'll give you a minute
and another one if needed.

1681
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,490
- I don't think I'll shed a tear.
- We're playing it for a minute?

1682
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,760
- I can't shed a tear.
- If it's for one minute,

1683
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,860
you'll shed a tear
if you just keep your eyes open.

1684
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:06,950
You need to open them big.

1685
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:08,300
- This is...
- Open your eyes big.

1686
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:11,490
You might be able to shed
a tear if you open your eyes big.

1687
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:12,990
Look at Jae Suk.

1688
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:14,700
- It's begun.
- I don't think he'll cry.

1689
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,740
Ready, set, go.

1690
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,260
(The 1 minute begins.)

1691
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:19,640
Jae Suk, that's quite fast.

1692
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,280
- Look at Jae Suk.
- Think of something sad.

1693
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,280
I think you might shed it.
Don't blink.

1694
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,820
Can you take off your glasses?

1695
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,820
(They go head to head
by taking off their glasses.)

1696
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:29,010
They're so ugly.

1697
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,360
Think of something sad.

1698
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,490
(Something sad...)

1699
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:35,590
Think of your stock prices dropping.

1700
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,120
Can you cuss at me, Jong Kook?

1701
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,200
Try to move my heart.
I only shed tears when I'm moved.

1702
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,760
Jong Kook, go ahead and cuss me out.

1703
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,470
Think of your wife.

1704
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,260
- Suk Jin, actually...
- Like this?

1705
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:46,930
(Hitting hard)

1706
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:50,740
(He's going to hit Jae Suk
until he cries.)

1707
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,110
- Think of something sad.
- He's crying.

1708
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,370
What do I do?

1709
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,370
You have 15 seconds.

1710
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,820
Suk Jin, make your acceptance
speech for the Grand Award here.

1711
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,470
- Hit me one more time.
- Say your speech here.

1712
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:01,840
- Then you'll cry.
- I'm grateful for our members.

1713
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:04,320
You know the speech you prepared.

1714
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,760
- "Dear my beloved..."
- I'm...

1715
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,360
(I'm grateful for our members.
Thank you so much.)

1716
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,660
Thank you so much.

1717
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:10,590
I can't cry!

1718
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:11,660
(Jong Kook is still trying
to make him cry by punching him.)

1719
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:13,220
Keep going.

1720
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,300
You can do it.

1721
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,570
- Hit me one more time.
- Mention our names.

1722
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:19,570
- Thank you, Jae Suk.
- Hit me one more time. Darn it!

1723
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,160
Jong Kook, I'm...

1724
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,340
(A rare sight of one being
overly emotional...)

1725
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,740
- And then what?
- He's crying.

1726
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,840
I'm grateful, and...

1727
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,930
(The Grand Award winner
in his imagination...)

1728
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:27,030
(got teary-eyed in no time.)

1729
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,200
- He's crying.
- He did it.

1730
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,840
- It just came out!
- It came out!

1731
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,240
- It came out!
- It came out!

1732
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,740
- That doesn't count.
- Mine came out too.

1733
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,280
- It came out!
- It came out.

1734
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,120
My tear came out.

1735
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,050
- It did, right?
- Look at this.

1736
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:42,220
(The director comes in
to verify it.)

1737
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,280
- It came out, right?
- It came out.

1738
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,700
- Where?
- Suk Jin wins.

1739
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,950
(Suk Jin wins.)

1740
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,220
(Suk Jin squeezes out a tear
while making his acceptance speech.)

1741
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:51,640
(His eyes got a little watery.)

1742
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,740
(On the other hand,
Jae Suk's eyes are dry.)

1743
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,530
(Suk Jin manages
to squeeze out his tears.)

1744
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:00,510
I told you to hit me harder.

1745
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:02,280
I thought it'd hurt.

1746
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:04,070
Gosh.

1747
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:06,370
- I did it!
- It's one to one?

1748
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:07,370
I squeezed it out.

1749
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:09,390
- That really helped though.
- I should've hit you harder.

1750
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:11,320
- You did shed a tear though.
- It's a tie!

1751
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,910
- This is great.
- Here's the second game.

1752
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,260
Please pick jegichagi.

1753
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:18,220
All right. He should pick jegichagi.

1754
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,030
- It's jegichagi.
- Yes!

1755
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,030
(The games Se Chan suggests)

1756
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,970
(They picked the game Se Chan
suggested, jegichagi.)

1757
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:24,030
All right!

1758
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,030
We got this.

1759
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:26,030
I'll win this for sure.

1760
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,870
- All right!
- We should play it.

1761
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,740
- Can they play too?
- We'll make up for it.

1762
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:31,740
- They could make up for it.
- I'll make up for it.

1763
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:32,740
- It's jegichagi.
- We can play against them.

1764
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,110
Is there a specific rule
for jegichagi?

1765
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,070
We'll just count
the number of kicks.

1766
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:37,280
Let's just keep it simple.

1767
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,550
Do you want to add up
the number of kicks?

1768
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:39,740
- Let's do that.
- Let's add up the scores.

1769
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:40,840
We'll add up the scores.

1770
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,390
- Let's add up the scores.
- They have more members anyway.

1771
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,840
Okay, let's add up the scores.

1772
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,120
But you can't catch it.

1773
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,720
- Okay. No catching.
- No catching.

1774
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,860
Okay, that'll be better for us.

1775
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,660
- That'll be better.
- They're at an advantage.

1776
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,660
There you go. Good job.

1777
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,860
- Hey!
- Hey.

1778
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:54,320
- No!
- How come she's so good?

1779
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,870
- So Min...
- If this is how it'll be...

1780
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:57,660
- Good job. That was great.
- You're pretty good.

1781
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:58,700
It must be because
I did it yesterday.

1782
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,700
You're pretty good.

1783
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,840
You never know. You might lose
if you make a mistake.

1784
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,370
- No catching.
- No catching.

1785
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:07,840
- No catching.
- I'm so nervous, So Min.

1786
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,570
- All right.
- No catching.

1787
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:11,140
- My shoes...
- Ji Hyo.

1788
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,180
I'm playing first?

1789
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:13,840
- Let's do this.
- You can just kick it once.

1790
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,950
- This is really nerve-racking.
- All right.

1791
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:16,180
This is the chance
you can make up for your last game.

1792
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,220
- One will be enough.
- All right!

1793
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,450
- It's simple.
- Just kick it twice.

1794
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:19,660
- I'll kick twice.
- Just kick it twice.

1795
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,050
- You can kick it once, right?
- Kick it three times.

1796
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:23,820
No catching.

1797
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:25,490
One.

1798
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,320
One.

1799
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,430
- That's two!
- Two!

1800
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:29,970
So Min. It's their turn.

1801
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,160
- You'll take turns?
- Let's take turns.

1802
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,160
All right.

1803
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:33,990
So Min, kick it just once.

1804
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:35,870
No catching, all right?

1805
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,240
You should be nervous.

1806
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,700
If you catch it,
you'll get no points.

1807
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,700
So Min, kick it
like how you did earlier.

1808
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,280
Why was I good at it earlier?

1809
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,640
- One.
- Why was I good at it earlier?

1810
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:46,950
One, two.

1811
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,780
- That's just one.
- That's one.

1812
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:49,950
One, two.

1813
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:51,360
(She's back to her old skills
as soon as the game starts.)

1814
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,660
- She only hit the feather.
- That's just one.

1815
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,360
- I think she hit it.
- That's two.

1816
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:55,760
- All right.
- Give it to me.

1817
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,220
- You should go next.
- I should change my shoes.

1818
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,050
- What's your size?
- No changing shoes!

1819
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:01,260
- Why not?
- No changing shoes.

1820
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,930
- No changing shoes.
- You should play with your shoes.

1821
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:04,470
- You should play with your shoes.
- But it hurts.

1822
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,070
That's none of my business.

1823
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,800
- That's your business.
- You can't change your shoes.

1824
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,340
- That's your business.
- But your shoes will work well.

1825
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,370
- No, they won't.
- No changing shoes.

1826
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:14,430
(Haha gives it a try first.)

1827
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:15,610
Suk Jin, I think...

1828
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,070
- your pants are the problem.
- Two,

1829
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:18,550
- three, four...
- Keep going.

1830
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:21,840
That's great! Five, six...

1831
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,320
- Seven... Gosh.
- That's six.

1832
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:25,280
- Good job.
- Darn it.

1833
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:30,090
- Why am I so bad at it?
- No tucking in.

1834
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,660
- Why can't this be allowed?
- No tucking in.

1835
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,450
- No tucking in.
- You should play as is.

1836
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,590
- Of course.
- You should play as is.

1837
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:35,820
You should play with what you got.

1838
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,320
I'll accept any objections.

1839
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:42,200
Why are you being so unreasonable?
We suggested this game.

1840
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,700
- You should play as is.
- You're supposed to...

1841
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,110
- hold your pants as you play.
- You can do it.

1842
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,840
- All right.
- All eyes are on you.

1843
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,950
- Everyone, be quiet!
- Go ahead and try it.

1844
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:49,740
Jae Suk is doing the jegichagi.
Everyone, keep quiet.

1845
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,950
- He'll kick it only three times.
- Here comes the king of jegichagi.

1846
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:53,320
- The emperor of jegichagi.
- All right.

1847
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,450
The king of jegichagi,

1848
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:56,340
- the almighty of jegichagi.
- Everyone, be quiet!

1849
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:57,820
- Everyone, be quiet!
- All right!

1850
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,320
Yoo Jae Suk.

1851
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,160
- This is nerve-racking.
- You can do it!

1852
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,490
- Watch him.
- The almighty of jegichagi!

1853
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:04,930
- Cameramen, focus!
- Here we go.

1854
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:06,090
- All right.
- Everyone, focus!

1855
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:08,590
(Will he be able to overcome
his nervousness?)

1856
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:10,570
Everyone in the country is watching.

1857
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:12,930
- Two, three, four...
- Two, three, four,

1858
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:15,740
- five. That's four.
- Four, five.

1859
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:16,840
(The end)

1860
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,030
That's four.

1861
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:19,180
He kicked it only four times.

1862
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,410
I knew it.

1863
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:22,370
We only needed to pressure him.

1864
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:23,840
- We need to pressure him.
- All right.

1865
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,370
- You should do well for our team.
- What's the current score?

1866
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:26,640
- You should do well.
- What's the current score?

1867
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,910
What's your current number?

1868
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:29,010
- Kick it 5 times.
- It's 8 to 6.

1869
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:30,840
- Kick it 6 times.
- Is it 8 to 6?

1870
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,120
I might not need to play this round.

1871
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,280
This is getting interesting.

1872
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,280
- My goodness.
- Let's go.

1873
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,120
- There are people behind you.
- He needs to do well.

1874
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,530
Would you move further back?

1875
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:38,800
- Don't stand so close to me.
- You should start...

1876
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:39,950
- as we are.
- All right.

1877
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,970
Suk Jin,
you should take off your pants.

1878
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:43,260
(He moves to the side
to avoid the mischievous members.)

1879
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:44,300
No way.

1880
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:47,490
Two, three,

1881
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:49,110
- four...
- He is done.

1882
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:50,260
Move out of the way.

1883
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:51,340
Hey.

1884
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:53,510
Move out of the way.

1885
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:54,780
Hey.

1886
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,410
What? I didn't move from my spot.

1887
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:57,570
- Come on.
- He ruined it.

1888
01:01:57,570 --> 01:01:58,840
That shouldn't count.

1889
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,070
- He stayed still.
- It's true. I didn't do anything.

1890
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:02,990
- Still...
- I didn't do anything.

1891
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:04,550
- Is my total 4?
- Your total is 4.

1892
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:06,450
So the current score is 12 to 6.

1893
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:08,120
Should we go next?
Should they go next?

1894
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,590
- You should go next.
- You should go next.

1895
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:11,090
- Okay.
- You are up.

1896
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,390
You are the last player.

1897
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:14,120
- Kick it 20 times.
- Don't be nervous.

1898
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:15,620
Come on, Se Chan.

1899
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:17,260
- Your team is leading by 6.
- Did you say 6?

1900
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:18,300
(Team Se Chan is leading by 6.)

1901
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:21,070
Don't be nervous.

1902
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,370
Your face turned red.

1903
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:23,530
- This is fascinating,
- Why are you nervous?

1904
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:24,780
- Don't be nervous.
- You just become nervous.

1905
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:25,970
- Go.
- That's right.

1906
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,280
One, two,

1907
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,780
- three, four,
- My goodness.

1908
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,140
- five,
- My goodness.

1909
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:31,910
six... That's good. Seven...

1910
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:32,950
Come on.

1911
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:34,740
Hey!

1912
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,240
(Landing a kick)

1913
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,990
What's your problem?

1914
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:40,360
- Hey!
- What was that?

1915
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,360
How could you kick me there?

1916
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,820
- What was that?
- How could you kick me there?

1917
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:44,030
I could kick it two more times.

1918
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,660
You practically stepped on it.

1919
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,990
Why did you stand there?

1920
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:48,200
Are you insane?

1921
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,470
For goodness' sake.

1922
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:50,990
Kick it 14 times for a tie.

1923
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:52,890
Do I need to kick it 14 times?

1924
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:55,260
- Kick it 15 times to win.
- Don't grab it.

1925
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,300
Let's go.

1926
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:57,840
Aren't you standing too closely?

1927
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,910
What?

1928
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:01,110
- Hey.
- Why are you standing too closely?

1929
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,640
Jong Kook will punch
as he kicks the jegi.

1930
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,200
- How many times? 14 times?
- That's right.

1931
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:06,240
- Are you going to stay here?
- Yes.

1932
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,410
Hold on.

1933
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:08,990
(Uppercut)

1934
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:11,220
(Flinching)

1935
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:12,990
Are you going to be okay?

1936
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:13,990
(Martial arts jegi)

1937
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,590
- Do you kick the jegi like this?
- Yes.

1938
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:16,620
Didn't you know?

1939
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:17,820
- I kick the jegi like this.
- Be careful.

1940
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,950
- Are you going to be okay?
- He will break your jaw.

1941
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:21,430
- He will break your jaw.
- Are you going to be okay?

1942
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:22,700
He will break your jaw.

1943
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:23,930
- I kick the jegi like this.
- He will break your jaw.

1944
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:25,070
- Really?
- Yes.

1945
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,590
- So you will punch people.
- Yes.

1946
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:28,370
- To kick it 14 times...
- My style changed.

1947
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:29,760
You will get punched.

1948
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,700
- He will break your jaw.
- Okay. I will stay here.

1949
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:33,700
- Old man, be careful.
- Okay.

1950
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,840
He will break my jaw.

1951
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,680
If you come near,
your jaw will take a blow.

1952
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,070
I don't want to get dental implants.

1953
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,510
- I need to kick it 14 times, right?
- Then it will be a tie.

1954
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:41,950
- Okay. I can kick it 14 times.
- Let's go.

1955
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:43,240
- Yesterday,
- Let's go.

1956
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,590
I kicked it 25 times.

1957
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:45,720
- Hey.
- That's the usual count.

1958
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,260
- It's easy to kick it 14 times.
- That's right.

1959
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,620
- Go.
- I bet he will kick it ten times.

1960
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,780
- I will lose if I kick it 13 times.
- Yes.

1961
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:52,450
- This is...
- Go.

1962
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:53,720
This is...

1963
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,370
One, two,

1964
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:57,120
- three, four...
- That's good.

1965
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,030
- Five, six,
- That's good.

1966
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:00,640
seven, eight,

1967
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,010
- nine, ten,
- Hold on.

1968
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,180
eleven...

1969
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,010
- Ten, eleven...
- Hold on.

1970
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,780
(Flying)

1971
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:11,240
Eleven...

1972
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,720
(I just needed to kick it
4 more times to win.)

1973
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:16,820
Thank goodness.

1974
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,180
- Gosh.
- He got close.

1975
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:19,660
Jong Kook is scary.

1976
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,320
- It was because of the chair.
- It was because of the chair.

1977
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,550
- I should have moved the chair.
- It was because of the chair.

1978
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:27,120
- Jong Kook did it diligently.
- You did so well.

1979
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:28,370
Team Se Chan won.

1980
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:29,620
Okay.

1981
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:32,390
- Yes!
- They are no match to us.

1982
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:33,490
The score is 2 to 1.

1983
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:35,370
I used to be good at jegichagi.

1984
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:37,010
Here comes the third game.

1985
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:38,200
I guess it requires
athletic abilities.

1986
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,110
- A quiz on stocks.
- Okay.

1987
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:45,450
(It's the game Se Chan suggested,
a quiz on stocks.)

1988
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:46,510
Okay.

1989
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:48,620
- It will be related to stocks.
- A quiz on stocks?

1990
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,120
- I will answer.
- All right.

1991
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,280
I don't know anything about stocks.
I don't invest in stocks.

1992
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,590
That's why we suggested this game.

1993
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,780
Unbelievable.

1994
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:58,550
- You don't play fair.
- A quiz on stocks.

1995
01:04:58,550 --> 01:04:59,620
That's why we suggested this game.

1996
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:00,890
I am so flustered.

1997
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:03,990
Being a chicken breast enthusiast,

1998
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:05,890
Jong Kook started
a chicken breast business.

1999
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:08,840
- Se Chan decided to invest in it.
- Okay.

2000
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,410
To his favorite member, Se Chan,

2001
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:13,740
- Jong Kook gave a stock option.
- A stock option.

2002
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,240
How do you spell "Stock option?"

2003
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:17,300
Stock.

2004
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:19,870
(How do you spell "Stock option?")

2005
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,550
This is an English question.

2006
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,410
- This isn't about stocks.
- I think I know.

2007
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,090
- Hey.
- Don't give them the answer.

2008
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:27,490
- Don't give them the answer.
- Okay.

2009
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:30,180
- Hey.
- Read the question.

2010
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,220
- Read the question.
- It isn't "Stop."

2011
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:35,030
- It isn't "Stop."
- She thinks it's "Stop option."

2012
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:36,620
I wrote down "Stop." Hold on.

2013
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:37,720
- All right.
- "Stock option?"

2014
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,800
- Just write.
- Write.

2015
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,160
The person whose answer is closer...

2016
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,240
- will win this round.
- Write.

2017
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,410
- Reveal your answer.
- Hold on.

2018
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:45,910
- Reveal your answer.
- "Option?" Hold on.

2019
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:48,240
- Reveal your answer.
- Hold on.

2020
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,550
Hold on. It takes time for me. S...

2021
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:51,870
- "Option."
- "Option."

2022
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:52,950
- O.
- "Option."

2023
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:54,120
- Five,
- "Option."

2024
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,680
- four, three,
- "Option."

2025
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,950
- two...
- "Option."

2026
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:58,490
(Glancing over)

2027
01:05:58,490 --> 01:05:59,620
For goodnesss' sake.

2028
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,360
I can't believe these jerks.

2029
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,780
- I am done.
- This is too much.

2030
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,590
(They will have a fierce match
of wrong answers.)

2031
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,390
You are out
if you don't reveal your answer.

2032
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:12,090
Hold it up.

2033
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:16,840
("Stook Oktion" and "Stock opsuen")

2034
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,200
(Team Se Chan: Stook Oktion
Team So Min: Stock opsuen)

2035
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,340
You jerk!

2036
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:23,050
You are so cruel.

2037
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:24,740
Hey.

2038
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,370
"Stook oktion."

2039
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:28,120
Show us the answer.

2040
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,640
(The answer is "Stock option.")

2041
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,820
Hold on. Show us the answer.

2042
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,780
- She got "Stock" right.
- She got "Stock" right.

2043
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:34,950
She got "Stock" right, but...

2044
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:36,530
- "Opsuen."
- "Opsuen."

2045
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,320
- S, U, and E are wrong.
- Her answer is much closer.

2046
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,490
O, P, S, U, E, and N.

2047
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,530
- So his answer is missing C.
- "Stook."

2048
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:43,660
"Stook."

2049
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,590
What?

2050
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:47,930
- No way.
- "Stook."

2051
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:50,240
Se Chan's answer
only has two wrong letters.

2052
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,640
So Min's answer
has three wrong letters.

2053
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,740
(Did Se Chan get
one more letter right?)

2054
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,340
(Se Chan won.)

2055
01:06:58,410 --> 01:06:59,820
We won the English quiz.

2056
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:01,120
We won the English quiz.

2057
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:03,050
What?

2058
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:04,680
- Is it right?
- It's true.

2059
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:05,950
"It's true."

2060
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,280
"Stook oktion."

2061
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,390
- He got I, O, and N.
- I, O, and N.

2062
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:10,820
- He got I, O, and N.
- She destroyed the last part.

2063
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:13,030
- "Opsuen."
- She destroyed the last part.

2064
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:14,820
- She destroyed the last part.
- He got I, O, and N.

2065
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:16,030
So Min.

2066
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,700
- I mean...
- So Min and I said...

2067
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,030
- we should never do a quiz.
- It's not like that.

2068
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:21,030
- This makes no sense.
- It's not like that.

2069
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,110
I needed to savor the pronunciation,

2070
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:24,510
- but I didn't have time.
- Listen.

2071
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:26,030
- This answer makes no sense.
- I can't believe So Min.

2072
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:28,840
- This answer makes no sense.
- So Min, I am sorry.

2073
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,010
You got "Stock" right.

2074
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:31,340
- T, I, O, N.
- How did you lose...

2075
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,950
to "Stook oktion?"

2076
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:35,280
We won the English quiz.

2077
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,010
How are you so athletic...

2078
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:40,220
- and smart?
- You are making me blush.

2079
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:41,590
- We are done, right?
- Yes.

2080
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,930
Team Se Chan won 1 more point,
so the score is 3 to 1.

2081
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:45,800
You should participate in this quiz.

2082
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,300
- I can do it.
- You know a lot about stocks.

2083
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,220
- I will go next.
- Go.

2084
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,090
Okay. I got this.

2085
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,530
- I know a lot about stocks.
- The king of stocks.

2086
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:54,930
I am so stressed out.

2087
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:57,010
- Quiz us on economic terms.
- So Min.

2088
01:07:57,010 --> 01:07:59,340
I have invested in stocks
for over 20 years.

2089
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:01,740
Suk Jin has invested in stocks
for many years.

2090
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,070
That's right.

2091
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,200
- All right.
- T, I, O, N.

2092
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,220
- Okay.
- Okay.

2093
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,640
In the stock market,

2094
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,990
what is the measure of halting
future and option sales...

2095
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:13,360
for five minutes...

2096
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,450
when futures prices soar
for more than one minute?

2097
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:17,260
- I wrote it down.
- Suk Jin doesn't know.

2098
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:19,160
- I wrote it down.
- Suk Jin doesn't know.

2099
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,260
Can you repeat the question?

2100
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:21,320
I know this.

2101
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,620
- Write it down.
- Don't you know the answer?

2102
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,620
- Don't you know the answer?
- Check their answers.

2103
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:25,700
He is writing something down.

2104
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,930
- For goodness' sake.
- You have 5 seconds. 5...

2105
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:30,530
I should remember this.

2106
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:32,280
This is bad.

2107
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:33,510
Reveal your answer.

2108
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:34,610
(Sidecar)

2109
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,870
That's right. It's a sidecar.

2110
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:37,110
He wrote "Brief pause."

2111
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:39,510
- Come on.
- I...

2112
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:42,280
- Why did you write "Brief pause?"
- I couldn't remember.

2113
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,620
Isn't it "Volatility interruption?"

2114
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,890
What's
"Volatility interruption" then?

2115
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,860
- It's "Volatility interruption!"
- What?

2116
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:48,790
- It's "Volatility interruption."
- "Volatility interruption."

2117
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,920
- It's "Sidecar."
- What's "Volatility interruption?"

2118
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:53,330
- "Volatility interruption."
- It's "Volatility interruption."

2119
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,570
- It prevents abrupt price changes.
- "Volatility interruption."

2120
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:56,790
I don't know what that is.

2121
01:08:56,790 --> 01:08:58,090
(I don't know what that is.)

2122
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:00,090
- Hey.
- What's up with you these days?

2123
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:01,390
Why are you doing this to us?

2124
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:03,210
- Hey.
- What's up with you these days?

2125
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:04,540
Is it "Sidecar"
or "Volatility interruption?"

2126
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:06,170
It's "Sidecar."

2127
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:08,110
I said we shouldn't have
another round.

2128
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:09,380
(The current score is 3 to 2.)

2129
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,640
- Thank goodness.
- It was fun.

2130
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,840
The last game is keeping composure.

2131
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,640
What kind of a game is it?

2132
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,510
- Composure? We don't know.
- It's So Min's suggestion.

2133
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:18,420
- Is it like the Absolutely Game?
- Absolutely Game.

2134
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,510
You can't get mad.

2135
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,620
You can't get worked up or mad.

2136
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,660
- Okay.
- So it's about composure.

2137
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:26,220
And you should remember
that this is...

2138
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:27,660
- It's fake.
- Yes.

2139
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:29,070
- It isn't real.
- No.

2140
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:30,830
- Absolutely.
- Don't ruin the atmosphere.

2141
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:32,240
- Promise that.
- Okay.

2142
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:34,830
Promise that you won't cry...

2143
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:35,870
or stop the shoot.

2144
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:38,170
You lose if you show
a strange reaction.

2145
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,470
Will you be okay?
So Min, promise me this.

2146
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:42,910
If you run out tearfully
and ruin the atmosphere,

2147
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:44,950
- it will be a bit...
- Let me tell you this.

2148
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,080
I will cry.

2149
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,640
This is about keeping composure.

2150
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:50,290
This is a warning.

2151
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:52,580
I will run out tearfully.

2152
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:54,750
- What?
- What kind of a game is this?

2153
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:57,050
You are the one
who suggested the game.

2154
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:58,860
Remember that, okay?

2155
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:00,090
Don't be like that.

2156
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:01,500
- Let's go.
- All right.

2157
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,530
This is the final.

2158
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:04,170
- Let's begin.
- Destroy her.

2159
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:05,700
How do you lose?

2160
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,790
You lose if you lose your composure.

2161
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:08,170
- We will judge by your reaction.
- You lose if you get mad.

2162
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,000
I will be the judge.

2163
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Se Chan, please begin.

2164
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,110
- Okay.
- All right.

2165
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:14,710
You know...

2166
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,410
that you resemble
Han Min Kwan, right?

2167
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:18,170
- Absolutely. I know.
- Absolutely.

2168
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:20,710
You know...

2169
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:22,820
that you resemble Han Moo, right?

2170
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:24,180
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

2171
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,790
They are starting off light.

2172
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:27,550
You know...

2173
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,220
that you are ugly, right?

2174
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:30,830
Absolutely.

2175
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,030
You know...

2176
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:34,220
that you are darn ugly, right?

2177
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,330
(You know
that you are darn ugly, right?)

2178
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,040
- So Min.
- Absolutely.

2179
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:41,910
- So Min.
- How far can we take this?

2180
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,610
- That was too much.
- She swore.

2181
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:44,670
Seriously.

2182
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:45,800
- Hold on.
- She lost her composure.

2183
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,240
I am giving you a warning.

2184
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,970
You lost your composure.

2185
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:50,110
- Me?
- Yes.

2186
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:51,500
- This is ridiculous.
- You lost your composure.

2187
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,920
- This is ridiculous.
- Don't do that.

2188
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,320
If she does it again, she will lose.

2189
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,640
- So she just received a warning.
- Yes.

2190
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:58,080
- She totally lost her composure.
- I am really calm.

2191
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,580
No, you lost your composure.

2192
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:01,420
- You shouldn't swear.
- You shouldn't swear.

2193
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:02,580
You lost your composure.

2194
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:05,550
Isn't she well-known
for losing composure very easily?

2195
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:06,860
Why did she suggest this game?

2196
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,420
- She swore after three turns.
- Hold on.

2197
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:10,220
- Why did she suggest this game?
- Seriously.

2198
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:12,630
- It's my turn.
- She is brazen.

2199
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,330
You...

2200
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,260
are still seeing that man, right?

2201
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,330
My goodness.

2202
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:21,780
Who?

2203
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,540
Why did you ask that?

2204
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:26,320
(Who?)

2205
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,380
- What kind of a game is this?
- You lost.

2206
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:29,790
- No.
- You lost.

2207
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:31,710
- You lost.
- You lost.

2208
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:33,710
- You lost your composure.
- You can't ask a question.

2209
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:35,990
- I am sorry.
- You lost.

2210
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:38,050
"Yes" should be your only answer.

2211
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:40,720
Why did you suggest this game?

2212
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,720
Why did you suggest it?

2213
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,000
- Were you testing your composure?
- What was that?

2214
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,590
- You are number eight.
- She received her second warning.

2215
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:47,170
If she messes up again,
she will lose.

2216
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:49,110
- How many warnings are there?
- Two.

2217
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:50,570
- All right. Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

2218
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:52,000
Don't ask a question.

2219
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:54,800
Is my junior from university
doing well?

2220
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,880
What?

2221
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:59,040
(He flinches a bit.)

2222
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,120
Absolutely.

2223
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,840
- What?
- "My junior from university?"

2224
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:02,950
Did you meet up with her?

2225
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:05,710
A film and theater major
at Dongduk Women's University.

2226
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:10,490
Are you still keeping in touch
with the man...

2227
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:12,720
who can sing well?

2228
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:14,500
Absolutely.

2229
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,670
- He got himself a new girlfriend.
- I see.

2230
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:19,890
No small talk.

2231
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,070
- Didn't she lose already?
- No small talk.

2232
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,330
- You have a warning.
- I am sorry.

2233
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:24,670
She lost already.

2234
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:26,430
She lost her composure.

2235
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,500
You will marry me, right?

2236
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:32,250
Absolutely.

2237
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,780
You can't attack him at all.

2238
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:35,950
You know...

2239
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,120
that...

2240
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,630
(Se Chan mentioned
her ex-boyfriend's occupation.)

2241
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:44,660
You know that
he is in touch with me, right?

2242
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:46,090
Absolutely.

2243
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:47,090
(Absolutely.)

2244
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:48,720
Hold on. Are you okay?

2245
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,920
Jae Suk, she is crying.

2246
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,000
- That was the worst.
- She is crying.

2247
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:54,590
- Come on.
- I am not crying.

2248
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:56,630
- This is a game.
- So Min's facial expression...

2249
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:57,740
- She is upset.
- She is crying.

2250
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,280
- It's...
- It's obvious, right?

2251
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:01,630
She suddenly lost her composure.

2252
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:03,750
You...

2253
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,210
were serious when you badmouthed
Jong Kook, right?

2254
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:09,540
- What?
- Absolutely.

2255
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,680
- What did he do?
- He badmouthed Jong Kook.

2256
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,050
(Her attack wasn't very effective.)

2257
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:16,130
When you had a kissing scene
in "Show Window: The Queen's House,"

2258
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:17,160
(The drama So Min is in)

2259
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,200
you thought of him, right?

2260
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,170
Absolutely.

2261
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:23,170
- Stop.
- Absolutely.

2262
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:24,590
- Absolutely.
- Are you okay?

2263
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:26,130
- You didn't answer right away.
- Jae Suk, just admit it.

2264
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:27,430
- Se Chan won.
- Jae Suk, just admit it.

2265
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:28,740
- Se Chan won.
- Okay.

2266
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:29,800
(Se Chan won.)

2267
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,410
- All right.
- Hey.

2268
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:34,040
- Why did she suggest this game?
- Seriously.

2269
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,910
She has the least amount
of composure.

2270
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:39,580
Why did you suggest the game?

2271
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,250
Since she suggested it, I thought...

2272
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,710
- I thought she knew a secret.
- Seriously.

2273
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,180
I also thought she knew a secret.

2274
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:45,620
I thought that too.

2275
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,790
- You lost composure first.
- It's only a game.

2276
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:48,990
- Don't misunderstand.
- That's right.

2277
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:51,680
Thus, Team Se Chan won
with the score of 4 to 2.

2278
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:53,200
I didn't even suggest this game.

2279
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,630
- Why did you suggest this game?
- Seriously.

2280
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:57,720
The back of her neck
is hot right now.

2281
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:01,040
(The back of her neck
became a sauna.)

2282
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:04,130
- Composure.
- Why did you pick that game?

2283
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:05,130
(Team Se Chan gets a ballot each.)

2284
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:06,410
- Okay.
- For goodness' sake.

2285
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:08,950
We will have the last mission
right away.

2286
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:10,780
- Gosh.
- That was so funny.

2287
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,780
The last mission is very simple.

2288
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:15,420
Between Se Chan's room
and So Min's room,

2289
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:17,580
the room with more people will win.

2290
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:21,460
Everyone in that room
will receive a ballot each.

2291
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:23,990
So guess which room
will have more people.

2292
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:25,180
- Okay. That's good.
- Okay.

2293
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:26,290
Let's go.

2294
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:28,050
- I will go last.
- Me too.

2295
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:29,530
(Which team will get more teammates
and win the mission?)

2296
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:31,460
I have four ballots.
I collected a lot.

2297
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:36,240
Jae Suk and Jong Kook are the ones
with a lot of So Min coins.

2298
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,540
How many coins does Ji Hyo have?

2299
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:40,970
(Despite being So Min's X-Man,)

2300
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:42,580
All right.

2301
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:45,420
(Ji Hyo didn't receive
So Min coins.)

2302
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:49,880
(It's important to secure
as many coins as possible.)

2303
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,140
How many more do you need?

2304
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:52,790
How many more do you need?

2305
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:55,320
Compared to Jae Suk,
I have half the number of coins.

2306
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:57,160
I will give you ten more coins.

2307
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,580
(I will give you 10 more coins
if you come here.)

2308
01:14:58,580 --> 01:14:59,660
I will give you ten more coins.

2309
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:03,170
(So Min suggests 10 So Min coins.)

2310
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:05,830
All right.

2311
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:07,200
All right.

2312
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,500
(Ji Hyo chooses Team So Min.)

2313
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,670
Nice.

2314
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,300
Here.

2315
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,330
(So Min recruited Ji Hyo
with the promise of 10 coins.)

2316
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:14,470
I will give you five.

2317
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:17,300
I will give you five.

2318
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,380
Hey.

2319
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:21,820
(So Min doesn't have
a lot of coins left.)

2320
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:23,080
Where should I go?

2321
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,490
(Now comes Jae Suk,
the man with many So Min coins.)

2322
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:30,220
(Jae Suk has done all the missions
as a member of Team So Min.)

2323
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:35,220
(Which team will the man
with many So Min coins choose?)

2324
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:42,500
(Why did he enter Se Chan's room?)

2325
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:46,800
So Min needs to do some hard works.

2326
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:49,640
Is So Min filming right now?

2327
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,640
(So Min didn't show up.)

2328
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,580
- I won't pick you.
- Don't pick me.

2329
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:54,620
- I will stay with Se Chan.
- Ten coins for you.

2330
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:56,040
Ten coins for you.

2331
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,120
I gave you the coins.

2332
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,490
She is doing something.

2333
01:15:58,490 --> 01:15:59,710
(Se Chan and Jae Suk
figured it out.)

2334
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:02,550
- She is doing something.
- She is trying to recruit them.

2335
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:06,090
(Se Chan opened the pouch as well.)

2336
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:07,130
Will you give me coins?

2337
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:08,130
Jae Suk.

2338
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:11,570
I will give you a lot of coins.

2339
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:12,740
(Thus, Jae Suk received
a lot of Se Chan coins.)

2340
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:13,960
I am in your care.

2341
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:15,290
How many do you have right now?

2342
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:18,170
- I am not sure.
- Count the coins.

2343
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:21,800
If Jong Kook and Haha come here,

2344
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:23,340
- we are set.
- Okay.

2345
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,080
(Next comes Haha,
the member So Min won over.)

2346
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,880
Haha, I will give you ten coins.

2347
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:27,950
- Really?
- Yes.

2348
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:29,880
Okay.

2349
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:31,490
All right.

2350
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:33,180
I am sorry, So Min.

2351
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:34,990
We are set.

2352
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,990
If Suk Jin comes, we are set.

2353
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:38,160
Did he go to that room?

2354
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:39,960
We need Jong Kook.

2355
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,030
He went to that room.

2356
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:42,920
That won't do. We need Suk Jin.

2357
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,000
But Suk Jin...

2358
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:45,890
We need to win Suk Jin over.

2359
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:51,830
Which room has more people?
I need to choose well.

2360
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:54,080
Does that room have a lot of people?
How many people are there?

2361
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:57,750
Both rooms got two members,
but we have a better chance.

2362
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:58,780
Why?

2363
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,280
Suk Jin, I will give you ten coins.

2364
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:02,640
How many coins did she offer?

2365
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:04,580
- She offered 15 coins.
- What?

2366
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:07,510
- She offered 15 coins.
- I will give you 16 coins.

2367
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:09,630
Suk Jin, I will give you 17 coins.

2368
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:10,880
Did you say 17 coins?

2369
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,330
(They begin to have a game of wits.)

2370
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:15,700
I will give you 20 coins.

2371
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:17,370
Come on.

2372
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,430
Really? Give me 20 coins.

2373
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:21,090
- I have 20 coins.
- Let me see.

2374
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:22,910
Will I have an advantage
if I enter this room?

2375
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:24,830
Counting 2, 4, 6, 8... 20.

2376
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:26,670
- How many coins do you have?
- I have 11 coins.

2377
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:28,430
Then you will have 31 Se Chan coins.

2378
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:29,640
Will I be in the top two?

2379
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:33,920
Jae Suk and Jong Kook
only have 25 coins each.

2380
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,340
Do they only have 25 coins each?

2381
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:39,660
(Se Chan guarantees
that he will be in the top two.)

2382
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:40,920
- Really?
- Yes.

2383
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:45,700
(The outcome depends
on Suk Jin's choice.)

2384
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,390
I'm in.

2385
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:51,830
Suk Jin, I will give you 20 coins.

2386
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:54,460
I received the coins.

2387
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,830
You received many coins.

2388
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:57,210
- What?
- You received many coins.

2389
01:17:58,260 --> 01:17:59,670
But Ji Hyo has...

2390
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:01,970
- many ballots.
- You won.

2391
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:03,250
- Yes!
- Okay.

2392
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,880
- Now, the coins are important.
- All right.

2393
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,140
I gave people a lot of coins.

2394
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:09,490
Once they receive more ballots,

2395
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,290
we will have
a fewer number of ballots.

2396
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,510
I have many ballots.

2397
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:14,580
Do you have many ballots?

2398
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:19,030
(Who will be decided
as the last in the hierarchy?)

2399
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:20,720
We need to write it down, right?
Let's vote.

2400
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:22,720
On the ballot,

2401
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:25,420
write down the name of the person
who will be the youngest.

2402
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:29,260
The person who doesn't get picked
as the youngest will be the winner.

2403
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:30,710
Two people with the most number
of winner's coins...

2404
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:32,740
- will be exempt from the penalty.
- Okay.

2405
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:34,080
The person who gets picked
as the youngest...

2406
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,950
will choose 1 of the 3 members...

2407
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:38,040
who aren't exempt
from the penalty...

2408
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,780
to carry out the penalty together.

2409
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:42,540
If So Min doesn't get picked
as the youngest,

2410
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:44,950
both of them will be exempt
since there are only two members.

2411
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:46,680
It's not about the team.
Two people with the most number...

2412
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,210
of winner's coins will be exempt.

2413
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:50,960
I see. So it's about everyone.

2414
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:53,420
I see.

2415
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,630
It isn't about the team.

2416
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:55,630
(He understood the rules
right before the ending.)

2417
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,260
Then I don't have much of a chance.

2418
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,830
- What?
- Who should be the youngest?

2419
01:18:58,830 --> 01:18:59,960
(Who should be the youngest?)

2420
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,430
You should have thought
about it earlier.

2421
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:03,300
- Seriously.
- You came to my room.

2422
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,430
Suk Jin.

2423
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:06,630
- Why didn't you think earlier?
- You should have done that.

2424
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:07,880
I did think, but...

2425
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,670
I voted.

2426
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,880
Me too. I am done.

2427
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:16,210
Gosh, this is hard.

2428
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:18,140
All the members voted.

2429
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:20,510
I told you that
the staff members will vote too.

2430
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:23,880
Producers, scriptwriters,
and cameramen will vote.

2431
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,160
- I will cherish each vote.
- That's right.

2432
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,590
So Min did well
in the beginning, but...

2433
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:32,090
- Absolutely Game.
- That ruined her.

2434
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:34,700
- That ruined me.
- Keeping composure...

2435
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,960
- completely ruined her.
- Yes.

2436
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,370
- Totally.
- Yes.

2437
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:41,710
- Staff members got many ballots.
- Seriously.

2438
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:44,280
There are about 40 ballots.
Please count them.

2439
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,340
Okay. I will count the ballots.

2440
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:50,290
(Candidate 1, Yang Se Chan
wants to escape menial tasks.)

2441
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:53,680
(Candidate 2, Jeon So Min
says she makes a good big sister.)

2442
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:55,660
So it's bad to get picked.

2443
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,330
- You lose if you get picked.
- You lose.

2444
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:58,630
All right.

2445
01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:00,050
Suk Jin voted for So Min.

2446
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,460
- Why would you say that?
- Okay. I will remember that.

2447
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,330
(Suk Jin got on So Min's bad side.)

2448
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:06,700
Ji Hyo, show the board.

2449
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,000
Jeon So Min.

2450
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,760
- Please mark.
- Hold it like this.

2451
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,610
- So Min.
- Hold it like this.

2452
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:14,830
- Jeon So Min.
- Two votes for Jeon So Min.

2453
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:16,540
- Two votes for Jeon So Min.
- I will do it.

2454
01:20:16,670 --> 01:20:17,880
Jeon So Min.

2455
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,880
No.

2456
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,470
- Three votes.
- Three votes.

2457
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:22,210
Jeon So Min. Four votes.

2458
01:20:22,210 --> 01:20:23,320
Four votes?

2459
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,140
Jeon So Min.

2460
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,580
I can't predict the result.

2461
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:29,180
Don't be absurd.
I am getting all the votes.

2462
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:30,830
Suk Jin voted for So Min.

2463
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:33,220
It's natural for one
to get many votes at once.

2464
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:36,090
The Jimmy Jib operator,
Yoon Hong Min voted for So Min.

2465
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Thank you.

2466
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,070
- People think it will be funnier.
- You are cuter.

2467
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:41,500
This is for Se Chan.

2468
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:43,610
"Se Chan should be made to work."

2469
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:46,500
"Good luck as the youngest."
Kang Seo Rim wrote that.

2470
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:48,580
- Seo Rim.
- Thanks.

2471
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:49,780
It's bad for you.

2472
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:51,300
Oh, it's bad for you. Hey!

2473
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:53,120
You know Min Hee,
the youngest scriptwriter.

2474
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,340
- Yes.
- She voted for you.

2475
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,380
This isn't a popularity vote,
Min Hee.

2476
01:20:57,710 --> 01:21:00,580
Seung Gyul of the audio team
voted for Se Chan.

2477
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:02,860
(Seung Gyul of the audio team,
Se Chan)

2478
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:04,360
Thank you.

2479
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,330
I said it's bad for you.

2480
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:07,860
Oh, it's bad for me.
Watch your back.

2481
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:09,700
Yang Se Chan.

2482
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:11,870
- So Min.
- Come on.

2483
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:12,890
Yang Se Chan.

2484
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:15,930
- Here it comes.
- Oh, no. Please.

2485
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:18,040
(The outcome is still unclear.)

2486
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Jeon So Min.

2487
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:22,330
My name keeps coming up.

2488
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:23,410
Jeon So Min.

2489
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:24,610
There are 40 votes.

2490
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:25,780
Jeon So Min.

2491
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,080
- My gosh.
- What?

2492
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,080
- Jeon So Min.
- What? Is it buffering?

2493
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,920
- Jeon So Min.
- It's like buffering.

2494
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,510
Jeon So Min.

2495
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:34,290
- Jeon So Min.
- All right.

2496
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,660
Jeon So Min.

2497
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:37,790
I'll collect the ballot papers...

2498
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:39,920
- to check the names.
- Hey.

2499
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,000
(The voters are afraid
of the tiger moth's revenge.)

2500
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,170
Hey.

2501
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:45,530
- Burn them.
- Tear them off.

2502
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:46,760
Burn them out.

2503
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:48,170
- Jeon So Min.
- Tear them off.

2504
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:49,430
- Yoo Jae Suk voted for So Min.
- Yoo Jae Suk.

2505
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:50,910
Yoo Jae Suk voted for So Min.

2506
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:52,610
(Jae Suk's ballot is revealed.)

2507
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:53,670
Jae Suk.

2508
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:54,830
Yoo Jae Suk voted for So Min.

2509
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,210
- That's a lot.
- Finally...

2510
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:59,380
Finally?

2511
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:00,780
We have three votes left.

2512
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:02,510
We don't know it yet.

2513
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:04,290
They might count as five per each.

2514
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:05,510
It might count as five.

2515
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:07,680
- Jeon So Min.
- The last one. Please.

2516
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,880
This is the last one.

2517
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:11,250
- This one will decide the result.
- Right.

2518
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:12,530
Jeon So Min.

2519
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:14,030
(Jeon So Min)

2520
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:16,260
- Okay.
- Thank you.

2521
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:17,370
So Min, don't lose your composure.

2522
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:19,070
Burn them down.

2523
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:20,390
Burn the votes.

2524
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:21,590
Don't lose your composure.

2525
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:23,500
- Keep your composure.
- All right then.

2526
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:24,610
You're the last in the hierarchy.

2527
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:26,430
- Let's say I'm older than you.
- We're not sure when it will end,

2528
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:28,410
but So Min is the last
in the hierarchy.

2529
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:30,140
- All right.
- I'm older than you.

2530
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:34,120
Since Se Chan is the winner,
what matters is...

2531
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,920
- how many Se Chan coins you have.
- He gave you a lot of coins.

2532
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,040
Count your coins.

2533
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,320
I didn't get anything today.

2534
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:44,460
- I have 22.
- Haha has 22 coins.

2535
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,530
(Haha has 22 Se Chan coins.)

2536
01:22:45,530 --> 01:22:47,720
- I have a lot of So Min coins.
- The yellow ones don't count.

2537
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,790
I know. These are 30.

2538
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:51,390
Gosh, how many coins do you have?

2539
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:52,630
Do you have 30 coins?

2540
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:54,370
- More than 30?
- More than 30?

2541
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:55,390
(Those who are likely
to be exempted from the penalty...)

2542
01:22:55,390 --> 01:23:00,610
("Shy Se Chan" Jae Suk moved
to Se Chan at the right time.)

2543
01:23:00,610 --> 01:23:03,500
(He got a lot
of Se Chan coins at once.)

2544
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:08,820
(A loyal supporter, Jong Kook)

2545
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:14,790
(He collected Se Chan coins
over time building up trust.)

2546
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:22,830
(Suk Jin was lucky
to be cast at the last minute.)

2547
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:26,540
(Who are the 2 members
with the most coins?)

2548
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:27,630
I have 37.

2549
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:30,070
My goodness. Jae Suk,
I thought you had 33.

2550
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:32,710
- I have 37.
- Jae Suk has 37 coins.

2551
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:33,800
What about you, Suk Jin?

2552
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,140
- I think I have 33.
- You have 33?

2553
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:37,470
I'll count them.

2554
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:39,110
- Does Suk Jin have 33 coins?
- Yes.

2555
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:41,040
- How could he have so many coins?
- Two, four...

2556
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,280
That doesn't make sense.

2557
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:43,880
Jae Suk is
currently in the first place.

2558
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,080
Okay.

2559
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:48,290
Darn it. It's not 33. I have 32.

2560
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,680
How many coins do you have?

2561
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:51,720
I have less than 30.

2562
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,250
- Yes!
- How many do you have?

2563
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:55,720
(Jae Suk and Suk Jin are currently
exempted from the penalty.)

2564
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,720
- Jong Kook.
- Darn it.

2565
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:57,720
How many do you have?

2566
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:58,890
I have 33.

2567
01:23:58,890 --> 01:24:00,130
(I have 33 coins.)

2568
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:01,700
- Really?
- All right.

2569
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,800
So Jae Suk and Jong Kook
are the survivors.

2570
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,500
(Suk Jin, Ji Hyo, and Haha
the candidates for the penalty.)

2571
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:08,780
- Hey, Se Chan.
- Hey.

2572
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:10,170
- I have one more coin.
- Hey.

2573
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:12,410
You were about to go to So Min.

2574
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:15,010
Come here, Se Chan.
You calculated the whole thing, right?

2575
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:17,710
- No, I didn't.
- You ungrateful punk.

2576
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:20,180
Now, So Min, among these three,

2577
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:23,630
you should pick one member
to get a penalty with you.

2578
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:26,420
- Let me tell you about the penalty.
- What is it?

2579
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:29,090
Today's penalty will be a big help
to our production crew.

2580
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:30,200
- What is it?
- What?

2581
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,290
I bet it's about cleaning.

2582
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:33,590
- I think so.
- Something bothersome.

2583
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:35,130
Today's penalty is...

2584
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,540
- When this episode is aired...
- What is it?

2585
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:39,040
I mean, the week before that,

2586
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,710
the preview will be aired.

2587
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:45,250
You will shoot a few scenes
that will be used...

2588
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:46,540
in the preview.

2589
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:48,010
(Shooting a few scenes
for the preview)

2590
01:24:48,010 --> 01:24:49,290
- For example,
- Like a thumbnail?

2591
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:51,540
a scene where you run hurriedly.

2592
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:53,420
- Where we're chased.
- Or you could look startled.

2593
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:54,920
- But...
- That's the worst.

2594
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,720
- That's a good idea.
- I like that.

2595
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,030
- It's not so bad.
- We will use them for a preview.

2596
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:00,030
All right.

2597
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:02,000
You need to pick a member
to act with.

2598
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:03,830
I'll get ready to go home.

2599
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:05,920
He's taking off
the microphone already.

2600
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:09,130
Suk Jin, who did you vote for?

2601
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:10,540
Be honest. Who did you vote for?

2602
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:11,760
(He lies that he voted for Se Chan.)

2603
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,300
I don't think so.
I think you voted for me.

2604
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:16,500
Right. I had three ballots.

2605
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,800
Seriously, we supported you, So Min.

2606
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:19,880
Haha and me.

2607
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,710
Let's just decide
by rock-paper-scissors.

2608
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:24,820
Our youngest member in 2022,
So Min, it's your call.

2609
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:26,620
(So Min is officially the youngest
member now. Who will she pick?)

2610
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:28,180
All right. Let's put on our masks.

2611
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:30,180
Oh, right. My mask. Thanks.

2612
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:31,830
Look at them. They're so annoying.

2613
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:34,130
- We supported you, So Min.
- We supported you.

2614
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:37,290
Our youngest member in 2022,
So Min, it's your call.

2615
01:25:37,290 --> 01:25:38,670
I supported you.

2616
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:40,420
Ji Hyo.

2617
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:42,200
(Ji Hyo)

2618
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,920
Song Ji Hyo is picked.

2619
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,370
Okay. Congratulations.

2620
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:50,600
(During the final voting)

2621
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:55,630
(Ji Hyo got caught
that she voted for So Min.)

2622
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,470
- Let's go.
- My gosh.

2623
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:02,170
- I survived. Let's go.
- Let's go home.

2624
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:04,040
See you.

2625
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,750
We have two actresses here.

2626
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:08,290
For the preview...

2627
01:26:08,290 --> 01:26:11,630
Ji Hyo voted for me.
She wrote my name.

2628
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:16,220
Hey. They all voted for you.
Everyone except you voted for you.

2629
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,370
I need to check the ballot papers.

2630
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:22,590
I think we are going to run.
I'm not good at running.

2631
01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:23,800
What do we do?

2632
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,410
All right. Cue.

2633
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:27,170
(That's how we got
the good chase scenes.)

2634
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:29,600
Move over!

2635
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,450
(She runs away in a hurry.)

2636
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:36,040
I'll leave. My goodness.

2637
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:40,550
No. My goodness.

2638
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:41,960
(She pretends to pass out.)

2639
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:45,290
I think that was really lame.

2640
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,890
(She even shows some sprint
which rarely happens.)

2641
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,290
Why are they trying to kill me?

2642
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:55,340
Who's trying to kill me?

2643
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:56,870
(She pretends that
someone is coming to kill her.)

2644
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:58,340
Don't kill me!

2645
01:26:59,410 --> 01:27:02,040
Jeon So Min? I can't believe this.

2646
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:03,950
Hey!

2647
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:07,710
This is embarrassing.

2648
01:27:07,710 --> 01:27:09,010
(This is embarrassing.)

2649
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:13,160
(She completes her mission
and wins a lot of R coins.)

2650
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:15,510
(Upclose)

2651
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:16,790
I'm so happy.

2652
01:27:18,850 --> 01:27:21,750
(She rips off a name tag
at a crucial moment.)

2653
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:24,070
Hey, you...

2654
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:27,070
(It's strange that she's
surprised by what she did.)

2655
01:27:27,070 --> 01:27:28,340
Cut. Okay.

2656
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:31,740
- Hey, what was that?
- That was nice.

2657
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:33,630
- Why are you surprised?
- I don't know.

2658
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:35,410
- I was just acting.
- I mean,

2659
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:37,250
you ripped it off
knowing that it was my name.

2660
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:39,280
You knew it was me.

2661
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,280
I just had to do something.

2662
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,140
I thought I had to do something.
