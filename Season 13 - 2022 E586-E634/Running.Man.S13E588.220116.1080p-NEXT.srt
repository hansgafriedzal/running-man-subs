1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,160
(To celebrate our first shoot
in the New Year,)

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,460
(please come in the trendiest
outfit you think tomorrow.)

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,730
Hello.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,340
When it comes to fashion,
you guys are no match for me.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,240
I think I look amazing today.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,840
You two should
stick together like that.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,410
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- What?

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,780
- Stick with him.
- My gosh.

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,750
So Min, the suede...

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,940
- In the suede jacket,
- Hello.

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,640
- you look like a CEO.
- My goodness.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,550
- Hello.
- Hello.

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,260
I think I look great today.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,760
- I...
- I look good too.

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,880
Hey.

16
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,860
- You...
- Hey.

17
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,760
- He's really...
- Hey, what's with you?

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,370
- Do you know what the problem is?
- I'd like to buy some honey.

19
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,160
The problem is that
you didn't get rid of the price tag.

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,540
- The price tag is on.
- Don't take it off.

21
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,130
If you take it off,
I'll have to buy it.

22
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,130
You're so feeble-minded.

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,230
What? You're the lady
from the movie, "Snowpiercer."

24
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,300
No.

25
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,440
- It's you, right? "Snowpiercer."
- That's right.

26
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,650
You're Jenny, right?

27
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,840
The important thing is that
I can pull off an outfit like this.

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,550
If you go around looking like this,
the movie will be popular again.

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,190
- No.
- It's "Snowpiercer."

30
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,450
You look just like her.

31
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,980
- What's your name?
- What's that dog?

32
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,080
- The tail of the train.
- This dog?

33
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,800
- Its name is Seok Sam.
- Seok Sam.

34
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,420
- Hey, Seok Sam.
- Seok Sam.

35
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,700
- Seok Sam.
- It's pretty.

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,700
- It's Seok Sam.
- It's really pretty.

37
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,940
There's one disappointing thing
about Suk Jin's outfit.

38
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,500
You should wear these pants
without jeans underneath them.

39
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Hey, you punk.

40
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,170
That's how
you're supposed to wear them.

41
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,530
This is disappointing.
You don't know fashion.

42
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,050
Did you just get a physical checkup?

43
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,050
What?

44
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,450
- He got a colonoscopy.
- A colonoscopy?

45
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,310
- On the back...
- An urological test on the front.

46
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,310
- And a colonoscopy on the back.
- It's also open on the back.

47
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,550
A colonoscopy on the back.

48
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,720
- Gosh, seriously...
- He just got...

49
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,220
a colonoscopy.

50
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,750
Suk Jin, you should
wear only the outer pants.

51
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,750
Right. Only the outer pants.

52
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,450
You can stay cool at home then.

53
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,450
- You look so tacky.
- No, I don't.

54
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,660
- Look at your hair.
- It's this year's new color trend.

55
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,700
Orange.

56
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,800
- Are you Michol or what?
- What are you talking about?

57
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,830
You're Dr. Octopus.

58
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,940
I don't look like Dr. Octopus.

59
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,060
That's right.

60
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,230
- From "Spider-Man."
- He's Tin Tin Five.

61
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,440
- Pyo In Bong.
- Move your head

62
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,830
Move it so I can see ahead

63
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,170
- Pyo In Bong.
- What's with you? Today...

64
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,170
Jong Kook is...

65
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,950
Imagine your boyfriend is a trainer.

66
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,340
This is how he's dressed up.

67
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,140
- Seriously, he is...
- He is wearing different color?

68
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,140
- The boyfriend look.
- He stands out.

69
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,950
He'd be the most
fashionable trainer.

70
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,150
This is called
the trainer boyfriend look.

71
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,080
- Seriously, you are...
- This is how you always look.

72
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,360
I saw Ji Seon sigh.

73
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,830
She must've prepared
some clothes for him.

74
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,890
I'm just glad
that he's not wearing shorts.

75
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,070
This hoodie is quite fashionable.

76
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,570
- What are you talking about?
- I guess it's cozy.

77
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,670
- I know what you mean.
- It's comfortable around here.

78
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,230
You know what I mean, right?

79
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,960
- It fits him well.
- It has lines here.

80
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,040
Hey.

81
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,700
- Ji Hyo, what's with you?
- She looks cute.

82
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,040
It's like
a cold medicine commercial.

83
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,510
Watch out for cold.

84
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,740
- A cold medicine commercial.
- Get me an abalone.

85
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,920
- My gosh.
- That's how she looks.

86
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,980
Ji Hyo reads
fashion magazines these days.

87
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,550
Is that true, Ji Hyo?

88
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,950
- I study fashion now.
- Actually,

89
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,920
- She studies fashion.
- she still looks good.

90
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,080
- It does look good on her.
- This is in style now.

91
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,290
- The bag is popular too.
- This one.

92
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,420
And we have someone
who's in the fashion business.

93
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,070
- That's not it.
- She runs a small store.

94
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,520
She sells imported clothes.

95
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,770
She imports clothes.

96
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,730
We can see ladies like her
in Itaewon.

97
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,040
There are a lot.

98
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,140
- In Itaewon...
- Now So Min looks...

99
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,510
pretty good in an outfit like this.

100
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,880
- She does.
- She's old enough.

101
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,770
- I look old, right?
- I mean, she's 37 now.

102
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,770
You look nice.

103
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,820
Since this is our first
shoot in the New Year,

104
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,270
I'd like you to talk
about your New Year's resolutions.

105
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,790
- This is our first shoot?
- Really?

106
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,790
I guess you all have
your New Year's resolutions.

107
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,950
And I heard one of Haha's
resolutions already came true.

108
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,950
- What is it?
- What?

109
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,450
- What is it? Are you pregnant?
- Your fourth child?

110
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,990
- Haha...
- What is it?

111
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,600
- I didn't do anything.
- Haha finally got the answer...

112
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,360
to the question that had been
bothering him for a long time.

113
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,640
- What is it?
- What's the question?

114
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,990
- What?
- What would it be?

115
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,640
- What?
- There's a video about it.

116
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,080
"How Do You Play?" or Running Man?
In 1, 2, and 3.

117
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,240
"How Do You Play?"

118
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,580
Oh, dear.

119
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,880
What?

120
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,520
(Feeling betrayed)

121
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,520
- Haha!
- Is this what you mean?

122
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,520
"How Do You Play?" or Running Man?
And you chose "How Do You Play?"

123
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,730
I can't believe this.

124
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,630
- Go away, you punk.
- Just go.

125
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,020
- I can explain.
- No.

126
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,450
- Let me explain.
- I don't like him anymore.

127
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,830
I can't believe this.

128
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,890
(Jong Kook raised doubts
about "The Man of Saturday.")

129
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,400
(After the suspicion was kindled,
Haha has been asked...)

130
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,540
(to choose between
Running Man and "How Do You Play?")

131
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,580
(And he failed
to answer every time.)

132
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,770
(The Man of Saturday
finally got his answer.)

133
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,840
- I don't like him anymore.
- I can explain.

134
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,970
- I hate him.
- Haha.

135
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,780
This is no joke.

136
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,640
- Seriously...
- I'm serious.

137
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,450
I recently went to Jeju Island
with my parents.

138
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,890
While I was driving,
my mother told me this.

139
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,830
"Since Haha started
'How Do You Play?'"...

140
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,390
"he doesn't seem happy
on Running Man."

141
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,700
- Seriously, she said that.
- Even she noticed it.

142
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,030
- She said that out of the blue.
- No.

143
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,590
I can't believe
you played this during the opening.

144
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,830
You're unbelievable.

145
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,010
This is the opening.

146
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,460
What am I supposed to do now?

147
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,700
- What's with you?
- Please.

148
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,080
Tell me.
Why did you say, "How Do You Play?"

149
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,200
I understand.

150
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,180
I've been doing this for 11 years,
but the show...

151
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,880
- It just started.
- It's new.

152
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,020
So I felt like...

153
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,840
it was my youngest daughter.

154
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,990
Then why do you look happy
on the show?

155
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,540
- You don't look happy here.
- Why is that?

156
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,650
Why do you try
so hard on the show...

157
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,950
- while you're not like that here?
- Why is that?

158
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,020
- That's important.
- That's just...

159
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,350
a misunderstanding.

160
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,560
You know what?

161
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,020
- That punk is serious about this.
- No.

162
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,560
- That's not true.
- Hey.

163
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,790
- Let's be honest.
- I...

164
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,870
You can feel it...

165
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,090
- while editing the show, right?
- He's immersed in it.

166
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,590
- He can feel it.
- That's not true.

167
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,200
- Not at all.
- Yes, it is. On "How Do You Play?"

168
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,510
- I got a herniated disk here.
- He looks very cheerful.

169
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,660
No. Don't get me wrong.

170
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,510
Hey! What's with your face?

171
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,310
- Hey, Haha...
- Jong Kook.

172
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,840
- I'm disappointed.
- You know what?

173
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,600
- I watched the show yesterday.
- I'm really disappointed.

174
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,640
- He's really...
- It's a new show.

175
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,840
He's proactive there.

176
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,910
Say something.

177
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,710
- He seems proactive there.
- That's not true.

178
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,060
- Thank you.
- He plays an active part.

179
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,520
- That's true.
- He's active.

180
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
(His Saturday colleague
pulls out right away.)

181
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,020
- That's because it's a new show.
- It just started.

182
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,130
You mean the show.

183
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,260
- He's pregnant too.
- Who?

184
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,890
Bo Pil. He's not?

185
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,770
- He's pregnant too.
- Who?

186
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
- Bo Pil.
- What?

187
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
- He's not?
- What?

188
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
I'm sorry.

189
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,070
Why would he get pregnant?

190
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,810
- What are you talking about?
- Is he pregnant?

191
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,010
Is he pregnant?

192
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,100
- Is Bo Pil pregnant?
- He says he's not.

193
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,700
Why would he get pregnant?
What are you talking about?

194
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,100
- What's happening?
- Who were you talking about?

195
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,380
- Who did you mean?
- Sorry. I couldn't hear it well.

196
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,470
Ji Hyo.

197
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,020
Take off your sunglasses.

198
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,910
- I'm sorry.
- What's wrong with you?

199
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,850
It was funny though. What was that?

200
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,390
- It was so sudden.
- Anyway,

201
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,150
Ji Hyo saved your life.

202
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,950
(Thanks to his friend from Mapo,
Haha got off the spot.)

203
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,130
My friend from Mapo.

204
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,200
It's just a joke.

205
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,570
No, I'm not joking.

206
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,930
I'm serious.

207
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,830
- Anyway, Jong Kook...
- Good luck, Haha.

208
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,460
- feels betrayed.
- Good luck.

209
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,010
- I do.
- Even your mom says that.

210
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,680
I'm very frustrated.

211
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,310
I'll call your mom
and clear up the misunderstanding.

212
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,880
My mom sounded serious.

213
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,080
She was serious.

214
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,380
While we were driving
on Jeju Island.

215
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,910
- That's right.
- My friends also talk about it.

216
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,390
That's why I didn't win
an award on SBS. Happy now?

217
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,950
They didn't give me anything
because I didn't do anything.

218
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,690
- Happy now?
- That's enough.

219
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,830
Enough is enough.

220
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,060
(He saves his life
by blaming himself.)

221
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,430
There's another video
that we received.

222
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,720
- What?
- One is not enough.

223
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,440
- Please play the second video.
- Haha?

224
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,070
- I hope it's not about me.
- What is it?

225
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,030
- Don't make it look like the truth.
- What would it be?

226
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,900
- What is this?
- Why? What are you doing?

227
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,040
- What is this?
- Why? What are you doing?

228
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,310
- This is what I reported.
- What is this?

229
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,320
This is from Jae Suk.

230
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,320
(What is this?)

231
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,390
- What is this?
- Stop it.

232
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,890
- What is she doing?
- Don't play it.

233
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,820
- Stop it.
- I reported it.

234
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,020
What is she doing?

235
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,990
- Is it from Running Man?
- What is this?

236
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,150
- This is a scene from her drama.
- Her drama?

237
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,200
Please.

238
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,270
- What is this?
- What's with her face?

239
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,570
No.

240
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,900
- Where is this place?
- Turn off the cameras.

241
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,600
Is this "I Hear Your Voice?"
Are you tone-deaf?

242
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,640
- Hey.
- It's "Idol Drama Operation Team."

243
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,380
Turn off the cameras now!

244
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,400
Turn them off.

245
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,340
- Turn them off.
- What is this?

246
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,840
This is embarrassing.

247
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,020
- Hey.
- What is going on?

248
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,280
What's with his face?

249
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,250
What's with his face?

250
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,990
(Feeling bitter)

251
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,690
What's that?

252
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,150
- Please turn it off.
- The last one...

253
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,760
Running Man is so unique.

254
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,020
- Who was that?
- What is she doing?

255
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,260
What was that?

256
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,460
This is what I was
talking about yesterday.

257
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,720
What was that?

258
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,790
- All right.
- What?

259
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,940
Let me see their faces again.

260
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,160
- What is it?
- Please play it one more time.

261
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,940
Did you see
the faces of the audience?

262
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,160
What's with their faces?

263
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,310
Is it supposed to be funny?

264
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,940
When was that?

265
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,340
(Please stop it.)

266
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,810
So Min.

267
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,080
What is this?

268
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,380
Is this "Comedy Big League" or what?

269
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,540
Is that "Comedy Big League?"

270
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,140
You reported it.

271
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,650
- I reported it.
- Are you tone-deaf?

272
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,410
The guy in the audience
is clenching his teeth.

273
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,890
- What's that, So Min?
- What's going on?

274
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,090
This is...

275
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,150
I made a cameo in a drama.

276
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,070
I played a singer
who's not so talented.

277
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,270
(Singing)

278
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,690
She did things like this.

279
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,210
What was that?

280
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,900
Guys, seriously... So Min...

281
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,840
- She's a treasure.
- She's done a lot of things.

282
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,270
- She's...
- She works really hard.

283
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,570
So Min does work hard.

284
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,980
- She's hardworking.
- So Min played...

285
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,640
- a character...
- She's supposed to be bad.

286
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,620
- who's not talented.
- The audience doesn't like her.

287
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,680
This video saved my life.

288
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,390
All right, everyone. You guys are
wearing trendy outfits today.

289
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,780
I think it will be hard...

290
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,130
for you to decide
who has better taste in fashion.

291
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,460
- So we will have a contest.
- A contest?

292
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,130
- Please.
- My gosh.

293
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,140
I don't want to be judged.

294
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,740
I just want us
to criticize each other.

295
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,610
We have four experts
who will evaluate your fashion.

296
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,640
- Okay.
- I'm in trouble.

297
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,430
Our youngest member So Min,
please open the curtains.

298
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,210
- So Min. You're the youngest.
- So Min.

299
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,380
- Okay.
- So this is what she does now.

300
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,850
So Min, hey

301
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,890
- Hey
- So Min, you should do this.

302
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,680
Use this hand. You should
open the curtains like this.

303
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,620
That's it. You should do that.

304
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,550
- She's really funny.
- I'm opening the curtains.

305
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,190
- What?
- I see.

306
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,230
(They see some silhouettes
behind the curtains.)

307
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,140
- There's a man.
- Four experts.

308
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,390
- Where's the man?
- It looks like...

309
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,760
- they are in the fashion business.
- There's a man.

310
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,170
I think the third one
is Kim Sook. Right?

311
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,110
- She must be Kim Sook.
- Is she Sook?

312
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,900
- Kim Sook.
- Number one is a slave hunter.

313
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,620
Number one is Hyuk.

314
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,410
Is it you, Hyuk?

315
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,220
- Hyuk.
- Please introduce yourselves.

316
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,830
Hello. Nice to meet you.

317
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,360
- I can hear her voice.
- Is it a man?

318
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,650
- It's a woman.
- She's a slave hunter.

319
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,390
The voice is disguised.

320
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,500
Number two, please say hello.

321
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,970
Hello. Nice to meet you.

322
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,430
- Who is she?
- Is she a comedienne?

323
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,660
Is she Jang Do Yeon?

324
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,210
- Jang Do Yeon.
- Number three.

325
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,400
Do Yeon's hair
doesn't look like that.

326
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,710
Hello.

327
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,940
I'm here to evaluate your fashion.

328
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,480
- She's Sook.
- Is that so?

329
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,250
- Number four, please.
- I have no idea.

330
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,510
Hello.

331
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,780
I'm the fiery fist of
the fashion industry, number four.

332
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,910
- The fiery fist?
- All of a sudden?

333
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,890
- In the fashion industry?
- We don't usually say that.

334
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,330
The fiery fist is quite slim.

335
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,860
- He's in the fashion business.
- He must be a model.

336
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,660
- I bet he's a model.
- He is well-proportioned.

337
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,060
- They look well-proportioned.
- Right. They're tall.

338
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,240
They look cool
with their legs crossed.

339
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,660
Did you see our outfits?

340
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,970
Yes, we did.

341
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,740
- Are you watching us?
- Yes.

342
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,080
We've been watching you
from the beginning.

343
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,610
- Is that so?
- Yes.

344
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,350
Was there an outfit you liked?

345
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,350
Pick the best one.

346
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,750
Well...

347
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,750
(Judge number 4's evaluation)

348
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,440
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Yes?

349
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,550
(Is the lady from "Snowpiercer"
the best dresser?)

350
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,460
Well...

351
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,360
He looks like...

352
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,460
a successful trot singer
from Hong Kong.

353
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,830
(A successful...)

354
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,930
(trot singer from Hong Kong)

355
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,800
- That's a perfect description.
- Hong Kong?

356
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,300
- He's...
- That's right.

357
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,670
He's really mean.

358
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,210
The four experts...

359
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,850
will evaluate each member's fashion.

360
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,140
- Please start with So Min.
- Okay.

361
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,120
Let me go first.

362
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,910
She matched different patterns well.

363
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,130
But she picked a jacket
of the wrong size.

364
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,150
It's an oversized jacket.

365
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,000
(She failed to pick the correct
size, which is the basics.)

366
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,330
I was going to say that.

367
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,660
- It's too long.
- So she looks ill-proportioned.

368
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,430
- Hey
- I know.

369
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,300
- And?
- First,

370
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,640
I think she prefers
the animal trend.

371
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,510
But she just looks like an animal.

372
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,090
She looks like a real animal.

373
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,810
(A real animal)

374
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,040
That was...

375
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,090
- That was too blunt.
- Exactly. It was blunt.

376
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,860
Many of those who work
in the fashion industry are blunt.

377
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,130
- True.
- We could...

378
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,050
We could criticize them
in the same way.

379
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,730
Right. Let's see what else they have
to say about us.

380
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,630
To be honest, I like So Min's style
more than the others'.

381
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,100
- See? She has an eye for it.
- She looks like a rich woman.

382
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,500
This is the first shoot...

383
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,560
- of the new year, right?
- Yes.

384
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,800
I think she picked the tiger pattern
to celebrate the Year of the Tiger.

385
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,880
- I guess she's right.
- Right.

386
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,440
- That's exactly my intention.
- There's one thing I don't like.

387
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,250
That she's wearing
such flashy clothes,

388
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,220
but her attitude doesn't suit
her outfit.

389
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,410
- Her attitude?
- Yes.

390
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,860
- She looks too shy.
- Attitude is important.

391
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,490
- Yes. It's important in fashion.
- Absolutely.

392
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,680
- So Min looks...
- Yes.

393
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,990
(Judge number 4's evaluation)

394
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,420
like the kindergarten director
in "Crayon Shin-chan"...

395
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,420
and Pikotaro who sang "PPAP."

396
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,130
She's somewhere between them.

397
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,020
- The kindergarten director?
- I know that character.

398
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,370
The one who always wears
a yellow jacket.

399
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,640
- Yes, that's the one.
- "PPAP."

400
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,500
(She aimed to be
a fashion leader, but...)

401
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,400
- "PPAP?"
- I know that singer.

402
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,930
- PPAP
- It's similar to their styles.

403
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,670
I know the character
from "Crayon Shin-chan."

404
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,710
- Judge number four...
- Me too.

405
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,940
- has a brutal way...
- It was a brutal criticism.

406
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,120
- Yes, it was a harsh evaluation.
- Yes.

407
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,850
- Judge number four.
- Indeed.

408
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,440
- Next up is Jae Suk.
- Okay.

409
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,360
He looks unexpectedly great
in his outfit.

410
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,510
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

411
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,730
- He looks great in that outfit?
- I'm not sure how this might sound.

412
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,260
But he looks rather fake
than original, I would say.

413
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,130
But he looks rather fake
than original, I would say.

414
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,130
(He looks fake.)

415
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,470
- I thought the same thing.
- That's so funny.

416
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,690
- That's so mean.
- His sneakers and everything.

417
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,510
- What's your problem?
- That's Jenny's fashion style.

418
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,610
- Gosh, seriously.
- I agree.

419
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,740
Looking at him from behind...

420
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,540
Hold on a second.

421
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,440
- She's taking a look at him.
- Is it because of his face?

422
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,940
What's wrong with my face?

423
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,280
- Don't criticize his face.
- Come on, ma'am.

424
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,490
- Just evaluate his fashion style.
- Looking at him from behind...

425
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,150
- That's why you're here.
- You see...

426
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,550
He looks okay overall
when I don't see his face.

427
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,790
- "He looks okay."
- "He looks okay."

428
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,000
- That's cool.
- Oh, no.

429
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,060
I think he'd look better
if he showed his face in profile.

430
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,560
- He should show his profile?
- He should cover his face.

431
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,370
Gosh. Those judges are
absolutely ridiculous.

432
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,030
You're supposed to evaluate
our fashion styles, not our looks.

433
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,930
Why would she criticize my looks?

434
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,770
As for Jae Suk...
Just as I said earlier,

435
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,170
he looks like a successful
trot singer from Hong Kong.

436
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,010
- That's a perfect comparison.
- I'm telling you...

437
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,410
I'm dying to find out
who Judge number four is.

438
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,510
I'll say it in his face
when he comes out.

439
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,750
- That suits you though.
- So you became successful...

440
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,220
and bought Snowpiercer.

441
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,650
He used to be in the tail section.

442
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,260
- He's so mean.
- He got successful as a singer.

443
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,260
A trot singer from Hong Kong.

444
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,830
- He's the worst.
- Okay.

445
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,190
- A singer from Hong Kong.
- I'd rather...

446
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,130
- Next up is Seok Sam.
- I think...

447
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,920
- I think I look really stylish.
- Stand over here, everyone.

448
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,740
Well, as for Jeok Sin...

449
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,010
- "Jeok Sin?"
- That's the worst criticism.

450
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,240
- She said his name wrong.
- Jeon Sin, the king of criticisms.

451
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,640
- Her criticism has already begun.
- Please go on.

452
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,740
- Jeok Sin.
- I'm sorry.

453
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,900
He matched a black sweater
with manly leather clothes.

454
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,440
But too much emphasis has been
placed on his masculinity.

455
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,220
- Only that area catches eyes.
- "His masculinity."

456
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,550
She called it "masculinity."

457
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,630
- That area is cut out.
- Indeed.

458
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,150
- It doesn't symbolize masculinity.
- So he looks over the top.

459
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,760
- I think it should be closed.
- It shows his confidence.

460
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,890
She said you should close it.

461
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,560
- Close what?
- Just sew it up.

462
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,890
- Right. Sew it up.
- Close it.

463
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,260
- Right. That's too much.
- But I can't close it.

464
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,610
- It's over the top.
- But...

465
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,030
- In my opinion, Seob Sin...
- Suk Jin.

466
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,640
- I'm sorry.
- It's Suk Jin.

467
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,640
- It's neither Jeok Sin...
- His name is Ji Suk Jin.

468
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,710
- nor Seob Jin. It's Suk Jin.
- It's Suk Jin.

469
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,270
- "Seok" as in "rock."
- It's Suk Jin.

470
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,540
- I guess Suk Jin...
- His name...

471
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,180
is not famous enough yet.

472
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,180
- He needs to be more famous.
- Exactly.

473
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,090
It seems as if he mixed everything
that was popular...

474
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,860
- among our dads' generation.
- "Our dads' generation?"

475
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,000
Oh, I see. "Our dads' generation."

476
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,690
- What does it mean?
- What our fathers liked.

477
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,020
- I don't think...
- His pants are too short.

478
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,520
- His pants are too short?
- Yes.

479
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,560
- That's because I have long legs.
- And what he's wearing over them...

480
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,060
What is that?

481
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,710
(What is that?)

482
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,980
- "What is that?"
- "What is that?"

483
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,380
Exactly what are you talking about?

484
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,270
- What are you referring to?
- I know what it is,

485
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,090
- but I don't like...
- You're talking about this, right?

486
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,010
I must say, they're all so candid.

487
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,960
Suk Jin looks like a second-hand
clothing store owner...

488
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,960
wearing all of the popular
fashion items that he'd seen...

489
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,230
- in fashion magazines.
- A second-hand clothing shop owner?

490
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,630
A second-hand clothing shop owner?

491
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,190
Why a second-hand clothing shop?

492
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,740
- Wearing the products in his store?
- To increase the sales.

493
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,800
- That's how he recommends them.
- Right.

494
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,370
- That makes sense.
- "I heard this was popular."

495
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,270
- It's simple.
- Next up is Ji Hyo.

496
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,770
- Okay.
- Ji Hyo looks cute.

497
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,800
- Right. She looks cute.
- She looks so cute.

498
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,380
- Ji Hyo looks really pretty today.
- She looks great in it.

499
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,980
I agree. Everything that Ji Hyo is
wearing now...

500
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,410
- is very trendy these days.
- Oh, you noticed them.

501
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,010
- Thank you. That's right.
- Especially her hat is so popular.

502
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,460
- Thank you.
- What are their standards?

503
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,090
Are you saying that fashion is
all about the face or what?

504
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,360
- I think Se Chan is right.
- That's right.

505
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,330
- Let's see what they say about me.
- Se Chan is right.

506
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,370
They evaluate the face,
not the fashion style.

507
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,600
- I too like Ji Ok's... Ji Hyo's...
- "Ji Ok?"

508
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,160
- She keeps saying our names wrong.
- "Ji Ok" as in "fiery pit?"

509
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,470
- I mean, Ji Hyo.
- My gosh.

510
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,710
- Go and wash your face.
- She keeps doing that.

511
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,110
She must be half-asleep.

512
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,350
What's with her pronunciation?

513
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,510
She called Suk Jin "Seob Jin."

514
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,810
It's very trendy, and you can see
her style...

515
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,140
- on runways very often.
- Really?

516
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,140
- You look so pretty, Ji Hyo.
- She's getting compliments.

517
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,210
Talk about her style, not her face.

518
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,950
- I think that the judges...
- What are your standards?

519
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,360
Why would you criticize...
Okay. Go ahead.

520
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,090
- Judge number four, go ahead.
- Okay.

521
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,150
- The feisty one.
- Let's see what he says.

522
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,490
There's this song.

523
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,660
(Pretty woman)

524
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,300
(He suddenly started singing
a love song.)

525
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,140
(What is going on?)

526
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,640
- What is his deal?
- What's wrong with him?

527
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
- Number four is just crazy.
- Hey, come out.

528
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
- He's just crazy. Who are you?
- Exactly.

529
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,930
- They all care about appearances.
- Judge number four...

530
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,400
Is he even an expert?

531
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,520
- Look how thin his wrist is.
- His fist looks so small.

532
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,240
- It's so thin.
- His punch would sting a little.

533
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
- Right. I'd get pricked and bleed.
- Okay. Let's hear them out.

534
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,590
Go ahead and criticize it all you want.
Number one, you're up.

535
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,560
As for Se Chan...
When it comes to his tops,

536
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,100
I think they're trendy and stylish.

537
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,100
Right.

538
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,160
- He dressed nicely.
- Although he dyed his hair orange,

539
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,890
- I think... It's not so bad.
- It's trendy these days.

540
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,960
- Oh, great.
- Really?

541
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,000
- It's not so bad?
- He looks great.

542
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,430
- I don't believe her.
- Exactly.

543
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,430
(Next up is
Judge number 2's evaluation.)

544
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,970
- His hair looks like Cheetos.
- Cheetos?

545
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,170
(His hair looks like Cheetos.)

546
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,640
- Cheetos.
- Hey.

547
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,170
My hair looks like Cheetos?

548
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,440
- She said it looked like Cheetos.
- That's a good comparison.

549
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,940
Hey, I like Cheetos.

550
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,820
- Cheetos? That's ridiculous.
- Cheetos.

551
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,720
- Cheetos?
- That's a great comparison.

552
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,130
Your fingertips turn that color...

553
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,290
- after eating those chips.
- Exactly.

554
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,360
Right. That's the exact color.

555
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,330
What about my clothes?

556
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,660
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

557
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,770
- Well...
- Who is this person? Let me think.

558
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,600
You look like a little boy
who's eight years old or younger.

559
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,580
And your mother is
a helicopter parent.

560
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,110
(The helicopter mom's son's style)

561
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,440
Who do you think you are?
How dare you talk about my mom?

562
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,050
- I can imagine the situation.
- Exactly.

563
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,390
- I can imagine it too.
- That was amazing.

564
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,680
- He's doing great.
- Who on earth is he?

565
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,550
- He's so observant.
- Who is Judge number four?

566
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,750
- There will be a talent show.
- He's so funny.

567
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,910
- Who is he?
- He's really good at this.

568
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,220
And your mother is
overly enthusiastic.

569
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,830
- My mom is overly enthusiastic?
- That's a good comparison.

570
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,720
- I can imagine the whole situation.
- Exactly.

571
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,160
- I can't wait to see his face.
- I've seen it.

572
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,420
- You can see it on social media.
- Indeed.

573
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,690
- Let's criticize them later.
- Let's do that.

574
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,040
- All right. My gosh.
- I've seen such kids before.

575
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,960
- Next up is Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook is up next.

576
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,610
Goodness, you.
Hey, put that water bottle down.

577
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,550
- This is a fashion item.
- That too?

578
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,470
- Of course. A water bottle...
- You're carrying it intentionally.

579
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,880
- Yes, I matched it to my outfit.
- Oh, I see.

580
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,710
Well... Right.

581
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,090
- Which camera should I look at?
- I have nothing to say.

582
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,590
Judge number four said that
he had nothing to say about him.

583
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,630
Well...

584
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,920
I can't evaluate his fashion style.

585
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,750
(They gave up on evaluating.)

586
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,460
- I knew it.
- Yes.

587
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,370
I wouldn't dress like that
even when I sleep.

588
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,870
Even when he sleeps?

589
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,890
He wouldn't dress like that
even when he sleeps.

590
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,840
I would never dress like that
even in bed.

591
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,310
- I can't believe him.
- He's amazing.

592
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,340
- I knew it.
- He has a nice body though.

593
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,380
(He has a nice body?)

594
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,050
- Is that so?
- Oh, I see.

595
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,640
- She doesn't sound very young.
- Do I have a nice body?

596
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,090
- I bet none of them is so young.
- I agree.

597
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,590
- They all use outdated expressions.
- True.

598
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,820
- I think they're done.
- Right.

599
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,250
- I'll go back in.
- That was quick.

600
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,650
Haha is up next. I wonder
how they'll evaluate his style.

601
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,250
- That was hilarious.
- Look how he's walking.

602
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,390
He's pretending to be younger.

603
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,390
He's 44.

604
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,330
- He's obsessed with being youthful.
- Absolutely.

605
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,690
He looks like Kanye West
from behind.

606
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,840
(She complimented how he looked
from behind.)

607
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,700
But once he turns around,

608
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,670
he looks like one of the minions
from "Despicable Me."

609
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,900
- One of the minions?
- Yes.

610
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,470
He looks completely different
from the front, don't you think?

611
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,740
- He looks great from behind.
- From Kanye West to a minion.

612
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,780
A minion from "Despicable Me?"

613
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,710
He looks incredibly stylish
from behind.

614
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,860
(He looks like a world-class
fashion leader from behind.)

615
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,180
- That's so funny.
- But he looks like a minion...

616
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,420
- from the front.
- My goodness.

617
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,480
(But he looks like an action figure
from the front.)

618
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,920
(To conclude, it's not
just about what you wear.)

619
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,690
I understand that he chose
oversized clothes intentionally.

620
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,920
He likes to wear oversized clothes.

621
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,690
But his pants make his legs
look too short.

622
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,230
He shouldn't have chosen
such long pants.

623
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,380
- My gosh.
- Who is he?

624
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,780
- His shoes have such thick soles.
- They're almost 10cm thick.

625
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,640
- Right.
- They're almost 10cm thick.

626
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,880
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

627
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,320
In foreign countries,

628
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,450
there are many fashion leaders
among homeless people.

629
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,450
That's all. I'll say no more.

630
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,860
- He's unbelievable.
- Who is he? I'm so curious.

631
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,490
- Who is he?
- Who on earth is he?

632
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,950
He practically called me a beggar.

633
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,370
Yes, that's right.

634
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,100
Come back in now.

635
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,490
I can't wait to find out
who they are. They're unbelievable.

636
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,310
- I'm upset.
- He would never dress like this?

637
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,230
Your fashion styles have been
evaluated...

638
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,780
- in detail.
- Yes.

639
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,240
Now, we'll reveal the four
fashion experts as you wish.

640
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,280
- Let's find out.
- Come out now.

641
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,050
- Number four, come on out.
- Who are you? Come out.

642
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,740
Number two, you said my hair looked
like Cheetos. Come on out.

643
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,210
- Come out now.
- I'll teach you a lesson.

644
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,450
- Number four, come out.
- My mom is a helicopter parent?

645
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,480
- That startled me.
- Oh, my.

646
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,590
- Oh, it was Woo Jae.
- Hello.

647
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,860
They sure are fashion experts.

648
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,650
- That startled me.
- Oh, my.

649
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,630
- Oh, it was Woo Jae.
- Hello.

650
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,630
I'm surprised.

651
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,370
(Running Fashion Show, Joo Woo Jae)

652
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,270
They all turned out to be
such amazing stars.

653
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,500
- Long time no see.
- Hi, Jae Suk.

654
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,110
- I can't complain to them.
- Hello.

655
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,900
- Hello.
- They all look so fabulous.

656
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,780
- Hello.
- Hi.

657
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,780
- Hello.
- They really are fashion experts.

658
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

659
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,140
- Hello.
- Hey, Woo Jae.

660
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,790
- It's been a while. Oh, hello.
- Hello.

661
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,980
- It's good to see you again.
- You look amazing.

662
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,390
Oh, my. They all look great.

663
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,890
Who said I looked like a minion?

664
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,980
(It was Irene.)

665
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,600
- Who called my hair Cheetos?
- It was her.

666
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
- Who said that?
- Who compared my hair to that?

667
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,770
I didn't know that Irene could be
so harsh.

668
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,800
- Their comments were so funny.
- As we expected,

669
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,370
- they have a lot of experience.
- True.

670
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,070
- It's hard to make such comments.
- It's not easy.

671
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,140
I'll introduce our guests
one after another.

672
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,670
First up is Lee Hyun Yi.

673
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,700
Hello, everyone. I'm Lee Hyun Yi.
I'm a fashion model.

674
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,520
- Is this your first time here?
- She looks gorgeous.

675
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,980
- Yes, this is my first time.
- Oh, really?

676
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,240
- Really?
- Yes.

677
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,390
- I think that's true.
- I've been enjoying the show...

678
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,910
- at home as a viewer until now.
- That's great.

679
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,560
Hyun Yi has been appearing
on many variety shows.

680
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,920
You've been very busy, right?

681
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,530
- Yes, I have.
- She seemed very enthusiastic.

682
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,300
- I'm busy shooting the shows,
- Yes.

683
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,800
but I'm also busy training
six times a week.

684
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,270
- Training for soccer?
- Yes.

685
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,270
- I spend most of my time training.
- I'm so jealous.

686
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,340
- I mean it.
- Join us...

687
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,880
- for training.
- I'm so jealous.

688
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,440
- They're like professional players.
- Indeed.

689
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,170
They've been training
as professional players do.

690
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,970
You see, Hyun Yi...

691
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,480
majored in economics
at Ewha Womans University.

692
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,520
- That was a long time ago.
- She's amazing.

693
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,180
- That's incredible.
- She has everything.

694
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,480
It was the only thing
I was good at...

695
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,180
- I wanted to major in economics.
- Economics?

696
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,920
- I majored in business, you know.
- Sorry?

697
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,990
- I majored in business.
- Right, he majored in business.

698
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,530
- Oh, right.
- I majored in business.

699
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,890
- It's similar to economics.
- What did you learn in college?

700
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,160
Like a business
that Huh Kyung Young runs?

701
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,140
(Could he have studied
to be like Huh Kyung Young?)

702
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,700
You're the one who makes calls
from his campaign team, right?

703
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,160
- I get a call from them every day.
- He's the one...

704
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,730
- who makes those calls.
- Oh, I see.

705
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,000
- I'm sure of it.
- Right?

706
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,380
No? I'm sorry.

707
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,080
- Huh Kyung Young?
- Huh Kyung Young?

708
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,280
I got a call from his campaign team
not long ago.

709
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,550
- Do you make those calls?
- No.

710
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,520
- "Hello."
- I got that call three times too.

711
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,890
- Do you...
- "Hello. I'm Huh Kyung Young."

712
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,150
Do you make those calls?

713
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,390
- No.
- No?

714
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,680
- No, I don't.
- Okay.

715
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,480
Hae Na is very famous...

716
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,920
in the fashion industry
because she is...

717
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,370
- shorter than most other models.
- That's true.

718
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,340
- Despite that, Hae Na is...
- Really?

719
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,000
- Is she very successful as a model?
- very successful in the industry.

720
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
- She has a well-proportioned body.
- Really?

721
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,960
- She's so stylish, you know.
- But she's very tall.

722
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,340
- Show us a few poses.
- True. I'm sure...

723
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,970
that I'm the shortest
among the active fashion models.

724
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,380
- Oh, I see.
- How tall are you?

725
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,910
- I'm 169cm tall.
- What?

726
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,470
- See?
- Aren't you taller than 170cm?

727
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,590
- She looks very tall.
- That's hard to believe.

728
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,020
So whenever I pose
with another model...

729
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,590
Let's say I'm posing with Hyun Yi.

730
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,250
I'd lie down or sit down right away.

731
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,290
(I'd lie down
or sit down right away.)

732
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,630
- I get it.
- Can you show us one pose?

733
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,360
- Let's say she's standing here.
- Okay.

734
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,150
- Then I'd bend my knees like this.
- Oh, I see.

735
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,570
- She has her own ways.
- You'd bend your knees?

736
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,570
Yes, to lower my body.

737
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,690
- You need to catch eyes...
- Haha does the same thing.

738
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,270
- Don't say that.
- He always...

739
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,040
- sits down in the front.
- That's true.

740
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,730
- He does that too. It makes sense.
- Right. He sits down in the front.

741
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,380
- I didn't realize that.
- I see that he had his own reasons.

742
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,380
He lowers his body every time.

743
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,280
- I can understand you.
- You do the same thing, Haha.

744
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,140
- That's very wise of you.
- He sits down right away.

745
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,550
- He had his own reasons.
- Now I see why he does that.

746
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:09,320
- He posed like that intentionally.
- Yes.

747
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,790
- I didn't know that.
- When I pose by myself,

748
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,980
I try to look as tall as possible.

749
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,600
I put one of my legs forward
and lean back a little.

750
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,990
- Leaning back? I see.
- Like this.

751
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,630
- I've seen models posing like this.
- Yes.

752
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,800
- Lean back a little?
- Like this.

753
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,890
- Irene is demonstrating it too.
- This pose makes your legs...

754
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,540
- look longer.
- It makes me look taller.

755
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,900
- Look at Ji Hyo.
- Why?

756
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,160
- Ji Hyo...
- Ji Hyo, what are you doing?

757
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,780
- What are you doing now?
- Are you a thug or a gangster?

758
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,780
(Are you a thug or a gangster?)

759
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,900
(She looks like a gangster forcing
people to buy cold medicine.)

760
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,400
- How do I look?
- Are you checking a property?

761
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,740
- As if she was checking a property.
- What is she doing?

762
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,820
- Checking a property to buy.
- Ji Hyo, are you a thug?

763
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,850
- One leg forward.
- She looks so funny.

764
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,390
- Next up is Irene.
- Hi.

765
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,890
- Welcome.
- Hello, everyone.

766
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,290
- She's been on our show before.
- Right.

767
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,590
- That's right.
- This isn't your first time here.

768
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,250
But it was a long time ago
when I just made my debut.

769
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,270
- Do you...
- I don't remember clearly...

770
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,920
- what I did on the show.
- Do you think...

771
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,570
you have changed since then?

772
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,160
- First, my Korean...
- She looks even younger now.

773
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,070
- I was younger back then.
- I said you looked younger...

774
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,870
- than you did back then.
- Really?

775
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,080
(The years have been kind to you.)

776
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
- The years have been kind to you.
- Thank you.

777
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,470
- First of all...
- Yes.

778
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,900
- I don't know. I think...
- Suk Jin.

779
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,740
- What's with that upset look?
- Exactly.

780
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,140
- He looked...
- He looked annoyed while saying it.

781
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,290
- It was a compliment. Then why...
- He was like this.

782
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,890
- "You look even younger now."
- It wasn't like that.

783
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,360
Why did you compliment her angrily?

784
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,150
- I wondered if it was a compliment.
- Why would you say it like that?

785
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,150
- You see,
- Why did you make an angry face?

786
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,990
had I said it too excitedly,
I would've seemed less sincere.

787
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,360
You're wrong.
You should exaggerate it.

788
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,690
"My, you look amazing."

789
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,690
"Well, you look good."
It's different.

790
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,770
- Did she live in a foreign country?
- Yes, she did.

791
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,640
- You didn't know that?
- You heard it when she first came.

792
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,230
- What's wrong with you?
- You didn't know that?

793
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,610
- I didn't know that.
- My gosh.

794
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,240
- She's from New York.
- What are you doing now?

795
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,080
- Irene.
- Yes?

796
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,620
You look young before.

797
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,710
What was that?

798
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,140
What are you doing
in those hideous pants?

799
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,290
The pants for colonoscopy.

800
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,860
Mister, go and get it done.
It's your turn.

801
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,390
- Come on. I'm a big fan of hers.
- Are you still under anesthesia?

802
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,130
- Next up is Joo Woo Jae.
- Welcome.

803
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,100
- Joo Woo Jae.
- Woo Jae is an MC...

804
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,030
- specializing in dating shows.
- That's right.

805
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,570
He's been hosting
a lot of dating shows.

806
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,430
Is it true that you and Se Chan went
on the same dating show?

807
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,960
- Yes, we did.
- Really?

808
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,500
Woo Jae and I appeared
on "Love Me Actually."

809
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,110
- Oh, it was "Love Me Actually?"
- Oh, really?

810
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,380
What was funny was...

811
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,610
that I was more popular with girls
than him back then.

812
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,610
(I was more popular than him
back then.)

813
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,850
- Se Chan was so popular.
- But why...

814
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,880
- Girls didn't seem to like him.
- Why...

815
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,180
They didn't like him at all.

816
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,680
- Why?
- I don't know.

817
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
Was he too blunt?

818
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,480
Didn't what you knew about dating
help you win their hearts?

819
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,520
He didn't get many votes.

820
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,130
- When I was cast for the show,
- Yes.

821
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,630
I was confident.

822
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,100
- I thought...
- Of course. I mean it was Se Chan.

823
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,990
Since I gave viewers tips
on dating...

824
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,640
- on my show every week,
- That's right.

825
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,870
and I have seen...

826
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,400
- so many couples,
- True.

827
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,960
- I thought it would be so easy.
- Right.

828
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,500
- "It'll be my absolute victory."
- And you must've checked...

829
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
- who else would be on the show.
- Of course.

830
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,970
That's right. I checked the list
and saw Se Chan's name there.

831
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,780
- But during the show,
- Yes.

832
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,120
I realized how charming he could be.

833
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,170
(During the show, I realized
how charming he could be.)

834
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,590
- He admitted his defeat?
- Why?

835
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,480
Don't you have dating skills?

836
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,910
He looked so handsome.

837
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,590
- Really?
- Oh, really?

838
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,650
Yes.

839
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,920
I find it hard to believe.

840
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,800
- On "Love Me Actually?"
- He looks happy.

841
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,190
Girls tend to pick someone
they feel comfortable around...

842
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,890
- when they're on a TV show.
- That's exactly my point.

843
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,460
- We hosted many shows like that.
- That's right.

844
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,890
That's why I said that Jae Suk was
my ideal type in an interview.

845
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,160
- Really?
- Yes.

846
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,870
You can find the article
on the internet.

847
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,810
"Song Hae Na's Ideal Type Is
Yoo Jae Suk."

848
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,080
- Really?
- Yes.

849
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,000
You look like a nice person. Okay.

850
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,280
She's socially savvy. Great.

851
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,910
It happens a lot...

852
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,090
- True.
- on matchmaking shows.

853
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,560
Many women choose someone else...

854
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,390
- They wouldn't pick whom they like.
- That's true.

855
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,590
- They would choose a different man.
- Woo Jae doesn't seem to agree.

856
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,750
I fell into a slump
for the first time in my life.

857
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,800
(I fell into a slump
for the first time in my life.)

858
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,070
Don't take it negatively.

859
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,160
- I hit rock bottom.
- He seemed so stressed out.

860
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,960
- You see,
- That was funny.

861
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,900
- Woo Jae has a lot of talents.
- I'm telling you the truth.

862
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,080
- Does he?
- He has a lot of talents.

863
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,380
- Yes. He's good at imitating...
- Really?

864
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,540
- Lee Soo Man,
- Me?

865
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,170
- Kim Jang Hoon,
- Of course.

866
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,780
Gong Yoo,
and so many other celebrities.

867
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,910
- Of course.
- You can imitate Kim Min Jong too?

868
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,440
- He looks like Min Jong.
- Yes, I can.

869
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,290
- I see the resemblance.
- By the way, Woo Jae...

870
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,820
It keeps bothering me.
Your shoulders are too rounded.

871
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,360
Right. You should fix it.

872
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,590
- Pull your shoulders back.
- Look at him.

873
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,590
- He's acting like a trainer.
- I couldn't...

874
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,990
Yoon Seok has a similar body to his.

875
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,150
(Yoon Seok has
a similar body to his.)

876
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,030
(The next Lee Yoon Seok)

877
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,300
- But...
- I can't ignore things like this.

878
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,870
- Come on, you guys.
- It bothers me.

879
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,640
He barely recovered his confidence
after "Love Me Actually."

880
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,500
- He may fall into a slump again.
- Not again.

881
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,610
- But it looks quite serious.
- Why would you talk about it?

882
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:27,000
I've been controlling my mind well
for the past few years.

883
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,550
- I see.
- But...

884
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,580
- Come on my show. I'll help you.
- Then...

885
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,020
Show us just one of them.

886
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,280
- A celebrity impression?
- Yes.

887
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,210
- He's really good at it.
- Well...

888
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,710
I think the best impression would be
Lee Seung Hwan.

889
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,890
Show us a little.

890
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,590
- You do have a similar voice.
- I'm excited.

891
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,600
- He's good at singing too.
- I think he'll do well.

892
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,190
(He started singing so suddenly.)

893
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,190
(Why did you leave me?)

894
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,800
- That was really good.
- That's all.

895
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,370
- He's amazing.
- My impressions are short.

896
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,960
- Imitate Min Jong this time.
- Sounds great.

897
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,770
- He's great. He never hesitates.
- He's really good at it.

898
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:55,810
- It was so good.
- You did well.

899
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,230
- He's good at it.
- I liked that.

900
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,900
(Now)

901
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,880
- That's it.
- Good job.

902
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,900
- He's really good at it.
- Imitate Kim Jang Hoon this time.

903
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,280
- That was good.
- Imitate Jang Hoon.

904
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,440
- Jang Hoon.
- He's good at it.

905
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,090
(1,000 times or 10,000 times)

906
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,790
That's good.

907
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,650
(You would come and go)

908
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,890
A kick.

909
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,390
(Jang Hoon's signature fly kick)

910
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,720
That's all...

911
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,390
- for the impression of Jang Hoon.
- That was so funny.

912
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,690
- That was impressive.
- Indeed.

913
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,690
- You did a great job.
- Yoon Seok...

914
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,140
- Yoon Seok is hilarious.
- How about Kim Dong Ryul?

915
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,840
- Kim Dong Ryul?
- Yes, I want to see his impression.

916
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,900
(He can imitate any singer
right away.)

917
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,000
- That was amazing.
- Good job.

918
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,380
- How about Yoon Seok?
- He's good at it.

919
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,440
- That was great.
- Indeed.

920
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
- How about Yoon Seok?
- He's amazing.

921
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,810
- Can you imitate him too?
- Yoon Seok?

922
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,970
Say his catchphrase too.

923
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,350
- That's good.
- "That's so mean."

924
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,470
- That was Lee Yoon Seok impression.
- Good job.

925
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,480
- "That's so mean."
- Great.

926
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,590
Let's give the four of them a hand.

927
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,480
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

928
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,750
Can you all step back a little?

929
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,180
- All right.
- That was hilarious.

930
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,390
There was a reason
for evaluating your fashion styles.

931
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,190
You can gain some additional points.

932
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,330
The seven of you will stand
where you are.

933
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,100
And the four guests will discuss...

934
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,870
deciding your rankings.
Starting from the worst dresser...

935
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,490
- Will they push us away?
- Yes.

936
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,570
- Starting from the worst dresser?
- That's terrifying.

937
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,370
- It's okay. Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

938
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,670
- It's okay.
- Please stand in front of them.

939
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:06,280
The higher you're ranked,
the more points you can get.

940
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,640
- It's okay.
- Since it's their decision,

941
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,880
- we should accept the result.
- Of course.

942
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,710
- We should accept it.
- Of course, we should.

943
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,380
- We should.
- Four of you, please discuss...

944
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,890
and push the person in last place first.

945
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,290
- Starting from the last place.
- This is so funny.

946
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,320
Please be fair and objective.

947
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,980
- He made no effort.
- I think...

948
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,560
we should choose Suk Jin.

949
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,250
- He should be in the last?
- His outfit is the worst.

950
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,690
- But that's too harsh.
- Decide based on our styles.

951
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:28,220
First, push the worst dresser
who came in seventh place.

952
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,960
- It's okay.
- Okay.

953
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,640
- I look cool from behind.
- It's okay.

954
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,870
It's okay.

955
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,870
He looks like Kanye West
from behind.

956
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,370
(They're discussing it seriously.)

957
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,380
Coming in seventh place would mean
you dressed awfully.

958
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,610
That person should never
talk about fashion again.

959
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,740
Now, please push the person
in seventh place.

960
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,240
- Can we push the person now?
- Push that person right away.

961
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,280
Push the person in seventh place.

962
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,320
Just push that person.

963
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,550
- Let's let Irene do it.
- Irene, go ahead.

964
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,910
It's okay. Don't hesitate
to push us.

965
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,060
We wouldn't mind.

966
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,590
- We won't be hurt.
- We would never be hurt.

967
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,290
(Who could be chosen
as the worst dresser?)

968
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,360
- I'm nervous.
- You can push me hard.

969
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,890
- Really?
- Okay.

970
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,160
(Suk Jin got eliminated first.)

971
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,390
- Are you serious?
- Really?

972
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,960
- Please move aside for now.
- My goodness.

973
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,230
- Please move aside.
- I'm glad I'm not in the last.

974
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,200
So this is what you do
on a variety show.

975
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,470
- Suk Jin is in seventh place.
- Suk Jin got eliminated.

976
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,780
Next, please push the person
in sixth place.

977
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,110
I have a feeling
that I'll be ranked high.

978
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,180
(Gym Jong Kook
is eliminated as well.)

979
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,180
- I'm good.
- You're out.

980
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,120
- Are you sure?
- It's all good.

981
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,450
- I...
- What he's wearing is better?

982
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,320
- At least I didn't come in last.
- Are you kidding me?

983
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,480
- It's understandable.
- Unbelievable.

984
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,220
Who's in fifth place then?

985
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,630
Go ahead.

986
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,630
- Nice.
- All right!

987
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,690
Seriously?

988
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,660
- It's true though.
- Right.

989
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,160
Are you kidding me?

990
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,730
Push the member in fourth place.

991
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,660
Take off your jacket halfway
like earlier.

992
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,770
But this is what
ties in the whole look.

993
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,430
- This isn't what I wanted.
- It's so true.

994
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,970
(Ms. Leopard Print came in 4th.)

995
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,040
It's So Min.

996
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,970
- Haha's too high up.
- I'm satisfied.

997
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,050
I agree with their choice.

998
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,320
- He looks different from behind.
- He looks so cool.

999
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,640
- From behind...
- That beggar?

1000
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,440
- How can that beggar look cool?
- They're all professionals.

1001
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,890
Ginger Boy is still up there.

1002
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,480
We're down to the top three.

1003
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,220
- Top 3?
- Top 3?

1004
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,920
- That alone makes me smile.
- Unbelievable.

1005
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,800
- Top three?
- Are you kidding me?

1006
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,490
- Let them see you from behind.
- On Running Man?

1007
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,800
Things are too easy on Running Man.

1008
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,690
It's down to those two.

1009
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,770
Jong Kook's already annoyed.

1010
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,110
- I can't look at Se Chan's legs.
- Did you hear him?

1011
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,640
He's annoyed
when that's what he chose to wear?

1012
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,280
It's not bad, right?

1013
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,670
- Join me over here.
- They're professionals.

1014
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,200
- No way.
- Come with me.

1015
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,900
Third place is good enough.

1016
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,550
(Ji Hyo is in 3rd place!)

1017
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,020
- Seriously?
- I agree that you look good.

1018
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,050
- I'm in third place, so...
- You sure are professionals.

1019
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,390
- How does this make any sense?
- I'm in third place.

1020
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,560
It makes no sense.

1021
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,630
This is insane.

1022
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,720
Are you sure about Se Chan though?

1023
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,590
- This is insane.
- Tell me about it.

1024
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,890
How does this make any sense?

1025
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,300
How can that outfit be...

1026
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,660
(The fashion terrorists
are outraged.)

1027
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,830
This is crazy.

1028
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,570
Let me explain though.

1029
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,840
If he goes to
a fashion show overseas,

1030
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,460
- he'll be photographed.
- Absolutely.

1031
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,460
Irene, come on.

1032
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,230
- He will be photographed.
- This is incredible.

1033
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,730
- She's right.
- People will take his photo.

1034
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,380
- I'm sure of it.
- No way.

1035
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,200
He'll catch my eye for sure.

1036
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,080
Don't you love
the color of his hair?

1037
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,350
- Mr. Cheetos.
- Mr. Cheetos.

1038
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,020
- Cheetos.
- I don't get it.

1039
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,060
And now for the finals.

1040
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,390
The finals.

1041
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,950
- The finals?
- How is this even possible?

1042
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,720
- I'm ashamed.
- How is this the finals?

1043
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,920
We're the ones embarrassed.

1044
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,890
- How can they be the finalists?
- This makes no sense.

1045
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,160
- This is insane.
- I should buy these clothes.

1046
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,890
Octopus Man is one of the finalists.

1047
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,840
- Unbelievable.
- Octopus Man.

1048
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,460
The one that gets pushed
will be in second place.

1049
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,710
The one who remains
will be in first place.

1050
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,830
Second place is good enough.

1051
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,100
Then he's in first place?

1052
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,940
The one who remains
will be crowned...

1053
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,770
as the Fashion King.

1054
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,540
The Fashion King. I love it.

1055
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,040
When that's what they're wearing?

1056
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,690
- They both look awful today.
- No way.

1057
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,580
- They're professionals.
- Second place is good enough.

1058
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,520
(The one who remains
will be the Fashion King.)

1059
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,150
I look good from behind.

1060
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,850
(Their pride hangs in the balance.)

1061
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,600
(Who will be crowned as
the Fashion King?)

1062
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,390
Let's do this.

1063
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,740
- Haha won.
- Okay.

1064
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,040
(Haha is the Fashion King!)

1065
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,140
You guys are professionals!

1066
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,200
They were serious about this.

1067
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,510
- I mean...
- Right?

1068
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,470
You're the real deal.
How about a photo?

1069
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,310
I can't believe it.

1070
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,180
- How does this make sense?
- Look at him.

1071
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,120
He's really happy about this.

1072
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,490
In 2, 3.

1073
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,620
(He takes a selfie not caring about
what the others think.)

1074
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,890
Seriously.
How does this make any sense?

1075
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,350
This is a huge honor.

1076
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,260
This is insane.

1077
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,680
From behind...

1078
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,950
- It works globally.
- They're professionals.

1079
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,220
- They know what's trending.
- His style...

1080
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,060
- works globally.
- Absolutely.

1081
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,830
He'll be photographed a lot...

1082
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:33,240
- out on the street.
- Exactly.

1083
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,740
You will be given points
depending on your ranking.

1084
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,270
- Okay.
- Nice.

1085
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,240
Today's race is all about
earning points...

1086
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,270
and using that
to make yourself taller.

1087
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,370
- It's the Key Point Race.
- Key Point Race?

1088
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,370
Since height means everything,

1089
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,350
you will be sorted into teams
according to your height.

1090
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,680
Tall, average, and short.

1091
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,640
To make things fair,

1092
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,350
Woo Jae will either be on
Team Average or Team Short.

1093
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,790
- Do I get to choose?
- Yes.

1094
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,120
All right.

1095
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,620
Here is Team Tall.

1096
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,350
Lee Hyun Yi.

1097
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,390
- Right.
- Of course.

1098
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,620
Hyun Yi's tall, so...

1099
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,830
Joining her will be Irene.

1100
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,390
Irene's tall as well.

1101
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,790
Also on that team is Jae Suk.

1102
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,160
How is he on Team Tall?

1103
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,370
I'm 178cm.

1104
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,510
And Jong Kook.

1105
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,580
- So we're on one team.
- I see.

1106
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,640
- Jong Kook and I are teammates.
- Nice.

1107
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,180
- Let's do this.
- That's Team Tall.

1108
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,970
I can't believe we're the tall ones.

1109
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,720
- But...
- If you think about it,

1110
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,180
- we're not exactly that tall.
- I know.

1111
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,760
- Next up is Team Average.
- Team Average.

1112
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,310
Suk Jin.

1113
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,220
So Min.

1114
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,850
And also Se Chan.

1115
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,830
- Is it just the 3 of us?
- Is it us 3?

1116
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,220
Yes, you're Team Average.

1117
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,390
Aren't we the weaker team, then?

1118
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,830
Here is Team Short.

1119
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,200
Haha, Ji Hyo, and Hae Na.

1120
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,430
- And Hae Na too.
- Right.

1121
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,830
- So that's how it is.
- Last but not least,

1122
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,830
Woo Jae will choose
the team he'd like to be on.

1123
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,080
Since he'll be 60 soon...

1124
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,680
What do you mean I'm almost 60?

1125
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,910
- You're right.
- We should respect our elders.

1126
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,490
- He'll soon turn 60.
- Still...

1127
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,520
You're right.

1128
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,850
I can tell that he's fond of me.

1129
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,060
He'll need someone
to make up for his lack of energy.

1130
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,220
You shine among us.

1131
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,850
- He was born in 1986 as well.
- Just like us.

1132
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,160
- The year of the tiger.
- That's right!

1133
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,060
You can be his children for the day.

1134
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,100
- Got it.
- Of course.

1135
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,870
Let me now explain
the rules to today's race.

1136
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,370
- I'm sure we have advantages too.
- Only they are a team of three.

1137
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,370
Right.

1138
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:15,470
You will increase your height
by winning in games.

1139
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,770
The team with...

1140
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,010
the highest average
on the touchpad will win.

1141
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,430
(Reach higher
by increasing your height.)

1142
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,770
You will find a wall
when all the games have ended.

1143
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,120
- Where you manage to touch...
- Really?

1144
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,540
Here's how you can grow taller.

1145
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,180
You will earn coins
after playing today's games.

1146
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,580
With them, you will be able
to purchase blocks.

1147
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,450
So that's how it'll be.

1148
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,700
You will be able to reach higher
if you have more blocks.

1149
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,160
The number of members
receiving the penalty...

1150
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,200
will depend on
how well you do as a team.

1151
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,370
The winning team will win a prize
and earn immunity.

1152
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,160
The shortest member
of the team in second place...

1153
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,510
will receive the penalty.

1154
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,200
The two shortest members
of the team in last place...

1155
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,700
will also receive the penalty.

1156
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:58,270
There's a way for you all
to increase your height...

1157
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,180
which could lead you
to have immunity.

1158
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,040
With the coins you earn,

1159
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,540
you can either spend it
to get the team ahead...

1160
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,350
or spend it
to increase your own height.

1161
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,580
That's all we need.

1162
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,660
- Let's not be selfish.
- They will lose for sure.

1163
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,350
I can either buy blocks
for the team...

1164
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,350
- or spend it for myself.
- Let's not be selfish.

1165
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,790
- They will play dirty.
- It could get dangerous for them.

1166
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,160
Buying shoe lifts
will hurt your team,

1167
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,240
but you'll save yourself
if your team loses.

1168
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,640
Buying blocks for the team
will get your team ahead.

1169
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:27,410
You will be given
a moment to make your purchases...

1170
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,450
every time we wrap up a game.

1171
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,270
After four games,

1172
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,540
your purchased items
will be revealed.

1173
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,720
The three best-dressed members
will receive 3 coins, 2 coins,

1174
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,580
and one coin respectively.

1175
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,910
For the best-dressed members?

1176
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,580
He gets three coins.

1177
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,850
For looking fashionable.

1178
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,450
This is super annoying.

1179
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,020
Our team already has two!

1180
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,760
- Nice.
- It was super important.

1181
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,270
You'll gather after changing
into your team sweaters.

1182
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,970
- All right.
- Okay!

1183
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,040
(Who will win today's race?)

1184
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,160
See you later!

1185
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,930
- Let's go.
- Off we go.

1186
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,510
(They gather to chat
in their team sweaters.)

1187
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,540
Really?

1188
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,600
(Looking around)

1189
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,680
Where's Suk Jin?

1190
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,270
Exactly. But it's only once a week.

1191
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,310
Who's taking so long?

1192
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,080
(His mouth twitches
as he teases Suk Jin.)

1193
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,180
Are you kidding me?

1194
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,660
At your age,
you should be setting an example!

1195
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,990
Guys.

1196
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,060
Oh, you're here.

1197
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,260
- Who said that?
- How polite.

1198
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,350
Suk Jin, you're here.

1199
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,270
Wasn't someone talking about me?

1200
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,200
- No?
- Of course not.

1201
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,370
- No way.
- It wasn't the case.

1202
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,390
Suk Jin, you're here.

1203
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,100
- How polite of him.
- Hey.

1204
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,660
Never forget your manners.

1205
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,870
- Manners. Of course.
- Se Chan.

1206
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,240
- Always be polite.
- Well-mannered.

1207
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,350
- Hey, there.
- I will always bow.

1208
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,580
You make living worthwhile.

1209
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,410
Gather around, everyone.

1210
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,080
How tall are you?

1211
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
I'm around 187 and 188cm.

1212
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,140
- Really?
- You're really tall.

1213
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,410
Aren't you 190cm?

1214
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,760
- Are you good at basketball?
- Basketball?

1215
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,890
I'm terrible at it.

1216
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,890
I love to be on my back.

1217
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,160
It's annoying, you know.

1218
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,390
People ask them that all the time.

1219
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,270
Exactly. People ask me that too.

1220
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,390
- "Do you play basketball?"
- Right.

1221
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:00,370
You'd think that Yoon Seok
is good at basketball too. He isn't.

1222
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,640
- Hyun Yi, do you play basketball?
- Are you good at it?

1223
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,370
I'm terrible at it.

1224
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,140
- Basketball...
- Aren't you good at volleyball?

1225
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,180
- That would be her.
- I used to play volleyball.

1226
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,810
- Yes, of course.
- She was on a team.

1227
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,310
- Really?
- Hae Na, what about you?

1228
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,350
- Me?
- Drinking alcohol.

1229
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,950
- She's a heavy drinker.
- I can hold my liquor well.

1230
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,850
- It's true.
- She's a heavy drinker.

1231
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,180
It's a talent in its own right.

1232
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,490
She loves to drink.

1233
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:22,450
(At that moment...)

1234
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,350
- It's a talent in its own right.
- And Hae Na...

1235
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,760
I heard that as well.

1236
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,020
- What are you up to?
- He...

1237
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,390
- What's that?
- What are you doing?

1238
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,520
What is it?

1239
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,790
(Why is he wearing goggles?)

1240
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,240
- Hold on.
- Check him out.

1241
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,640
- This is too much.
- What are you wearing?

1242
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,810
I have my reasons.

1243
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,010
- Which is what?
- I'm not trying to be funny.

1244
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,310
You're like...

1245
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,540
- That's not the case.
- Are you an attention-seeker?

1246
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,100
- What's going on?
- You see,

1247
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,540
two days ago,

1248
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,180
I received
vision correction surgery.

1249
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,410
Like LASEK?

1250
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,270
No, I had lens inserted.

1251
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,540
So that's why.

1252
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,790
I couldn't risk
my eyes receiving a blow.

1253
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,890
- Of course.
- Then...

1254
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:53,990
you should've stayed home.

1255
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,260
(Hyun Yi chimes in.)

1256
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,520
The procedure was done two days ago.

1257
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,930
- Of course.
- So why...

1258
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,850
He's here to get out of his slump.

1259
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,100
- It could get worse though.
- It was done two days ago,

1260
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,160
- so why bother...
- She is funny.

1261
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,220
- Woo Jae...
- You're doing well today though.

1262
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,970
Do you know what gave me the chills?

1263
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,490
Yoon Seok wears goggles
when he works out.

1264
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,770
Really?

1265
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,580
The surgery must've taken
a toll on him.

1266
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,970
"You're so thoughtful."

1267
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,370
- When he plays games.
- "You're so thoughtful."

1268
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,950
- He's good.
- "You're so thoughtful."

1269
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,220
- Woo Jae...
- He's good.

1270
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,040
Woo Jae is quite good
with variety shows.

1271
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,890
- It's of high quality.
- He's good.

1272
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,310
- High quality?
- He gets along with anything.

1273
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,950
All right. Please slate for us.

1274
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,890
- Hey, you didn't do it?
- Hey. So Min.

1275
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,990
(The slate by the youngest member
of Running Man)

1276
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,700
- Do it even if you're not told.
- Why didn't you do it?

1277
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,220
- I'll slate now. In 1, 2, 3.
- What do you mean?

1278
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,720
- Slate!
- What are you going to do?

1279
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,100
You have to say it politely.
Say, "I'm going to slate."

1280
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,240
- Don't say that. Say...
- I'm going to slate.

1281
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,470
In 1, 2, 3.

1282
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,040
- Are you upset?
- No, I'm not.

1283
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,930
- You seem upset.
- Slate like this. Not like this.

1284
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,510
- You should slate like this.
- Okay!

1285
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,740
- Do it like this.
- So Min.

1286
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,310
- So Min.
- That's how they tease people here.

1287
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,850
You should be snappy.

1288
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:54,950
- Okay.
- You're the youngest, you know.

1289
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,890
- Okay.
- Stand over here now. Here.

1290
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,220
All right. In this mission,
you have to hold out...

1291
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,350
through all humiliations
with your determination.

1292
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,580
It's called I'm Holding Out.

1293
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,290
- It sounds hard.
- A man and a woman...

1294
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,390
will pair up.

1295
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,660
A couple from each team
will play the mission.

1296
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,120
For two minutes,

1297
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,290
we'll count the time each couple
is on the buoy.

1298
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,700
The couple that holds out
the longest wins.

1299
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,810
It's simple, right?

1300
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:18,010
- It sounds fun.
- We must go up there.

1301
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,100
- How do we go up there?
- The time we hold out on the buoy?

1302
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,700
The two of us should be up there
for you to count, right?

1303
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,970
- Correct.
- Got it.

1304
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,270
- A man and a woman?
- That's right.

1305
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,720
But there are three men
on this team,

1306
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,470
- Can't two men play?
- so Suk Jin will play woman.

1307
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,470
He'll be a woman?

1308
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,890
- I'll do it.
- He should do it. He's a bit...

1309
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,060
- But Suk Jin is...
- I'm really strong.

1310
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,580
- You are?
- I'm too strong to play woman.

1311
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,890
Woo Jae is quite competitive
unlike how he seems.

1312
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,890
- He is.
- He's quite competitive.

1313
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:43,560
What's creepy is that
Yoon Seok is also very competitive.

1314
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,870
I'm glad he's competitive.

1315
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,770
- "You're so thoughtful."
- "You're so thoughtful."

1316
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,910
Please pick players
who will play in Round One.

1317
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,330
- Come over here.
- It's okay as long as...

1318
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,200
- our feet don't touch the ground?
- You should quickly dominate.

1319
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,310
- So Min, use your feet, and...
- I can go up like this.

1320
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,510
(Woo Jae's long legs seem useful.)

1321
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,100
That was great.
Your thighs seem strong.

1322
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,120
The thing is,
they'll grab your legs.

1323
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,220
They won't let you go up there
like that.

1324
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,240
(Wrestling is most important
in this mission.)

1325
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,680
- Right. We must go up together.
- So Min and Woo Jae...

1326
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,950
- should play first.
- Okay. Sounds great.

1327
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,180
- The two of you should play.
- You two should play.

1328
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,560
- I'll play with Seok Soon.
- You and I will go second.

1329
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,260
- You should watch Ji Hyo play.
- All right.

1330
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,990
Who is officially stronger
between you two?

1331
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,660
- Irene's arms are stronger.
- They are?

1332
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,870
- Is that so?
- She's the goalie.

1333
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:18,290
- My arms... Okay.
- Then...

1334
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,740
- I should play with Irene.
- Okay, I'll play with you.

1335
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,810
- Hey...
- Jong Kook is going second?

1336
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,140
Jong Kook is going second?
Hey, let us play first.

1337
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,140
(Urgent)

1338
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,200
We'll play first.

1339
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,680
- No, we'll play first.
- No.

1340
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,100
- We'll go first.
- Jong Kook is going second?

1341
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,270
Then Woo Jae should play later.
You should play against Jong Kook.

1342
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,350
- You're the fiery fist, aren't you?
- Right, since we're...

1343
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,370
- on the same level.
- That's right.

1344
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,080
Then we should go first.

1345
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,490
- You can show your power then.
- Okay, I'll play later.

1346
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,620
- I'll wait for the rival match.
- But you two are really strong.

1347
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,220
Players for Round One,
please stand here.

1348
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,790
You can start
once we stop the music.

1349
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
- All right.
- So Min and Woo Jae,

1350
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,160
please come over here.

1351
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,390
- Me? Okay.
- Okay.

1352
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:52,560
- He looks good with So Min.
- They're in trouble.

1353
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,970
- So Min looks good with him.
- So Min, he looks good with you.

1354
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:56,010
- You go well...
- I mean it.

1355
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,270
- With me?
- with comedians. He's Yoon Seok.

1356
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,580
- Yoon Seok.
- How many times...

1357
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,010
do I have to impersonate him today?

1358
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,180
- "You're so thoughtful."
- Did you see...

1359
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,680
- So Min's face just now?
- Why?

1360
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,950
When we told her she looks good
with Woo Jae,

1361
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:09,410
she went, "With me?"

1362
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:13,020
("With me?")

1363
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,580
Why are you acting shy again?

1364
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,080
No, it's...
Do we look good together?

1365
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,620
This is when she made it
really obvious.

1366
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,930
It was when she found out
that Woo Jae was coming.

1367
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:24,160
When we paused the shoot
to get changed,

1368
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,470
she went to Woo Jae and said,
"Hey, we're the same age."

1369
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:29,140
("Hey, we're the same age.")

1370
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,310
(Trying to build a bond
in a cheesy way)

1371
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,040
Jae Suk, you heard that?

1372
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,850
- For me...
- I'm not the type...

1373
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,810
who can easily talk casually
to strangers.

1374
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:43,140
But she directly asked me
to speak casually.

1375
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,350
So Min is also not the type
to speak casually right away.

1376
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,220
But what if So Min
just ends up liking Se Chan?

1377
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,290
- Then Woo Jae...
- Woo Jae will have to...

1378
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,930
- will experience another slump.
- Is this "Love Me Actually?"

1379
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,290
- No, it's not.
- It's not.

1380
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,790
Woo Jae, this is Running Man.

1381
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:58,930
You should focus.

1382
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,200
- You remind me of that show.
- So Min and Se Chan...

1383
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,470
have something going on.

1384
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,930
- Right. I know that they do.
- Yes.

1385
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:03,930
Focus, Woo Jae.

1386
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:05,200
We'll play the music for Round One.

1387
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,970
You can start as soon as
the music stops.

1388
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,040
There's going to be wrestling.

1389
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,100
We go up...

1390
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,470
- once the music stops?
- Yes, when it stops.

1391
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,350
Then what do we do
while the music plays?

1392
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,080
(The first song is "Dynamite" by BTS.)

1393
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:22,560
(The geezers' dance moves
that we wish ARMY wouldn't see)

1394
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,260
Ji Hyo is the strong one.

1395
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:26,660
- Yes, Ji Hyo is strong.
- She's quite strong.

1396
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,660
Ji Hyo is...

1397
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,930
(The ace with 12 years of experience
relaxedly enjoys the dance.)

1398
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,390
(The match starts.)

1399
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,240
- Hey, Irene!
- Haha just hit Ji Hyo.

1400
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,580
(Haha and Jae Suk quickly
occupied the buoy.)

1401
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,350
(Long-legged Irene falls off.)

1402
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:48,540
Irene! Don't come up
from there. It's dangerous.

1403
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,680
(It only counts
if the two of them are on the buoy.)

1404
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,950
Come up, Se Chan!

1405
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,140
- Hold on, Suk Jin.
- Push Ji Hyo off!

1406
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,390
Don't push me!

1407
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:55,580
(Irene managed to come up.)

1408
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,520
Irene, come here.

1409
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,220
(A defender who specializes
in weaklings)

1410
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,560
(Hold me!)

1411
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,120
(Screaming)

1412
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,720
- Hurry.
- Hold me!

1413
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,770
- Irene.
- No. Hurry.

1414
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:08,200
Hold me!

1415
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,200
Go up again.

1416
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,700
(She attacks ruthlessly
with her high-pitched screaming.)

1417
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,640
(Studying in advance)

1418
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,010
Hey, she's trying to come up.

1419
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:16,080
Who is this?

1420
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,600
Is it Irene?
I thought it was Ji Hyo.

1421
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,950
(The two middle-aged men
go head-to-head.)

1422
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:22,890
- I thought it was Ji Hyo.
- Jae Suk!

1423
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,950
Okay. Well done.

1424
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,950
(Suk Jin ends up falling off.)

1425
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:30,430
(All members of Team Average
are wiped.)

1426
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:32,390
- Hurry up. It's okay.
- Go up again.

1427
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,520
- Go up again.
- It's okay. Go up.

1428
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,890
- Push them, Irene!
- Go up again.

1429
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:39,240
- Ji Hyo, push them!
- Go up again, Suk Jin!

1430
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,970
(Among the pro players
with 12 years of experience,)

1431
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,270
For how long do we have to hold out?

1432
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,330
(Irene became an iron gatekeeper.)

1433
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:44,470
Over here! Okay.

1434
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,700
(Hitting)

1435
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,470
(The invisible hand intrudes.)

1436
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:49,700
It's over. You can't go up there.

1437
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,950
- Push them.
- Push them.

1438
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:55,720
The male couple is too merciless.

1439
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,410
Se Chan.

1440
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:58,950
(The male couple from Team Average
is playing shamefully.)

1441
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:00,450
Se Chan, come up here!

1442
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,080
What are you, a spy?

1443
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,990
- Irene!
- Hey, Se Chan!

1444
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,260
Ten more seconds!

1445
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,470
- Go up again.
- Irene is no joke.

1446
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,870
It's over anyway.

1447
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,660
(Round 1 ends.)

1448
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,740
I did well.

1449
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,870
- Irene.
- Irene never let go of her place.

1450
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,830
I did well.

1451
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:21,970
(The orange boy and the old man
are dead tired.)

1452
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,310
You did it, Irene.

1453
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,600
(Irene has a strong grip as
she was a volleyball player once.)

1454
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,770
All right.

1455
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:27,180
Wow, Irene was no joke.

1456
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,740
She's a tough one indeed.

1457
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:31,910
Everyone, we have the results
of Round One.

1458
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,720
Round 1's 1st place...

1459
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,490
goes to the team that held out
for 1 minute and 6 seconds.

1460
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,990
It's Jae Suk and Irene.

1461
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:39,560
(Team Tall wins 1st place
with 1 minute and 6 seconds.)

1462
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,660
You won?

1463
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,060
I knew it.

1464
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,330
- That's amazing.
- Great job.

1465
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,200
- What did you do?
- Second place...

1466
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:47,330
goes to Haha and Ji Hyo
who held out for 56 seconds.

1467
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:48,990
- Good. Second place is good too.
- We're in second place.

1468
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,370
- Well done.
- It was impossible to go up.

1469
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,930
Third place goes to
Se Chan and Suk Jin...

1470
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:53,470
- who held out for 18 seconds.
- Only 18 seconds?

1471
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,740
- Gosh, Yangsebari.
- Hae Na.

1472
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,270
- Yes?
- Let's go.

1473
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:58,350
I'm coming.

1474
00:47:58,350 --> 00:47:59,770
I don't think we can win.
Jong Kook...

1475
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:02,350
We'll combine the scores,
so you can turn the tables.

1476
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,120
- Because of Jong Kook.
- This is...

1477
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,410
- I don't think we can win.
- We need to work together.

1478
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,310
Players for Round Two,
please gather.

1479
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,350
- Okay.
- He's really strong.

1480
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:11,260
This is a rival match.

1481
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,950
Hey, Jong Kook...

1482
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:14,850
We should work together.

1483
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:16,200
- All right.
- He'll kill you all.

1484
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,220
- We'll turn on the music now.
- I know.

1485
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,220
Can I even go up here?

1486
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,870
- Music, cue.
- You should be able to.

1487
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:20,970
(The music for Round 2 plays.)

1488
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,270
(The song for Round 2
is "Gotta Go" by Chungha.)

1489
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,270
All right.

1490
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,870
Let's go.

1491
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,850
(Too bad it's already midnight)

1492
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,450
Oh, that means midnight?

1493
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:38,680
Oh, that means midnight?

1494
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,850
- Stop. Hyun Yi, what's that?
- That doesn't seem right.

1495
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,290
Something seems off.

1496
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,720
Something seems off about her dance.

1497
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:46,990
That doesn't seem right.

1498
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,560
Something is off.

1499
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,200
What are you doing, Hyun Yi?

1500
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,160
(Her body roll seems somewhat off.)

1501
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,330
- Something is off.
- Something is...

1502
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,830
What are you doing, Hyun Yi?

1503
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,410
Her dance is off.

1504
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:59,540
(The cheesy girl
has taken over the stage.)

1505
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,700
That's it. That's the dance.

1506
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,450
What are you doing, Hae Na?

1507
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:04,470
(Hyun Yi has taken over
the dance floor in the meantime.)

1508
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:05,470
I'll join you.

1509
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:06,950
Gosh, Hyun Yi is...

1510
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,520
- Look at Hae Na.
- She's just...

1511
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,120
Her dance is off.

1512
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,790
- Why are their dances so weird?
- How they're such bad dancers?

1513
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:15,220
(It's impossible to understand
the way they move their bodies.)

1514
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,950
- Hae Na, come up to the center.
- The models' dances are weird.

1515
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,290
(Woo Jae is only thinking
of dominating Jong Kook.)

1516
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:19,600
So Min, you must come down now.

1517
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,700
We'll start now.

1518
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,330
- I have to go down?
- Go around.

1519
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:24,490
You must win.

1520
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,720
- Go up there.
- I just came down.

1521
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,140
I just came down.

1522
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,100
(Jong Kook came up first.)

1523
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,040
- Help me.
- It's over. Hyun Yi went up.

1524
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,200
(So Min is focused on
attacking Hae Na.)

1525
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,410
She already went up.

1526
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,180
Go up there!

1527
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:39,180
Go up, Woo Jae!

1528
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,580
Go up!

1529
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,120
(The rivals are finally
taking on each other.)

1530
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,220
Are you going to lift me?

1531
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,540
(Hugging)

1532
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,520
Are you going to lift me?

1533
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,350
(After trying a few times,
he suddenly hugs Jong Kook.)

1534
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:51,330
- Be careful! I might go blind.
- Go up there.

1535
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,700
(Woo Jae tries to attack them
with empty threats.)

1536
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,370
- Be careful.
- Push Woo Jae off.

1537
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:57,660
- Hey.
- Woo Jae.

1538
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,120
Push Woo Jae off.

1539
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,830
(The grasshopper
is hanging by a thread.)

1540
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:03,870
I might go blind!

1541
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,700
- Woo Jae!
- Stay still.

1542
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,740
(So Min hasn't come up
while Woo Jae threatens them.)

1543
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:08,810
We should go up.

1544
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:10,350
What is he, a rock?

1545
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:11,850
Stay still. You can just stay still.

1546
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:14,020
- You should...
- Hey!

1547
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,520
- You should go up.
- So Min, you should go up.

1548
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,310
- Go up there, So Min!
- You need to go up.

1549
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,350
(Team Tall has pushed everyone off.)

1550
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,620
- You must go up.
- Go up there, So Min.

1551
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,760
(Team Short barely manages
to join Team Tall.)

1552
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,330
- Just stay still.
- Go up there!

1553
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,560
- Go up there.
- I'm really going up this time.

1554
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,290
- Go up there.
- Here I go!

1555
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:30,370
- Look at Woo Jae.
- Go up to the buoy!

1556
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:31,560
What is Woo Jae doing?

1557
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,990
- Yes, Hyun Yi and you should...
- Go up there.

1558
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,390
Here I go!

1559
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:35,490
Go up there, Woo Jae!

1560
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,600
I'm really going this time.

1561
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,010
Yes, Hyun Yi and you should...

1562
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,270
(He lightly runs as though he's
going to face Jong Kook head-on.)

1563
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,970
- He's coming up.
- Just stay still like that.

1564
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,810
(Woo Jae jumps up to the part
where Jong Kook isn't present.)

1565
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,950
(Hitting)

1566
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,450
- That's it.
- Woo Jae...

1567
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:57,930
Here I go.

1568
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,430
- Here I go. I'm serious.
- Woo Jae is like a paper doll.

1569
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:01,600
I'm really going this time.

1570
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,020
- Hey.
- A paper doll.

1571
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,020
(The paper doll
is jumping around again.)

1572
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,160
- He's a paper doll.
- Totally.

1573
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,240
Woo Jae. Where did he go?

1574
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:10,430
Woo Jae. Where did he go?

1575
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,970
("Navillera")

1576
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,270
- Hey.
- He is a funny guy.

1577
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:20,080
(Overcoming embarrassment
with an outdated skit)

1578
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,450
- Hey.
- He is a funny guy.

1579
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:22,720
Great one, Woo Jae.

1580
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,350
- Woo Jae.
- I got a call.

1581
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:26,660
- Good one.
- Woo Jae, it's not too late.

1582
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,660
Woo Jae is hilarious.

1583
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,020
- Hey.
- What's with that team?

1584
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:32,580
- That team...
- We're the worst.

1585
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:33,850
Woo Jae...

1586
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:35,020
Hey, Woo Jae!

1587
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,470
You're so sloppy.

1588
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,720
(Woo Jae's rival wins
an overwhelming victory.)

1589
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,990
All right.

1590
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,430
- What was that?
- What was that?

1591
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,930
- Woo Jae.
- That was a good fight.

1592
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:46,600
- I thought you were a paper doll.
- What were you doing?

1593
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,640
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1594
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,680
He's only competitive.

1595
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,770
It was intimidating, wasn't it?

1596
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,970
This guy... I didn't know
where he'd pop up.

1597
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:56,040
- We're in last place.
- I thought...

1598
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,740
- Woo Jae was a kite.
- All right.

1599
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,120
- You were just flying around.
- All right, got it.

1600
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,580
I think we didn't even earn
two seconds.

1601
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,350
- I couldn't go up, not even once.
- Well done.

1602
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:06,330
- We did really well.
- Jong Kook...

1603
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:07,950
- and Hyun Yi.
- We lost, but we fought well.

1604
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:09,470
Your record is
1 minute and 58 seconds.

1605
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:12,020
They didn't come down at all.

1606
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,790
- Except for two seconds?
- Yes. I mean...

1607
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:14,870
Next is...

1608
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,370
Haha and Hae Na. Your record
is 1 minute and 15 seconds.

1609
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:19,370
(Team Short's record isn't bad.)

1610
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:20,470
- All right.
- What about us?

1611
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,640
- Next is...
- I bet it's similar to theirs.

1612
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,240
Woo Jae and So Min.

1613
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,600
- I bet it's similar to theirs.
- Right.

1614
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,520
Your record is
rounded up to two seconds.

1615
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,080
- Pardon?
- You rounded up?

1616
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,350
- That was terrible.
- So it was less than two seconds.

1617
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,220
They couldn't go up there together.

1618
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,260
How did...

1619
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,760
So the team in first place...

1620
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,850
is Team Tall.

1621
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,290
- All right!
- All right!

1622
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,660
- We did it.
- They must have a lot of coins.

1623
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,120
- Three coins each.
- Okay.

1624
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,930
The team in second place
is Team Short.

1625
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:46,330
If you think about it...

1626
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,290
- Here you go, Irene.
- Thank you.

1627
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,430
Here, Hyun Yi.

1628
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:50,740
Thank you.

1629
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:53,240
- Thank you! This is nice.
- We have so many coins.

1630
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,310
Good job.

1631
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:58,350
All right, now. Combining the points
and the points you earned earlier,

1632
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:00,740
you will take turns
to enter the voting booth...

1633
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,220
and purchase either
a block or a shoe lift.

1634
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,720
Buying shoe lifts
will hurt your team,

1635
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,310
but you'll save yourself
if your team loses.

1636
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,350
But buying blocks for the team
will get your team ahead.

1637
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:13,020
The number of members
receiving the penalty...

1638
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,660
will depend on
how well you do as a team.

1639
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,930
The winning team will win a prize
and earn immunity.

1640
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,540
The shortest member
of the team in second place...

1641
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:20,990
will receive the penalty.

1642
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,660
The two shortest members
of the team in last place...

1643
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,330
will also receive the penalty.

1644
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,740
We must buy it no matter what.

1645
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,430
- We should think of the team first.
- We must buy it. Of course.

1646
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:31,310
The result of the vote will be
revealed only toward the end,

1647
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:32,350
so feel free to choose
whatever you want.

1648
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:33,640
We won't reveal it right away.

1649
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,910
We must buy blocks.

1650
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,290
- We must buy blocks.
- Of course.

1651
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:37,540
- Of course.
- We don't even need to...

1652
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,910
- say this many times.
- Of course, we should get blocks.

1653
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:39,950
Of course. It's a given.

1654
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,350
- We can just trust each other.
- Since we're already tall.

1655
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:43,330
- I won't talk about it anymore.
- Okay.

1656
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:44,580
I'll get a block too.

1657
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:47,490
We must be at a disadvantage
to think of betraying each other.

1658
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,950
- You're right.
- We have it good right now.

1659
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:50,970
- You're right.
- Let's go.

1660
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:53,290
- Hyun Yi, you can go first.
- Me? Okay.

1661
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:55,640
(Hyun Yi of Team Tall
goes to vote first.)

1662
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,810
How do I get in here?

1663
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:59,540
So Min! You should be careful!

1664
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,270
- Do I just put it in here?
- We'll be in first place.

1665
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:02,600
(They need to put in the coin they
earned in each box...)

1666
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,950
(to purchase either a block
or a shoe lift.)

1667
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:06,640
(Team Tall promised each other
to buy a block just 30 seconds ago.)

1668
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,140
We must buy blocks.

1669
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,910
We should think of the team first.

1670
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,290
I'll get a block too.

1671
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,760
How thick is the shoe lift?

1672
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:19,950
(What will the first voter,
Hyun Yi, choose?)

1673
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,520
(She purchases a block.)

1674
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,330
Then how much is a block?

1675
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,200
(She buys blocks in a row
while thinking of her teammates.)

1676
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,410
(She spends the last coin
on a shoe lift.)

1677
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:37,100
(Lee Hyun Yi of Team Tall,
2 blocks, 1 shoe lift)

1678
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,850
- You spent it all, right?
- I bought blocks.

1679
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:40,740
- Right?
- It'd be meaningless otherwise.

1680
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,950
- I know. It'd be meaningless.
- We all have the same height.

1681
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:44,040
(She indifferently increased
her height by 1cm.)

1682
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,160
- Can I put all of them in?
- Yes, you can.

1683
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,220
I can?

1684
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,020
Then I'll use two, and...

1685
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,560
(Will Irene keep the promise
she made with her teammates?)

1686
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,660
Okay.

1687
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,850
(Irene of Team Tall,
1 block, 1 shoe lift)

1688
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:58,620
(Irene also bought a shoe lift
to increase her height by 1cm.)

1689
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,100
- I'm going to get blocks.
- Shoe lifts are useless.

1690
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,830
- I'm going to get blocks only.
- You should think of the team.

1691
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:04,470
We will win. We can just win it.

1692
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,740
You're tall.

1693
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,310
Goodness. We don't have to
buy shoe lifts just yet.

1694
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:10,910
We should invest in blocks.

1695
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:12,410
Where is it?

1696
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,540
This is for a block.

1697
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,580
(He buys 2 blocks
as he confidently said.)

1698
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:19,660
Will the other members
pay all their coins for blocks?

1699
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:20,680
(Will the other members
pay all their coins for blocks?)

1700
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,080
For your information,

1701
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,560
(The members of Team Tall
have similar heights.)

1702
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,760
(Then shoe lifts
will come in handy.)

1703
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:29,350
(Tapping)

1704
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,560
(He could feel the coins
the others spent on shoe lifts.)

1705
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,890
We can just win first place
as a team.

1706
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:36,100
I'll get a shoe lift.

1707
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,270
(Jong Kook purchased a shoe lift.)

1708
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:43,100
(Jong Kook got a shoe lift!)

1709
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,040
I'll insert one for a block.

1710
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,870
Do we have plenty of blocks?

1711
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:50,350
(He purchases a shoe lift
as expected.)

1712
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,120
There's quite a lot in here too.

1713
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,850
(Every member of Team Tall
betrayed each other.)

1714
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:59,330
(He spends his last coin
on a shoe lift as well.)

1715
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:01,020
(Yoo Jae Suk of Team Tall,
1 block, 2 shoe lifts)

1716
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:03,930
(It's Team Short's turn.)

1717
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:07,040
(Hae Na was contemplating
her loyalty to Haha and Ji Hyo.)

1718
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,640
Hae Na, don't you use your head!

1719
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,160
No, I didn't!

1720
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,930
(Haha...)

1721
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,740
(uses all his coins on shoe lifts
without thinking twice.)

1722
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:16,100
- See you later.
- Okay.

1723
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,580
Don't make a confusing face.

1724
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,080
Haha, seriously... I...

1725
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,720
- You know how it's like, right?
- You know me.

1726
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,020
- Ji Hyo has changed a lot.
- She twists games a lot.

1727
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,310
- She twists them a lot.
- No, I don't.

1728
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:25,310
Is that so?

1729
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,290
(She purchases shoe lifts
right away.)

1730
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:33,850
(Ms. Song has been betraying
everyone recently.)

1731
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:36,290
(She uses her coins
to buy 2 shoe lifts.)

1732
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:37,790
(Song Ji Hyo of Team Short,
2 shoe lifts)

1733
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:39,020
So Min!

1734
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,700
If we all choose to vote for
the team, we'll win first place.

1735
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,100
I can't get the penalty today.

1736
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,200
Okay. You can't
get the penalty, right?

1737
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,200
(Team Average is after an immunity
by purchasing blocks.)

1738
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,600
Hello.

1739
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:53,310
I don't even need to say it
out loud. I'm getting shoe lifts.

1740
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,470
I should make myself
taller first, and...

1741
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:57,120
So Min! They said you'd need to...

1742
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,640
change your underwear
for today's penalty.

1743
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,760
I already bought it.
Penalties these days...

1744
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,760
are so harsh,
so I need my team to win.

1745
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:07,120
(Ji Suk Jin of Team Average,
1 shoe lift)

1746
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,100
So this is how good it feels
to do something nice.

1747
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,740
This is only our first round.
We don't need to buy shoe lifts.

1748
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:14,740
- Not yet.
- You're right.

1749
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:17,100
Woo Jae! Think of the team.

1750
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,740
How many times must I tell you?

1751
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,580
- You're tall.
- I...

1752
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:21,970
can afford it.

1753
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:30,850
(He purchases a shoe lift.)

1754
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:34,310
I think my team
will come in last place.

1755
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:36,850
As long as it's not me.

1756
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,580
I won't see them ever again anyway.

1757
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,600
This is the lift?

1758
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,490
(Everyone of Team Average
chose to buy shoe lifts.)

1759
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,290
(Se Chan got 3 shoe lifts.)

1760
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:50,910
All right.
Your first choice is over.

1761
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:52,930
Let's move to the second floor
for the next mission.

1762
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:53,930
Let's go.

1763
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:56,240
Are we going to keep
playing this game?

1764
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,310
No, we won't. Come on, Woo Jae.

1765
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,120
I was confident to do well
in the next round.

1766
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,270
We change games.

1767
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,140
- You must've been worried.
- No, I was sad, that's why.

1768
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,240
That's why I asked.

1769
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,950
(Fortunately, the paper doll
won't have to flap around anymore.)

1770
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,720
- So Min.
- Yes?

1771
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,950
This is so troublesome.

1772
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:12,660
Let me explain it to you.
When everyone is gone...

1773
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,100
Look at the cameraman and ask...

1774
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,370
if you can slate. When he says yes,
that's when you slate.

1775
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,470
- You got it, right?
- Can I slate now?

1776
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:20,040
Look at the cameraman
and check if everyone is gone.

1777
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,200
- Okay.
- Look. You need his permission.

1778
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,430
- Do I hit it vertically?
- Yes. Tell him you'll slate.

1779
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:25,830
I'm going to slite.

1780
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:27,370
It's "slate," not "slite."

1781
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,640
(The path of becoming the youngest
is long and tough.)

1782
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,680
Let's do it.

1783
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,540
- I'm going to slate.
- Yes, leave your hands like that.

1784
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,770
One, two.

1785
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,220
Gosh! It should be one, two, three.

1786
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,370
Then move out.

1787
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:37,680
I'll slate.

1788
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,140
One, two, three.

1789
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:41,660
That's it! Good job.

1790
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:44,490
I'll teach you again.
I need to teach you well.

1791
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:45,490
(After the youngest's slate,
they move to the next spot.)

1792
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,100
Wow, what is this place?

1793
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,350
This place is nice too.

1794
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:49,600
That's understandable.

1795
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,990
It feels odd.

1796
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:52,620
- Why?
- So Min.

1797
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:54,970
Because she's sitting next
to me and Woo Jae?

1798
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:58,560
So Min must be really happy
with her team today.

1799
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,470
I thought So Min...

1800
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:02,580
What's wrong with you, So Min?

1801
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,040
It's so fascinating.
I don't get why you're so happy...

1802
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:07,720
because they're not
doing anything for you.

1803
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,310
- But you are...
- She doesn't need all that.

1804
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:10,850
So Min doesn't mind it.

1805
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:12,080
I was wondering
why she seemed so happy.

1806
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,660
So Min doesn't mind that at all.

1807
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,950
As long as she's satisfied,

1808
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:16,290
- she's all good.
- She's just happy.

1809
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:17,930
Why don't you guys fight over me?

1810
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:18,930
- Over you?
- Yes.

1811
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,450
You want them to fight over you?

1812
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:21,850
Try to steal my heart.

1813
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,990
Woo Jae doesn't seem
interested at all.

1814
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,930
- Rather than that...
- Why would you want us to fight?

1815
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:27,640
- "Rather than that?"
- It's something I'm bad at.

1816
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,560
You mean stealing a woman's heart?

1817
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,060
You can do it.

1818
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:33,410
What was that?

1819
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:34,910
What are you doing?

1820
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:36,240
She said he could do it.

1821
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,540
- Woo Jae...
- I was watching the show,

1822
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:42,350
and there was a comment
I could totally relate to.

1823
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:44,040
- Which one is it?
- It's what you said.

1824
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,660
- Which one is it?
- You called her cheesy.

1825
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,260
(You called her cheesy.)

1826
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,560
You said you've never seen
anyone like this.

1827
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,760
- There are two people.
- Exactly.

1828
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,290
There are two people I say that to.

1829
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,830
Her being cheesy is her charm.

1830
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:56,260
- It is.
- It suits her.

1831
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,430
The thing is, So Min likes him
not because of his looks...

1832
00:59:58,430 --> 00:59:59,600
- but because of his wit.
- That's right.

1833
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,540
- I like guys who are humorous.
- That's right.

1834
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:02,700
And he's really funny.

1835
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,160
- Woo Jae is indeed cool,
- He's a good talker.

1836
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,010
but it's not like
he's amazingly cool.

1837
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:10,740
He's not that cool.

1838
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,370
- But he's really charming.
- He's not that cool.

1839
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:15,020
I wasn't known for my looks...

1840
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,720
among the models.

1841
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,390
- Then were you known for your wit?
- But...

1842
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:20,290
- you're the best-looking one here.
- That's true.

1843
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:21,390
- Well, that's...
- Right?

1844
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:22,720
- I won't deny that.
- You're the best-looking one.

1845
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,560
- He won't deny it?
- He said he wouldn't deny it.

1846
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,060
You know how we have
many guests, right?

1847
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,260
But I'm not that envious
of your looks.

1848
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,830
(I'm not that envious
of your looks.)

1849
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:33,270
You're not that cool.

1850
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:34,640
We have a lot of guests,

1851
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,830
- but you're not that cool.
- When Woo Jae...

1852
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,430
When Woo Jae walks by,

1853
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,140
it doesn't turn my head.
You're not that handsome.

1854
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,080
- You know it yourself.
- I'm not envious at all.

1855
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,310
- Your looks...
- It's not because of your looks.

1856
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:45,540
When you first drew the curtains,

1857
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,850
I just went,
"He's wearing a designer label."

1858
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,850
- That's all.
- "Nice jacket."

1859
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:50,950
- I went, "Nice jacket."
- "It's Gucci."

1860
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:52,540
- That's all.
- That's all.

1861
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:55,660
Isn't there something going on
with you and Sae Ho?

1862
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:56,930
You guys have something going on?

1863
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:58,660
- With who?
- What do you mean?

1864
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,850
- Irene and Sae Ho?
- There's nothing? I thought...

1865
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:02,350
But we're really close.

1866
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:04,290
- She's the type Sae Ho likes.
- So we hang out too.

1867
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:05,720
- Really?
- For real?

1868
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,100
- We ate together too.
- She's the type he really likes.

1869
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,240
- Why?
- Did you two eat alone?

1870
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,240
No, I wouldn't do that.

1871
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,470
- Then was Chang Hee there?
- Don't get me wrong!

1872
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:14,140
(Adamant)

1873
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,770
No. It's not like that.

1874
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:17,950
- Are you offended?
- It's not like that.

1875
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:20,370
- We have many mutuals.
- What do you mean?

1876
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:23,540
- Mutual friends.
- We have many mutual friends.

1877
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:24,850
I thought she said "Musical."

1878
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:26,040
I heard it
as "Village Survival, the Eight,"

1879
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,490
- the show.
- "Village Survival, the Eight."

1880
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,930
It's not every day
that we meet people...

1881
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:33,830
- in the fashion industry.
- They rarely visit variety shows.

1882
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:36,100
Is Woo Jae popular among models?

1883
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,220
I am not sure.

1884
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,700
(I am not sure.)

1885
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,390
- She said it with seriousness.
- Today,

1886
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:41,890
Woo Jae is getting attacked a lot.

1887
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,140
- I see that Hae Na can't lie.
- Isn't he popular?

1888
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,740
- He isn't someone...
- Seriously.

1889
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,600
who gets talked about much.

1890
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,700
My goodness.

1891
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:51,580
He isn't popular
in the fashion industry.

1892
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:53,410
- He is popular in other industries.
- That's the worse.

1893
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,640
- Hey.
- Seriously.

1894
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,850
- It's like that.
- You are an intellectual.

1895
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:58,640
- They can't rate themselves.
- I said it as it is.

1896
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,490
An economy major sure is different.

1897
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:02,620
Do junior models talk about
Woo Jae and go,

1898
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,850
"He is pretty nice?"

1899
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,120
He doesn't get mentioned much.

1900
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,200
I see.

1901
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,790
Who gets mentioned?

1902
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:12,470
The male model
who gets mentioned a lot...

1903
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:14,040
is Nam Joo Hyuk.

1904
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:16,540
- I see. Joo Hyuk.
- You know who he is.

1905
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,330
I am jealous of him.

1906
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:21,100
Another one is Jang Ki Yong.

1907
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,970
- Jang Ki Yong.
- He is popular these days.

1908
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,040
When they mentioned Jang Ki Yong,
I realized what it's like.

1909
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,120
- Nam Joo Hyuk too.
- Seriously.

1910
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,350
Fortunately, I am unbothered...

1911
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:31,240
because I know
that they are on another level.

1912
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:33,410
It's not like...

1913
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:35,180
such words hurt my feelings.

1914
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,520
- He is confident.
- I see.

1915
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,020
In the modeling industry, he is...

1916
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,990
- the only one who works that way.
- No one else is like him.

1917
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,260
He is the only one.

1918
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,370
- He works steadily.
- His boyfriend-like photos...

1919
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:44,470
- are famous.
- He is witty.

1920
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,620
- He is charming.
- You know,

1921
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:47,830
- there is that.
- The boyfriend-like photos.

1922
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:50,310
His boyfriend-like photos
are famous.

1923
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:51,470
What are those?

1924
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:52,830
- The boyfriend-like photos.
- Someone's actual boyfriend.

1925
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:54,870
He dresses like
someone's actual boyfriend.

1926
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,470
- The boyfriend look.
- Yes.

1927
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:58,100
- Are those what he is famous for?
- It means...

1928
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,120
that he looks like a non-celebrity.

1929
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:02,080
Hyun Yi.

1930
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,390
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

1931
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:04,490
- Stop it.
- Hyun Yi.

1932
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:05,720
- Stop it.
- We were talking among ourselves.

1933
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,720
- All of us could hear you.
- Do you know what Hyun Yi said?

1934
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,020
I went, "Woo Jae is famous
for his boyfriend-like photos."

1935
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,350
She went, "It means..."

1936
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,490
"that he looks like someone
you would meet in real life."

1937
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:17,520
- I see. She has a point.
- He isn't like Jang Ki Yong.

1938
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,600
- Someone you could seduce.
- That's right.

1939
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,740
Someone you would see
around universities.

1940
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:22,770
- That's right.
- Like an actual boyfriend.

1941
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:23,930
So people think,

1942
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:26,270
"If I make up my mind,"

1943
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:29,040
- "I might be able to seduce him."
- That's right.

1944
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,100
All right.

1945
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,270
Fine. Good.

1946
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:32,470
All right.

1947
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,580
With my charms,
I target a niche market.

1948
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:35,640
- That's right.
- Of course.

1949
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,310
- Do you accept it then?
- I'm so happy about it.

1950
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:38,740
- It's a good thing.
- He said he is happy.

1951
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,620
- Are you happy?
- During an interview...

1952
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,180
For goodness' sake.

1953
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:43,930
I am sorry,
but why are you showing teeth?

1954
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:45,350
(I am sorry,
but why are you showing teeth?)

1955
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,700
(He gets annoyed
upon seeing Jae Suk's teeth.)

1956
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,060
His mouth was closed, but...

1957
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:50,160
His teeth are always showing.

1958
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,270
That's how it is.

1959
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:52,930
- You are being sensitive.
- Really?

1960
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:54,160
You are being sensitive.

1961
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,470
- I...
- You are being sensitive.

1962
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:57,510
- Woo Jae, you are being sensitive.
- Hey.

1963
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:59,660
You must have sneered at him.

1964
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:01,140
- Jae Suk's teeth...
- Why did you sneer at him?

1965
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,540
are always showing.

1966
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:04,510
His mouth was closed,
but one tooth was clearly visible.

1967
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,240
- Hey.
- That's how it is.

1968
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,310
- That's how it is.
- He is being sensitive.

1969
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,370
- That's how it is.
- He is being sensitive.

1970
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,080
- That's how it is.
- Woo Jae, you are being sensitive.

1971
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:14,260
That happens
when he is feeling good.

1972
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,490
- Yes.
- That's right.

1973
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:17,120
This time,

1974
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:20,560
we will play a game
so many viewers requested.

1975
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:21,620
What is it?

1976
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,990
It's the Yang Se Chan Game.

1977
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,600
That game.

1978
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,930
- We haven't played it in a while.
- I know.

1979
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:27,390
- It's a fun game.
- It's named after me.

1980
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:28,540
Your identity is on your forehead.

1981
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:34,810
(It involves guessing the identity
of the person on the hat.)

1982
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:40,680
(Wrong and funny answers
made the game popular.)

1983
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:46,890
(Sharp questions are needed
to guess the person's identity!)

1984
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:49,390
There will be four rounds.

1985
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:50,850
We came up with a list of matches.

1986
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:54,220
In Round One, Jae Suk,
Woo Jae, and Haha will go.

1987
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:57,020
It's a war between the stars.

1988
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:58,200
My team will win.

1989
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,620
- I will show you.
- Woo Jae.

1990
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:01,270
Let's go.

1991
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:02,700
Let's win.

1992
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,140
If the game
doesn't involve using my body...

1993
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,240
You are good at it, right?

1994
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,470
I rule.

1995
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:11,040
(Haha's keyword is Kim Yeon Koung.)

1996
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,100
What is he going to do?

1997
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:14,040
- Jae Suk's identity is hard.
- Okay.

1998
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:15,470
Okay.

1999
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:17,810
- Is mine easy?
- It's easy.

2000
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:20,180
Everyone's identity is easy.

2001
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:21,720
But it will be hard to explain.

2002
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,930
- You checked everyone's identity.
- I will get it right quickly.

2003
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:24,930
It's funny.

2004
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:26,490
I won't be funny in this round.

2005
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:27,830
- I will get it right quickly.
- Okay.

2006
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:29,100
Show us your skills.

2007
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,620
- Okay. I will show you.
- Watch.

2008
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:33,290
Which question...

2009
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,700
- should I ask?
- It can be confusing for newbies.

2010
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,310
- You need to be experienced.
- Don't be flustered.

2011
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:38,700
Don't be flustered, Woo Jae.

2012
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,700
Just don't be flustered.

2013
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,540
- Hey.
- Let's hear your first question.

2014
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:44,080
Both of them are clumsy.

2015
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:45,910
- We don't need time to think.
- They are clumsy.

2016
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:47,020
Let's begin right away.

2017
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:48,680
Is this person...

2018
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,450
from the past or present?

2019
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:54,020
He is pretending to be sharp.

2020
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,260
He is pretending to be sharp.

2021
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,620
He is pretending to be sharp.

2022
01:05:58,620 --> 01:05:59,680
(He gets caught
trying to play a detective.)

2023
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,560
Is this person
from the past or present?

2024
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,100
That person was born in the past
and is living in the present.

2025
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,470
- That person is alive.
- What?

2026
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:06,470
That person is alive.

2027
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:07,790
- Is this person alive?
- Yes.

2028
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:09,390
- Really? Okay.
- Yes.

2029
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:11,100
- That's right.
- Okay.

2030
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,430
Then this person must be old.

2031
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:13,870
- Can I ask a question?
- Yes.

2032
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:15,600
"This person must be old."

2033
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:17,180
Is this person a man or a woman?

2034
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,810
(Joo Woo Jae, Donald Trump)

2035
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,310
That's sharp.

2036
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,720
(Well...)

2037
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,450
(Well...)

2038
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:26,580
Come on.

2039
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:27,990
(You guys are too much.)

2040
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:29,290
That's just wrong.

2041
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:30,350
- It's hard to say.
- What?

2042
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:32,020
- It's hard to say.
- What's the matter?

2043
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,290
Don't you know the answer?

2044
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:34,520
- Come on.
- Don't do that.

2045
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,060
- What's the matter?
- It's hard to say.

2046
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:37,560
- What's the matter?
- Don't you know the answer?

2047
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,160
- You are too much.
- Hold on.

2048
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,270
Listen.

2049
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:43,240
It was a sudden question.

2050
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:46,140
- Give him the answer.
- It takes time to answer.

2051
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,080
- I can't believe it.
- That person is...

2052
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,910
- I can't believe them.
- Why are you hesitating?

2053
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:51,950
It's a person.

2054
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,770
- We can tell him this much.
- Yes.

2055
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:55,080
- A man.
- That's right.

2056
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,180
That's right.

2057
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,490
- Okay.
- It's basic information.

2058
01:06:57,490 --> 01:06:59,220
- I heard that he is a man.
- Yes.

2059
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:01,060
Is this person a man or a woman?

2060
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:03,350
(Haha, Kim Yeon Koung)

2061
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:06,060
(Well...)

2062
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,160
Unbelievable.

2063
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,490
- Do you know?
- They are too much.

2064
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:10,890
Come on.

2065
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:12,720
- It's the first question.
- Okay.

2066
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,240
- Let's answer truthfully.
- Tell me this much.

2067
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,490
- Tell him this much.
- She is...

2068
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:17,040
- a woman.
- A woman?

2069
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:20,040
- I see. She must be a woman.
- Okay.

2070
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,700
Let me ask you this right away.

2071
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,100
What does this person wear?

2072
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,740
Hold on. You should have asked
about the person's sex.

2073
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:29,410
Casual clothes.

2074
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:30,790
My goodness.

2075
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:32,350
- Casual clothes?
- Yes. Casual clothes.

2076
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:33,490
- Casual clothes?
- Yes.

2077
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,450
- You asked a stupid question.
- I think...

2078
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:38,060
this person often wears
formal clothes.

2079
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,290
This person wears
casual clothes too.

2080
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:41,350
This person's fashion style
is cosmopolitan.

2081
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,930
- Cosmopolitan?
- Yes.

2082
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:45,560
It's also nomadic.

2083
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,990
- Nomadic?
- Yes.

2084
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,390
I am sorry, but you should ask
a definite question.

2085
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:51,100
You should narrow things down.

2086
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,770
- For goodness' sake.
- You need answers...

2087
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:55,540
that narrow things down.
Your question wasn't very helpful.

2088
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,350
- Are you a player?
- No.

2089
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,040
- I am a meddler.
- I see.

2090
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,540
That's the person's style.

2091
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:01,740
Is that so? Okay.

2092
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,620
- Casual clothes.
- Yes.

2093
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,620
- He is pretending to be sharp.
- Is it my turn?

2094
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:06,680
- Yes.
- He is pretending to be sharp.

2095
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:08,990
Is this person Korean?

2096
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:10,080
(Joo Woo Jae, Donald Trump)

2097
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,390
(Pondering)

2098
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:13,580
- That's so funny.
- Don't you know?

2099
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,290
- Why are you hesitating?
- This is...

2100
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:16,700
- an essential step.
- It's so funny.

2101
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,220
- I need to take a breath first.
- It's an essential step.

2102
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,700
- It's an essential step.
- You are doing so well.

2103
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:21,870
- Do you really have to think?
- It's an essential step.

2104
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:23,290
You are being professional.

2105
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:25,510
- Is this person Korean?
- Do you really have to think?

2106
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:27,240
It's the global era,

2107
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,310
so nationalities aren't important.

2108
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:30,470
(Even his teammate is incredulous.)

2109
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:31,810
I agree.

2110
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:32,950
It's like that these days.

2111
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:35,640
Isn't it a childish question?
We are the world.

2112
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,240
- In any case...
- "A childish question."

2113
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:38,620
"We are the world."

2114
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:40,580
If you want to know...

2115
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:41,620
Just tell him.

2116
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,610
He isn't Korean.

2117
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:45,230
(Okay.)

2118
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:46,280
He isn't Korean.

2119
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,600
I will ask my question.

2120
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:49,190
Is this person Korean?

2121
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,320
My goodness.

2122
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:53,270
It's unclear, right?

2123
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:54,660
- Really?
- Right now,

2124
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,640
- she isn't in Korea.
- Is it unclear?

2125
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,530
- That's right.
- She isn't in Korea.

2126
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:01,180
Is she a Korean national?

2127
01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:02,530
She isn't in Korea right now.

2128
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:04,280
That's not what I asked.
Is she a Korean national?

2129
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:06,150
Didn't you hear me?
She isn't in Korea.

2130
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:08,070
I didn't ask you if she is in Korea.

2131
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,540
Is she a Korean national?

2132
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:11,480
- Is she?
- She isn't in Korea.

2133
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:13,040
(They endlessly say,
"She isn't in Korea.")

2134
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,220
- Woo Jae.
- I said the same thing.

2135
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:15,650
I didn't ask you...

2136
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:17,690
- if she is in Korea.
- Okay.

2137
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:18,780
Is she a Korean national?

2138
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,120
- You are in Korea, right?
- Yes.

2139
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,260
She isn't in Korea.

2140
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:22,260
That's not what I asked.

2141
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,490
I am Korean.

2142
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:25,160
- It's the same thing.
- I am Korean.

2143
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,490
- I know that.
- What's your nationality?

2144
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:27,900
- What? I am Korean.
- What's your nationality?

2145
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,270
- How about you? How about her?
- I am Korean.

2146
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:30,530
- We are in Korea.
- That's right.

2147
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:32,160
- She isn't in Korea.
- She isn't in Korea.

2148
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:34,780
- She isn't in Korea.
- Is this allowed?

2149
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:36,830
- It's the fact.
- She is a global person.

2150
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:40,740
- So she is Korean. All right.
- Okay.

2151
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:43,350
- A Korean woman.
- We can give him that much.

2152
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:45,040
I will ask a question.

2153
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:46,910
What is...

2154
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:48,890
this person's job?

2155
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,360
- It's really hard to say.
- I know.

2156
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,450
That question wasn't very sharp.

2157
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:54,650
Be quiet!

2158
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,060
Why did you sit behind me?

2159
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,430
- What?
- Seriously.

2160
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:01,330
Irene, stop him.

2161
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,100
For goodness' sake.

2162
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:06,230
Why is he so bad
at asking questions?

2163
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:07,330
Job.

2164
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:09,680
This person is a hero.

2165
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,850
- This person is a hero. It's true.
- A hero.

2166
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,370
This person is a hero.

2167
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:14,440
That was a good answer.

2168
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,520
I know.

2169
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,850
I will say this.

2170
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:18,650
"Along with the Gods."

2171
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,480
"Along with the Gods?"

2172
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,020
- A hero.
- "Along with the Gods."

2173
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,190
That's cool.

2174
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:24,430
- That's...
- "Along with the Gods."

2175
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:25,820
- That's true.
- I figured it out.

2176
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:27,290
- Really?
- I figured it out.

2177
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:28,530
- Who is it?
- I figured it out.

2178
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:30,060
That can't be right.

2179
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,100
I figured it out.

2180
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,600
Let me answer.

2181
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,730
(Let me answer.)

2182
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,990
(Person of the present day,
casual and formal clothes, hero)

2183
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:38,330
(What will be Jae Suk's answer?)

2184
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,570
Robert Downey Jr.

2185
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:40,830
(Robert Downey Jr.)

2186
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:43,530
(He guessed the person
to be Robert Downey Jr.)

2187
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:44,700
How did he get that?

2188
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,700
- How did you get that?
- How did he get that?

2189
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,940
- Robert Downey Jr.
- How?

2190
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,110
- Robert Downey Jr.
- How did you get that?

2191
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:50,280
Robert Downey Jr.

2192
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,410
He is our hero.

2193
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:53,480
- That's incorrect.
- Really?

2194
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:54,820
- You aren't even close.
- Jae Suk.

2195
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:56,890
- A hero in the widest sense.
- Really?

2196
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:58,530
Haha calls everyone a hero.

2197
01:10:58,530 --> 01:10:59,780
- Can I ask a question?
- Go ahead.

2198
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:01,490
- Woo Jae, let's go.
- How many characters?

2199
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,100
What do you mean?

2200
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,400
Well...

2201
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,860
- It depends on how you count.
- It depends on how you count.

2202
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:09,070
How many characters are in the name?

2203
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:10,330
It's hard to tell.

2204
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:12,700
I think the name has
5, 6, or 7 characters.

2205
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:15,780
- I think it has over 20 characters.
- That's right.

2206
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:17,400
- You could say that.
- Yes.

2207
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:19,400
You need to judge well, Woo Jae.

2208
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,440
That's right.

2209
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,110
I will get things started
in earnest now.

2210
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:27,760
I will ask a sharp question
about this person.

2211
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,820
Does this person appear on TV?

2212
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,060
Hae Na is quite startled.

2213
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:36,560
This person must appear on TV.

2214
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,530
- This person...
- I asked the right question.

2215
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:41,230
This person appears on TV.

2216
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:42,990
- Is that the case?
- This person appears on TV.

2217
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:44,440
This person appears on TV.

2218
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,330
This person must be
a TV personality.

2219
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:47,940
(Chuckling)

2220
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:51,350
We are at a disadvantage
because he is the master of games.

2221
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:52,400
(We are at a disadvantage.)

2222
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:55,020
- I think he is close to the answer.
- A TV personality.

2223
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,150
Hold on.

2224
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:59,150
Who was that person?

2225
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,610
- I can't remember the name.
- Who?

2226
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:01,860
Can't you remember the name?

2227
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,520
Didn't this person win a big award?

2228
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,950
- Can't you remember the name?
- No.

2229
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:08,120
Hold on.

2230
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:09,930
- Can't you?
- Hold on.

2231
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:12,320
- You know this person, right?
- I know this person.

2232
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:14,790
- But you can't remember the name.
- It's on the tip of my tongue.

2233
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:17,270
You know the person,
but you can't remember the name.

2234
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:18,440
Jae Suk figured it out.

2235
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,470
- You can't remember the name.
- Jae Suk figured it out.

2236
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,140
He figured it out quickly.

2237
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:24,110
- You know, right?
- My teacher.

2238
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:26,110
- You know.
- "My teacher."

2239
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:27,940
What's this person's job?

2240
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:31,390
- Now, he is taking a break.
- He is jobless.

2241
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:34,450
- That's right.
- Now, he is jobless.

2242
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:36,360
He isn't working.

2243
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,730
- That could be a hint.
- Let me answer.

2244
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:39,150
(Let me answer!)

2245
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:40,760
- A genius would get it right.
- Donald Trump.

2246
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:43,100
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

2247
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,120
(Woo Jae is correct.)

2248
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:46,930
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

2249
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:48,600
(Woo Jae got the answer
by asking 4 questions.)

2250
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,660
- You are a genius.
- I am good at using my brain.

2251
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:51,970
(The paper doll
finally showed his strength.)

2252
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:53,810
- That was incredible.
- You are a genius.

2253
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:56,780
He is a genius.

2254
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:58,850
He did an amazing job.

2255
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:00,940
That was incredible.

2256
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:02,280
- That was incredible.
- You should answer like that.

2257
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,610
Woo Jae is so annoying.

2258
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:04,820
He is smart and sexy.

2259
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:06,780
Does the second place get something?

2260
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:07,890
- Yes.
- Really?

2261
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:09,150
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

2262
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,980
So this person is a Korean woman
who isn't in Korea.

2263
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:13,560
Haha, ask a question.

2264
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,790
The only thing he knows is
that she is a Korean woman.

2265
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:17,620
- This person...
- Ask a sharp question.

2266
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:20,100
- Right now...
- What does this person wear?

2267
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,860
(Haha, Kim Yeon Koung)

2268
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:23,860
(Haha asks a sharp question
about what she wears.)

2269
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,310
What does she wear for her job?

2270
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,610
She wears something sporty.

2271
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:29,640
(She wears something sporty.)

2272
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:30,810
You gave that information.

2273
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,440
- You gave that information.
- That's good information.

2274
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,650
I am impressed.

2275
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:36,940
(Haha gained crucial information.)

2276
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:38,390
- Is it that person?
- Sporty.

2277
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,520
(Will he be able to figure it out?)

2278
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,080
Let me answer.
I really know the answer.

2279
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,360
I really know the answer.

2280
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:44,730
Kim Yeon Koung.

2281
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:45,820
(Kim Yeon Koung is correct.)

2282
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:47,030
- Sporty.
- Sporty.

2283
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:48,900
"Sporty" was crucial information.

2284
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,230
My goodness.

2285
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:51,360
Sporty.

2286
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,530
"Sporty" was crucial information.

2287
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:54,030
It's too bad
that you couldn't remember the name.

2288
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,490
I...

2289
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:57,470
(Na Kyung Eun)

2290
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:59,400
She is a hero. She really is.

2291
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,280
- How was I supposed to get this?
- She is a hero.

2292
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,440
- I said, "Along with the Gods."
- She is a hero.

2293
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:06,200
- I mean...
- All moms are heroes.

2294
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,940
- That's right.
- All moms are heroes.

2295
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:09,820
(Woo Jae took 1st place
and Haha took 2nd place.)

2296
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:10,940
For goodness' sake.

2297
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:13,780
- Thus, Jae Suk took third place.
- It was Kyung Eun.

2298
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:14,980
All right.

2299
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:17,480
In Round Two, Irene
So Min, and Haha will go.

2300
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,480
- Okay.
- You will go again.

2301
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,760
- It's a good one.
- Woo Jae was really good.

2302
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:22,930
I know.

2303
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:24,970
- I am curious.
- How will they get it right?

2304
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:26,990
- The first place...
- Is mine hard?

2305
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:29,030
- I think it's too hard.
- You can do well.

2306
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:30,360
She will never get it right.

2307
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,440
Seriously.

2308
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,700
- I think it will be hard...
- I will guess without looking.

2309
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:35,400
- for So Min.
- Will it be hard for me?

2310
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,610
She might not know who it is.

2311
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:38,310
What?

2312
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:39,370
(Jong Kook hasn't looked
at Irene's keyword, Kim Jong Kook.)

2313
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:40,540
I will guess without looking.

2314
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:41,980
It will be hard for So Min.

2315
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,940
I will give you
straightforward answers.

2316
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:46,280
Irene, do well.

2317
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:47,320
Okay.

2318
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:48,650
- You can do it.
- Ask a question.

2319
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,390
Is this person from the present day?

2320
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:51,390
Of course.

2321
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,690
That's right.

2322
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:55,150
- All right.
- They are cool about it.

2323
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:56,690
- All right.
- That's good.

2324
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:57,900
- Give each other some hints.
- That's right.

2325
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,030
That's right.

2326
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:02,030
Is this person a man or a woman?

2327
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:03,530
That's a good question.

2328
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:04,700
For goodness' sake.

2329
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,230
- A man.
- All right.

2330
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:07,230
- A man.
- A man.

2331
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:08,810
- Let's speed things up.
- Is he definitely a man?

2332
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:10,200
- He is definitely a man.
- Okay.

2333
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,650
Is this person a man or a woman?

2334
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:12,780
(Haha, Spider-Man)

2335
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:13,810
(Well...)

2336
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:15,520
(Haha, Spider-Man)

2337
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:17,110
(The sound of cheaters)

2338
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:18,410
Come on.

2339
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:20,220
- It's the first question.
- He is a man.

2340
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:21,890
- Is this person a man?
- He is a man.

2341
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:23,410
- Is this person a man?
- Yes. He is a man.

2342
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:24,820
He is a man. Okay.

2343
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,190
Is this person a man or a woman?

2344
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:28,290
- A man.
- A man?

2345
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:29,530
- Yes.
- He is a man.

2346
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:30,900
A man from the present day.

2347
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,270
- I like that this round is quick.
- A man from the present day.

2348
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,070
Is this person Korean?

2349
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:36,070
(So Min, Elon Musk)

2350
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:37,700
- No.
- No?

2351
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:38,900
She said no.

2352
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:39,970
No?

2353
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:42,440
- And that's the correct answer.
- I got confused for a second.

2354
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,870
- That's impossible.
- I got confused for a second.

2355
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:45,310
- Haha, answer the question.
- Look at Irene.

2356
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:46,570
She said he isn't Korean.

2357
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:47,780
- Is he Korean?
- She said he isn't Korean.

2358
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,350
- Why would you be confused?
- Why would you be confused?

2359
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,570
He is trying to confuse you.

2360
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:52,220
I just realized it now.
I am not confused.

2361
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:56,450
What's this person's job?

2362
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:57,730
His job?

2363
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:00,230
He studies.

2364
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:01,360
He studies?

2365
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,190
- That's right.
- He studies.

2366
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:04,790
- What's this person's job?
- I like how speedy this round is.

2367
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:06,530
- A civil worker.
- A civil worker?

2368
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:08,530
- It's true too.
- That's right.

2369
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,640
- It's true.
- He is a civil worker.

2370
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,270
He must be someone from the past.

2371
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:14,810
What's this person's main job?

2372
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:16,830
- That's a good job.
- The main job.

2373
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:17,900
- What does he do?
- The main job.

2374
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,040
The main job.

2375
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:20,980
He does many things.

2376
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:22,240
He has a variety of jobs.

2377
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:23,520
- Right?
- The main job.

2378
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:24,940
He runs a business.

2379
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:27,860
For goodness' sake.

2380
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:28,860
- But...
- It's true.

2381
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,060
- It's true.
- That's what I know of him.

2382
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,780
- For goodness' sake.
- "That's what I know of him."

2383
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:34,320
- That's what I know of him.
- Same here.

2384
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,120
In that case...

2385
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,570
(It's So Min's turn
to ask a question.)

2386
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:39,860
I will ask a basic question.
Is this person alive?

2387
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:41,160
(So Min, Elon Musk)

2388
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,730
- No. Is he alive?
- He is alive.

2389
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:44,440
Why did you say no?

2390
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,510
(He tried to give her
false information.)

2391
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:47,700
(Why did you say no?)

2392
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,510
- He is alive.
- What is your problem?

2393
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:50,980
- Is he alive?
- He is alive.

2394
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:52,980
- I am glad to hear that.
- Haha is too much.

2395
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,150
He is alive.

2396
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:55,650
- You play dirty.
- He is alive.

2397
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:58,350
Is this character a person?

2398
01:16:58,540 --> 01:16:59,610
Just now...

2399
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:01,150
- A character?
- A character?

2400
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:04,260
(Haha suddenly used the word,
"Character.")

2401
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:05,390
Yes, he is.

2402
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:06,530
- A person?
- Yes.

2403
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:07,820
- That's right.
- A person?

2404
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:08,950
- Yes, he is.
- He is a person.

2405
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:10,860
- Okay.
- That's right.

2406
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:11,990
- Irene.
- Irene.

2407
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:13,120
(Does Haha have a hunch?)

2408
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,140
Do you know this person?

2409
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:17,100
- Of course.
- I am really...

2410
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,570
- All of us know him.
- Is this person here?

2411
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:19,940
- What?
- You already asked...

2412
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:21,230
- Here?
- You already asked a question.

2413
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:24,650
(Irene's question
makes everyone flustered.)

2414
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:25,680
(Is Kim Jong Kook here?)

2415
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,180
Is this person here?

2416
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,440
- What?
- Well...

2417
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,740
Hey. Come on.

2418
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:32,980
Why aren't you telling her?

2419
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,410
Why aren't you telling her?

2420
01:17:35,410 --> 01:17:37,480
- Seriously.
- Tell her.

2421
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:38,690
Why aren't you telling her?

2422
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:40,620
- Why aren't you telling her?
- I think I know the answer.

2423
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:41,820
- Here.
- I think I know the answer.

2424
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:42,900
Is this person here?

2425
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,730
- I think I know the answer.
- He isn't here.

2426
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:46,030
He isn't here.

2427
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:48,230
- I think I know the answer.
- He isn't here.

2428
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:50,400
- That's right.
- Here?

2429
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,660
He isn't here.

2430
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:53,230
(They avoid the crisis by saying
that he isn't at the table.)

2431
01:17:53,230 --> 01:17:55,370
He might be outside of the table.

2432
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,570
- I think I know the answer.
- Irene.

2433
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,200
(Is it me?)

2434
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,040
(Yes!)

2435
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:03,180
Irene.

2436
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:05,980
- You are close.
- You are close.

2437
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:07,540
That was a sharp question.

2438
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:09,560
I figured it out
without looking at the answer.

2439
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,360
- You are close.
- Didn't you look at the answer?

2440
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,690
- I didn't look.
- Irene, they are flustered.

2441
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:14,150
- I got it right. Yes.
- Did you get it right?

2442
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:15,930
- Job.
- You made them flustered.

2443
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:17,190
Tell me about this person's job.

2444
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:19,400
- You asked them if he is here.
- Tell me about this person's job.

2445
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:20,790
- Job?
- Job?

2446
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:22,100
He runs a business.

2447
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,600
What business?

2448
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:24,940
Seriously.

2449
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:26,030
What business?

2450
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:27,530
- He runs a business.
- He is an entrepreneur.

2451
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:28,870
- An entrepreneur?
- That's it.

2452
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,230
- An entrepreneur.
- A foreigner.

2453
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:31,240
He is an entrepreneur.

2454
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,570
- Irene, you need to get it right.
- Okay.

2455
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:37,480
Is this person Korean?

2456
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,820
Does he have a Korean ID card?

2457
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:40,520
- No, he doesn't.
- No, he doesn't.

2458
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,950
He must be something like Pengsoo.

2459
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:44,430
(Haha figured out
that it's a character.)

2460
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:45,690
A man.

2461
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:48,030
- Irene.
- I will ask a question.

2462
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,790
The last question.

2463
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:51,790
Which color...

2464
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:53,770
(Irene, Kim Jong Kook)

2465
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:55,600
is this person wearing?

2466
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:57,730
- What?
- This person...

2467
01:18:57,730 --> 01:18:59,010
- Hey.
- This person...

2468
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:03,900
(Irene seems to know
that this person is here.)

2469
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:07,310
(This person...)

2470
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:08,480
Answer the question.

2471
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,520
(Team Tall is close to the answer.)

2472
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,720
- Answer the question.
- Answer the question.

2473
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,350
He is wearing black.

2474
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:14,360
No. His favorite color is brown.

2475
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,280
- He is wearing black.
- I didn't ask about that.

2476
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,150
- Which color is he wearing now?
- They don't know that.

2477
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:20,890
- He is wearing black.
- Black, I think.

2478
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:21,990
- Black.
- Yes.

2479
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:23,100
- Black.
- It's black.

2480
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:24,660
It's black.

2481
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:25,970
Black.

2482
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,100
He is wearing black.

2483
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,190
(Black?)

2484
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:29,570
(Irene checks the colors.)

2485
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:31,070
He is wearing black.

2486
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,510
Let me answer.

2487
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,480
Kim Jong Kook.

2488
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,510
(Kim Jong Kook is correct.)

2489
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:36,980
I knew it!

2490
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:40,700
(They failed to hide the answer.)

2491
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:43,040
- I thought it was you at first.
- Irene.

2492
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,070
Okay.

2493
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,440
Irene, how did you?

2494
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,650
- What?
- How did you know?

2495
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:47,910
I asked them if he is here.

2496
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:50,060
- She looked at my pants.
- I asked them if he is here.

2497
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:51,980
I realized it when I saw his pants.

2498
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:53,780
- You are sharp.
- Can I ask a question first?

2499
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:57,260
- Can I ask a question first?
- Yes.

2500
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:58,290
Make things certain.

2501
01:19:58,290 --> 01:20:00,820
Did this person make money by...

2502
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:02,160
- She knows.
- She knows.

2503
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:05,440
Did this person develop
an electric car?

2504
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,140
(So Min, Elon Musk)

2505
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:08,510
Hold on. Let's hear his answer.

2506
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:09,780
(He is in trouble.)

2507
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:13,850
(Not even a cheater
can dodge this bullet.)

2508
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:15,910
- Did he develop an electric car?
- Are you talking about Tesla?

2509
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:19,940
(That's exactly
what she is talking about.)

2510
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,110
Let me answer.

2511
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:22,480
- Elon Musk.
- Okay.

2512
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,890
(Elon Musk is correct.)

2513
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:26,230
- I got it right.
- You are second place.

2514
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:27,900
I could have done better.

2515
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,600
They said this person isn't Korean.

2516
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:34,320
In Round Three, Jong Kook,
Se Chan, and Hae Na will go.

2517
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,360
Okay.

2518
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,600
- I'm honored to go against Se Chan.
- Okay.

2519
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:39,230
I'm honored.

2520
01:20:39,230 --> 01:20:41,530
- I can win.
- This is the Yang Se Chan Game.

2521
01:20:41,530 --> 01:20:42,610
I'm honored.

2522
01:20:42,610 --> 01:20:43,610
Show us what you can do.

2523
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:44,680
It will be fun.

2524
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,870
We have to win this time.

2525
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:48,040
But I just can't explain...

2526
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,720
- the opponents' words.
- This is going to be okay.

2527
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:57,280
(Jong Kook's word:
General MacArthur)

2528
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,730
This is hard.

2529
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:00,430
- Do you know those people?
- It won't be half bad.

2530
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,140
- What?
- Do you know them?

2531
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:23,680
Do you know those people?

2532
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:24,980
- What?
- Do you know them?

2533
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,240
I'm not sure about one person.

2534
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:28,890
The one on Hae Na's head?

2535
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:29,920
Yes. The one on Hae Na's head.

2536
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,810
- Are you confused?
- That's good.

2537
01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:33,590
- All right.
- I haven't done this for a while.

2538
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:36,820
I did some research on this game.

2539
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:38,690
- You did? Like what?
- I'll ask sharp questions.

2540
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:40,130
- Do you have a plan?
- Yes.

2541
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:42,130
- Hae Na.
- All right.

2542
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:43,560
Hae Na goes first.

2543
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:46,770
What is this person good at?

2544
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:49,010
- My gosh.
- What is the person good at?

2545
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:52,180
(The first question
hits the bull's eye.)

2546
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,050
- That's sharp.
- She's good.

2547
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:56,900
Hae Na is clever.

2548
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:58,940
(You answer first.)

2549
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:00,380
- My gosh.
- You answer first.

2550
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:01,720
He doesn't know.

2551
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:02,810
You answer first.

2552
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:04,480
He doesn't seem to know this person.

2553
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,390
- Go ahead.
- He doesn't know.

2554
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:07,780
Is he good at cooking?

2555
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:08,820
(Is he good at cooking?)

2556
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:09,930
Well...

2557
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:12,600
He invented something.

2558
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,730
That's a big clue.

2559
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:14,990
My gosh.

2560
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:16,470
Why would you say that?

2561
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:18,360
- Why?
- Did you want to look smart?

2562
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,170
- I can't believe this.
- That's it.

2563
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:21,640
- I mean...
- That was sharp.

2564
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:22,810
- Hey.
- That's what it is.

2565
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:24,770
Did you want to look smart?

2566
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:25,980
- That's what it is.
- I know, right?

2567
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:27,480
Hey, how could you...

2568
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,440
- You shouldn't say that.
- You can't give...

2569
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,380
such a direct hint.

2570
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:34,020
I just don't know much.
That's all I know.

2571
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,050
Right.

2572
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:38,890
I think he drinks a lot.

2573
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:40,930
- Hey.
- What?

2574
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:42,630
I think he drinks a lot.

2575
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:44,560
- Excuse me.
- What?

2576
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,760
- Are you making guesses?
- No. It's true.

2577
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,990
- Are you serious?
- Yes. He drinks a lot.

2578
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:49,990
(He remembered a scene
from the movie, "Forbidden Dream.")

2579
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:51,340
He invented something,
and he drinks a lot?

2580
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:52,490
- Does he?
- Does he?

2581
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:55,670
Tell me about his age.
How old is he?

2582
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:58,100
- That's sharp.
- His age?

2583
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:00,570
He is older than you, Se Chan.

2584
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,350
He's older than me.

2585
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:04,180
I'd say he's a grandpa.

2586
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:05,810
- That's a big clue.
- He's old.

2587
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:07,270
A grandpa?

2588
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:09,980
You guys are
being generous. Hang on.

2589
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:12,180
All right. Is the person...

2590
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:14,760
older than me or younger than me?

2591
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:16,930
- What?
- His age.

2592
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:18,690
Older than you.

2593
01:23:18,690 --> 01:23:19,960
- He is?
- Yes.

2594
01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:21,600
Why are you hesitating?

2595
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,600
(Why are you hesitating?)

2596
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,190
- He hesitated.
- Wait.

2597
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:26,390
I was thinking of his photo.

2598
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:27,900
You answered
her question right away.

2599
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:31,640
It's not like that. I was thinking
of the photo I saw.

2600
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,930
- When I saw it...
- Does he look younger than me?

2601
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:35,480
I think he's about his age.

2602
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,980
I guess you two are
of a similar age.

2603
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:38,850
- I see. That's possible.
- A similar age.

2604
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:40,480
I think so.

2605
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,940
My turn?

2606
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:44,350
- Well...
- Hae Na, you ask good questions.

2607
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:45,980
- Really?
- She asks sharp questions.

2608
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:48,020
You're sharp. You're almost there.

2609
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:49,820
What did he invent?

2610
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:51,960
(Hae Na, Jang Yeong Sil)

2611
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:53,600
- This is new.
- This is it.

2612
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,560
- My gosh.
- She's really good.

2613
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,670
(It's a point-blank question
with no way out.)

2614
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,990
- Go ahead.
- I'll just say what I know.

2615
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:01,270
It might be a big hint.

2616
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:03,730
Okay. It will make you look cool.
It's a battle with yourself.

2617
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:05,980
He made a map.

2618
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:08,010
(He made a map.)

2619
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:10,570
(Did he make a map?)

2620
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:13,720
(He gave a wrong hint
without knowing.)

2621
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,810
- He made a map?
- Is that a big hint?

2622
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,420
Is that right?

2623
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:19,850
- I don't think it's correct.
- Hey, get out.

2624
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:21,890
(Embarrassed)

2625
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,190
- It's hilarious.
- It's done.

2626
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:26,230
- Now...
- That's all I know.

2627
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:27,770
- That's it.
- Jong Kook, that's what I know.

2628
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:29,130
- That's it.
- It's done.

2629
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,470
- It can't be helped.
- All right.

2630
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:31,490
It's done.

2631
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:33,430
- Isn't that correct?
- No.

2632
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:34,900
- Okay.
- That's what he thinks.

2633
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:37,100
- That's good though. Well done.
- All right.

2634
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:38,680
- It's my turn.
- Okay.

2635
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:41,680
- Ask a sharp question.
- Ask the question you prepared.

2636
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,070
- I did my research.
- This is Yang Se Chan Game.

2637
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:45,050
Everyone is flustered
by this question.

2638
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:46,980
What is his job?

2639
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:48,180
(Se Chan, Oh Il Nam)

2640
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:50,280
(It turns out the research
wasn't so profound.)

2641
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:51,390
We don't know.

2642
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:53,090
- What?
- We don't know his job.

2643
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:54,260
Why not?

2644
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:55,980
Because we don't.

2645
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:58,600
No. I think I know.

2646
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,820
He's unemployed.

2647
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:00,930
- Right.
- He is jobless?

2648
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:02,100
- He's jobless.
- Is he?

2649
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,230
- Yes, he is.
- This is getting tricky.

2650
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:04,970
There are a lot of jobless people.

2651
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:05,970
- A grandpa?
- Yes.

2652
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:07,840
A jobless grandpa?

2653
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:11,480
But I think he is a global star.

2654
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:13,180
What?

2655
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:14,350
A global star?

2656
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:16,550
- She told you everything.
- Se Chan, this is the easiest one.

2657
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:18,920
- This is the easiest one.
- You can answer it now.

2658
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,940
- You're almost there.
- You should know it by now.

2659
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:22,110
Think carefully.

2660
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:23,890
It's not a lie.

2661
01:25:23,890 --> 01:25:24,890
Right?

2662
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:26,220
I get it. Okay.

2663
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:28,090
- My gosh.
- I told you the truth.

2664
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:29,730
- I get it now.
- Se Chan knows it.

2665
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:31,020
Se Chan knows the answer.

2666
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:32,850
- Se Chan, give your answer.
- I get it.

2667
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:34,100
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2668
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:35,890
(Let me answer.)

2669
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:37,390
McDonald's Grandpa.

2670
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:40,560
(Incorrect)

2671
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,770
(He's completely wrong.)

2672
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:44,380
- Hey.
- No?

2673
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:47,010
- McDonald's doesn't have a grandpa.
- There's no McDonald's Grandpa.

2674
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:49,010
McDonald's doesn't have a grandpa.

2675
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:50,010
There's no grandpa.

2676
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:52,770
- Oh, right. It's KFC.
- It has a clown.

2677
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:54,180
Isn't that the grandpa?

2678
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:55,590
(Next week!)

2679
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:58,590
(Se Chan keeps
giving away big hints.)

2680
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:00,110
(Do you like her?)

2681
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:02,350
(And Round 4 continues.)

2682
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:04,390
(He makes 10,000 dollars a month
wearing jeogori?)

2683
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:05,460
It's obvious.

2684
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,690
(Is he more handsome than me?)

2685
01:26:07,690 --> 01:26:10,490
(The worst question ever
for Yang Se Chan Game)

2686
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:12,490
- He's more handsome.
- It's over.

2687
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:14,210
(They have no one to trust.)

2688
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:17,530
(The only thing they can
turn to is the shoe lift.)

2689
01:26:17,530 --> 01:26:19,880
- Irene. We have no choice.
- I know.

2690
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:23,380
(They fight for 1cm...)

2691
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:26,110
(having hand-to-hand combat.)

2692
01:26:26,110 --> 01:26:28,640
(They have
an intense cat-and-mouth game.)

2693
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,590
(Yesterday's enemy...)

2694
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:32,810
(is today's friend.)

2695
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:34,680
(Yesterday's friend...)

2696
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:36,480
(is today's enemy.)

2697
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:41,390
(Get rid of everything
that stunts your growth.)

2698
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:44,600
(They show real teamwork or just fake it.)

2699
01:26:45,190 --> 01:26:48,360
(Who will be at the top?)

2700
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,430
(And...)

2701
01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:52,180
(To celebrate 2022,
the Year of the Black Tiger,)

2702
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:54,680
(five tigers are coming.)

2703
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,550
(The Myth of Dangun
in the Year of the Black Tiger)
