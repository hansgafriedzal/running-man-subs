1
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,840
(The second mission is
Yang Se Chan Game.)

2
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,100
That game.

3
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,100
Donald Trump.

4
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,440
(Thanks to the paper doll,
Team Average gets 3 points.)

5
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,570
(Quick-witted Irene gets
her team 3 points.)

6
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,280
(McDonald's Grandpa?)

7
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,170
(Team Tall played well...)

8
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,250
(against Yang Se Chan
who's bad at Yang Se Chan Game.)

9
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,250
(How much does
this person make a year?)

10
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,720
(I guess over 100,000 dollars.)

11
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,090
(What does he wear?)

12
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,220
(Suk Jin, V)

13
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,820
(It's a man.)

14
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,130
(And he makes 10,000 dollars
a month wearing jeogori?)

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,160
(With all the indigestible clues,)

16
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,870
(Ji Hyo finds out
the answer is Pengsoo.)

17
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,090
(Ji Hyo becomes a genius
by answering Pengsoo.)

18
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,630
(Team Tall wins
the second mission again.)

19
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,660
(The members of Team Tall
get 3 coins each.)

20
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,810
(The members of Team Short
get 2 coins each.)

21
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,700
You should definitely buy
a block with your coins this time.

22
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,840
That's what I've done.

23
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,210
Sure. He's very tall.

24
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,480
You will take turns
to enter the voting booth...

25
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,120
and purchase either
a block or a shoe lift.

26
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,660
- Okay.
- My gosh.

27
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,760
It's a given.

28
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,980
He's right.

29
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,450
I'll go first.

30
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,460
All right. Go. I'll go too.

31
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,490
There's no need to hesitate.

32
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,600
(He said he didn't
even have to think about it.)

33
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,400
(Yoo Jae Suk of Team Tall, 2 blocks)

34
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,490
(1 shoe lift)

35
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,760
Well...

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,240
(Jong Kook who was bluffing
buys one more shoe lift.)

37
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,210
(Kim Jong Kook of Team Tall,
2 blocks, 1 shoe lift)

38
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,070
I'll be right back.

39
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,540
Remember that our team should win.

40
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,570
(Mr. Ji expects the paper doll
to be loyal to his team.)

41
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,650
(With his one precious coin,)

42
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,040
(he buys a shoe lift.)

43
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,180
I think we're going to lose.

44
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,020
I'm sure we'll be the last.

45
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,820
What's there to think about?

46
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,600
- There's no need to hesitate.
- I don't even have to choose.

47
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,760
There will be another chance for us.

48
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,960
- What is this?
- What's that?

49
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,930
- What's all this?
- There are cannons.

50
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,100
What is this for?

51
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,510
- Gosh, what is this?
- In the middle of the race?

52
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,160
- Is this for cream?
- It must be cream.

53
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,260
We don't usually do this
in the middle of a race.

54
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,740
- Isn't this for cream?
- Right.

55
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,540
- What did you say?
- I'm scared.

56
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,740
What does it spurt?

57
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,180
All right. This mission is...

58
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,740
a game where the team's life
depends on a member's hand.

59
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,260
It's called Thrilling Random Game,
Frightening Quiz.

60
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,350
Frightening Quiz?

61
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,520
Why would we have a quiz
contest with members like them?

62
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,360
- Haha, Hae Na is smart.
- We don't know that.

63
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,360
You still have hope.

64
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,460
Two teams will make
one team in each round.

65
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,020
- Two teams?
- The rest...

66
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,170
will sit in front of the canons.

67
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,490
(The rest will sit
in front of the cannons.)

68
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,870
So it will be a team
of 7 or 8 members.

69
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,470
You will take turns to say
one syllable of the answer.

70
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,840
(Each member will take turns
to give one syllable of the answer.)

71
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,340
That sounds difficult.

72
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,080
But for those who don't
know the answer,

73
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,490
we will give you
two chances to pass.

74
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,990
The next member will
continue giving the answer.

75
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,620
If you give the correct answer,
both teams will get one point each.

76
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,620
And this is what the other team does
when you give the correct answer.

77
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,300
One member presses buttons, and
the others sit in front of cannons.

78
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,490
They will pick a card
from number 1 to 6.

79
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,500
Let's say they pick a card
with number 1, 2, and 3.

80
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,580
The member standing here
will press a button.

81
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,470
The member with the chosen number
will get floured.

82
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,470
(They press a button every time
the opponents get a correct answer.)

83
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,080
So it's random.

84
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,440
I guess we all will get floured.

85
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,240
The team that gets floured
loses one point.

86
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,180
- Okay.
- These two teams go first.

87
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,750
- These two?
- Let's do that.

88
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,620
Then you should...

89
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,720
choose a member
to press the buttons.

90
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
I'll do it.

91
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,120
- I'll do it.
- Let me do it.

92
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,830
Haha is quite experienced.

93
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,770
You young punks, sit down.

94
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,170
You should be nice to the guests.

95
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,740
- I said I'd do it.
- Right.

96
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,460
- Haha is seasoned.
- He's an old fossil.

97
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,870
- He is an old fossil.
- He is an old fossil.

98
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,030
- Let's do that.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

100
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,240
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

101
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,370
(Win)

102
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,370
(Embarrassed)

103
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,500
Hae Na survived.

104
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,650
- Is it all right?
- Hae Na.

105
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,650
- Are you going to be okay?
- Sure.

106
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,250
All right. You will start
giving your answers from here.

107
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,360
- So are we a team?
- We're a team now.

108
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,750
- Us?
- Mix them up.

109
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,360
This team is perfect.

110
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,490
Right. You should mix us.
I want to see how good they are.

111
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,490
It's not perfect.

112
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,300
She's from abroad, and she graduated
from Ewha Womans University.

113
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,060
And his wife went
to Yonsei University.

114
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,190
- Hey.
- His wife?

115
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,670
My wife has nothing
to do with this game.

116
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,430
- I'm curious about her.
- Then Suk Jin and...

117
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,930
- What was your name?
- Se Chan.

118
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,650
- Se Chan.
- "What was your name?"

119
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,650
- Switch places.
- Okay.

120
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,440
All right. You two should
pick cards now.

121
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,050
And show your numbers
only to your opponents.

122
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,080
The number you pick is yours.

123
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,750
- We're not supposed to see it.
- Right.

124
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,810
Show your cards.

125
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,730
All right. That's Ji Hyo's number.

126
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,560
- Okay.
- Okay.

127
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,320
They will never give
a correct answer.

128
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,800
How would they get it right?

129
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,100
We will give five quizzes.

130
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,120
- All right.
- Okay.

131
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,190
The category of the first question
is common knowledge.

132
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,430
Listen to the question
and give one syllable of the answer.

133
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,470
- Okay.
- Sure.

134
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,240
- Common knowledge?
- It's like common sense.

135
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
- Common sense? I see.
- Let's go.

136
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,220
It's to congratulate
a woman who's about to marry.

137
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,720
It's a party that a bride has
with her friends. What is it?

138
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,990
(It's a party that a bride has
with her friends. What is it?)

139
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:45,450
(The answer is a bridal shower.)

140
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,660
(It's a party that a bride has
with her friends. What is it?)

141
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,170
- Three, two, one.
- Pass.

142
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,300
Bae.

143
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,670
- Pass.
- What?

144
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,670
(Bae?)

145
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,240
Bae.

146
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,130
- Bae?
- Bae?

147
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,740
- No.
- It's a baby shower.

148
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,630
- No, it's a brother shower.
- That's not it.

149
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,350
(It's a baby shower.
No, it's a brother shower.)

150
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,550
(It's wrong again.)

151
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,550
No. That's not it.

152
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,140
What is that?

153
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,080
- No.
- Is it a party?

154
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,080
- What's that?
- It's a brother shower.

155
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,560
- A brother shower.
- A brother shower?

156
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,060
- Bridal.
- Brother.

157
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,160
What is a brother shower?

158
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,950
You mean a bride.

159
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,730
- A bridal shower?
- Anyways.

160
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,930
- It's not brother.
- It starts with the same letter.

161
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,120
- It's bridal. Hey.
- Bridal.

162
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,760
- Bridal.
- So Min, you should go home.

163
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,260
- Come on, So Min.
- You should know that.

164
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,060
This is nice.
So Min, I love this game.

165
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,630
- This is really nice.
- You should know this.

166
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,540
- We should get this right.
- Do you want to switch seats?

167
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,010
All right. This time, you are
supposed to spell a word I say.

168
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,180
- Yes. Okay. It's good.
- Spell a word?

169
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,140
Spell the word I say in turn.

170
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,140
- Okay.
- The spellings.

171
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,660
- I'm nervous.
- All right.

172
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,620
- You can do this.
- Give the word.

173
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,990
Rainbow.

174
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,360
R.

175
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,660
(Spell rainbow.)

176
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,660
(R)

177
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,760
- Pass. I'm nervous.
- A.

178
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
- A.
- I'm so nervous.

179
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,370
- Pass.
- I.

180
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,690
N.

181
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,410
- B.
- O.

182
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,540
- W.
- Okay!

183
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,070
No.

184
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,070
(Haha makes a protest.)

185
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,180
It should go back to him.

186
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,110
- Of course, I know it's a W.
- It's Suk Jin's turn again.

187
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,180
- Do you not know it's a W?
- Should it go this way?

188
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,050
- Hang on.
- It was an A.

189
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,350
(Hang on.)

190
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,990
Let's talk about the pass.

191
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,990
Why would you pass?

192
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,560
- Don't do this to your friend.
- Rainbow?

193
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,720
We know how to spell rainbow.

194
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,360
- Is he serious?
- I know rainbow.

195
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,990
Don't make a joke now.

196
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,560
- It spells...
- We lost two times.

197
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,730
- Hey.
- They didn't know.

198
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,120
- We lost two times.
- They didn't know.

199
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,260
- It's not like that.
- We knew it.

200
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,760
I know rainbow. Just sit.

201
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,690
I just made use of the pass.

202
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,870
Woo Jae, you don't seem to know
much about your friends.

203
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,330
- You don't know.
- We knew it.

204
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,630
- It's not like that.
- We lost two games.

205
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,610
I was nervous,
so I didn't want to make a mistake.

206
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,500
- All right. Well done.
- I was afraid I might be wrong.

207
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,740
Since they got the second question right,
Hae Na will press a button.

208
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,940
Pick a number and press the button.

209
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,860
Okay. I'll pick...

210
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,930
(Will Hae Na be able
to avoid the penalty numbers?)

211
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,730
(Shutting their eyes tight)

212
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,730
- It's okay. It doesn't hurt.
- My goodness.

213
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,750
It will be all right.

214
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,160
- I'll press a button.
- Go ahead.

215
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,230
Press a button.

216
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,870
(She picks number 5.)

217
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,930
(They survived from the flour.)

218
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,310
(Fortunately, Hae Na managed
to avoid the penalty numbers.)

219
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,480
- They survived.
- Let's move on.

220
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,830
- Okay.
- Good.

221
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,370
I believe in Hae Na.

222
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,200
The next question is
about common knowledge.

223
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,850
(The next question is
about common knowledge.)

224
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,310
This is an industrial complex
in the northern part of the US...

225
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,990
where computer and software
products are developed. What is it?

226
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,290
(An industrial complex where computer
and software products are developed)

227
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,990
- It's impossible not to know this.
- What is it?

228
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,820
Three, two, one.

229
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,990
- You should know this.
- Mi...

230
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,300
- What?
- What?

231
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,820
(Mi...)

232
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,970
- What?
- What?

233
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,490
- It's Silicon Valley.
- Silicon Valley.

234
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,690
- I knew it.
- You should've passed.

235
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,930
What were you talking about?

236
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,830
- I thought it was Microsoft.
- Microsoft.

237
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,500
- That's what I thought.
- Silicon Valley.

238
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
I understand. You said software,
so I thought it was Microsoft.

239
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,040
You can just pass.

240
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,810
- Techno?
- You're unbelievable.

241
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,850
- Song Ji Hyo...
- What?

242
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,980
She said Techno Valley.

243
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,810
(Song Ji Hyo said Techno Valley.)

244
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,380
(When the answer,
"Silicon Valley" was announced...)

245
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,810
- Did you not know that?
- I didn't know.

246
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,080
I thought it was Techno Valley.

247
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,920
(I thought it was Techno Valley.)

248
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,680
(Ji Hyo loves Korea's IT industry.)

249
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,620
- She's a patriot.
- I'm glad it's not Techno Mart.

250
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,060
Techno?

251
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,370
Is this what you meant?

252
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,800
I'm glad she didn't say Techno Mart.

253
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,540
That's funny.

254
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,630
You meant Techno Valley in Korea.

255
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,130
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

256
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,870
- I like the questions.
- I don't know.

257
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,410
- I'll just go for it.
- We can do this.

258
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,070
- I'm not afraid.
- I like the questions.

259
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,340
The next question is
about common knowledge.

260
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,940
In 1894...

261
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,340
It's 1894.

262
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,680
What's the antitradition
and antiforeign movement...

263
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,810
started by Jeon Bong Jun,
a follower of Donghak?

264
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,160
You know it, right?

265
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,850
What's the antitradition
and antiforeign movement...

266
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,060
started by Jeon Bong Jun,
a follower of Donghak?

267
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,320
- You know it, right?
- Pass.

268
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,320
Pass. In case I give a wrong answer.

269
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,830
- Three, two, one.
- Dong.

270
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,690
Hak.

271
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,360
(Donghak)

272
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,680
- What?
- That's not it.

273
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,540
- Isn't it Farmers' Rebellion?
- That's...

274
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,440
- Isn't it Farmers' Rebellion?
- That's...

275
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,410
- Is it Farmers' Rebellion?
- Donghak Peasant Movement.

276
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,110
- Is it Donghak?
- It's right.

277
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,680
- So it was Donghak.
- Why did you not say anything?

278
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,080
- How can you not know Donghak?
- Seriously.

279
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,080
It's Donghak Peasant...

280
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,680
We said "Donghak."

281
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,260
- It's Donghak Peasant Movement.
- Why did you not say anything?

282
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,820
- Why didn't you say the answer.
- You should know this.

283
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,160
I was really...

284
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,900
I thought I was wrong.

285
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,630
- It's not like that.
- I just said "Hak."

286
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,270
- I didn't hear what he said.
- He said "Dong."

287
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,460
- So...
- I only heard you.

288
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,930
- I said "Hak.
- I said "Dong." Loud and clear.

289
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,270
So Round One is over.

290
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,430
(Round 1 ends
with the wrong answer.)

291
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,540
We didn't get floured.

292
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,330
This is great.

293
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,730
- They got only one question right.
- Okay.

294
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,970
All right.

295
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,410
They look just fine.

296
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,840
- Who will go next?
- I'll do this.

297
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,810
You know I'm good
at picking numbers. I'll do it.

298
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,110
- No, I'll press buttons.
- No.

299
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,020
- I'm really good at this.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

300
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,610
- No one is better than me.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

301
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,660
- I have a good hunch.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

302
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,160
No. I'll do it.

303
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,580
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Let me do this.

304
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,850
- No, play rock-paper-scissors.
- You should sit.

305
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,820
- You...
- I received eye surgery.

306
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,660
- So you should sit.
- But...

307
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,720
- You can wear goggles.
- He can do that.

308
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,770
Wait. Woo Jae...

309
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,300
Woo Jae just got eye surgery,
and they want him to sit here.

310
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,560
Okay. I'll wear goggles.

311
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,600
- He should.
- Wear goggles.

312
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,310
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

313
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,470
- Okay.
- Okay.

314
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,750
I'm the only one who lost.

315
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,440
- What's...
- Rock-paper-scissors

316
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,340
- What's...
- Rock-paper-scissors

317
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,610
Okay.

318
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,180
Donghak Peasants' Movement.

319
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,050
- It's Donghak Peasant Movement.
- What's that?

320
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,290
I just added an apostrophe.

321
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,560
All right.

322
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
- She's smart.
- Let's go.

323
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,130
So Min and Woo Jae, pick a card.

324
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,630
We're better than them.

325
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,930
Show your cards.

326
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,930
- This is it.
- Okay.

327
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,830
- All right.
- Don't show it to your team.

328
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,700
I already made up my mind.

329
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,200
It's our turn.

330
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,330
- Good luck.
- Let's do this.

331
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,180
- We can do this.
- Let's do this.

332
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,940
- I'll appreciate your help.
- We should get it right.

333
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,050
I'll appreciate your help.

334
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,110
You should think
that she's number one.

335
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,310
Why?

336
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,110
No, Dong Hoon. You can do this.

337
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,250
Okay. I'll give it a try.

338
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,660
- He's improved a lot.
- All right.

339
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,350
The first category is person.

340
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,630
(The first category is person.)

341
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,820
I'm good at this.

342
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,720
Haha, you look cool.

343
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,560
I'll show you a picture,
and you'll answer who it is.

344
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,630
Okay.

345
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,860
Here's the question.

346
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
- An.
- Gel.

347
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
- Ii.
- Na.

348
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,560
- Jol.
- Ie.

349
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,910
- Okay.
- Yes!

350
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,780
(The answer is Angelina Jolie.)

351
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,510
- That's too easy.
- That was an easy one.

352
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,570
It's too easy.

353
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,880
Angelina Jolie is too easy.

354
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,280
- This is going well.
- Nice.

355
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,440
- Good.
- Well done.

356
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,520
We're good.

357
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,790
Nice.

358
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,810
All right.

359
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,520
Se Chan, pick a number
and press the button.

360
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
I already made up my mind.

361
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,580
- I picked a number.
- Hey.

362
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,760
Be good.

363
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,480
You...

364
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,760
It's not about good or bad.

365
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,260
I just pick a number.

366
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,800
- I mean...
- Should I try hard to press it?

367
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,460
I should try hard.

368
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,300
Is this what you want?

369
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,460
What am I supposed to do?

370
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,700
(He responds
to Suk Jin's request playfully.)

371
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,830
That's not what I meant.

372
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,200
Is this what you want?

373
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,410
- What am I supposed to do?
- Okay.

374
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,510
- Good.
- Come here.

375
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,600
Are you getting smart with me?

376
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,280
No, it's not like that.

377
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,750
(An old fossil shows up.)

378
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,790
No, it's not like that.

379
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,180
- What's with you?
- What are you doing?

380
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,890
- What are you talking about?
- Why would I get smart with you?

381
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,180
It's not like that.

382
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,030
I just told him to be good.

383
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,560
- It's not about being good or bad.
- Seok Sam.

384
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,450
- You're being mean.
- Are you messing with me?

385
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,530
I'm not messing with you.

386
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,190
- I'm trying to be good.
- You're messing with me.

387
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,190
I'm just messing with you.
I'm trying to be good.

388
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,770
My goodness.

389
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,960
I'm warning you now.

390
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,090
If you don't do it right...

391
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,540
Why would you warn him?

392
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,670
Do you have
yellow cards or something?

393
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,180
- Do you?
- Why would you warn him?

394
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,930
- I thought we all have them.
- What?

395
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,150
- What's with him?
- Why are you upset?

396
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,420
- Why are you mad?
- We can give yellow cards.

397
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,970
- Hey, be good.
- I'll be good.

398
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,340
Pick a number and press the button.

399
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,610
I'll pick...

400
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,660
(Will he be able to avoid
the 3 penalty numbers out of 6?)

401
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,290
Number three.

402
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,220
(Number 3!)

403
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,860
Number three.

404
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,400
(Ji Seok Sam is chosen.)

405
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,560
Number three.

406
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,570
(The disciplinarian who gives
warnings gets floured.)

407
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,310
(It's a perfect didactic story
where the evil gets punished.)

408
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,310
It's perfect.

409
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,840
This is amazing.

410
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,570
(Surprised)

411
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,020
It was perfect, right?

412
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,110
It's perfect.

413
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,110
- It's perfect.
- This is amazing.

414
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,580
How could it be so perfect?

415
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,160
Can you believe this?

416
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,260
He's punished.

417
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,900
You're being punished.

418
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,950
Was I good?

419
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,260
Yes. You were perfect.

420
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,400
I was good, right?

421
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,270
- You just did as you were told.
- I did a good job.

422
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,830
Suk Jin, they say I did a good job.

423
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,590
Suk Jin, I did as you said.

424
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,140
It's the best.

425
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,310
- Gosh. He's the Honorary Employee.
- This is nice.

426
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,100
- That's unbelievable.
- Hey.

427
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,650
- Did you know my number?
- No, I didn't.

428
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,100
You told me to be good.

429
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,420
It's unbelievable
that you picked Suk Jin's number.

430
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,570
That was amazing.

431
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,290
Well done. Nice, Seok Sam.

432
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,680
The next question is
about common knowledge.

433
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,710
- Se Chan.
- Gosh.

434
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,020
(The next question is
about common knowledge.)

435
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,450
Due to an increase
in the amount of money,

436
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,660
- currency loses its value...
- You know it, right?

437
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,300
and the price of goods continually
increases. What is it called?

438
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,430
(Empty Head seems to know
the answer too.)

439
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,460
- All right.
- This is an easy one.

440
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,360
- You know it, right?
- If you don't, just say pass.

441
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,930
- Bu.
- What?

442
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,100
You should pass!

443
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,200
- You know it, right?
- If you don't, just say pass.

444
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,650
- Bu.
- What?

445
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,750
You should pass!

446
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,050
- What?
- Just say pass!

447
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,420
- It's...
- It's inflation.

448
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,610
- You should pass!
- He said I'd know it.

449
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,520
He doesn't know inflation.

450
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,660
- What did he say?
- He said, "You know it, right?"

451
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,680
He was going to say bubble.

452
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,760
He said "Bu."

453
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,260
- Bubble.
- Economic bubble?

454
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,590
- My goodness.
- Inflation.

455
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,690
(Their chance to win a point
is gone like bubbles.)

456
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,900
Seriously, let's do this.

457
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,220
- We just need one more point.
- We should get one question right.

458
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,560
The next question is
about common knowledge.

459
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,730
- Okay. Good.
- That's a tough one.

460
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,680
It was a gift from France
to the US back in 1886.

461
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,100
What's the statue located on
Liberty Island in New York Harbor?

462
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,280
- Three...
- The.

463
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,310
- Statue.
- Of.

464
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,710
- Lib.
- Erty.

465
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,020
Okay!

466
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,580
Great.

467
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,850
- Pick a number.
- We have good teamwork.

468
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,660
- Can I pick number three again?
- No.

469
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,060
(Can I pick number three again?)

470
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,180
(He's the number 3.)

471
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,680
- Suk Jin, I can't.
- Hey.

472
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,930
Can they switch seats?

473
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,350
- I just asked.
- Good.

474
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,060
It can't be numbers 2, 3, and 4.

475
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,770
And it can't be numbers 3, 4, and 5.

476
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,060
(Se Chan is
thinking carefully again.)

477
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,430
Now I feel at ease.

478
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,460
They must be really nervous.

479
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
I'll pick a number.

480
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,150
(What's Se Chan's choice?)

481
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,810
I pick number four.

482
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,110
(Number 4?)

483
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,950
(Joo Woo Jae is chosen.)

484
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,320
I can't believe this.

485
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,950
It's unbelievable.

486
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,350
(The Variety Show Deity is here!)

487
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,450
Hey.

488
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,530
How...

489
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,590
- Did you really not know that?
- Seriously?

490
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,800
I'm doing my best.

491
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,360
- It's like...
- This is amazing.

492
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,930
The flour...

493
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,960
I can't believe this.

494
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,640
That's unbelievable.

495
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,910
- I can't believe this.
- He's really good.

496
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,830
- You...
- He's really good.

497
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,180
- He's at a ski resort.
- It's a ski resort.

498
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,440
- He's at a ski resort.
- He's at a ski resort.

499
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,750
White snow is coming down

500
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,390
- She's right.
- It's like he is at a ski resort.

501
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,840
- He's at a ski resort.
- For sure.

502
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,850
How did he pick number four?

503
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,560
- This is crazy.
- That's unbelievable.

504
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,320
- Seriously, you're the best.
- How is it possible?

505
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,090
- You're the best.
- You really are.

506
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,350
- I didn't know.
- By the way,

507
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,090
they never won.

508
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,320
Is that because of me?

509
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,690
- We lost a point?
- We lost three games in a row?

510
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,230
- What will you do?
- All right.

511
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,360
- The last one.
- It's our turn.

512
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,670
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

513
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,880
- Rock-paper-scissors
- We won't do it anyway.

514
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,750
- Okay. Let's do this.
- Okay.

515
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,250
This is hilarious.

516
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,780
Jae Suk, where should we sit?

517
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,780
Do you want me...

518
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,150
to finish it early?

519
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,710
It's up to you.

520
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,080
Jae Suk.

521
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,810
- It doesn't matter.
- Let me be number two.

522
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,390
- Which one?
- Let me be number two.

523
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,930
- It doesn't matter where I sit.
- Number two?

524
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,060
So Min, you're number two.

525
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,500
- Thank you.
- I'll go first then.

526
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,820
- Okay. You're number one.
- Thank you.

527
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,000
Let's be strategic.

528
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,670
Ji Hyo is number three.

529
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,670
- Please, Jae Suk. Se Chan...
- She's the first one to answer.

530
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,460
Can I switch seats with Se Chan?

531
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,430
I'm relieved. I can say pass.

532
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,510
- Can I switch seats with Se Chan?
- Pass!

533
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,150
Pass!

534
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,600
- Pass.
- Pass.

535
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,710
(They rehearse saying pass.)

536
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,020
Pass. This isn't right.

537
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,150
Pass. Okay.

538
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,840
- Pass.
- All right then.

539
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,460
(The first two players have
no intention to give an answer.)

540
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,530
Let me switch seats
with Se Chan, Jae Suk.

541
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,920
(She begs Jae Suk
to switch her seat with Se Chan's.)

542
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,090
- Okay.
- Save her life.

543
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,230
All right then.

544
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,660
- Se Chan.
- Se Chan and Woo Jae are switched.

545
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,420
Why? I want to say pass.

546
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,500
Se Chan and Woo Jae are switched.

547
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,740
Do you switch these two?

548
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,940
I'll let you switch seats...

549
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,160
after each question.

550
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,660
- Thank you.
- All right.

551
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,130
We can do this.

552
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,170
- Don't give up.
- I'll give it a try.

553
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,100
- Of course.
- I'll do my very best.

554
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,450
- Now...
- We've got this.

555
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,750
- This is a team game.
- You should dust it off.

556
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,670
- Okay. Where?
- I'll do it for you.

557
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,080
- All right.
- Ouch.

558
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,490
(Ouch.)

559
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,720
(Se Chan hit his glasses.)

560
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,260
- I'm sorry, Suk Jin.
- He practically hit Suk Jin.

561
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,820
- I bet it was intentional.
- I was trying to dust it off.

562
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,500
- You just wanted to hit me.
- You got the wrong idea.

563
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,300
- Don't get him wrong.
- Okay. You're good to go.

564
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,030
- He was trying to help you.
- Yes, he was.

565
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,120
I didn't mean to hit your glasses.

566
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,660
- He's a good guy.
- Show your cards to the camera.

567
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,700
(Team Tall revealed their numbers.)

568
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,400
- Don't let him see it.
- That's interesting.

569
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,940
- I couldn't see the numbers.
- Right.

570
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,310
- It's amazing they picked those.
- Exactly.

571
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,940
- I couldn't see the numbers.
- You can put them down now.

572
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,510
- Put them down so he can't see.
- That's neat.

573
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,720
The category of the first question
is common knowledge.

574
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,910
- Okay. Good.
- I'd prefer common knowledge.

575
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,720
- I want you to call it differently.
- I hope it won't be difficult.

576
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,610
It's an advanced knowledge quiz.

577
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,260
- "Advanced?" Okay.
- Good. Let's call it that way.

578
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,690
I feel offended when you call it...

579
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,120
- common knowledge.
- Right.

580
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,730
- It's an advanced knowledge quiz.
- "Advanced knowledge."

581
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:10,300
What is the Chinese idiom
that means a man must keep...

582
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,500
his promises no matter what?

583
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,540
Nam.

584
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,860
Three, two, one.

585
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,010
Pass.

586
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,330
Pass.

587
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,470
(Both So Min and Ji Hyo
called pass.)

588
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,600
- Pass.
- A.

589
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,980
- A.
- Wait. Suk Jin...

590
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,250
- Il.
- Suk Jin told him the answer.

591
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,810
(Suk Jin got caught cheating.)

592
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,550
- Suk Jin told him the answer.
- He knew the answer anyway.

593
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,750
- Why would you do that?
- You shouldn't tell the answer.

594
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,840
Don't think we can't see you.

595
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,380
- Suk Jin, move to the end.
- Namaileon...

596
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,110
- It's unacceptable.
- I was supposed to say "Eon."

597
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,220
- Suk Jin, get up now.
- Never do that.

598
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,310
- I had no choice.
- Move to the end.

599
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,380
- I had no choice.
- Didn't you know the answer?

600
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,590
- Yes, I knew.
- You're not allowed to do so.

601
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,800
- Of course.
- What if...

602
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,030
(I apologize.)

603
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,730
- Trust me. I'll go first.
- He said, "I apologize."

604
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,590
- Suk Jin just said,
- Hey.

605
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,400
- "I apologize."
- You should know that idiom.

606
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,470
- Of course, I know that.
- I mean...

607
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,130
He wouldn't have apologized
if it hadn't been Bo Pil.

608
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,310
He said, "I apologize."

609
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,710
- Well, you know...
- He bowed deeply.

610
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,870
- Honestly, it was wrong of me.
- Yes, that's right.

611
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,750
- You two were right about that.
- Right. Never do that again.

612
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,840
- You ruined the fun.
- Let's move on.

613
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,910
The category is also
common knowledge.

614
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,080
- You mean, advanced knowledge.
- Right. It's advanced knowledge.

615
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,730
Let's get this one right.

616
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,150
What is the fruit that's a type
of green grape and that's popular...

617
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,420
- as it tastes similar to mangoes?
- They must know this one.

618
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,800
(It's easy.)

619
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,120
Three, two, one.

620
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,770
- Mus...
- Just call pass.

621
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,130
- It's shine muscat!
- It's shine muscat!

622
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,310
(It's shine muscat!)

623
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,740
- It's shine muscat!
- What's wrong with you?

624
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,240
- It's shine muscat.
- Don't you know shine muscat?

625
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,070
- Shine... seriously.
- Shine muscat.

626
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,780
- What's the point of being smart?
- Why were you so confident?

627
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,110
- Shine muscat!
- Shine muscat!

628
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,340
- Isn't the answer "shine muscat?"
- I'm so disappointed.

629
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,810
- Shine muscat!
- "How about shine muscat?"

630
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,460
(How about shine muscat?)

631
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,190
Didn't you know it started with S?

632
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,620
- Even those idiots knew that.
- Let's change your seats now.

633
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,150
- Let's change your seats.
- I'm sorry, but let me say a word.

634
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,560
We're all shocked because of
what he said on this show before.

635
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,000
- None of you knew the idiom.
- Hey!

636
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,330
- Only I knew the answer.
- Shine muscat...

637
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,510
- Shine muscat...
- It was an easy one.

638
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,240
- After I said the first syllable,
- Hey.

639
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,830
none of the next five of them knew
the second syllable of the idiom.

640
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,900
- None of them knew the idiom.
- Woo Jae, move to the end.

641
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,400
- Woo Jae, move to the end.
- Woo Jae.

642
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,550
(The empty heads beat
the smart guy.)

643
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,570
Hae Na, you go first.

644
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,690
- I remembered "mus."
- Yes, you did.

645
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,990
- I forgot "shine."
- He went blank suddenly.

646
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,190
- I'm not lying.
- Hey, listen.

647
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,190
We would've gotten it right
if you had called pass.

648
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,580
- Right. You should've called pass.
- That was funny.

649
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,650
- We all knew the answer.
- Sit down, everyone.

650
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,730
Woo Jae, move to the end.

651
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,620
- Gosh. Is he really smart?
- They didn't even know the idiom.

652
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,320
- Just sit down.
- I mean...

653
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,470
- Move already.
- Did he go to Hongik University?

654
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,100
That was unexpected.

655
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,900
Okay. Let's continue.

656
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,240
- This is so much fun.
- Let's go.

657
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,830
- Hae Na, let's do this.
- I'll call pass if it's English.

658
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,130
The next category is person.

659
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,710
- I'm not confident in it.
- It'll be easy.

660
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,570
- Let's go.
- Suk Jin, don't tell the answer.

661
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,870
- I won't. I promise.
- Never do that again.

662
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,020
Here's your question.

663
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,410
Pass.

664
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,810
- El.
- V.

665
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,020
- Is.
- P.

666
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,060
- Re.
- S.

667
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,030
- Ley.
- Good.

668
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,420
(Correct)

669
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,920
- I'm relieved.
- Great.

670
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,800
(Everyone is doing
Elvis Presley's dance.)

671
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,090
Suk Jin, that was good.

672
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,160
- We did well.
- We were amazing.

673
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,360
- Let's keep it up.
- Great.

674
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,540
- This is our team's true ability.
- That was good.

675
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,900
- Okay. Let's go. I'll pull it off.
- It's okay.

676
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
- Don't worry.
- Let's trust him.

677
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,570
- You can do it, right?
- He can do it.

678
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,810
- You can do it.
- Okay. I'll start right away.

679
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,900
I pick number one.

680
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,140
(He chose number 1.)

681
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,260
I pick number one.

682
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,540
One, two, three.

683
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,640
(And the number he picked is...)

684
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,880
It's party time!

685
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,670
- One, two, three.
- It's party time!

686
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,440
(Jong Kook is chosen.)

687
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
I'm sorry.

688
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,180
- He apologized to Jong Kook.
- Oh, no.

689
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,410
- I'm sorry, Jong Kook.
- That was good enough for me.

690
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,620
- I didn't know it was your number.
- I feel bad for him.

691
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,680
Hey, are you crying?

692
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,090
- I'm okay.
- Why did you pick number one?

693
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,890
How come you picked number one?

694
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,950
- How come you pressed that number?
- We were amazing.

695
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,020
Can you please give me a chance
to redeem myself?

696
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,330
Woo Jae, you go first.

697
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,760
We'll be okay
as long as we're not in the last.

698
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,870
- Right.
- We can do this.

699
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,960
The category is person.

700
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,930
- I like this category.
- Good luck.

701
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,930
- Here's your question.
- It's difficult for me.

702
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,380
- It must be easy.
- Show the picture.

703
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,410
Go.

704
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,610
- Pass.
- Ke.

705
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,500
(Ke)

706
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,770
- Pass.
- Oh, my.

707
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,510
- V... I mean, S.
- My gosh.

708
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,350
- It's Keanu Reeves.
- Oh, right.

709
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,480
- You don't know Keanu Reeves?
- Hey.

710
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,890
(The correct answer is
Keanu Reeves.)

711
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,450
- It's Keanu Reeves.
- Oh, right.

712
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,420
- You don't know Keanu Reeves?
- Hey, it's Keanu Reeves.

713
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,090
- You don't know Keanu Reeves?
- I don't know...

714
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,220
- why I said it.
- He said, "Ke."

715
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,860
- Hey, Hae Na.
- I knew his name, but...

716
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,300
- Oh, Keanu Reeves.
- Hey, Hae Na...

717
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
- I didn't know Hae Na would do it.
- Hae Na helped us.

718
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,960
- Why did you call pass?
- I got flustered.

719
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,690
- So I just called pass.
- Hey, Woo Jae.

720
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,370
- You don't know Keanu Reeves?
- "The Matrix."

721
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,110
I went blank again as I did before,
so I just called pass.

722
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,230
If you hadn't called pass,
we would likely have made it...

723
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,610
- because Haha knew the answer.
- Yes, I knew the answer.

724
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:44,170
I know shine muscat
and Keanu Reeves.

725
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,240
- Yes? Okay.
- Suk Jin, you go first this time.

726
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,680
- I'll do that.
- I know Elvis Presley too.

727
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,620
- Seriously.
- Go on. Cheer yourselves up.

728
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,060
- We've got this.
- Let's do this.

729
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,860
- We can do this.
- I almost remembered it.

730
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,720
Why don't you do the wave
starting with Suk Jin?

731
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,990
- Okay. Here we go.
- Don't give up.

732
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,490
- If we just start off well...
- Let's go.

733
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,720
(The wave begins.)

734
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,490
- You guys got up at the same time.
- You should do it consecutively.

735
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,490
Start over again.

736
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,460
But why must we do this?
I'm running out of energy.

737
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,460
To boost your morale.

738
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,930
- To improve teamwork.
- Okay.

739
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,540
- Great.
- We've got this.

740
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,840
(They're all obedient.)

741
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,440
- That's good. Right.
- You should sit down right away.

742
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,350
- Right after you stand up. Okay.
- Honestly, we're not in the mood.

743
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,580
Think about our situation.

744
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,650
- Still, you should do this.
- We feel hopeless right now.

745
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,480
- Why?
- You gathered these three idiots.

746
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,920
- This isn't fair.
- How are we supposed to do this?

747
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,220
- What are you talking about?
- Haha.

748
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,660
- I knew shine muscat.
- We all knew shine muscat.

749
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,990
- Who doesn't know shine muscat?
- Exactly.

750
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,490
- It's just...
- Who doesn't?

751
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,190
- We all know that much.
- We knew Keanu Reeves too.

752
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,070
What kind of idiot doesn't know
Keanu Reeves?

753
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,810
- Hey, sit down.
- Nobody can be that stupid.

754
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,340
(Tired)

755
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,230
Haha, we all knew shine muscat.

756
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,310
Let's continue.

757
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,650
This time, you have to spell
an English word.

758
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,820
- We can do this.
- This is your last question.

759
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,820
Here's your question.

760
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,680
- Spell the word "earth."
- What is it?

761
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,890
- This is...
- Pass.

762
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,390
- Pass.
- Pass.

763
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,390
E! It's "earth!"

764
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,020
(The 3 of them called pass
in the row.)

765
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,920
- My gosh.
- E, A, R, T, H.

766
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,020
I was taken aback. That's why.

767
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,460
- I was taken aback.
- Come on.

768
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,040
- Sir, please.
- We were taken aback.

769
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,260
- The 1st 3 of us were...
- The earth is getting warmer.

770
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,340
- Why "earth?"
- It's "earth."

771
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,140
- Hey! E, A, R, T, H.
- Come on.

772
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,000
Which is worse? Not knowing how
to spell "earth" or "shine muscat?"

773
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I thought you knew.

774
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,010
- Which is worse?
- We were all taken aback.

775
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,210
I was so surprised.

776
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,290
- One of you should've known.
- Which is worse? Shine muscat?

777
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,980
- Or earth?
- Get lost.

778
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,410
- Hey.
- Get lost.

779
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,090
- I was just taken aback.
- Is "earth" a difficult word?

780
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,490
I was taken aback. That's all.

781
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,020
- "Us?" "Earl?"
- "Earth."

782
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,100
- "Earth?"
- Yes.

783
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,400
- E, A, R, T, H.
- I was taken aback.

784
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,520
- I'll memorize it.
- I was flustered.

785
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,340
- I'll memorize the word.
- Okay.

786
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,700
- You were just taken aback, right?
- Yes, that's why.

787
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,040
- I was taken aback.
- That was shocking.

788
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,070
- I was really taken aback.
- I know.

789
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,230
- I thought you were playing soccer.
- "Pass."

790
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,200
- "Pass."
- "Pass."

791
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,470
They should be
as great as a Brazilian team.

792
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,770
- No one would shoot the ball.
- We'd keep passing it around.

793
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:02,010
- We'd never shoot the ball.
- We'd just pass it around.

794
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,820
I'll announce the winning team.

795
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,210
- Oh, boy.
- That was funny.

796
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,060
This team had a good chance to win
as they didn't lose many points.

797
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,920
- This team got four points.
- I guess it's not our team.

798
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,090
I bet it's Haha's team.

799
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,130
It's Team Short.

800
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,190
(Team Short will receive 3 coins
as the winning team.)

801
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,360
- Hae Na.
- We won?

802
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,690
- We won.
- Really?

803
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,420
- That team didn't do well.
- Oh, right.

804
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,140
- Team Tall came in second place.
- Okay.

805
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,340
- Okay.
- Team Average came in last...

806
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,500
with minus one point.

807
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,730
- It doesn't matter right now.
- You got one question right.

808
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,670
Now, go into your team's booth.

809
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,050
Yes.

810
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,670
- I'll go right away.
- Me too.

811
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,080
- I'll put in all my coins.
- We've never put in...

812
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,850
more than one coin until now.

813
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,120
Yes. I'll go right away.

814
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,980
(Starting with Haha
who ran into the booth...)

815
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,320
- Okay.
- Three coins, okay?

816
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,130
(Everyone has made a purchase.)

817
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:47,100
I'll explain about the last mission.
Please sit down.

818
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,100
We have the last mission.

819
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,930
- You never know how it might end.
- Right. It's not over yet.

820
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,570
As the saying goes,
you've been competing...

821
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,760
as if you were comparing
the size of acorns.

822
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,430
The last mission is Acorn War.

823
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,050
You have only 30 minutes.

824
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,440
You'll play Name Tag Elimination.

825
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,710
The first team to get eliminated
will come in last.

826
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,410
- Oh, boy.
- The last team to survive will win.

827
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,440
- I see.
- That's great.

828
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,390
However, you can't just tear off
others' name tags.

829
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,480
We hid a lot of acorns
in different places...

830
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,330
- in this building.
- Acorns?

831
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,920
- More than 100 acorns?
- Yes.

832
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,060
Collect five acorns and hand them in
to the staff in charge...

833
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,400
to get an elimination ticket
and reveal your target.

834
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,420
- I see.
- Really?

835
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,570
- Then you can eliminate the person.
- Okay.

836
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,660
Can't I tear off a name tag
without an elimination ticket?

837
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,470
Correct. You can't tear it off
without an elimination ticket.

838
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,380
But once that person starts
attacking you, you can defend.

839
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,440
Of course.

840
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,150
if you tear off his or her name tag,
the ticket becomes invalid.

841
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,410
Got it.

842
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,350
It won't be easy.

843
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,150
You need 5 acorns
to get 1 elimination ticket.

844
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,210
And you can get an open ticket
with 15 acorns.

845
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,590
Anyone can tear off
your target's name tag.

846
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,220
If you hand in 15 acorns.

847
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,560
I suppose you'll let us know.

848
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,920
Yes. If you hand in 15 acorns
and say your target is Jong Kook,

849
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,990
- everyone can eliminate him.
- "Kim Jong Kook."

850
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,140
- Everyone can attack that person?
- Yes.

851
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,460
- If you hand in 15 acorns.
- You'd become everyone's target.

852
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,970
Also, you can revive
your team member with 15 acorns.

853
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,650
- I can revive one person?
- Yes, one that's been eliminated.

854
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,410
- It's over when two teams are out.
- Got it.

855
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,150
- Now, please take your positions.
- Okay.

856
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,450
- Let's go.
- It's difficult.

857
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,680
- This is where we start?
- What should we do to win?

858
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,160
If we collect enough acorns,

859
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,900
- who should we eliminate first?
- Exactly.

860
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,690
Suk Jin.

861
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,130
- Why?
- I don't know.

862
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,490
- We don't have to eliminate him.
- He's not a threat.

863
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,430
Which team is in second place?
Shouldn't we attack that team?

864
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,340
- It's Team Short.
- Right, it's Team Short.

865
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,770
- We should eliminate that team.
- Then we should eliminate...

866
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,170
- Team Short.
- Okay.

867
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,670
- Do you think we'll be a target?
- Our team?

868
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,880
Yes. We have only three on our team.
They must think they can beat us.

869
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,940
- We should aim to win.
- Okay.

870
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,210
Since I'm not good at attacking,
I'll collect acorns.

871
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,450
- That's a good plan.
- I like the idea.

872
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,290
- Who would be good at it?
- Woo Jae.

873
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,020
- Woo Jae and I will do it.
- Woo Jae isn't so strong.

874
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,390
- But I have long arms and legs.
- That's right.

875
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,860
- Se Chan, are you confident?
- Let's win this...

876
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,660
Let's win this round
and turn the game around.

877
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,690
- Let's use all three coins.
- That'll be awesome.

878
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,570
- Let's win a dramatic victory.
- Let's just not be in the last.

879
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,370
- One, two, three. Let's go.
- Two, three. Let's go.

880
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,760
- Then we'll begin the race now.
- Okay.

881
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,110
- The race begins now.
- Okay.

882
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,430
We should find acorns.
Are they hidden in random places?

883
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,110
- We should eliminate Team Short.
- We should eliminate them quickly.

884
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,550
- Let's go.
- I'll go find acorns.

885
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,910
Let's split up and look for acorns.

886
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,050
Let's gather again later.

887
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,050
- Should we split up for now?
- Yes, let's split up.

888
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,090
- Let's find some acorns first.
- But I'm scared.

889
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,420
But it can be dangerous for her.
Wait. There must be some here.

890
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,450
I wonder what it looks like.
Hold on.

891
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,720
I'm pretty sure that some are hidden
in a place like this.

892
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,020
Are those acorns big or small?
Or average? Are they small?

893
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,040
(Acorns will play a big part
as Team Short is outnumbered.)

894
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,460
Are they in a box?

895
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,370
I don't see any in the lockers.

896
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,430
Let's collect five acorns
no matter what.

897
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,880
Okay.

898
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,240
Is this it? Oh, I found one.

899
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,270
- Really?
- Yes.

900
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,550
Can we find acorns
in a place like that?

901
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,740
(Se Chan found his 1st acorn.)

902
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,910
So Min, this is what it looks like.

903
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,650
- Did you find one? Is this it?
- Yes.

904
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,680
Let me take a look.

905
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,060
Give it to me.
I'll have to keep acorns anyway.

906
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,290
I've become good at finding
hidden items.

907
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,360
(The observant Ssaebssaeb keeps
the momentum.)

908
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,400
There it is.

909
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,100
Acorn

910
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,220
I'll find them before others do

911
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,960
(While Team Average found acorns
one after another...)

912
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:13,960
(Haha found an acorn too.)

913
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,000
Okay.

914
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,670
There's none here.

915
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,470
- Haha.
- Yes?

916
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,380
- It must be easier for you.
- Why?

917
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,880
You are like an acorn.

918
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,440
- My gosh.
- You're small like an acorn.

919
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,590
(He's looking for acorns as if
he were looking for his friends.)

920
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,350
How many acorns did you find?

921
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,320
- What about you?
- I found two.

922
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,660
I found one.

923
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Did you find any?

924
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,750
- No.
- Se Chan.

925
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,950
- Se Chan.
- We have five acorns now.

926
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,920
- Do we have five acorns?
- Se Chan.

927
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,570
- I found 2.
- That's 4.

928
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,990
- How many?
- Four.

929
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,690
We have five. Woo Jae,
get a ticket to eliminate Haha.

930
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,700
(Woo Jae, get a ticket to eliminate Haha.)

931
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,160
- Eliminate Haha.
- I don't think I can eliminate him.

932
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,170
- You can do it. Don't worry.
- Why don't you do it yourself?

933
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,410
- Hurry up.
- Go on. How many do you have?

934
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,500
- I have one.
- Give it to me.

935
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,050
Haha.

936
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,410
(Woo Jae purchased a ticket
to eliminate Haha.)

937
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,580
- Let's go.
- Let's tear off his name tag.

938
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,670
Let's go.

939
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,550
(Haha noticed
that something was going on.)

940
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,010
Gosh.

941
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,980
- Act natural. Don't let him know.
- Okay.

942
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,390
- I'll do it well.
- Good.

943
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,800
I'll lure Haha.

944
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:14,020
We should eliminate
the strong one first.

945
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,870
Okay. Great.
We're like Hansel and Gretel.

946
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,430
Look to your right. Where is Haha?

947
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,230
- Quiet down.
- He went that way.

948
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,230
- He went that way.
- Come with me.

949
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,460
We should be careful. He's tactful.

950
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,140
- He'll figure it out.
- Haha went that way. Come with me.

951
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,110
(So Haha barely lost Team Average.)

952
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,670
You must have found a lot of acorns.

953
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,350
I haven't found any yet.
Did you find any acorns?

954
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,940
Gosh, no. I didn't see any.

955
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,320
This is too difficult.

956
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,680
Why is it so hard to find acorns?

957
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,860
- Indeed. I couldn't find any.
- Exactly.

958
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,120
- Gosh. You startled me.
- What's going on?

959
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,160
- You're not trying to do it, right?
- I couldn't find any.

960
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,860
(As famous scaredy-cats,
they both got scared.)

961
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,450
(You're not trying to do it, right?)

962
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,690
(He got startled and is chuckling.)

963
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,930
Jae Suk, we haven't found...

964
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,340
- I'm still looking too.
- enough acorns yet. Hey.

965
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,610
- We...
- They all must be here.

966
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,970
What are you guys doing here?

967
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,880
(The tigers who are after Haha
are here.)

968
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,500
It begins already?

969
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,150
- Hey.
- How many acorns did you find?

970
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,440
We couldn't find any acorns.

971
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,510
I haven't found enough acorns yet.

972
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,010
- What does an acorn look like?
- I found only two.

973
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,010
(Se Chan and Woo Jae go in
right away.)

974
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,980
Have I been in this room before?
They all look the same.

975
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,890
What's going on?
Do you have enough acorns?

976
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,130
(Haha figured it out.)

977
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,130
Let's run away.

978
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,690
Gosh. That scared me.
Why did they suddenly come up here?

979
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,840
I have no idea.

980
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,540
- They're acting weird.
- What are they doing?

981
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,570
- Jae Suk, give me just one acorn.
- I don't have any.

982
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,930
- Woo Jae is trying to eliminate me.
- I don't have any either.

983
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:31,930
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

984
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,640
- What's going on?
- He's trying to eliminate me.

985
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,650
What's going on?

986
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,650
Woo Jae, wait.

987
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,200
- No. It's not what you're thinking.
- What?

988
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,210
- Woo Jae.
- No. I'm not trying to do anything.

989
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,740
- Don't get me wrong.
- Why are you approaching me?

990
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,480
Why are you here? Are you after me?

991
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,290
- No.
- Then what...

992
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,420
I was just wondering
what you guys were doing.

993
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,860
(But...)

994
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,690
(Jae Suk attacks him!)

995
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,920
- I'm not attacking you.
- Hey.

996
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
(Jae Suk attacks him!)

997
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,070
Five.

998
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,960
(Jae Suk collected 5 acorns
3 minutes before he met Haha.)

999
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,070
I'll eliminate Haha.

1000
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,070
(He chose Haha from Team Short.)

1001
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,070
Here you go.

1002
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:05,470
(Jae Suk's sudden attack)

1003
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,000
- I'm not attacking you.
- Hey.

1004
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,940
(Jae Suk is holding Haha down.)

1005
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,120
(And here comes Woo Jae
who's also after Haha.)

1006
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,390
(Haha is everyone's target.)

1007
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,290
Is it me again? Wait.

1008
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,180
Gosh. Me? Is it me again? Wait.

1009
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,860
He's out.

1010
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,830
(Woo Jae successfully eliminated
1 person.)

1011
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,660
- He's out.
- He's out?

1012
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,400
- Okay. Great job.
- I did it.

1013
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,990
- Gosh.
- Are you okay?

1014
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,340
(The elimination ticket
Jae Suk bought is invalid now.)

1015
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,430
What a shame.

1016
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,410
Haha is out.

1017
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,050
Both of them were after me.

1018
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:46,170
Haha is out.

1019
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,290
Gosh, that fool.

1020
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,480
- We got one.
- We have to collect acorns again.

1021
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,950
- Who should we eliminate this time?
- That's easy.

1022
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,660
- Who...
- We'd better eliminate a weak one.

1023
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,560
- Who should we eliminate?
- Then let's eliminate Irene first.

1024
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,420
- Wait.
- I'll just check where she went.

1025
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,920
Okay. The more we eliminate,
the better our chances are.

1026
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,570
Where is Suk Jin?

1027
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,660
(Meanwhile, Suk Jin...)

1028
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,730
I just need one more acorn.

1029
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,140
We should eliminate Jong Kook first.

1030
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,500
(Surprisingly, Suk Jin is
targeting Jong Kook.)

1031
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,140
There must be one in this room.

1032
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,050
Here's one. Okay. Good.
I have enough acorns now.

1033
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,820
Two, four, and five.
Who should I eliminate?

1034
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,440
Would you like to purchase
an elimination ticket?

1035
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,390
Of course, I'll get one.

1036
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,160
- I'll eliminate Irene.
- Irene?

1037
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,830
Irene... Hold on.
Who else is on her team?

1038
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,300
Irene, Hyun Yi, Jae Suk,
and Jong Kook.

1039
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,430
I'll eliminate Irene.
I've made up my mind.

1040
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:45,810
- Okay. You chose Irene.
- Yes.

1041
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,270
I wanted to choose
Jong Kook or Jae Suk.

1042
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,580
Where is she?

1043
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,010
- I don't see any acorns.
- Gosh.

1044
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,860
We should keep looking.

1045
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,210
Don't go too far.

1046
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,750
What? Oh, hey, Irene.

1047
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,160
(Se Chan found Irene
who was hiding in the room.)

1048
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:05,890
What are you doing here?

1049
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,690
How many acorns do you have?
I'll let you go if you give me three.

1050
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,790
I have two.

1051
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:14,230
Give me just one of them,
and I won't say your name.

1052
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,370
- Just 1?
- Yes, give me just 1.

1053
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,670
If you don't,
I'll find five acorns quickly,

1054
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,600
and tear off your name tag.

1055
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,140
(Thug Woo Jae is running around.)

1056
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,140
I found another one.

1057
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,140
(Thug Woo Jae is running around.)

1058
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,920
- In 3, 2...
- Give me 1, and I won't attack you.

1059
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
I give you one?

1060
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,190
- I won't attack you.
- Okay. Deal.

1061
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,420
- Will you give me one?
- No, you should give me yours.

1062
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,960
No. Give me one of your acorns.

1063
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,120
Why would I give it to you?

1064
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,520
It's because...

1065
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,460
I said I would eliminate you.

1066
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,870
Why would you do that?

1067
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,670
You're on another team.
I'll eliminate you.

1068
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,560
- But I won't if you give me one.
- You don't have to attack me.

1069
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,960
We'll just leave if you give me one.

1070
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,440
- Do you promise me?
- Yes, I promise you.

1071
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,170
- Or else, I'll tell on you.
- Okay. I promise.

1072
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,480
- You'd better keep your promise.
- I promise.

1073
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,750
- If you... Pinky promise. Sign it.
- I signed it.

1074
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,140
- Make copies.
- Done.

1075
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,920
- It's a promise.
- Okay.

1076
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,310
- Now, give me one acorn.
- Look at this.

1077
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,040
- It's a promise.
- Okay. I got one of your acorns.

1078
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
You promised me, okay?

1079
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,390
- Woo Jae, how many do you have?
- Four.

1080
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,420
I'll give you one.
You tear off her name tag.

1081
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,310
- Okay.
- Hey, you can't do that.

1082
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,420
(Woo Jae bought a ticket
to eliminate Irene.)

1083
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,420
(Hey, you can't do that.)

1084
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,850
You crook!

1085
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,020
- Irene.
- Irene.

1086
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,460
No!

1087
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,560
(I'll guard the back door.)

1088
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,600
- Hurry up and take care of her.
- She's not even fighting.

1089
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,420
- Hurry up and finish it up.
- It's done.

1090
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,060
He tore it off.

1091
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,060
(The naive Irene is out.)

1092
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,870
- Irene.
- I'm sorry.

1093
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,330
(I'm sorry.)

1094
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,370
I'm really sorry.

1095
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,730
You guys are so mean.

1096
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,640
- I'm sorry.
- This is Running Man.

1097
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,020
- Gosh. Seriously.
- This is Running Man.

1098
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,640
(I'm sorry.)

1099
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,440
Woo Jae, how many do you have left?

1100
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,250
Irene is out.

1101
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,330
This is quite scary.
It happened so quietly.

1102
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,290
I didn't even hear her scream.

1103
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,520
Darn it. Irene is out.

1104
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,940
I should join Jong Kook
to get things done. Where is he?

1105
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:55,060
(Meanwhile, the person who was
determined to eliminate Irene...)

1106
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,210
Then what happens?

1107
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,310
- Your ticket is invalid now.
- Can I choose another person...

1108
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,870
I can choose another person.

1109
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,500
Your elimination ticket is
invalid now. That's the rule.

1110
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,640
(Chuckling)

1111
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,100
I can't believe this. Darn.

1112
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,920
It was so hard for me to find these.

1113
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,580
I should find five more acorns?

1114
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,920
(He lost his elimination ticket
as he targeted the weak one.)

1115
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,640
This is driving me nuts.

1116
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,810
Ji Hyo is out.

1117
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,350
(Song Ji Hyo is out.)

1118
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,850
- We'll team up.
- Song Ji Hyo is out.

1119
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:18,160
(Ji Hyo is out?)

1120
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,190
Oh, no. This is bad!

1121
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,600
(Ji Hyo was alone
searching for acorns.)

1122
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,640
Who could it be?

1123
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,330
(The 86ers came together
to annihilate Team Short.)

1124
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,540
It's me! Hold on.

1125
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,980
- Is it really you?
- No, it's not.

1126
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
What on earth?

1127
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,080
(Woo Jae took her out
while Se Chan distracted her.)

1128
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,100
It was Woo Jae.

1129
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,850
(Ji Hyo was attacked
out of nowhere.)

1130
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,020
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

1131
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,170
But I had to do
at least something today.

1132
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,190
(He already eliminated 3.)

1133
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,190
Get lost, you jerk.

1134
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:46,580
(Thug Ji Hyo wasn't enough
to save her own life.)

1135
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,920
Oh, no. This is bad!

1136
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,420
Hae Na's in trouble.

1137
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,920
Hae Na's...

1138
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,790
the only one left on the team.

1139
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,830
I only need to find one more.

1140
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,460
Just one more.

1141
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,540
(She secretly searches
for more acorns.)

1142
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,140
I found it.

1143
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,560
I found one more.

1144
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,640
Here. Who do I give these to?

1145
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,810
(She has 5 and is looking
to buy an elimination ticket.)

1146
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:08,850
Me?

1147
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,310
Should I collect more or hide?

1148
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,620
Maybe I should
just take someone out.

1149
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,620
Hyun Yi.

1150
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,480
I'll take Hyun Yi out.

1151
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,020
(Hae Na buys an elimination ticket
that targets Hyun Yi.)

1152
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,350
I need to find Hyun Yi.

1153
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,480
(She targets Hyun Yi in secret.)

1154
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,730
Where are the acorns?

1155
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,750
Oh, there's one.

1156
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,190
(Stealthily)

1157
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,520
I need to eliminate Woo Jae.

1158
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,390
I need to eliminate Woo Jae.

1159
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,100
- Hey, Hae Na.
- My gosh.

1160
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,170
Are you alone?

1161
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,310
Who are you trying to eliminate?

1162
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,670
Are you all right?

1163
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,580
(Her target Hyun Yi
appears in front of her.)

1164
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,730
Are you all right?

1165
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:41,810
Did you find any acorns?

1166
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,370
(Hyun Yi goes after
Hae Na first though.)

1167
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,540
I'll hold her for you.

1168
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,750
(Hyun Yi goes after
Hae Na first though.)

1169
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,920
(A sneak attack)

1170
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,390
Rip her name tag off.

1171
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:02,120
(The tall ladies battle it out
while screaming.)

1172
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,120
Here.

1173
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,390
(The tall ladies battle it out
while screaming.)

1174
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,540
(Ripping off)

1175
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,600
My gosh!

1176
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,270
(She tore off the name tag!)

1177
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,370
(Not long ago,)

1178
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,870
(Jong Kook and Hyun Yi
saw Haha get eliminated.)

1179
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,370
- They're...
- Let them be.

1180
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,640
We should get to safety for a while.

1181
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,020
Suk Jin.

1182
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,620
That's five.

1183
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,890
I found five.

1184
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,120
Hae Na.

1185
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,580
(She bought an elimination ticket
that could take Hae Na out.)

1186
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,660
Here are five.

1187
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,560
(They wanted to annihilate
Team Short first.)

1188
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,290
(The last hope of Team Short
is eliminated.)

1189
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,620
- Sorry, Hae Na.
- Hae Na is out.

1190
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,790
- Hae Na is out.
- I almost got your name tag.

1191
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,870
I would've lost if I were alone.

1192
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,000
- I can't see anyone.
- Ji Hyo's been eliminated.

1193
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,040
- Here.
- Look.

1194
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,040
Here. I have more.

1195
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,230
Why are you so good
at finding these?

1196
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,080
We only need one more.

1197
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,100
(The trio boldly targets Jong Kook.)

1198
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,980
- We'll target Jong Kook.
- Is there one?

1199
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,250
- Here.
- I knew it.

1200
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,350
- Good. We have five.
- Let's do it.

1201
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,850
- Suk Jin...
- Here we go.

1202
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,690
- Did you eliminate them all?
- They must all be here.

1203
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,120
Anyone could still win.

1204
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,250
Jong Kook,

1205
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,790
we should stick together.

1206
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,980
Get up here, guys.

1207
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,560
(Get up here, guys.)

1208
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,390
I want to rip off
someone's name tag.

1209
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,460
Why didn't I think of Se Chan?

1210
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,620
Hold on.

1211
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,620
- Why didn't I think of Se Chan?
- Hey. Woo Jae.

1212
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,230
Jong Kook, look.

1213
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,940
I'm going to buy
an elimination ticket.

1214
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,370
Who should it be? Jae Suk?

1215
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,000
- Should I target Jong Kook?
- We'll come for you.

1216
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,040
(Only Jae Suk
can take Woo Jae out.)

1217
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,600
Just know
you only have one chance with me.

1218
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,670
I can fight back
once you lay a hand on me.

1219
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,770
Me too.

1220
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:23,850
I'll come after you too.

1221
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,210
I have enough.
Who should we go after first?

1222
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,810
Spare me two.

1223
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,390
He wants two more
which means he's ready to fight.

1224
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,920
(Jae Suk's trying to buy a ticket
with the acorns from Hyun Yi.)

1225
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,060
- All right.
- You can...

1226
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,120
I'll buy a ticket for Se Chan.

1227
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,920
- Do it.
- Good one.

1228
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,390
- Okay, Se Chan.
- Hold on.

1229
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,390
- Me?
- Yes.

1230
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,060
- Go after him too.
- I'll target Jae Suk too.

1231
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,560
We're not allowed to intervene.

1232
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,690
We can pin down their targets.

1233
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,190
- Can we do that?
- Of course.

1234
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,000
- I know.
- Go after Jae Suk.

1235
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,390
We are almost done.

1236
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,500
- Go after Jae Suk.
- Take the other side.

1237
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,170
- What about our team?
- I'm going after Jae Suk.

1238
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,210
Just Jae Suk.

1239
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,410
How about a 1 on 1?

1240
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,540
- You're dead today.
- I'll come straight for you.

1241
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,480
- Be careful though.
- We should grab Se Chan.

1242
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,710
Grab him.

1243
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,210
I must be their target!

1244
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,520
- Jong Kook's after me.
- No, wait.

1245
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,210
Jong Kook's after me.

1246
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,520
He's out.

1247
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,750
(Ji Suk Jin is out.)

1248
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,460
I was their target.

1249
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,620
You!

1250
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,520
- Ji Suk Jin is out.
- It was me all along.

1251
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,000
Ji Suk Jin is out.

1252
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,520
I was their target.

1253
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,170
- Over here!
- Grab him.

1254
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,190
Get him.

1255
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,690
Let go of me.

1256
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:21,730
Jae Suk.

1257
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,370
Hurry!

1258
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,410
Go after Jae Suk.

1259
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,540
(The 86ers are desperate.)

1260
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,600
Hyun Yi's so strong.

1261
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,670
Go after Jae Suk.

1262
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,350
(While Hyun Yi blocks Se Chan...)

1263
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,580
Hyun Yi, grab him for a second.

1264
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,520
No!

1265
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,520
(But Jae Suk shows his back.)

1266
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,190
I got it.

1267
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,660
Watch out!

1268
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,790
I got Jae Suk.

1269
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,520
- Jae Suk is out.
- He's been eliminated.

1270
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,890
- Jae Suk is out.
- He got me.

1271
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,730
Were you eliminated?

1272
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:49,890
I'm out of the game.

1273
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,270
Yoo Jae Suk is out.

1274
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,690
(Se Chan went after him
when he showed his back.)

1275
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,940
I should've been a part
of that dynamic takedown.

1276
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,730
He got me from behind.

1277
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,270
For now, we should fall back.

1278
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,250
Jae Suk, gosh.

1279
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,870
(They fall back for now.)

1280
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:06,850
- Did you see me just now?
- I...

1281
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,850
- Hyun Yi...
- Did you see it?

1282
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,390
Did you film me
holding Jong Kook by the collar?

1283
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,310
- I held him like this.
- I bet it wasn't intimidating.

1284
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,390
No, I held him like so.

1285
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:16,460
- Really?
- Like that.

1286
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,560
- Do you have that on camera?
- Are you good?

1287
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,600
I want it aired
as one of the best scenes.

1288
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,690
Make sure music is played
in the background...

1289
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,960
and play it in slow motion.

1290
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,100
Se Chan was there.

1291
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,670
We should stick together.

1292
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,890
(Team Tall stick together.)

1293
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,910
We should eliminate Se Chan.
Let's keep searching.

1294
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,770
Se Chan...

1295
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:34,330
Woo Jae and Se Chan.
There are two guys left.

1296
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,540
I know.

1297
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:36,910
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1298
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,370
How many do you have?

1299
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,770
- I have 2 or 3.
- I have 3.

1300
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,480
- Really?
- We should eliminate Se Chan.

1301
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,640
Se Chan?

1302
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,120
- Woo Jae...
- Take one of the guys out.

1303
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,420
- One of them needs to go.
- Okay.

1304
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,730
Yang Se Chan.

1305
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:49,850
(Jong Kook buys an elimination ticket
that targets Suk Jin.)

1306
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,060
We'll then go after Woo Jae.

1307
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,190
(He buys an elimination ticket
that targets Se Chan.)

1308
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,330
This one is for Woo Jae.

1309
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:55,890
Joo Woo Jae.

1310
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,520
Then... Let's see.

1311
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,540
Only So Min remains. Right?

1312
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,770
(They can go after everyone
if they get another ticket.)

1313
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:01,830
One for So Min.

1314
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,310
Jong Kook is now an open target.

1315
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:10,480
(Jong Kook is an open target?)

1316
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,580
They're coming.
I'm an open target now.

1317
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,810
- Let's run.
- Oh, no.

1318
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,210
(Team Tall makes a run for it.)

1319
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:17,710
- Let's go upstairs.
- We need...

1320
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,710
- to find Jong Kook fast.
- Hurry.

1321
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:20,710
(Team Average searches for him.)

1322
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:21,920
I have three.

1323
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,690
- How can we take Jong Kook out?
- We can't.

1324
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,790
With 15 acorns,
we can buy an open ticket.

1325
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:28,890
So anyone can eliminate him?

1326
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,190
We'll have to collect 15
and make Jong Kook an open target.

1327
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,100
One-on-one isn't an option.

1328
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,560
Let's collect 15 fast.

1329
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,040
Collect 15...

1330
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,940
- and make Jong Kook an open target.
- Okay.

1331
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:39,440
Okay.

1332
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,640
Here's one.

1333
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,080
We'll name our target.

1334
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,040
An open target.

1335
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,140
An open ticket.

1336
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,750
- Jong Kook as an open target.
- Here are 15 acorns.

1337
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,290
(They purchase an open ticket
that targets Jong Kook.)

1338
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,210
- And then...
- This is for Hyun Yi.

1339
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,250
Are they all targets now?

1340
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,580
- Who can we target?
- Both of them.

1341
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,290
- I'll go after Hyun Yi.
- Hyun Yi and Jong Kook.

1342
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,600
I'll go after Hyun Yi.

1343
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,060
Let's do this.

1344
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,170
I bet they're sticking together.

1345
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,440
- Here!
- Nice one.

1346
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,230
So Min.

1347
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,770
- Jeon So Min.
- We're all set.

1348
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:11,040
(Hyun Yi buys an elimination ticket
that targets So Min.)

1349
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,640
We can eliminate anyone now.

1350
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:15,600
Only Hyun Yi and Jong Kook remain,
right?

1351
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,640
Yes.

1352
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:19,120
He's an open target,
but only our team remains.

1353
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,350
- We can all go after him.
- It won't be easy though.

1354
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:22,750
- Right.
- It won't be easy.

1355
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,350
(Outnumbering him
doesn't always guarantee a win.)

1356
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,520
There's another one over there.

1357
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,190
- Let's bring Suk Jin back.
- How many do we need?

1358
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,390
- Fifteen.
- Right.

1359
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:34,100
- Let's do that.
- Let's bring him back.

1360
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,390
- Yes, let's bring him back.
- We'll resurrect him.

1361
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:38,460
Okay, let's collect 15 acorns.

1362
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,640
(They make an odd decision
to resurrect Suk Jin instead.)

1363
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,770
Four against two is better.

1364
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,060
- They can do the same though.
- And resurrect Jae Suk.

1365
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,810
- We need 15 acorns.
- Right.

1366
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,000
(They're hoping to use Suk Jin
as a shield.)

1367
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,440
I found one.

1368
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,910
(Project Old Man Resurrection)

1369
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,440
Here's one. I have five.

1370
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:54,540
We have 15.

1371
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,790
Okay, let's bring him back.

1372
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:56,890
We'll bring Suk Jin back.

1373
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:57,980
- A resurrection.
- A resurrection.

1374
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,390
- Suk Jin.
- We'll bring Suk Jin back.

1375
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,850
- That's 15.
- Right.

1376
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,390
- You're bringing Suk Jin back.
- Yes.

1377
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,730
- Where is he though?
- Maybe...

1378
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:06,460
- We'll bring Suk Jin back.
- Bring him back.

1379
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,500
Suk Jin has been
brought back into the game.

1380
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:11,830
He's back?

1381
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,040
Suk Jin's back.

1382
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,040
We should eliminate him again.

1383
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,670
- We need a ticket though.
- If we hurry...

1384
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:18,100
- You're right.
- We need one first.

1385
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,480
(They need an elimination ticket
for Suk Jin though.)

1386
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,170
- They find acorns so well.
- Darn acorns.

1387
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,600
They brought Suk Jin back.

1388
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:26,270
Once the four of us
eliminate Jong Kook,

1389
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,440
we can...

1390
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,440
win the entire race with all 12.

1391
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,890
How's that for a dramatic ending?

1392
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:33,920
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin!

1393
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:35,790
Thanks, guys.

1394
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:37,620
- Aren't we loyal?
- You're the best.

1395
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,500
Suk Jin, here's the deal.

1396
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,520
- You guys are the best.
- Suk Jin,

1397
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,370
we need to join forces
and eliminate Jong Kook.

1398
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:44,670
- Okay, got it.
- Can I give this to you?

1399
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,140
Sure thing.

1400
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,710
- Later...
- I saw Jong Kook just now...

1401
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,410
- on the seventh floor.
- Let's go then.

1402
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:52,600
They were moving away
on the seventh floor.

1403
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,580
- Away?
- We should head up this way.

1404
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,640
Sure thing.

1405
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,250
Suk Jin. You go ahead.

1406
00:46:58,750 --> 00:46:59,870
Suk Jin.

1407
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,520
Then we're all set.

1408
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:02,790
Suk Jin.

1409
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,290
Hold on.

1410
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,480
- How many do we need to resurrect?
- Fifteen.

1411
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:07,980
- We should collect more.
- If only we had collected them.

1412
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,160
- We'll bring Jae Suk back.
- That sounds good.

1413
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,690
Sure. It sounds better.

1414
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:13,230
- We can do this.
- It's a better plan.

1415
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:14,520
We can bring him back.

1416
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,920
(Team Tall aims
to bring Jae Suk back.)

1417
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,100
- That's one.
- Se Chan...

1418
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,290
We need to bring him back.

1419
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:22,100
We need to.

1420
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:24,810
Hurry. We have to find more acorns.

1421
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,640
Suk Jin, do whatever you can...

1422
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,480
- to stop Jong Kook.
- Got it.

1423
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,710
Muster up all your strength.

1424
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:32,040
I hear something.

1425
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:33,480
I can hear something.

1426
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,940
(I hear something from upstairs.)

1427
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,040
- I hear something.
- Hey.

1428
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,140
Let's go.

1429
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,980
(Commence attack.)

1430
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,080
Are they heading upstairs?

1431
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,230
(Team Tall must avoid them
until they bring Jae Suk back.)

1432
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,390
They're here.

1433
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:48,600
We have a total of ten.

1434
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,460
- We only need five more.
- Yes, five more.

1435
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,890
- Don't we have ten?
- Yes.

1436
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,460
Jae Suk,

1437
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,060
hold on tight.

1438
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,540
It won't be long.

1439
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,270
We'll bring you back.

1440
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,810
(Hold on. We'll bring you back.)

1441
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,100
There they are. Let's go.

1442
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,580
- Go.
- So Min.

1443
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:05,580
We need to withstand him.

1444
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:07,440
So Min, this way.

1445
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,790
- Do we go downstairs?
- Go.

1446
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:10,290
Hurry.

1447
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:13,390
(Team Tall frantically runs away
while Team Average gives chase.)

1448
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,020
They're going back up again.

1449
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,690
Wait a minute.

1450
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,730
- No way. Woo Jae.
- They're here!

1451
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,460
Guys!

1452
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,520
- They're good.
- Guys!

1453
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,960
Suk Jin! Se Chan!
Jong Kook is here!

1454
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,670
They're here! They headed upstairs.

1455
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,000
Se Chan, they're here!

1456
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,310
- They're here. They went upstairs.
- Where?

1457
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:32,600
I can't catch up with them.

1458
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,810
Hold on.

1459
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,250
Let me catch my breath.

1460
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,100
(Jong Kook and Hyun Yi
gave Team Average the slip.)

1461
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,370
That was close.

1462
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:39,480
We could've gotten So Min.

1463
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,640
We just walked past So Min,
didn't we?

1464
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,060
- That was really close.
- I was...

1465
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,480
I was afraid we'd be surrounded.

1466
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,980
(Jong Kook finds it regrettable that
they couldn't get rid of So Min.)

1467
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,520
I should've gotten rid of her.

1468
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,420
I couldn't decide what to do
in the heat of the moment.

1469
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,790
- Me neither.
- Hold on.

1470
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:55,460
We need two more.

1471
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,230
Two more.

1472
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:00,040
We just need one more.

1473
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,710
(Jong Kook found an acorn.)

1474
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:04,910
We just need one more acorn.

1475
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:07,440
Just one more.

1476
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:09,140
Just one more.

1477
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:11,540
- They're here.
- One, two, three, four...

1478
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,750
- They're here.
- I got it.

1479
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:13,850
Hold on.

1480
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,080
- We...
- I got it.

1481
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,850
(Right then, Team Average appears.)

1482
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:18,040
(The 4 members of Team Average
finally found the 2 of them.)

1483
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,560
- There they are.
- They're here.

1484
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,850
We can't get them.

1485
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:22,560
(They run after Jong Kook
and Hyun Yi in a weird way.)

1486
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,060
Go! Chase them until the end!

1487
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,330
(We can't lose them again!)

1488
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,000
Go!

1489
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:31,390
(A chase in the middle of the day
begins abruptly.)

1490
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:32,730
I almost got all the acorns
I needed.

1491
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,170
Here they are!

1492
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,600
- I almost gathered enough acorns.
- Join me!

1493
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,670
Chase them until the end!

1494
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:40,600
(They managed to capture Jong Kook.)

1495
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,040
- Join me!
- Grab Jong Kook.

1496
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,270
We must seize Jong Kook.

1497
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,140
(A face-to-face confrontation
between the two teams)

1498
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,750
(They work together to attack
Jong Kook who is an open target.)

1499
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,690
Hey, this won't do.

1500
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,120
Hold on.

1501
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,190
Gosh, this is really frustrating.

1502
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,290
- This won't work.
- Be careful.

1503
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,790
Let go of him.

1504
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:01,920
(Right then, the tall striker
subdued Se Chan.)

1505
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,920
I got him.

1506
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,890
- I got him.
- Grab it. That's great.

1507
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:07,870
- Hold on.
- I got him. It's all right.

1508
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,480
Se Chan, get Hyun Yi.

1509
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,670
- Get Hyun Yi, Se Chan.
- Se Chan!

1510
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:16,100
Se Chan!

1511
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,040
Jong Kook! My eyes!

1512
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,170
My gosh.

1513
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:22,390
(The fiery fist is in danger.)

1514
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,020
Hey. Woo Jae is out.

1515
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,750
Woo Jae is out.

1516
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:27,750
- Woo Jae...
- Great.

1517
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,060
Woo Jae is out. Watch out.

1518
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:30,480
(Joo Woo Jae is out.)

1519
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,690
Joo Woo Jae, out.

1520
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,850
I think Jong Kook's next target is me.

1521
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:34,920
(Jong Kook's next target is Se Chan,
his strongest rival.)

1522
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,330
- Jong Kook is after you.
- Hyun Yi, we can't...

1523
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:39,000
- We can't eliminate Suk Jin.
- Over here.

1524
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,600
- Here it is.
- We can't eliminate him anyway.

1525
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:43,000
Suk Jin, hold her.

1526
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,960
- Let me eliminate Jong Kook.
- You can't.

1527
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,210
You will?

1528
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:49,370
Suk Jin, go for it now.

1529
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:50,600
Go for it.

1530
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,080
Suk Jin, rip off his name tag.

1531
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,980
(Jong Kook never shows his back.)

1532
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,190
Hey, hurry.

1533
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:57,940
(While the two of them
are struggling to get Jong Kook...)

1534
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,390
Hurry!

1535
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,750
I almost got her!

1536
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:03,290
Se Chan!

1537
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,100
- Hey!
- Hurry!

1538
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,060
Hurry!

1539
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,120
We need to hurry up!

1540
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,190
Hurry!

1541
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:13,060
- What are you waiting for?
- So Min!

1542
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:16,140
Wait. Hyun Yi got me.

1543
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,440
(Tearing)

1544
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,940
- I got it.
- What was that?

1545
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,600
(In the meanwhile,
Se Chan's name tag was removed.)

1546
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,520
Yang Se Chan is out.

1547
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,670
Wait!

1548
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:27,670
(Meanwhile, So Min...)

1549
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:28,890
Wait!

1550
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:30,580
Hold on.

1551
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,790
(Hyena-like Hyun Yi
is only after So Min's name tag.)

1552
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,020
Wait.

1553
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,690
- Jeon So Min, out.
- So Min!

1554
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:40,730
- I can't rip his name tag off.
- You can!

1555
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,770
(Suk Jin didn't know
Jong Kook was an open target.)

1556
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:43,890
- How come?
- You can rip his name tag off.

1557
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:45,170
- Wait.
- No, he can't.

1558
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,270
You can
rip his name tag off, Suk Jin.

1559
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,890
- How come?
- Jong Kook is everyone's target.

1560
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,270
He's everyone's target?
I didn't know.

1561
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:51,310
Hey, stop!

1562
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:54,810
(It's a 1-on-1 match
between Jong Kook and Suk Jin.)

1563
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:56,770
- I got it!
- Jong Kook, you're out.

1564
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,310
But he...

1565
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,310
It's okay.

1566
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,310
(Suk Jin ripped off
Jong Kook's name tag.)

1567
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:03,890
But he... I couldn't remove
his name tag because of the strap.

1568
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:05,420
Wait a minute.

1569
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:08,290
(When Jong Kook lost his strength
and was fighting for his name tag,)

1570
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:12,250
(Suk Jin removed his name tag
as an experienced player.)

1571
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,890
(A big twist)

1572
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:19,230
(Suk Jin, who got revived, did it.)

1573
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:20,270
All right.

1574
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:22,000
- So Min.
- She ripped mine off.

1575
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,330
- What happened?
- Jeon So Min, Kim Jong Kook, out.

1576
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:25,370
Is that all right?

1577
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:28,640
(The open target,
Kim Jong Kook is out.)

1578
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,370
- Jong Kook is out?
- Jong Kook is out?

1579
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:32,580
(The shocking news of Jong Kook's
elimination hits the prison.)

1580
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,020
- Hyun Yi survived?
- Suk Jin eliminated him?

1581
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,250
- Hyun Yi...
- That means...

1582
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,710
- only Hyun Yi and Suk Jin remain.
- It's a one-on-one match.

1583
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,020
For real?

1584
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,390
(Suk Jin has become the last hope
for Team Average.)

1585
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,890
- So Min is out?
- Only Hyun Yi and Suk Jin remain.

1586
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:43,890
They said Jong Kook was out, right?

1587
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:44,890
They did.

1588
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:46,190
(It's a 1-on-1 match
between Hyun Yi and Suk Jin now.)

1589
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:47,660
All right. I'll see you later.

1590
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,270
- Let's see.
- It's just me and Hyun Yi now?

1591
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:51,460
(Both Hyun Yi and Suk Jin
need to get an elimination ticket.)

1592
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,940
(Hyun Yi starts collecting acorns
right away.)

1593
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:57,730
My gosh.

1594
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:59,100
(Now it's a matter
of who finds more acorns faster.)

1595
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,440
I'm in trouble. I'm sure
Hyun Yi has some acorns.

1596
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,850
(Suk Jin doesn't have acorns
as he just got revived.)

1597
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,140
I have no acorns.

1598
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,080
(He needs to find more acorns
to become the star of the game.)

1599
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,310
I need to find them fast.

1600
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,290
(He needs to find more acorns
to become the star of the game.)

1601
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:12,020
(Right then)

1602
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,460
Suk Jin, let's face it head-on.

1603
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:15,960
Face me head-on.

1604
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,660
(Hyun Yi provokes Suk Jin now that
she got an elimination ticket.)

1605
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:18,660
Bring it on.

1606
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:19,960
(Hyun Yi provokes Suk Jin now that
she got an elimination ticket.)

1607
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,290
Wait. I haven't collected
enough acorns. Give me some time.

1608
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:24,060
- I haven't found the acorns.
- I picked you out.

1609
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,370
Really? But I haven't found
the acorns.

1610
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:27,190
Give me a few more minutes.
We need to play it fair.

1611
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:28,960
- You need more time?
- Please.

1612
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,370
Okay. I'll give you some time
to run off.

1613
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:31,730
Go.

1614
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:32,810
(But Hyun Yi
isn't ready to let Suk Jin go.)

1615
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,730
This won't be any good though.

1616
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:36,500
What do you mean? Once I rip off
your name tag, you're done for.

1617
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,770
No, I meant for me.

1618
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:40,980
I'm only going to defend myself.

1619
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,850
If I rip off her name tag...

1620
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:43,890
You can't rip mine off first.

1621
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:45,040
I can run away, right?

1622
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,160
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

1623
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,160
How come?

1624
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,660
Although it may not be effective,
I'll earn some time.

1625
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,750
Why are you so strong?

1626
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,520
(Grabbing tightly)

1627
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:53,730
Shall we give it a go?

1628
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,100
(Startled)

1629
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,120
She's way too strong.

1630
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,670
(Hyun Yi tries the thigh pull move.)

1631
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,040
You're so strong.

1632
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,560
(Suk Jin hopelessly
flutters about.)

1633
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:05,940
You're way too strong.

1634
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,730
(Hyun Yi tries
the thigh pull again.)

1635
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:08,850
You're so strong.

1636
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,210
You're so strong.

1637
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,440
(Glimmering again)

1638
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,020
Goodness, you're amazing.
It must be because you play soccer.

1639
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,520
(Hyun Yi's name tag was ripped off?)

1640
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,000
(Suk Jin ripped off her name tag
before she could attack him.)

1641
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,330
Oh, no!

1642
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:34,790
(Suk Jin claimed that he had
no elimination ticket on Hyun Yi.)

1643
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:36,060
(What exactly happened?)

1644
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,100
I'm sorry.

1645
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,830
(5 minutes ago)

1646
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:40,140
I already have three.

1647
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,410
(He barely managed to
gather 5 acorns.)

1648
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:44,940
- I'll buy one on Hyun Yi.
- Bring it on.

1649
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,940
(He bought an elimination ticket
right before a head-on match.)

1650
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:51,440
(Then he fooled her, saying
he has no elimination ticket.)

1651
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:55,190
(Suk Jin's blow on Hyun Yi
when she was off her guard)

1652
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:59,420
(That's how Suk Jin ripped off
Hyun Yi's name tag.)

1653
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,960
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1654
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,060
Lee Hyun Yi is out.

1655
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,330
(We haven't used this caption
for a while.)

1656
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:06,670
(Ji Suk Jin wins.)

1657
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,270
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1658
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:11,810
Lee Hyun Yi is out.

1659
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:13,040
- We won.
- We won.

1660
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:16,040
- My gosh, we won, So Min.
- We won.

1661
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,640
- We won.
- That was close though.

1662
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,540
- What shall we do?
- That was close.

1663
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,120
- We need to buy blocks.
- Everyone should buy blocks.

1664
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,640
- Woo Jae, you must join us.
- Race over.

1665
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:25,390
Gosh, what is this?

1666
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:26,420
(The moment of destiny
has finally come.)

1667
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,020
What is that?

1668
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:30,080
I don't think we can win.

1669
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,730
Are you kidding me?

1670
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:33,520
I must increase my height.

1671
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,060
Or I could stretch my arms.

1672
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:36,960
We're so done for.

1673
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,330
(Who will be the winner
of this race?)

1674
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:39,790
- My gosh, this is...
- All right!

1675
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,310
- Gosh, Suk Jin.
- Yes?

1676
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,370
You were indeed a hero
whom we brought back alive.

1677
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,980
- Exactly.
- You were our hero.

1678
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,670
- I can't believe it.
- Everyone is talking about...

1679
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:50,770
- how fast and strong you are.
- She's incredibly strong.

1680
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:54,170
I thought Hyun Yi had a chance
of beating him.

1681
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:55,940
- We almost won.
- You almost did.

1682
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,310
- But I got fooled by Suk Jin.
- Is that so?

1683
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,120
I'll announce the results
of the final mission.

1684
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,390
Team Average won first place.

1685
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:04,980
- Nice!
- We can just buy those.

1686
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,120
- Team Tall is in second place.
- Yes, we can.

1687
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,120
- We'll win for sure.
- For sure.

1688
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,420
And Team Short is in last place.

1689
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:11,330
- We're in second place.
- We'll give you coins in order.

1690
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,960
You're earning as many coins
as you eliminated others.

1691
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,040
- Wow, that's incredible.
- Really?

1692
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,540
- That's incredible.
- What did he say?

1693
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,940
- That's five.
- I eliminated three.

1694
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,140
As many players as you eliminated.

1695
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,230
Then you eliminated six players.

1696
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:21,440
Then we don't know who will win.

1697
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,040
- I eliminated...
- Even still,

1698
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,250
- we need to buy blocks.
- For real?

1699
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,980
These are for Team Short.

1700
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,140
As many players I eliminated?

1701
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,520
You must buy blocks no matter what.

1702
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,890
Let's use up all our money for that.

1703
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,420
- I'm getting five coins, right?
- Let's seriously invest in it.

1704
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,710
- We must.
- You have six coins now, right?

1705
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:34,160
We have no other choice now.

1706
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,420
We don't, but we could win
if we invest in blocks.

1707
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,830
- Then actually...
- How many do you have?

1708
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,390
- Even if I do nothing...
- He got five.

1709
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:40,390
- It's meaningless for him.
- But I won't do that.

1710
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:41,560
- Okay.
- Woo Jae.

1711
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,420
It's meaningless.

1712
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,600
There's no point fighting
among ourselves.

1713
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,600
We must invest in blocks.

1714
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,640
It's not a matter of why.
We must invest in them.

1715
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,000
- It's a promise.
- Got it.

1716
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,710
You must invest in blocks
until the end.

1717
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:52,870
- Here I go.
- I'll go next.

1718
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:55,330
- They have this much.
- Even so.

1719
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,940
- This is my last chip.
- I didn't earn it for free.

1720
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:00,940
(The team members of Team Short
got a coin each.)

1721
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:03,310
(All of them bought blocks.)

1722
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:05,890
Gosh, we never know
what will happen, do we?

1723
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,020
Of course, we should buy blocks.

1724
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,390
(Even Team Tall buys blocks
even though they were leading.)

1725
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:11,690
Our can is full.

1726
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:14,290
We must beat them.

1727
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:15,560
- So Min, add all of them in.
- So Min is gone.

1728
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,560
Did she go home?

1729
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,600
(Team Average didn't buy
that many blocks.)

1730
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,620
(She chooses to buy blocks.)

1731
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:21,440
I'm the one who is in least danger.
I couldn't help but put it all in.

1732
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,600
- You did?
- Since I'm short...

1733
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,770
- What did you buy?
- The blocks.

1734
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:27,040
Since we're in first place,

1735
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:28,810
we can't help it.

1736
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,770
(Woo Jae invests all 6 coins
in blocks.)

1737
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:32,940
- I'm done.
- I'll put my trust in Team Average.

1738
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,140
- What? Why?
- Okay.

1739
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,440
- You revived me, that's why.
- We did.

1740
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,890
(Suk Jin buys blocks
since he was revived.)

1741
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,750
I added them all.
I really added them all.

1742
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:42,420
They have great teamwork.
That's not good.

1743
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:43,850
Do you think it'll work?

1744
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:45,520
- Se Chan!
- This is strange.

1745
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,190
You're the tiger!

1746
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:50,330
Se Chan, everyone on our team
is bound to betray one another.

1747
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:51,460
But we can pull it off though.

1748
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:54,870
All right, everyone.
I'll announce the results now.

1749
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,230
That was quite quick.

1750
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:58,730
It looks like there's a big gap
between good and bad players.

1751
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:01,730
I'll announce
the results of Team Tall.

1752
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,410
I bet it's overpowering.

1753
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:05,000
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

1754
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,580
You used ten coins in total.

1755
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,250
Wait a minute. You're sharing
everything with us, right?

1756
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,890
Why would you reveal that?

1757
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:11,940
You'll get to see it anyway.

1758
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,120
- Jae Suk bought...
- Among ten coins...

1759
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,790
seven blocks and three shoe lifts.

1760
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,660
- Okay.
- He got three shoe lifts.

1761
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,390
That's a lot. At first...

1762
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:21,750
You bought seven blocks?

1763
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:23,060
Jong Kook.

1764
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,100
At first...

1765
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,830
- Out of 12,
- You bought a lot.

1766
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:27,600
you bought 10 blocks
and 2 shoe lifts.

1767
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,600
You bought shoe lifts too.

1768
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,060
- You shouldn't have blamed me.
- There's no difference.

1769
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:33,310
- My gosh. I only got two.
- They're all the same.

1770
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:35,500
- I didn't lie.
- Irene,

1771
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,210
you got 7 blocks and 3 shoe lifts.

1772
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:40,540
- Wow.
- Goodness.

1773
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,120
They all got shoe lifts.

1774
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,080
- We still got a chance.
- We still have a chance.

1775
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,960
- We really do have a chance.
- We have a chance.

1776
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,980
- We're taller than them, at least.
- That's right.

1777
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:53,020
Hyun Yi got 9 blocks
and 3 shoe lifts.

1778
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:54,460
We're no different.

1779
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,390
- I know.
- You got a lot of blocks.

1780
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,390
- I only got three shoe lifts.
- You got a lot of blocks.

1781
00:58:58,390 --> 00:58:59,460
That's what I'm saying.

1782
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,790
- I got nine blocks.
- You got a lot more than others.

1783
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:03,940
She bought a block
every time she got three shoe lifts.

1784
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,100
- That's enough.
- I piled up nine blocks.

1785
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:08,980
- "That's enough?"
- They all had situations.

1786
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,100
- Let's see.
- We all did well amicably.

1787
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,210
Right, we did well.

1788
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:13,770
- Of course.
- They all bought equally.

1789
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:16,080
Did you buy shoe lifts
in the beginning? You did?

1790
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,810
It was heartwarming for us at the end.

1791
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:20,750
And for Suk Jin,

1792
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:24,960
- he got 5 blocks and 3 shoe lifts.
- Yes.

1793
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,890
- What?
- He did well.

1794
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,060
Why are you suddenly so loyal?

1795
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,600
- We were...
- Toward the end,

1796
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,230
- it got heartwarming.
- heartwarming toward the end.

1797
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:34,670
Woo Jae, you got 7 blocks
and 2 shoe lifts.

1798
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,940
- Wow.
- Woo Jae bought a lot of blocks.

1799
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,540
What is that?

1800
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:42,770
Then this is disadvantageous for us.
We might be in last place.

1801
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:45,310
- We're in last place.
- Next is Se Chan.

1802
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:47,370
He got 5 blocks and 5 shoe lifts.

1803
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:49,290
- What?
- He got five blocks...

1804
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,020
(He got 5 shoe lifts.)

1805
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,210
- Are you kidding me?
- Why didn't you contribute?

1806
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:53,960
- I got five of each!
- Hey!

1807
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,210
- Gosh, you punk.
- I got five of each!

1808
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:57,330
- You're total garbage.
- They got seven blocks on average.

1809
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:58,750
But it's...

1810
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,160
- They got seven blocks on average.
- We lost.

1811
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:03,620
- My gosh.
- So Min.

1812
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:05,330
You got 3 blocks and 3 shoe lifts.

1813
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,890
- My gosh.
- Darn you.

1814
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:09,560
(So Min also invested
half of her coins in shoe lifts.)

1815
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,600
- We're no different.
- Pass.

1816
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,040
We could be in last place.

1817
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,310
- We could be.
- All right.

1818
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:17,810
Haha, you got 7 blocks
and 4 shoe lifts.

1819
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:18,870
- What?
- I did well.

1820
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:21,040
- What?
- I got 3 and 1 toward the end.

1821
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,170
Look how brazen he is.

1822
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:23,640
- You got four shoe lifts?
- Hae Na.

1823
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,190
You got 7 blocks and 1 shoe lift.

1824
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:27,960
- Wow, you're so loyal.
- How loyal of you.

1825
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,660
- Ji Hyo.
- Let's listen to what she got.

1826
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,020
- You got 5 blocks and 4 shoe lifts.
- What?

1827
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,230
- What?
- Ji Hyo!

1828
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,500
- Can you repeat that?
- Ji Hyo!

1829
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,100
What does this mean?

1830
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,500
She got a lot of shoe lifts too.

1831
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,000
- Ji Hyo!
- She got many shoe lifts too.

1832
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,440
- It's because I'm the shortest.
- Right.

1833
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,410
We'll give you the shoe lifts now.

1834
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:44,410
- All right.
- All right.

1835
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:46,310
- It's only a shoe lift difference.
- Only by that much?

1836
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,410
It's only one shoe lift difference.

1837
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,210
It doesn't look that different
from the others.

1838
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:52,540
We'll start with Team Tall
who is obviously ahead.

1839
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,420
- Then I'll go first.
- All right.

1840
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:57,480
- It's all about the average anyway.
- Right.

1841
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,560
If you can,

1842
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,960
- hit as high as possible.
- I'll do my best.

1843
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,190
- It's quite high.
- You should go as high as you can.

1844
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:05,520
- Hold on.
- You should see from up there.

1845
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,330
- It'll be better to hit sideways.
- It's quite high.

1846
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:09,020
- You're right.
- It's really high.

1847
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:10,560
- It's a bit scary though.
- Why?

1848
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:12,940
- It looks scary to me too.
- It's really high.

1849
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,040
You shouldn't be scared of this.

1850
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,710
Can't you go first?
I'm a bit scared.

1851
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:16,940
- But...
- We'll catch you.

1852
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,210
- We'll catch you. Don't worry.
- Will you?

1853
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:19,210
We will catch you like this.

1854
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:20,980
- It's scary though.
- We'll catch you.

1855
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,500
If you slap the wall and fall down,

1856
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,910
- Just throw yourself at the wall.
- you won't get hurt.

1857
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:25,850
- I should jump like this, right?
- Yes, you should.

1858
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:28,440
If you hit too high,
you might fall backward.

1859
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,790
No, you won't. I got you.

1860
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:30,940
- I got you.
- We'll catch you.

1861
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,560
- You got me.
- Okay.

1862
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,790
- Jump like Freddie Mercury.
- Don't you trust me?

1863
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,250
- I'll go first.
- All right.

1864
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:36,690
The grasshopper is jumping.

1865
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:38,190
- I'm so envious.
- The grasshopper?

1866
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,560
(Will he be able
to overcome his fear?)

1867
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,390
- The grasshopper!
- The grasshopper!

1868
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:42,600
(Will he be able
to overcome his fear?)

1869
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,270
No way!

1870
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,210
(He only jumped about 20cm.)

1871
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:51,100
- What was that?
- What did you just do?

1872
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,100
(What was that?)

1873
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,980
- I'm sorry.
- You should've jumped more.

1874
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,480
- I was scared.
- Gosh, seriously.

1875
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:58,080
- He only jumped that high?
- You can jump that high...

1876
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,440
without blocks.

1877
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,370
- Are you serious?
- I was really scared.

1878
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,850
- What was that?
- It was really scary.

1879
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:05,540
- I mean...
- I suddenly got...

1880
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:06,690
- really scared.
- Jong Kook, you're up next.

1881
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,580
- He's being weird.
- You get me though, right?

1882
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:09,830
You should've jumped higher!

1883
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:10,850
You get me, right?

1884
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:13,000
What do you expect?
How can I get you?

1885
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
- Hey.
- But I get him.

1886
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,270
- I think it'll be scary up there.
- I get him.

1887
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:17,500
- I get him.
- You shouldn't have done that.

1888
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,670
What was I supposed to do?
I was scared!

1889
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,100
When I was about to jump,

1890
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,830
I imagined my shoulders dislocating.

1891
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:24,940
But still...

1892
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:27,940
- He's deflating our blocks.
- I imagined my shoulders dislocating.

1893
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:29,250
- Jae Suk, you're deflating ours.
- Our blocks are deflating.

1894
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,270
Come down.

1895
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:32,480
- Their blocks are deflating?
- Our blocks are deflating.

1896
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:34,640
I should've jumped higher.

1897
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,850
- Yes!
- I should've jumped that high.

1898
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:39,080
- Darn it.
- That's really high.

1899
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,460
You should jump sideways.

1900
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,690
(Hyun Yi of Team Tall
jumps high as well.)

1901
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,580
- Hey.
- What's with her?

1902
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,190
- We got this.
- Good job.

1903
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:47,560
- Well done.
- You did well.

1904
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,960
- It's okay.
- You did well.

1905
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,020
It's okay. You did a good job.

1906
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,100
- She jumped diagonally.
- What is that?

1907
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:54,330
- It's okay. You did a good job.
- It's a relief though.

1908
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:55,910
- How can she hit his mark?
- What was that?

1909
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:58,230
- Jae Suk is happy.
- It's okay.

1910
01:02:58,230 --> 01:02:59,310
Jae Suk, it's a relief.

1911
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,100
- Hey! What was that?
- He's glad.

1912
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,410
It's okay.

1913
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:03,540
She hit Jae Suk's mark.

1914
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,770
For the rest of the teams,
take turns in hitting the wall.

1915
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:06,980
You should take turns.

1916
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,210
- So Min, let's go.
- It was a mistake.

1917
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:10,980
Goodness, Jae Suk made a bad start.

1918
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,020
If you give me one more chance...

1919
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,710
He will never give you
another chance!

1920
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:16,750
Then stay quiet!

1921
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,660
Why should I stay quiet?
Gosh, seriously.

1922
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:19,660
(The Grand Award duo
is having a quarrel.)

1923
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,230
- Go for it!
- So Min is going to jump.

1924
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:22,290
(So Min of Team Average goes first.)

1925
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,460
- That's pretty high.
- It's quite high.

1926
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,140
- It's quite high.
- Well done, So Min.

1927
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,440
It's 3.15m. Ji Hyo, it's your turn.

1928
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,140
- Go!
- Please make it high.

1929
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,500
- Nice.
- That's high too.

1930
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,210
It's exactly 3m.

1931
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:36,040
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin, you're up next.

1932
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,750
- Let's go.
- Suk Jin.

1933
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:39,540
- Suk Jin.
- I should've jumped higher.

1934
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:42,120
- What's with your arm?
- What?

1935
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:43,940
(Extended)

1936
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:46,290
- Goodness.
- What is that?

1937
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:47,850
Is he Lee Byung Hun in "Inside Men?"

1938
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:48,960
- That's...
- What's wrong with your arm?

1939
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,480
- Please hurry.
- Remove that.

1940
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,960
- It's my arm.
- You can't do this.

1941
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,190
- What on earth...
- It's my arm. What are you doing?

1942
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:54,690
Mister, that's enough.

1943
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:56,020
- Gosh, this man.
- Seriously.

1944
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:58,390
What are you, a character
in "Inside Men?"

1945
01:03:58,390 --> 01:03:59,670
I want to try again though.

1946
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,190
- Right? I'd jump higher.
- I know.

1947
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:02,290
You can jump higher
if you're given another chance.

1948
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:03,710
Gosh, he almost touched that.

1949
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:05,060
He's pretty good.

1950
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:07,080
- Suk Jin is pretty good.
- Didn't he just reach 3.6m?

1951
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,870
Gosh, Suk Jin is really good.

1952
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:10,710
(Suk Jin is showing
his reliable sides today.)

1953
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:12,480
He can't do it because of Woo Jae.

1954
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:13,580
- What was that?
- What was that?

1955
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:15,310
He can't do it because of Woo Jae.

1956
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,120
(It was too short.)

1957
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:18,690
It's 3.15m.

1958
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:20,390
Gosh, Suk Jin!

1959
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,080
- Hey.
- What was that?

1960
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,580
- Hey. It was...
- What did he just do?

1961
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,060
- It wasn't fun at all.
- Let me tell you a tip.

1962
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,850
- Next is Hae Na.
- I jumped from afar.

1963
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:29,020
He said he'd share a tip.

1964
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:31,000
- What's with that man?
- I know.

1965
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,060
- Hae Na.
- Hae Na.

1966
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:34,830
- All right.
- It's 3.05m.

1967
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,210
Next is Haha.

1968
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:38,370
- He's intimidated.
- It's scary up there.

1969
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:41,310
(The little kid can jump
quite high although he's short.)

1970
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:43,870
- It's because he played basketball.
- Right.

1971
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:44,940
Watch your knees!

1972
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,870
(The little kid can jump high
because he used to play basketball.)

1973
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:48,440
- Haha.
- He can't jump that high.

1974
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,940
The highest he can reach is 3.2m.

1975
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,580
- Didn't he jump up to 3.4m before?
- Before...

1976
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,660
Haha, the highest you can reach
is 3.2m.

1977
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:56,790
I knew it.

1978
01:04:57,890 --> 01:04:59,690
Haha, the highest you can reach
is 3.2m.

1979
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:01,690
(It's exactly 3.2m.)

1980
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,230
The highest you can reach is 3.2m.

1981
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:05,290
(As expected)

1982
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:07,290
- Mister 3.2m!
- It's as high as mine.

1983
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:09,500
- It's 3.2m.
- It's as high as mine.

1984
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,640
- Woo Jae seems relaxed.
- Darn it.

1985
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:12,730
Let's see.

1986
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:14,670
(Se Chan and Woo Jae
on Team Average jump comfortably.)

1987
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:15,830
- That was cool.
- Well done.

1988
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:17,440
So that puts...

1989
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,020
Team Tall in first place,
and they win prizes.

1990
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:23,080
- Yes!
- It's good for us.

1991
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,940
- We got this.
- We're not in last place?

1992
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:27,390
And the shortest member...

1993
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,890
of Team Average
will receive the penalty.

1994
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:31,290
Two members from this team
will receive the penalty.

1995
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:34,350
We'll give you shoe lifts.
Please put them on.

1996
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:36,000
Shall we put the shoe lifts on?

1997
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,870
- It's too small.
- I only have one.

1998
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:39,960
- I'm...
- I should've got more shoe lifts.

1999
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,000
I should've betrayed them.

2000
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:46,940
This is the fun part.

2001
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:49,270
We are all by ourselves now!

2002
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:52,000
- I guess this is how it feels.
- So this is what shoe lifts are.

2003
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,020
The shoe lifts...

2004
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,480
- I'll go for it first.
- Sure.

2005
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,040
- Could you step back?
- Gosh, this is...

2006
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,290
- You're so tall.
- But you're wearing a cap.

2007
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:00,460
- Let me see.
- Okay, I'll take it off.

2008
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,160
We're similar in height now.

2009
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:03,850
You're still shorter than me.

2010
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:04,850
You can never be as tall as me.

2011
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:06,600
- All right. First place...
- You can't be taller than me.

2012
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,500
- goes to Haha.
- Yes!

2013
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,690
Hae Na and Ji Hyo
will receive the penalty.

2014
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:11,870
- All right!
- They'll receive the penalty.

2015
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:13,330
(All right!)

2016
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:14,500
He's ecstatic.

2017
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,960
- He's so happy about it.
- He's so weird.

2018
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,640
The two of them
are getting the penalty.

2019
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,600
He's the worst.

2020
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,250
- All right.
- For this team,

2021
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,940
it's obvious...

2022
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,420
- that Woo Jae is in first place.
- Okay.

2023
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:28,170
- Do we have one more person to go?
- Yes.

2024
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:29,580
- Is it me?
- You should come and stand here.

2025
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:32,540
So Min's head is taller than others.

2026
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:34,960
Please turn around.

2027
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,980
Se Chan is definitely taller.

2028
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,460
- First...
- Please take off your cap.

2029
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,750
First, Se Chan...

2030
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,500
(It looks like Se Chan lost.)

2031
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,190
- Se Chan...
- It looks like Se Chan lost.

2032
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:45,060
- Se Chan won.
- His shoulders are much higher.

2033
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:47,100
- Se Chan won.
- Of course.

2034
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,140
All right.

2035
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,410
- Look at him.
- Why are you adjusting your hair?

2036
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:53,170
Push it down. Stop it. Push it down.

2037
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:56,250
- Why would you adjust your hair?
- The grandpa is still young.

2038
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:58,250
Suk Jin, are you ready?

2039
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:00,770
- All right. Hold on, Suk Jin.
- Look how tall his hair is.

2040
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:03,580
- That's so brutal of him.
- Look at his hair.

2041
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:07,060
- They're similar in height.
- They are.

2042
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,120
(They're similar in height.)

2043
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:11,480
- They're similar in height.
- They are.

2044
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,480
So Min wins!

2045
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,230
What a load of nonsense.

2046
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:17,100
(Jae Suk supports So Min.)

2047
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,960
(What a load of nonsense.)

2048
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:21,770
(Putting on a straight face)

2049
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,960
- How could you say that?
- It doesn't make any sense.

2050
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,210
You can check if you want.

2051
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:26,710
- She won!
- This is too much.

2052
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:29,330
How is that possible?
I'm looking down at her.

2053
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:30,810
- Let's check again then.
- Do I look like a fool?

2054
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:31,980
Then measure it yourself.

2055
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,370
- Go ahead and measure it.
- Let's do that.

2056
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:35,270
Measure it. You see?

2057
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:37,480
Look where your hip is.

2058
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,690
This is...

2059
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:41,390
Come on, So Min.

2060
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,520
I'm sorry, So Min.

2061
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:43,960
This is how life is.

2062
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,390
- All right.
- We're in second place.

2063
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:48,620
Hae Na, Ji Hyo, and So Min
will receive the penalty.

2064
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:50,020
(Hae Na, So Min, and Ji Hyo
will receive the penalty.)

2065
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,960
Bring in the prize.

2066
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,040
What is it?

2067
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:55,730
It's Korean beef. You can grill it
or make rice cake soup with it.

2068
01:07:58,060 --> 01:07:59,310
It's so fresh.

2069
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,580
- No way.
- And...

2070
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:04,000
the penalty is a whipped cream bomb.

2071
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,310
One of you
will be spared from it randomly.

2072
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:07,580
One of us will be spared?

2073
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,040
(Who will be the lucky survivor?)

2074
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,210
Two,

2075
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,480
three!

2076
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,790
Okay.

2077
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:17,330
Hae Na survived.

2078
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:18,750
The nice one survived.

2079
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:21,390
- Unbelievable.
- The nice one survived.

2080
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:23,100
- My goodness.
- That was incredible.

2081
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,690
- The nice one survived.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2082
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:26,600
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you.

2083
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2084
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:32,040
Hello.

2085
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,600
It's time to film
my favorite show, Running Man.

2086
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,830
I will hurry up and sit down.

2087
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:37,040
I can't wait.

2088
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,100
What will happen today?

2089
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:42,440
Ever since Haha began
to star in "How Do You Play?"

2090
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,850
he doesn't look happy
on Running Man.

2091
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:46,520
(Ever since he heard those words,
he shows happiness on Running Man.)

2092
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,750
- My goodness.
- Hello.

2093
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,060
Suk Jin.

2094
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,660
- Suk Jin, you are too much.
- What?

2095
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:52,920
- Suk Jin.
- So Min.

2096
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,790
- Suk Jin.
- Why are you picking on me?

2097
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:56,420
- You have no interest in me.
- So Min.

2098
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:59,670
Of course, I have interest in you.
I worry about you.

2099
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:02,330
- Hello.
- I prepared a special chair.

2100
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,730
You didn't prepare it.

2101
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,100
You have a point.

2102
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,670
I can't believe
you tried to hit me with a crutch.

2103
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:08,730
(She expressed herself
with a crutch.)

2104
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:10,910
I feel sorry for you
that you injured your leg,

2105
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:12,440
but you can be the judge today.

2106
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,440
Are you okay?

2107
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:16,080
You are slow.

2108
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,140
Are you okay?

2109
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,290
So Min,

2110
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:21,750
you can't get us water, right?

2111
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:23,790
Seriously.

2112
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:25,330
You still need to clap the slate.

2113
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:27,060
- You are the youngest.
- Should I do it now?

2114
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,460
- Do it later.
- You can do it from the spot.

2115
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,830
Today, you should do the work
as a substitute.

2116
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:32,460
- Do you want water?
- Yes, I need water.

2117
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:33,870
I am sorry.

2118
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,140
Don't be sorry.

2119
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:38,210
How did it happen?

2120
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:40,540
When you go down the stairs...

2121
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,580
- like this,
- Yes.

2122
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:45,480
women often twist their ankles.

2123
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,140
- That happens.
- That happens to me often.

2124
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:48,140
It's the same with men.

2125
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,850
Then my foot became swollen,

2126
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,640
so I got an X-ray.
I have a fracture.

2127
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,420
- A fracture.
- Did your bone break?

2128
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:55,980
- It's a fracture.
- I got a fracture in my foot.

2129
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:57,830
Her toenails got bruised.

2130
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:59,890
That's not true. It's a pedicure.

2131
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:01,420
Her toenails got bruised blue.

2132
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:03,100
She got a pedicure since she knew
that a guest was coming today.

2133
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:04,830
- It's a pedicure.
- Did she get a pedicure...

2134
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:06,600
- to look cute to a guest?
- It's a pedicure.

2135
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,670
So we won't need a referee
for four weeks.

2136
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:09,830
That's not true.

2137
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:12,170
- You should wear a yellow uniform.
- That's right.

2138
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,340
No.

2139
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:14,710
In any case,

2140
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,750
I hope So Min recovers quickly.

2141
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,270
- I feel bad.
- She will recover soon.

2142
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:20,470
- Time will pass quickly.
- Thank you.

2143
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:24,050
Today, we will welcome 2022,
the Year of the Tiger.

2144
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:26,260
Se Chan and So Min were born
in the Year of the Tiger.

2145
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,160
Roar. Tiger is
my Chinese zodiac sign.

2146
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:31,260
We invited guests
who were born in 1986 like them.

2147
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,760
- Really?
- Did you say 1986?

2148
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,190
Are there celebrities
who were born in 1986?

2149
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:35,520
Not many celebrities were born then.

2150
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,020
Guests who were born in 1986,
the Year of the Tiger, come on out.

2151
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,630
This is "Tiger Is Coming."

2152
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,760
- Who are the guests?
- "Tiger Is Coming."

2153
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,670
- "Tiger Is Coming."
- Hey.

2154
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:46,930
(Three guests who were born
in the Year of the Tiger)

2155
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,560
- My goodness.
- Hey.

2156
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,640
My goodness.

2157
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:57,640
Welcome.

2158
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:58,640
Hello.

2159
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,210
Bae Seul Ki.

2160
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:01,970
- It has been a while.
- Seul Ki.

2161
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,570
- Hey.
- Welcome.

2162
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:06,980
It's Eunhyuk.

2163
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:08,510
- Hey.
- I thought it was an idol singer.

2164
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:11,560
I thought it was an idol singer.

2165
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:14,460
(People who are the same age
greet each other warmly.)

2166
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:15,960
You look much better.

2167
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,960
- Eunhyuk.
- You haven't changed at all.

2168
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:21,360
This is insane.
I haven't seen her in a long while.

2169
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,930
- It has been so long.
- I thought you didn't recognize me.

2170
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:26,060
That's not true. I was fascinated.

2171
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:28,360
- She worked with me upon debuting.
- Hello.

2172
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,230
Please come to the middle.

2173
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:31,940
I can't believe
Soo Ah and Seul Ki are here.

2174
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:34,180
I am close to tears.

2175
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:35,810
- Come here.
- This brings back memories.

2176
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,270
- It has been a while.
- I haven't met Seul Ki before.

2177
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:38,590
- Hello.
- Hello.

2178
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:40,440
- It's our first time meeting.
- Yes, it is.

2179
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,150
- Are we the same age?
- So Min, sit down.

2180
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:43,610
- Are we the same age?
- We are the same age.

2181
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:45,180
- The Year of the Tiger?
- Hey.

2182
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:48,060
- We are...
- Sit down, So Min.

2183
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:49,150
I broke my foot.

2184
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:51,060
- It's nice to meet you.
- What is up with you?

2185
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,500
Sit still.

2186
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,390
- This isn't a reunion. Sit still.
- For goodness' sake.

2187
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:55,390
- Was everyone born...
- Sit down.

2188
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:56,970
- in the Year of the Tiger?
- Sit down.

2189
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,040
My goodness.

2190
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:00,170
This is incredible.

2191
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:02,710
She is here
with her boyfriend today.

2192
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:04,600
(He is a good man
who looks after his girlfriend.)

2193
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,770
That's right.

2194
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:07,180
Are you taking a walk?

2195
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,750
- Yes, we are. Hello.
- My goodness.

2196
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,440
You have a good boyfriend.

2197
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,390
I can't believe it.

2198
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,510
It has been a while.

2199
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:16,420
- Eunhyuk, it has been a while.
- Yes, it has.

2200
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:18,850
It has been four years
since I visited Running Man.

2201
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:20,180
- That's right.
- Really?

2202
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:22,800
- You visited after your discharge.
- Eunhyuk doesn't get old.

2203
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:25,130
Eunhyuk, you don't get old.

2204
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:26,860
I didn't recognize him.
He looks younger.

2205
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:27,930
- When he entered,
- He looks the same.

2206
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:30,690
- I didn't recognize him.
- Eunhyuk, you look younger.

2207
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:32,260
I am taking good care of myself.

2208
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:33,900
- I see.
- You look after yourself.

2209
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:35,310
Please tell me what you do.

2210
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:37,230
- I go to a dermatologist often.
- Is it necessary?

2211
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:39,470
- I use a sheet mask every day.
- I see.

2212
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:41,510
When Eunhyuk first debuted
as Super Junior,

2213
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:43,680
I thought,
"He must be an excellent singer."

2214
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:46,110
- I thought that.
- Jong Kook.

2215
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:47,810
You know what I mean, right?

2216
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:49,610
"He must be an excellent singer."

2217
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:51,150
I thought that.

2218
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:53,390
- His looks improved a lot.
- Thankfully.

2219
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:55,020
They improved a lot
compared to the past.

2220
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,150
- Yes.
- I am taking good care of myself.

2221
01:12:56,150 --> 01:12:57,220
He looks exactly the same.

2222
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:58,820
- Seriously.
- I saw him ten years ago.

2223
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:00,100
- He looks exactly the same.
- You look better now.

2224
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,360
- Your face is plumper now.
- Suk Jin should do the same.

2225
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,140
- That's right.
- It wasn't like that before.

2226
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:05,300
(Jong Kook won't stop talking
about how his looks improved.)

2227
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,730
You keep talking
about how my looks improved.

2228
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,570
I must have looked terrible
in the past.

2229
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,600
You must have looked terrible
in the past.

2230
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:13,810
- "You look good now."
- How bad were my looks?

2231
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:15,570
Other members
of Super Junior were...

2232
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:17,250
- too handsome.
- Trainer Kook.

2233
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:19,440
- Stop it already.
- Everything is relative.

2234
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,610
- Today...
- Everything is relative.

2235
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:22,960
When he said it at first,
it sounded like a compliment.

2236
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,220
But he kept going.

2237
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,960
- Other members were too handsome.
- Trainer Kook.

2238
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,220
Stop it already.

2239
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:30,350
- Are you going to a ski resort?
- Stop it already.

2240
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,600
For your information,
Eunhyuk went...

2241
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,000
to the same elementary school
as So Min.

2242
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,190
- That's right.
- Middle school too.

2243
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:37,760
Elementary school and middle school.
That's nine years.

2244
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,470
I heard Eunhyuk was very popular.

2245
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,210
- He was very popular.
- Eunhyuk...

2246
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:44,180
could dance well,
so he was very popular.

2247
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:46,070
- His real name is Hyuk Jae.
- What?

2248
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:47,180
- Hyuk Jae.
- Lee Hyuk Jae.

2249
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:48,310
- Hyuk Jae.
- Sit down, So Min.

2250
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,250
- So Min.
- All right.

2251
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:52,390
- We keep telling you that.
- We understand how you feel,

2252
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:54,350
but you need to recover quickly.
Stay seated.

2253
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:56,510
- He was so popular.
- Don't move.

2254
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:59,090
What was So Min like
in elementary school?

2255
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:02,100
So Min was the same even then.

2256
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,350
- Really?
- She was innocent.

2257
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:06,670
She was a bit obsessed with love.

2258
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:07,970
- Really?
- Eunhyuk.

2259
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:09,800
- Really?
- In elementary school?

2260
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,890
In elementary school?

2261
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:12,470
When was I like that
in elementary school?

2262
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:14,670
In elementary school, we had...

2263
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:17,140
- a cute popularity vote.
- Right.

2264
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:18,540
- Then...
- That's fascinating.

2265
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:21,600
we voted for the top three girls.

2266
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,350
- I see.
- Every time,

2267
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:24,880
So Min placed 2nd or 3rd.

2268
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:26,350
That's not true.
I remember it exactly.

2269
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:29,350
Then she always asked the kids
who chose her as 2nd or 3rd place,

2270
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:30,650
- "Why am I second place?"
- She is the same.

2271
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:31,790
She is the same.

2272
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,350
(Why am I second place?)

2273
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:35,820
- She is still like that.
- I remember it exactly.

2274
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:38,260
- I got goosebumps.
- I got goosebumps.

2275
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,170
- Hyuk Jae wrote down...
- I got goosebumps.

2276
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:43,060
the names
for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places.

2277
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:44,690
I think I was in seventh place.

2278
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:45,840
(She remembers it exactly.)

2279
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:46,840
Seriously.

2280
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,040
- She is still like that.
- She pestered kids for days.

2281
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,380
It's scary that you remember it.

2282
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:50,540
She is still like that.

2283
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:52,140
She pestered kids for days.

2284
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:55,140
She hasn't changed
since elementary school.

2285
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:56,350
She is the same.

2286
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:58,110
Let's move on to the next guest.

2287
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:00,790
It has been so long. Hong Soo Ah.

2288
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:02,720
- Hello.
- She rarely visits variety shows.

2289
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,560
I have seen her
ever since she was little.

2290
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,480
Suk Jin, I helped her debut.

2291
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,390
- That's right.
- Don't be ridiculous.

2292
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:10,130
- I practically raised her...
- "Music Bank K-Chart."

2293
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:11,220
on "Six Heroines."

2294
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:14,100
- Do you remember "Six Heroines?"
- That's right.

2295
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:15,500
- Hey.
- That's right.

2296
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,730
- Suk Jin.
- I gave her screen time.

2297
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:18,670
On "Six Heroines," you were...

2298
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:19,900
I was the only one
who didn't make it big.

2299
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,570
- Everyone else made it big.
- You weren't in that position.

2300
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:23,930
- That's right.
- Seriously.

2301
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:25,210
Everyone,

2302
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:27,180
we are moving to the center
as if there is a bonfire.

2303
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:29,070
- Please move back.
- So Min isn't the center.

2304
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:30,180
So Min was sitting down.

2305
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:31,940
So Min, stop moving closer.

2306
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:33,640
- Okay.
- Stop moving closer.

2307
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,720
Here is the thing about Seul Ki.

2308
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:37,310
When there were...

2309
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:39,790
a lot of dating variety shows
such as "Love Letter,"

2310
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:43,220
she captivated the nation
with her retro dance.

2311
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:45,020
It has been two years...

2312
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,800
since you got married, right?

2313
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:47,800
- What?
- Yes.

2314
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,060
- Did she get married?
- Didn't you know?

2315
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:50,360
- Did she get married?
- Seul Ki, did you get married?

2316
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,470
- Yes.
- Seul Ki.

2317
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:53,060
- You got married?
- You didn't tell us.

2318
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:54,360
Why didn't you invite us?

2319
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,310
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Well...

2320
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:57,380
Hold on.

2321
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:59,440
- Because I lost...
- Seul Ki.

2322
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,720
my phone a few times,

2323
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:06,010
my number changed,
and I couldn't reach many people.

2324
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:07,980
- Seul Ki got married.
- I had no idea.

2325
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,110
I wasn't invited
to Jae Suk's wedding,

2326
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:12,890
but I went anyway.

2327
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:13,890
I am sorry.

2328
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,150
(Seul Ki went
even though she wasn't invited.)

2329
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:20,260
(The vending machine of good deeds
encounters an error.)

2330
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:21,760
- Hold on.
- Jae Suk.

2331
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:23,060
- Jae Suk.
- Come on.

2332
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:24,890
Bring an envelope, Jae Suk.

2333
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:26,540
Bring an envelope.

2334
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:28,640
- You should talk.
- Your face is turning red.

2335
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,070
Your face is turning red.

2336
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:31,900
- Let me step outside for a second.
- Jae Suk.

2337
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,600
You shouldn't have said anything.

2338
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:35,440
He went to withdraw some money
for the wedding gift.

2339
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,880
- Jae Suk.
- Seul Ki!

2340
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,220
Seul Ki!

2341
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:39,720
We met for the first time
in a long while.

2342
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,290
You shouldn't be like that.

2343
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:44,010
Jae Suk, it has been a while
since I saw your ears turn red.

2344
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:45,980
- You shouldn't have said anything.
- You know...

2345
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:47,630
Jae Suk feels bad
about such things.

2346
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:49,760
- It's okay, Jae Suk.
- You didn't know.

2347
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,690
There is someone who didn't come
despite receiving an invitation.

2348
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,560
- Me? Did I receive an invitation?
- Hey.

2349
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,560
- You are less than human.
- I sent it to you.

2350
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,060
- You are so mean.
- You are less than human.

2351
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,560
Just a moment ago, he was like,
"Did she get married?"

2352
01:16:58,670 --> 01:16:59,900
I am sorry.

2353
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:02,310
- He is so mean.
- I will bring an envelope.

2354
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:03,680
- Hey.
- Se Chan...

2355
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:05,310
Did you like Seul Ki?

2356
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:06,510
No!

2357
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:07,710
That came out of nowhere.

2358
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:08,850
- No.
- My goodness.

2359
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:10,610
So Min. Today,

2360
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:12,790
- your comments are impactful.
- Please slow down.

2361
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:15,350
Please slow down.

2362
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:18,150
I think your foot injury
made you better at talking.

2363
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:20,220
- That's so funny.
- It made you better at talking.

2364
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:22,320
- I don't want to look lazy.
- I understand.

2365
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,720
- Sit down.
- That energy went to her mouth.

2366
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,320
So Min's comments are clean-cut.

2367
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,190
She gets to the point.

2368
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,730
All right.

2369
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:33,840
It has been a while,
so we should see Seul Ki's...

2370
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,710
- Let's see her retro dance.
- The retro dance.

2371
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:38,310
- Let's see it.
- Her retro dance is a must-see.

2372
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:39,470
It's fascinating.

2373
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:40,550
It's a must-see.

2374
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:41,600
It's my first time seeing it.

2375
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,380
Please play some music.

2376
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:44,420
It will be fun.

2377
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,140
Let's see it.

2378
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:49,890
(She is shy for a second.)

2379
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:50,960
She is moving to the rhythm.

2380
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,060
- The music is perfect.
- It's old-fashioned.

2381
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:54,220
(The old-fashioned beat...)

2382
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:56,890
(makes her transform
in 180 degrees!)

2383
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,720
(This is the retro dance!)

2384
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,260
Her facial expression is perfect.

2385
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:01,760
(Retro dance)

2386
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,540
Yes!

2387
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,060
Seul Ki.

2388
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:10,040
- Seul Ki.
- She is good.

2389
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,730
- Let's go.
- Seul Ki.

2390
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:14,880
- Here it comes.
- Seul Ki.

2391
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:18,180
Here it comes.

2392
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:19,550
- Seul Ki.
- She hasn't changed at all.

2393
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:21,010
Here it comes.

2394
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:22,810
- One, two, three.
- Here it comes.

2395
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:26,090
(Here comes the retro woman.)

2396
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,850
Seul Ki.

2397
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:30,520
- That's how the dance goes.
- It's nice.

2398
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,630
(The retro queen's hands and feet
move in a fancy way.)

2399
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:35,220
She still has it.

2400
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:36,730
She still has it.

2401
01:18:36,730 --> 01:18:37,730
(The legendary retro dancer
still has it.)

2402
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:39,340
Seul Ki still has it.

2403
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:42,140
- That was incredible.
- She hasn't changed at all.

2404
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:43,600
Seul Ki still has it.

2405
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,310
- I liked her facial expression.
- Seul Ki.

2406
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:46,970
That brought back memories.

2407
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:48,250
- Seul Ki.
- That was great.

2408
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:50,270
- You are so cool.
- I am going insane, Seul Ki.

2409
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:53,290
- It's a little hot in here.
- Did it relieve your stress?

2410
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:54,890
It really did.

2411
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:59,350
There isn't a place
you can dance without worry.

2412
01:18:59,350 --> 01:19:00,720
I know.

2413
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,430
I felt like I was watching
an old clip.

2414
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:03,650
- Seriously.
- Yes.

2415
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,630
You don't look like your old self.

2416
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:07,390
Eunhyuk.

2417
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:08,670
Eunhyuk, hang in there.

2418
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:10,540
Eunhyuk, it means he likes you.

2419
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:12,140
- Hang in there.
- Eunhyuk.

2420
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:13,560
- Now, you are...
- Hold on.

2421
01:19:13,710 --> 01:19:14,840
- Suppress your anger.
- Your face improved a lot.

2422
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,140
Show us what you can do.
You are the dancing machine.

2423
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:19,100
- Just how bad did I look before?
- Dance as you did in the past.

2424
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,810
Eunhyuk, please dance
to "Sorry, Sorry."

2425
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:22,810
- "Sorry, Sorry?"
- Yes.

2426
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:24,420
Yes. Eunhyuk, please dance
to "Sorry, Sorry."

2427
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:26,420
That song came out
when I was 24 years old.

2428
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:28,980
He is still at the age
to work actively.

2429
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,890
(The politest dance in the world)

2430
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:37,130
Let's go.

2431
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,320
(Sorry, sorry)

2432
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,430
Look at her.

2433
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:45,000
(She dances with her injured body.)

2434
01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:47,100
- Don't do that.
- Don't move your legs.

2435
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,840
(His elementary school alumna
dances in the corner.)

2436
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:52,440
There you go.

2437
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:54,270
- He looks cool.
- There you go.

2438
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:55,880
(This is the secret
of winning the popularity vote.)

2439
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,550
- He is different.
- There you go.

2440
01:19:57,810 --> 01:19:59,010
He rubbed his hands well.

2441
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:00,420
- It has been a while.
- You did well.

2442
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,140
- He did well.
- Eunhyuk is cool.

2443
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:03,790
(Oh.)

2444
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:05,560
- What is it?
- What is it?

2445
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,850
I am curious, that's all.
He looks so much better now.

2446
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,560
(He attacks with compliments.)

2447
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,760
Isn't that right?

2448
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,860
- Eunhyuk, it's a compliment.
- Yes?

2449
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:15,630
- I know it's a compliment,
- That's right.

2450
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:17,390
but he said it too many times.

2451
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:19,170
- He is looking after you.
- That's right.

2452
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:20,400
- Don't misunderstand.
- All right.

2453
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,900
- So Min loved it too.
- She loved it too.

2454
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,010
So Min, you...

2455
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:26,350
No. Suppress yourself.

2456
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:27,770
- Don't dance.
- Suppress yourself.

2457
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:30,920
- That was insane.
- It's so good to see them.

2458
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,140
(The 3 guests brought back
memories of the past.)

2459
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:33,510
All of them are our age.

2460
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:37,310
With the five members who were born
in the year of the tiger,

2461
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:39,480
We will have The Myth of Dangun
in the Year of the Black Tiger Race.

2462
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:42,960
The three guests who were born
in the year of the tiger...

2463
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,890
as well as Se Chan and So Min
will be tigers...

2464
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:47,670
and the rest of the members
will be bears for the race.

2465
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:48,800
We are bears.

2466
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,690
It's an individual event
between ten members,

2467
01:20:50,690 --> 01:20:52,560
so make sure to collect
as many garlic cloves as possible.

2468
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:56,210
The top 3 will get a present
and the bottom 3 will get a penalty.

2469
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,180
But each mission will be a match
between the couples.

2470
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:02,750
A tiger and a bear
will be partners for the mission.

2471
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,510
Your ranking will determine
how many garlic cloves you receive.

2472
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:08,610
But among 5 tigers and 5 bears...

2473
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,560
are two poachers in disguise.

2474
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,680
Poachers?

2475
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:13,790
(Among 5 tigers and 5 bears
are 2 poachers in disguise.)

2476
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:15,890
(Poachers?)

2477
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:16,960
- Is there one among bears too?
- Yes.

2478
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,720
There is 1 among bears
and 1 among tigers.

2479
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,820
Come on.
When did they notify the poachers?

2480
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:24,170
If a poacher and an animal
are partners,

2481
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,710
half of the garlic cloves
the animal earns...

2482
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,470
will automatically go
to the poacher.

2483
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:31,900
So the poacher will take
half of the partner's garlic cloves.

2484
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:34,400
So it will be bad for you
if your partner is a poacher.

2485
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,400
(Staring)

2486
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,010
Those who place 1st and 2nd
in a mission...

2487
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:39,480
can check someone's identity
and switch their partners.

2488
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:41,440
Gosh, this is annoying.

2489
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:43,260
What is it?

2490
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:44,560
- Is it Haha?
- Did you get caught?

2491
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:45,810
Did you get caught?

2492
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:47,460
- Is it me?
- What?

2493
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:49,390
- For goodness' sake.
- I was just looking.

2494
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:52,130
- Jong Kook will tell us soon,
- Do we know who the poachers are?

2495
01:21:52,130 --> 01:21:53,260
so we just need to wait.

2496
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,500
Jong Kook, who do you think
are the poachers?

2497
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:56,970
I was just looking.

2498
01:21:56,970 --> 01:21:59,710
- This must be Kim Jong Kook Game.
- I was just looking.

2499
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:01,710
We haven't picked the poachers yet.

2500
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:03,400
- Really?
- You haven't picked them yet?

2501
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,270
- I felt so victimized.
- Come on.

2502
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:06,640
I was just looking.

2503
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:07,750
Did you see the way he looked at me?

2504
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:09,140
I was just looking.

2505
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:11,110
It was almost game over for you.

2506
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:12,180
- Seriously.
- He behaved naturally.

2507
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:14,110
- The poachers weren't decided.
- I didn't say anything.

2508
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:17,110
I didn't say anything.
Nothing was out of the ordinary.

2509
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:18,150
I thought the poachers were decided.

2510
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:21,180
Once the race ends,
you will arrest the poachers.

2511
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:22,320
I see. Okay.

2512
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,350
If you figure out who they are,

2513
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:25,720
you shouldn't tell the others
to give yourself an upper hand.

2514
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:26,820
All right.

2515
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:28,170
It's time to decide on your partner.

2516
01:22:28,630 --> 01:22:31,600
One at a time, the tigers will sit.

2517
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,340
- Then all five bears will go up.
- Really?

2518
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:36,730
If it's your favorite tiger's turn,

2519
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:38,680
lower the rope and the basket.

2520
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:41,100
- The tiger...
- I see.

2521
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:44,770
will cut the ropes
he or she doesn't like...

2522
01:22:44,770 --> 01:22:47,480
and put a plushie in the basket
of his or her choice.

2523
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:48,980
So it's random.

2524
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:50,590
The rotten rope.

2525
01:22:51,150 --> 01:22:53,590
- So you don't know who it will be.
- The rotten rope.

2526
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:55,350
You shouldn't look up
when you are sitting down.

2527
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:56,350
Okay. Let's go.

2528
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:57,560
Bears will go up.

2529
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:58,820
Let's go.

2530
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:02,520
All right.
The first tiger is So Min.

2531
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:06,060
Eunhyuk and Se Chan's faces
shine differently.

2532
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:08,260
- What?
- Your face looks like cement.

2533
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:09,340
For goodness' sake.

2534
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:10,570
Eunhyuk's face glows.

2535
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:12,940
- I went to the salon too.
- It glows. Look at Eunhyuk.

2536
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:14,050
He takes care of himself.

2537
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:16,550
Eunhyuk, this is a treatment
you haven't received before, right?

2538
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:19,640
- Eunhyuk, hang in there.
- What is up with him?

2539
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,480
- What is up with him?
- This is only the beginning.

2540
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,960
- He is messing with my mind.
- Hang in there.

2541
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,350
Brace yourself.

2542
01:23:25,790 --> 01:23:28,820
Eunhyuk looks different today.
He looks cool since he came alone.

2543
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:30,600
You are driving me crazy.

2544
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:32,130
I can't believe you.

2545
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:33,560
- So Min.
- You are driving me crazy.

2546
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,690
You should focus on getting better.

2547
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:39,170
All right. If you like the tiger,

2548
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:41,810
lower the basket
without making a sound.

2549
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:44,100
No one is making preparations.

2550
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:47,010
- So Min.
- No one is holding the basket.

2551
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:48,770
No one is turning around.

2552
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:50,810
Why is one toe so long?

2553
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:52,140
- Her toe is like that.
- It's really long.

2554
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:54,050
It looks like a finger.

2555
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:56,610
If any bears in the back...

2556
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:59,180
want to partner up with So Min,

2557
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:00,820
lower the basket.

2558
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:01,890
You can't look up.

2559
01:24:01,890 --> 01:24:02,930
I will put the plushie inside...

2560
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:04,300
- right away.
- Still...

2561
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:05,650
My goodness.

2562
01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:08,170
Isn't it too early to do that?

2563
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:09,430
- I...
- What?

2564
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:10,760
Are you serious?

2565
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:12,260
I will put the plushie inside
right away.

2566
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:14,340
Please lower the baskets quietly.

2567
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:15,540
They changed spots too.

2568
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:16,600
I will put the plushie inside
right away.

2569
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:19,750
- The baskets are coming down.
- Someone is looking...

2570
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:21,970
- without doing anything.
- All the baskets are coming down.

2571
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:25,110
(Pulling)

2572
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:27,890
Who is it?
Did the baskets come down?

2573
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:29,180
They are mischievous.

2574
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:30,180
(They pull up the baskets
so that she can't catch one.)

2575
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:31,460
All right.

2576
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:32,820
It will be bad if you get caught.

2577
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,460
- Be careful.
- It will be bad if you get caught.

2578
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:37,960
- I will give you ten seconds.
- Be careful.

2579
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:38,960
(Putting)

2580
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:40,860
She put it inside.

2581
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:42,260
- What?
- It will be bad if you get caught.

2582
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:43,860
- I will give you ten seconds.
- Be careful.

2583
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:45,390
She put it inside.

2584
01:24:45,670 --> 01:24:48,100
(What?)

2585
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:50,070
I told you that
it will be bad if you get caught.

2586
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:52,470
I told you that
it will be bad if you get caught.

2587
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:54,310
Jae Suk and So Min are partners.

2588
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:55,310
Come on.

2589
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:57,680
It's set.

2590
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,720
- That's incredible.
- Good job.

2591
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,180
I didn't mean to do that.

2592
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:03,510
- Congratulations.
- She is so fast.

2593
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:04,890
She is fast.

2594
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:06,560
- So Min.
- She has quick hands.

2595
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,930
How are you so fast?

2596
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:09,020
(The tiger with a fracture is happy
that she caught a bear.)

2597
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:10,630
It's set.

2598
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,320
- Thank goodness.
- That was fast.

2599
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,760
- Thank goodness.
- Hey.

2600
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,800
It was my first time
pulling a prank.

2601
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:20,100
(Eunhyuk is the next one
to choose a partner.)

2602
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:22,040
- He is happy.
- Eunhyuk, look up.

2603
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:23,070
Look up.

2604
01:25:23,070 --> 01:25:24,140
Congratulations.

2605
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,600
(Eunhyuk and Jong Kook
become partners.)

2606
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,720
Is this for real?

2607
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:30,810
It's for real.

2608
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:33,140
(Suk Jin and Seul Ki)

2609
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:35,750
(Ji Hyo and Soo Ah)

2610
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:38,310
(Haha and Se Chan)

2611
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:41,430
Now, you will have a random draw
to choose your identity.

2612
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:42,460
Please don't let me be a poacher.

2613
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:44,560
- You never know.
- Please don't let me be a poacher.

2614
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,000
It's like the Mafia Game.

2615
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,170
- That's right.
- The Mafia Game.

2616
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:48,220
You look for the mafia members.

2617
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,340
All right.

2618
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:53,640
Choose one of the tiger cards
to decide on your identity.

2619
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,430
- Will it last all day long?
- That's right.

2620
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:56,710
Please.

2621
01:25:56,710 --> 01:25:58,680
(Once a poacher, always a poacher.)

2622
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:03,470
(They check their identities.)

2623
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,750
(Eunhyuk is relaxed.)

2624
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:08,350
Out of these three?

2625
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:17,020
(He gets a poacher card!)

2626
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:19,860
Hang on. Wait a second.

2627
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:20,890
Eunhyuk.

2628
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:24,500
Wait a second.

2629
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,670
My heart is beating fast already.

2630
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:30,510
(He takes a big breath
and walks toward the door.)

2631
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:31,710
Wait a second.

2632
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:32,770
(He turns back.)

2633
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:35,270
(Eunhyuk partnered up
with Jong Kook too.)

2634
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:36,640
I won't be able to keep it a secret.

2635
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:41,290
(The tiger poacher
has his work cut out for him.)

2636
01:26:41,290 --> 01:26:42,310
What?

2637
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:45,720
(Will he be able to overcome
the difficult situation?)

2638
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:47,890
Hang on. Wait a second.

2639
01:26:47,890 --> 01:26:50,800
(Poacher wearing
Tiger's mask, Eunhyuk)

2640
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,500
(With 18 years of experience
on TV shows,)

2641
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,890
(he needs to fool
the members of Running Man.)

2642
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:58,390
(No, I'm not!)

2643
01:26:58,390 --> 01:27:03,380
(He pretends to be a tiger
and starts hunting.)

2644
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:05,640
(However,)

2645
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,380
(there's one more poacher
hiding in here.)

2646
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:08,570
(It's me.)

2647
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:10,220
(I know who it is.)

2648
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:13,010
(Take off the mask of an animal...)

2649
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:15,810
(and stimulate
the instinct of the poacher.)

2650
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:18,610
(Protect the garlic...)

2651
01:27:18,610 --> 01:27:22,480
(with human intelligence
and patience.)

2652
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:24,150
- Don't open it.
- It's Jong Kook.

2653
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:27,630
(Who's the protagonist
of the Myth of Dangun?)

2654
01:27:27,630 --> 01:27:29,640
(The Myth of Dangun
in the Year of the Black Tiger 2)
