1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,950
(Last week)

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,070
(The 3 guests who were born
in the Year of the Tiger)

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,570
(Eunhyuk, Hong Soo Ah, Bae Seul Ki)

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,670
(The Myth of Dangun
in the Year of the Black Tiger Race)

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,440
(Those who were born
in 1986 are tigers.)

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,750
(And the rest
of the members are bears.)

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,680
(It's an individual event where
they should gather garlic cloves.)

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,710
(The top 3 get a present
and the bottom 3 get a penalty.)

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,250
(A tiger and a bear
will be partners for the mission.)

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,670
(Among 5 tigers and 5 bears...)

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,070
(are 2 poachers in disguise.)

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,170
(There is 1 among bears
and 1 among tigers.)

13
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:58,250
(The poacher gets half of
the garlic cloves the animal earns.)

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,750
(So the animals don't want
to be partners with the poachers.)

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:10,250
(Those who arrest the poachers at the end,
get 20 garlic cloves.)

16
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,460
(Then they get to choose
their partners.)

17
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,830
She put it in.

18
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,540
(Bear Jae Suk and Tiger So Min)

19
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,100
Eunhyuk, look up.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,210
(Bear Jong Kook and Tiger Eunhyuk)

21
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,410
(There is Eunhyuk's fan
who only looks at Eunhyuk.)

22
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,240
(Bear Suk Jin and Tiger Seul Ki)

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,970
(Bear Ji Hyo and Tiger Soo Ah)

24
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,720
(Bear Haha and Tiger Se Chan)

25
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,550
(Now they have a random draw
to choose their identity.)

26
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,080
(One among tigers and
one among bears will be poachers.)

27
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,070
(One of the five tiger cards
is the poacher card.)

28
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,240
(Once a poacher, always a poacher.)

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,070
Pick one of the tiger cards.

30
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,330
(So Min chooses
her identity like that.)

31
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,050
(Eunhyuk's turn)

32
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,690
(Eunhyuk is the poacher!)

33
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,660
(Eunhyuk picks the poacher card.)

34
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,600
Wait a second.

35
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,030
My heart is beating fast already.

36
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,820
(Taking a big breath)

37
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,100
Wait a second.

38
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,760
(Once he goes in,)

39
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
(he has to face
his partner, Jong Kook.)

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,540
Why is it Jong Kook of all people?

41
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,150
(He goes back feeling nervous.)

42
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,150
What?

43
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,150
(Why isn't it opening?)

44
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,440
I hoped things would be easy today.

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,510
I won't be able to keep it a secret.

46
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,790
(Now Eunhyuk will get
half of his parters' garlic cloves.)

47
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,160
(Detective Kim's eyes are set.)

48
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,090
(Pale)

49
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,350
You are just...

50
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,160
suspicious of everyone.

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,790
Eunhyuk seems a little nervous.

52
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,730
Eunhyuk, are you the poacher?

53
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,370
No, I'm not. It's just Jong Kook...

54
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,760
suspects everyone no matter that.

55
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,570
- Right.
- He has a good hunch.

56
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,200
- He really does.
- It feels somewhat strange.

57
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,940
He tripped twice on his way here
when there was nothing.

58
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,700
- I see. Twice?
- Yes.

59
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,880
And he kept rambling.

60
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,940
He might be the poacher.

61
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,150
(What will happen to Poacher Eunhyuk
who has a scary partner?)

62
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,350
(After the tigers
choose their identities...)

63
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,090
Pick one of the bear cards.

64
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,380
If it says a bear,
you're a regular bear.

65
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,690
If it says a poacher,
you're a poacher.

66
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,190
I've been unlucky lately.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,720
I really don't want to be a poacher.

68
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,100
(Big Nose comes back
after choosing his identity.)

69
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,160
This is funny.

70
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,000
It feels strange.

71
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,130
- Suk Jin is being really strange.
- He's suspicious.

72
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,670
What took you so long?

73
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,040
Suk Jin, what makes you so happy?

74
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,940
- He's being strange.
- Mr. Poacher.

75
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,880
- What took you so long?
- Are you the poacher?

76
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,570
It looks like he's caught in a net.

77
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,650
(He captured himself.)

78
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,040
Look at him.

79
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,320
- He's being strange.
- Don't say that.

80
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,590
- He is strange.
- Isn't that strange?

81
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,790
My gosh.

82
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,950
- He's like this.
- I'll catch him.

83
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,160
- Catch him.
- I'm going to catch him.

84
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,160
I guess he's really the poacher.

85
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,570
- We have the poacher.
- I feel good when I'm suspected.

86
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,970
- I guess it's him.
- Go ahead and suspect me.

87
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,470
- It's him.
- I bet that's true.

88
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,870
- He must be the poacher.
- He is.

89
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,260
- He's the poacher.
- Suspect me.

90
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,370
It's Suk Jin.

91
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,630
But I won't catch him.

92
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,940
On purpose?

93
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,540
(Eunhyuk is the poacher
among tigers.)

94
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,850
(Who is the poacher
among bears then?)

95
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,450
All right.
There are two poachers here.

96
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,590
Those who partnered up
with the poachers will get...

97
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,420
only half of their garlic cloves
even if they win.

98
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,590
Really?

99
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,620
- Aren't you the poacher?
- No, I'm not.

100
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,960
I'll give you a mission
where you can earn garlic cloves.

101
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,060
It's called Furious Race.

102
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,730
- Okay. Furious Race!
- Furious Race.

103
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,640
Okay, Eunhyuk. It's Furious Race.

104
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,430
- He's good at races.
- I can see...

105
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,040
- how things will go today.
- I know.

106
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,800
Hey, your shoulders are curled in.

107
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,140
- All right.
- I have the text neck.

108
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,350
That's not good.

109
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,540
You will pick a toy car each.

110
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,410
And you will have a race
with it on a treadmill.

111
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,890
That will be fun.

112
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,460
The first team that is completely
wiped out loses the game.

113
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,460
Is it a random game?

114
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,050
Your ranking will determine
how many garlic cloves you receive.

115
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,530
We have ten toy cars here.
Choose one each.

116
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,720
- Do we get to choose one?
- Pick one, Eunhyuk.

117
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,700
- One for each?
- One for each.

118
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,560
Should I pick a small one or a big one?
I'll pick a big one.

119
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,970
Can we just pick one?

120
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,160
- I'll choose this one.
- This looks strong.

121
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,340
There are only trucks left.

122
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,410
I shouldn't have chosen this.

123
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,800
I like that car. Do you want
to switch your car with mine?

124
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,950
- Which one?
- I like that car.

125
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,210
Well, I'm sorry.

126
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,540
- I'm ashamed.
- He's...

127
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,150
That's perfect for you.

128
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,450
- It's perfect for me, right?
- I think that's good.

129
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,610
- Gosh.
- Seul Ki wants to switch.

130
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,760
This might be strong.

131
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,980
- This is a patrol car.
- This one looks weak.

132
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,480
This is a patrol car.

133
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,350
But the sports cars were already picked.

134
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,660
Eunhyuk, that's...
Why did he pick that one?

135
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,420
He was very late picking the car.

136
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,790
Because you're the poacher?

137
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,640
- What are you talking about?
- You're the poacher among tigers.

138
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,800
- He is the poacher.
- I think he is.

139
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,060
- Look at the color.
- What?

140
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,410
- Me?
- Yes.

141
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,340
It says "I'm the poacher."

142
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,970
- Who?
- It says NM.

143
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,410
- Does it mean I'm the poacher?
- What?

144
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,950
- Is that it?
- Yes.

145
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,080
You can put it down now.

146
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,450
There's nothing
we can do about this.

147
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,350
- Can we place it anywhere we want?
- Can I put it on here?

148
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,040
In front of yours like this?

149
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,520
- Like this?
- Let's do this. Run.

150
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,960
- All right. Let's do this.
- Good luck.

151
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,180
Don't touch them.

152
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,830
- How would it go?
- Please.

153
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,160
- Please.
- It should run.

154
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,860
It's starting.

155
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,220
(The race starts.)

156
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,540
- Let's go.
- It's moving.

157
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,060
(Soo Ah, Ji Hyo, Jae Suk, So Min,
Seul Ki, Suk Jin)

158
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,730
(Haha, Jong Kook, and Eunhyuk
are out as soon as it starts.)

159
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,080
- I'm so nervous.
- My goodness.

160
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,730
- Gosh.
- They're out.

161
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,210
(Soo Ah, Ji Hyo, Jae Suk, So Min,
Seul Ki, Suk Jin, Se Chan)

162
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,850
- Okay.
- This is amazing.

163
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,870
(So Min, Suk Jin,
and Ji Hyo are out.)

164
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,790
My gosh.

165
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,350
(There are only 4 cars left.)

166
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,610
- Hey, Seul Ki.
- It's you and me.

167
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,830
(Jae Suk's sports car and
Seul Ki's patrol car are competing.)

168
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,850
- Hey, Seul Ki.
- It's going well.

169
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,530
- Good.
- It's holding mine.

170
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,420
- It's the patrol car.
- It's out.

171
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,160
It's stuck.

172
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,270
I'm winning. I'm the first.

173
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,860
- There you go.
- It's stuck.

174
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,900
- I'm winning.
- Please.

175
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,100
What is this?

176
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,560
- What is it doing here?
- Just go.

177
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,210
No. Don't touch it, Seul Ki.

178
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,710
Se Chan, charge forward.

179
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,600
Hey.

180
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,780
- Just hang on to it.
- No!

181
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,540
Don't blow at it. Stop it.

182
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,450
- Oh, no.
- It's moving.

183
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,650
(Se Chan is out.)

184
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,980
My gosh.

185
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,410
Oh, dear.

186
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,790
This is the final.

187
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,790
(Now only Jae Suk
and Seul Ki are left.)

188
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,350
- Hey.
- It's fast.

189
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,100
- Get ready.
- Oh, no.

190
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,220
- Oh, no.
- My gosh.

191
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,220
(Which car will survive
until the end?)

192
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,360
- It's holding Seul Ki's car.
- This is so thrilling.

193
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,060
- It's holding Seul Ki's car.
- This is so thrilling.

194
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,730
- Seul Ki wins.
- Seul Ki?

195
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,430
It's holding Seul Ki's car.

196
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,040
(Seul Ki wins by a neck.)

197
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,600
- Seul Ki, you're the winner.
- It supported her car.

198
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,970
(Contrary to their expectation,
the patrol car beat the sports car.)

199
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,720
My car helped Seul Ki's.

200
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,870
- This is fun.
- It's so fun.

201
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,350
- Let's play one more time.
- One more time.

202
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,980
- Can we play again?
- Let's play one more round.

203
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,050
Now we know which car is good.

204
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,090
All right then. Without the winners,

205
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,990
the rest four teams
will play it again.

206
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,990
(Without the winners,
Suk Jin and Seul Ki, they play it again.)

207
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,790
- Well done.
- Nice.

208
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,490
Let's play it again.

209
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,120
This is really fun.

210
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,270
Let's go.

211
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,730
- All right. Are you ready?
- Yes.

212
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,910
- This is so fun.
- Okay.

213
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,280
That's good. Done.

214
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,740
- All right.
- This is really thrilling, right?

215
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,080
- It's fun.
- Why is it so fun?

216
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,520
- Okay.
- Let's begin.

217
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,580
I'm so thrilled.

218
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,240
(They are just toy cars,
but it's as thrilling as the F1 race.)

219
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,790
Okay. Mine looks good.

220
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,090
(The race starts.)

221
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,890
- It's moving.
- It's moving back.

222
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,260
Oh, no.

223
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,850
(Soo Ah, Jae Suk, Se Chan)

224
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,530
- Hey.
- Nice.

225
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,970
Oh, no.

226
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,860
- Hey.
- Mine has survived.

227
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,860
(A 5-car rear-end collision occurs.)

228
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,930
- Eunhyuk.
- This is a good spot.

229
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,240
(Both Jong Kook
and Eunhyuk survived.)

230
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,640
- Se Chan.
- It's done.

231
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,150
Go.

232
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,910
- Don't blow at it.
- Go!

233
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,980
- Hang in there.
- Engine!

234
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,490
- Hang in there.
- Engine!

235
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,950
Superpower beam!

236
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,420
- Hey.
- No.

237
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,900
(Se Chan's car starts to come
to life with the superpower beam.)

238
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,920
Go.

239
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,500
- Good.
- There it goes.

240
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,590
- What?
- Nice.

241
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,190
This is a good car.

242
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,370
- No, don't touch it.
- Touch it.

243
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,690
Hit it.

244
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,930
Go forward.

245
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,770
That one is amazing.

246
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,560
This one is unbelievable.

247
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,140
- What?
- No.

248
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,010
- No!
- Move backward.

249
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,280
No!

250
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,380
(Jong Kook's car starts
to be pushed backward.)

251
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,480
Darn it.

252
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,810
All right.

253
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,710
- Good.
- It's coming.

254
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,490
We're almost there.

255
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,990
My gosh.

256
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,620
Whose car is that?

257
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,790
This is like a scene from a movie.

258
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,860
- What do we do?
- This is a movie.

259
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,770
(Screaming)

260
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,460
(Hey!)

261
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,540
Are you controlling the car?

262
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,040
Okay. It's done.

263
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,060
No!

264
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,910
(Eunhyuk, Se Chan)

265
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,040
(Se Chan's car
suddenly drifts backward.)

266
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,380
No!

267
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,010
(It's finally out.)

268
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,210
(The winners are
Jong Kook and Eunhyuk.)

269
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,410
(Se Chan's car failed to finish
despite the power beam and booster.)

270
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,520
He won.

271
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,910
- This is really fun.
- That was unbelievable.

272
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,580
I guess this car knows
how a variety show works.

273
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,310
All right.

274
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,990
You are number 2,
and you are number 3.

275
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,080
We're number three.

276
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,550
Team Song Ji Hyo is number four.

277
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,900
Team Yoo Jae Suk is number five.

278
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,900
- That's disappointing.
- It was so much fun.

279
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,400
The winners are
Suk Jin and Seul Ki.

280
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,740
You two get ten garlic cloves.

281
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,140
And you get 8, 6,

282
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,960
four, and two garlic cloves
respectively.

283
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,200
We get 4 and 2 garlic cloves?

284
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,480
- We get 6.
- We get only 2 cloves.

285
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,150
- But the thing is,
- Eight cloves.

286
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,280
those who partnered up
with the poachers...

287
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,520
will lose half of
their garlic cloves to the poachers.

288
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,580
(The partners of the poachers lose
half of the cloves to the poachers.)

289
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,990
(If Jong Kook is not the poacher,
Eunhyuk should have 15 cloves now.)

290
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,390
- But we don't know that.
- Right.

291
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,360
- We will find out later.
- Of course, we will.

292
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,490
You will find out at the end.

293
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,730
- I see.
- At the end?

294
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,000
- We don't know that now.
- What?

295
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,660
Haha took
three of your garlic cloves.

296
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,030
- What?
- That's not true.

297
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,660
Now that he says that,
he seems really suspicious today.

298
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,930
- Okay.
- Seriously, it's not me.

299
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,870
- I'm 100 percent sure.
- Can you give us some hints?

300
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,200
I'll give you a hint.

301
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,240
I said those who placed 1st and 2nd
would receive special benefits.

302
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,670
Those who place first...

303
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,040
(The benefit for 1st place)

304
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,980
get to know the number
of their garlic cloves...

305
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,710
and the identities
of their partners.

306
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,940
- Then it's over.
- The first place?

307
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,050
Both members will
get to know all that.

308
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,290
- If one of them is a poacher...
- What happens then?

309
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,860
If they reach an agreement,

310
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,090
they can switch their partners.

311
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,230
If they don't want to,
they can keep the team as it is.

312
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,460
Haha is really shocked.

313
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,790
No. I don't care.

314
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,090
- You're busy doing some thinking.
- Who placed first?

315
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,870
- Suk Jin.
- Okay.

316
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,300
If there's a poacher...

317
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,140
Jong Kook, what if it turns out
I'm not the poacher?

318
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,610
- I'm not the poacher.
- Just keep it up.

319
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,300
- All right.
- Keep up the good work.

320
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,750
For the second place,

321
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,120
we will give the information
to only one of them.

322
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,990
(Only 1 member of the 2nd place
will get the information...)

323
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,490
(on their identities and the number
of their garlic cloves.)

324
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,580
That's really nice.

325
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,950
We will pick one member
through a random draw.

326
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,490
Can we switch partners...

327
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,680
- when both members are animals?
- You can do that.

328
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,730
Eunhyuk wants to switch partners.

329
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,550
I want to switch partners
even if he's an animal.

330
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,660
- Hey.
- Jong Kook.

331
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,000
All right then. The first-place
team will leave the room first.

332
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,160
Let's go.

333
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,240
(Suk Jin and Seul Ki are going out
to check their identities.)

334
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,560
- You're not the poacher, are you?
- What?

335
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,270
- You're not the poacher, are you?
- No, I'm not.

336
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,370
I'm not the poacher.

337
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,170
It's in there.

338
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,110
All right. I will tell you...

339
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,310
the number of your garlic cloves
and the identities of your partners.

340
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,650
How many did we win?
We got ten cloves, right?

341
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,180
You got ten garlic cloves each.

342
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,450
Please open yours. Both of you.

343
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,490
Open it together.

344
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,320
(One of them has
only 5 garlic cloves.)

345
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,530
What would you do?

346
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,130
(Will they switch partners
after checking their identities?)

347
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,530
- We still have a long way to go.
- I won't switch.

348
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,920
- Good.
- We won't switch.

349
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,230
You may go back in.

350
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,410
(They didn't switch their partners
after checking the identities.)

351
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,880
(The 1st-place team is done.)

352
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,410
- What?
- What's all this?

353
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,300
All right. Only one of you...

354
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,040
will get to know
your partner's identity.

355
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,540
You will play rock-paper-scissors,
and the winner will hear it.

356
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,760
(They play rock-paper-scissors,
and the winner gets to hear it.)

357
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,290
You...

358
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,320
Are you sure you're not it?

359
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,360
I'm not the poacher.

360
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,630
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

361
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,690
If you're not the poacher,

362
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,290
I want to show you...

363
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,900
whether I'm not the poacher or not.

364
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,090
(I want to show you...
whether I'm not the poacher or not.)

365
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,770
- What do you think?
- Then I'll hear it.

366
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,770
(Jong Kook suddenly wants
to show Eunhyuk his identity.)

367
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,410
- Then I'll hear it.
- All right.

368
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,010
I'll show you...

369
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,380
- my identity.
- Okay.

370
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,040
- But...
- Them I'll hear it.

371
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,380
Hang on.

372
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,840
(Viper realizes
that something's strange.)

373
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,540
If that's what you want,
I'll get the information.

374
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,990
Are you sure you're not it?

375
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,680
I'm not the poacher. I'm a tiger.

376
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,210
I'm just a tiger.

377
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,360
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

378
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,820
Rock-paper-scissors

379
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,160
Gosh, I won.

380
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,560
(I'm doomed.)

381
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,250
You know what?
If you check it right now,

382
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,380
you will feel bad
that it's just over like that.

383
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,170
"What? Is this it?"

384
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,410
- You think?
- Yes.

385
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,910
Then I should take a look.

386
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,620
(Then I should take a look.)

387
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,720
(His trick doesn't work.)

388
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,730
I'll show you
the number of your garlic cloves...

389
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,680
- and your partner's identity.
- Okay.

390
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,020
I knew it.

391
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,730
(Your partner is the poacher,)

392
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,500
(and you currently have
4 garlic cloves.)

393
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,500
- Jong Kook, it's not like that.
- Come here.

394
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,640
- Jong Kook, listen to me.
- I knew it.

395
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,770
Seriously,

396
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,530
I find myself surprising myself.
When he walked back,

397
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,480
he tripped like this.

398
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,030
And he kept rambling.

399
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,670
So I thought he was suspicious.

400
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,010
Why is it Jong Kook of all people?

401
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,350
I got goosebumps.

402
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,170
If I arrest him at the end,

403
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,150
how many garlic cloves will I get?

404
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,810
If you catch the two poachers,
you will get 20 garlic cloves.

405
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,490
I'll get 20 garlic cloves?

406
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,890
(The one who arrests the poachers
will get 20 garlic cloves.)

407
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,820
I have to catch one more.

408
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,900
You have to arrest
both the poachers.

409
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,520
Is it better for me
to keep it to myself?

410
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,690
It has pros and cons.

411
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,790
If you keep your team as it is,

412
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,740
you can hide
Eunhyuk's identity from others.

413
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,770
So I don't have to tell people...

414
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,340
- that he's the poacher.
- That's right.

415
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,800
(Hiding Eunhyuk's identity
from others can be a good strategy.)

416
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,010
All right then.

417
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,540
You'll keep it as it is, right?

418
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,750
(Polite)

419
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,520
Do you want my help?

420
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,620
Yes.

421
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,780
I'm making it look
like Haha is the poacher.

422
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,250
All right then.

423
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,050
If we stay here for too long,
people might find it suspicious.

424
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,360
Shall we go?

425
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,320
Even if we don't switch partners,
someone else might switch.

426
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,790
- Right.
- Let's go.

427
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,870
(Jong Kook decided to maintain
his team to keep his secret.)

428
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,730
Shall we go in with a smile?

429
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,100
With a smile.

430
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,340
Who received the information?

431
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,900
How did it go?

432
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,240
- We?
- We're keeping the team.

433
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,740
- Did you switch partners?
- We'll be happy together.

434
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,800
Hang on.

435
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,770
So one of you doesn't
know the information?

436
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,850
- One of us doesn't know,
- Right.

437
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,170
- but we have faith.
- Sure. What matters is...

438
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,750
that we win the games.

439
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,850
All right then.

440
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,360
The 1st and 2nd-place teams
have decided to maintain the teams.

441
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,950
- They are not switching teams?
- No.

442
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,050
You will get changed
for the next mission then.

443
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,100
Okay.

444
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,100
Please sit with your partners.

445
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,770
- Eunhyuk.
- Yes.

446
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,230
- Gosh, Eunhyuk.
- Yes.

447
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,870
He will come to play soccer with us.

448
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,600
- Who said that?
- Sit.

449
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,740
I'll just give it a try.

450
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,060
- Just come.
- Jong Kook.

451
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,510
It will never end there.

452
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,140
- Eunhyuk...
- What?

453
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,980
took the bait.

454
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,800
- He took the bait.
- Why?

455
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,650
Gosh, when I heard
their conversation,

456
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,440
I thought he shouldn't go.

457
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,020
He has a good reason to join us.

458
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,020
He lives with his manager,

459
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,120
- and his manager plays on our team.
- Right.

460
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,990
So he should join us too.

461
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,780
But my manager always comes home...

462
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,420
looking depressed
after soccer games.

463
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,000
He gets scolded a lot.

464
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,770
- He's not easily daunted.
- "Hey!"

465
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,370
- I know.
- "Take good care of it!"

466
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,500
"Take good care of it."

467
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,840
All right.
This is the first mission.

468
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,110
It's a game...

469
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,510
where you should protect
your partners with faith.

470
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,400
It's called
Bodyguard Cham, Cham, Cham.

471
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,540
- Bodyguard Cham, Cham, Cham?
- Cham, Cham, Cham?

472
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,980
Two teams will play
against each other in each round.

473
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,440
The representative of each team
will play Cham, Cham, Cham...

474
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,350
using this finger.

475
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,550
The other member will...

476
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,860
attack and defend
instead of the representative.

477
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,680
(The remaining 1 member
will attack and defend.)

478
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,860
- Like this?
- That means...

479
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,550
(The bodyguards will
attack and defend.)

480
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,260
So I should be the bodyguard.

481
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,060
No, I can be a bodyguard.

482
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,560
So the representatives will
play Cham, Cham, Cham.

483
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,800
And the bodyguards
will either attack or defend.

484
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,800
The bodyguard whose representative
loses will have to defend.

485
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,800
And there's more.

486
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,110
If you fail to attack,

487
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,670
you're supposed to lose
the right to attack.

488
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,940
But in this game, your
opponent can attack you right away.

489
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,090
The opponent can attack.

490
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,020
It counts as success.

491
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,860
You will get to attack
five times each.

492
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,180
The team that attacks more
will win the game.

493
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,250
Then the team that has
a poacher in it...

494
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,490
should lose the game then.

495
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,220
But the poachers also
need to earn more garlic cloves.

496
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,930
- So they try their best.
- That might be better.

497
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,900
Really? Isn't it better
for them to hide their identities?

498
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,340
It's up to them.

499
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,170
- So what's your plan?
- What do you mean?

500
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,670
What's your plan?

501
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,310
I'll just try my best.

502
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,010
- Don't you have a special plan?
- I'm not the poacher.

503
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,670
I'm just a bear.

504
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,120
- You are?
- Yes.

505
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,510
That's exactly what
a poacher would do.

506
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,740
Exactly. Right?

507
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,150
You're being completely fooled
by him.

508
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,590
- That could be the case.
- You don't have any plans.

509
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,450
You might be embarrassed at the end.
Jong Kook will probably say,

510
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,800
- "Why didn't you deny more firmly?"
- Right.

511
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,130
- Yes, that's right.
- "You seemed suspicious."

512
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,220
"You acted weird."

513
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,840
That's not it.
You won't do your best.

514
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,040
- No. I'm not a poacher.
- Right?

515
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,140
- He can't deny it.
- He's already acting suspiciously.

516
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,840
- He speaks strangely.
- Today, Jong Kook is Detective Kim.

517
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,700
- "I'm not a poacher."
- He's driving me nuts.

518
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,500
If Haha were one of the poachers,
I'd be shocked.

519
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,550
- I told you I wasn't one.
- It'd be shocking.

520
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,470
We'll decide the teams to have
a match by drawing lots.

521
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,050
- E would be the best.
- Indeed.

522
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,050
- E would be the best.
- Seul Ki, go ahead...

523
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,010
- and pick one. Pick E.
- I want E.

524
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,650
If you pick E, you'll be ranked
no lower than third.

525
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,450
- They must've picked E.
- I picked E.

526
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,860
(Jae Suk and So Min picked E.)

527
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,750
- E!
- Who picked A?

528
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,870
- Okay.
- Who picked C?

529
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,130
- This is great.
- Stop it.

530
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,230
- Oh, this team?
- We picked B.

531
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,840
The first round is Haha and Se Chan
versus Soo Ah and Ji Hyo.

532
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,310
Okay.

533
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,380
- All right.
- But I don't know the rules.

534
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,880
We'll let you play
a practice game first.

535
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,310
Haha, you can attack first.

536
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,410
Cham, cham, cham

537
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,650
Cham, cham, cham

538
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,120
(Soo Ah failed to defend.)

539
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,320
- Then I hit her. You must block it.
- Right. Good.

540
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,360
- You're supposed to...
- You should've blocked it.

541
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,120
- Ji Hyo should block the attack.
- Correct.

542
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,650
- Try not to hit me with the lid.
- I won't hit you.

543
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,490
- Why are you so anxious?
- I might accidentally hit you.

544
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,560
Be careful not to hit my nose.

545
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,800
(She informed Ji Hyo
of what she should know.)

546
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,840
My gosh.

547
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,040
(She warned Ji Hyo not to hit
her nose hastily.)

548
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,370
- Okay. I'm glad you told us that.
- I can't...

549
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,960
I can't get another nose job.

550
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,000
- "I can't get another nose job."
- I can hit your head, right?

551
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,310
- This is my last nose.
- She's funny.

552
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,240
- Her last nose of her life.
- Her last nose.

553
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,910
Let's continue the practice game.
Soo Ah will attack this time.

554
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,890
Cham, cham, cham

555
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,940
- Then...
- Right. Good.

556
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,090
- That's good. Ji Hyo.
- Like this?

557
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,180
I'll use my right hand.

558
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,030
- That's not how you should hit him.
- Exactly.

559
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,330
- I'll show you.
- You don't have to.

560
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,950
(The entertainer with 31 years
of experience will demonstrate.)

561
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,190
- You should hit him hard like this.
- Don't hit me with the edge.

562
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,370
You should hit him hard like this.

563
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,100
- Jae Suk.
- Come on. It's okay.

564
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,230
It doesn't hurt at all.

565
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,930
- Se Chan, hit him with it.
- Go ahead and hit me.

566
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,540
- Okay. Here I go.
- It doesn't hurt.

567
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,810
Jae Suk, you need to...

568
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,700
(Hitting hard)

569
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,440
- It doesn't hurt at all.
- Really?

570
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,580
It doesn't hurt. Does it hurt?

571
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,790
- It could make you upset though.
- No, it doesn't hurt.

572
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,950
- It doesn't hurt.
- Right?

573
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,910
- Give it to me. It looks fun.
- That was funny.

574
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,390
(Seok Sam tries getting hit
with a foam sword too.)

575
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,650
- It doesn't hurt at all.
- Right. Exactly.

576
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,860
Hit me. It doesn't hurt.

577
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,830
(Annoyed)

578
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,830
Hey.

579
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,900
- You told me to do it.
- It doesn't hurt.

580
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,070
- It doesn't hurt at all.
- But it was annoying.

581
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,810
- Anyway, it doesn't hurt.
- It doesn't hurt.

582
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,230
- It doesn't hurt, so don't worry.
- Suk Jin, are you okay?

583
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,050
- I'm fine. It didn't hurt at all.
- Okay. Great.

584
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,080
- Which team will attack first?
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

585
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,850
- Okay.
- Rock-paper-scissors

586
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,080
- Good.
- You go first.

587
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,550
- Soo Ah, you have 5 attacks.
- I have 5 attacks? Okay.

588
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,010
- Yes. You go first.
- I'm ready.

589
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,050
Cham, cham, cham

590
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,480
(Haha defended successfully.)

591
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,950
Hey.

592
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,250
Cham, cham, cham

593
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
(Ji Hyo hit Haha
when he defended successfully.)

594
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,830
- You should've hit Soo Ah.
- I won.

595
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,430
- You should've hit Soo Ah.
- That wasn't all.

596
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,800
This is how Soo Ah moved her hand.

597
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,660
She moved it like this.
Cham, cham, cham

598
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,960
- I thought she pointed upward.
- What was that?

599
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,500
- Soo Ah, did you cast a spell?
- Does she have four attacks left?

600
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:54,970
I almost turned my head upward.

601
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,880
- Don't cast a spell on him.
- Okay.

602
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,380
- I'll swing it like this. Got it.
- You have four attacks left.

603
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,820
Se Chan was supposed to
hit her, right?

604
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,850
- That's correct.
- Cham, cham, cham

605
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,620
(Haha defended successfully again.)

606
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,250
Cham, cham, cham

607
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,560
- Okay.
- Hey. Gosh.

608
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,790
Cham

609
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,790
(Upset)

610
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,830
- I won, you little...
- I hit her.

611
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,690
- Then why did I get hit?
- I don't know. I hit her.

612
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,250
- Ji Hyo, you were supposed to...
- I hit Soo Ah as I should.

613
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,420
- I hit her. I did nothing wrong.
- I thought we won.

614
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,960
- Didn't we win? I was mistaken.
- Ji Hyo, why did you hit him?

615
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,160
- I was mistaken.
- Ji Hyo.

616
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,610
- Why did I get hit?
- Ji Hyo.

617
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,140
- It's 1 to 0.
- Okay.

618
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,660
I'm ready.

619
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,080
- Cham, cham, cham
- Okay.

620
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,740
(Spaced out)

621
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,050
- Right. I was supposed to block it.
- What is wrong with you?

622
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,820
- I didn't know I was good at this.
- Yes, I should've blocked it.

623
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,680
- I'm good at this game.
- You did well.

624
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
- Soo Ah.
- Ji Hyo,

625
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,480
- you should block his attack.
- You're doing it wrong.

626
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,390
You say it too slowly.
Cham, cham, cham

627
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,750
- Cham, cham, cham
- Oh, I didn't realize that.

628
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,030
He could defend
because you said it so slowly.

629
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,150
- I see.
- Cham, cham, cham

630
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,900
Anyone can defend
if you say it so slowly.

631
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,990
- I didn't realize that.
- Why would you tell her that?

632
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,340
- Let's continue.
- You shouldn't...

633
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,460
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Let's continue.

634
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,570
- I want to sit here.
- I almost sat on your lap.

635
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,960
- Why didn't you sit on his lap?
- This is...

636
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,730
- This is my seat.
- Sit on his lap. It's okay.

637
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,200
- But...
- I think it's nice.

638
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,940
- I know. I wish I hadn't seen him.
- You two looked so sweet.

639
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,320
You should say it quickly.

640
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,940
Ready. Go.
Cham, cham, cham

641
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,120
- That's good.
- That must hurt.

642
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
Ready. Go.

643
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,410
(Soo Ah lost again.)

644
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,710
- Okay.
- Good.

645
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,250
- Ji Hyo, you should've moved fast.
- I think...

646
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,420
- You should do your best.
- I think I'm not bad at this game.

647
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,450
- It's Haha's turn to attack.
- Got it.

648
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,530
- Here I go.
- Okay.

649
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,630
(It's Haha's turn to attack.)

650
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,720
Cham, cham, cham

651
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,140
(Soo Ah defended successfully.)

652
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,190
No, that's not what you should do.

653
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,430
Cham, cham, cham

654
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,900
(Soo Ah won, but Se Chan hit her.)

655
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,140
- Did I do something wrong?
- Hey.

656
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,200
Ji Hyo only blocks,
and Se Chan only hits Soo Ah.

657
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,350
Ji Hyo, you were supposed to
hit Haha.

658
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,470
- Aren't they just simple?
- I got hit here.

659
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,550
Aren't they all idiots?

660
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,980
I could see him hitting me.

661
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,150
This is like an idiot's game.

662
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,790
Cham, cham, cham

663
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,890
(What?)

664
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,530
(Ji Hyo picked up the foam sword.)

665
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,490
- She blocked it with the sword.
- He hit me again.

666
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,720
- Instead of the lid.
- She can't use the sword.

667
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,900
- Ji Hyo, you blocked it well.
- You were amazing.

668
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,230
- That was hilarious.
- Soo Ah.

669
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,400
You shouldn't turn your head
in the same direction.

670
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,840
- Why do I keep following his hand?
- She got hit again.

671
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,730
- Just look at my hand.
- Turn your head to the other side.

672
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,440
- To the other side.
- Turn it in the opposite direction.

673
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,900
- Cham, cham, cham
- Good.

674
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,850
- She couldn't help it.
- Exactly.

675
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,320
- She just followed his hand.
- She's too naive.

676
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,710
Cham, cham, cham

677
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,890
Cham, cham, cham

678
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,420
(Ji Hyo hit Haha.)

679
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,480
(The zoned-out sisters
finally pulled it off.)

680
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,990
- I did right, didn't I?
- Why was I hit with the blue one?

681
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,190
- Yes, you did.
- No, you weren't hit with this.

682
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,600
I think I saw this blue sword
when I got hit.

683
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,830
You were mistaken.

684
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,900
The game is over.

685
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,400
The score is 5 to 1.

686
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,040
- Haha and Se Chan won.
- Okay.

687
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,660
(Haha and Se Chan won
with a score of 5 to 1.)

688
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,110
- Okay.
- We're up next.

689
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,810
Next, Jong Kook and Eunhyuk
versus Suk Jin and Seul Ki.

690
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,640
This game requires...
Are you good at this game, Eunhyuk?

691
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,610
- I'll play the game.
- Okay. Go ahead.

692
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,280
- Do you want to play the game?
- Yes.

693
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,970
- Really?
- Wait. Gosh, I have to hit a girl.

694
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,320
Oh, no. I'm scared.
I'm sure it'll hurt so much.

695
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,290
- It's okay, Seul Ki. This is...
- Really?

696
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,910
My gosh.

697
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,010
- This is...
- Really?

698
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,130
(Startled)

699
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,180
You said it was okay.

700
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,150
Look at his hair. His hair got flat.

701
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,460
- Why were you so surprised?
- Hey.

702
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,190
- Are you okay?
- His hair got flat.

703
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,990
- You said it was okay.
- Yes, I did.

704
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,990
Suk Jin was startled.

705
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,400
- I meant it, but it swept my face.
- Was it okay?

706
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,900
- I could see his hair flapping.
- Was it okay?

707
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,610
- He still looks scared.
- Suk Jin, be confident.

708
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,970
- Hey. Then should I play the game?
- Yes?

709
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,120
- It's okay. I don't mind being hit.
- Good. Absolutely.

710
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,910
- I don't want to hit her.
- All right. Jong Kook...

711
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,350
- You made the right decision.
- But getting hit by Jong Kook...

712
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,090
would be a good memory.

713
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,010
- Stop it. Come and sit here.
- Okay.

714
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,090
- Would you choose a good memory...
- A good memory, my foot.

715
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,480
or safety?

716
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,330
- I'd be in a difficult position.
- Let's play two rounds for now.

717
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,600
- Okay.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

718
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
(They switched their seats
in the end.)

719
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,920
- Rock-paper-scissors
- The pot lid if he loses.

720
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,160
Rock-paper-scissors

721
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,160
Good. Do you want to attack first
or not?

722
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,260
- Will you attack first?
- I'll attack first.

723
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,000
- All right. Go on.
- Okay.

724
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,040
You can do it.

725
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,470
- I've already made up my mind.
- Cham, cham, cham

726
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,470
(Oh, gosh.)

727
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,940
- Cham, cham, cham
- Great.

728
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,000
- My goodness.
- Oh, gosh.

729
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,410
- Seul Ki, lift it up more quickly.
- Cham, cham, cham

730
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,180
Cham, cham, cham

731
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,120
Cham, cham, cham

732
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,790
Cham, cham, cham

733
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,750
You're so fast. Can you slow down?

734
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,090
- Hey!
- It's over.

735
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,130
(They attacked 5 times consecutively
at high speed.)

736
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,180
We won.

737
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,490
- Hey, that was too fast.
- Great job.

738
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,030
- That was too fast.
- That was neat.

739
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,490
- Great. You should do it fast.
- Good job, Eunhyuk.

740
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,660
- Speed up. Move fast.
- He was amazing.

741
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,640
- You punk, I told you to slow down.
- I knew he'd do well.

742
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,700
- Wait. Did he attack five times?
- You did great.

743
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,470
You blocked 1 attack,
so they got 4 points.

744
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,640
- Seul Ki blocked it well.
- I blocked it.

745
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,440
It was so funny
because she was holding the lid.

746
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,940
- It's Suk Jin's turn to attack.
- All right.

747
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,890
(It's time for Suk Jin
to have his revenge.)

748
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,620
- I should prepare to block...
- Cham, cham, cham

749
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,180
Oh, gosh. Jong Kook.

750
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,560
- I should prepare to block...
- Cham, cham, cham

751
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,920
(Jong Kook hit the top of his head.)

752
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,060
- My gosh.
- Are you all right?

753
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,130
- That was quick.
- I was...

754
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,030
- I swung it downward.
- I'll make sure to block it.

755
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,030
He was so fast.

756
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,070
(Chuckling)

757
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,260
Who said it didn't hurt?

758
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,110
- Hey, listen.
- I'll do it well next time.

759
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,610
- I'll focus on blocking attacks.
- Listen.

760
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,970
- Seul Ki, watch your foot. Oh, man.
- Yes?

761
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,050
"Watch your foot?"

762
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,280
(He said,
"Seul Ki, watch your foot.")

763
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,510
- Watch her foot?
- He meant, "Watch carefully."

764
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,350
- I'm watching my foot right now.
- He said, "Watch your foot."

765
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,390
- I'm watching my foot right now.
- He told her to watch her foot.

766
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,410
- Watch carefully. I mean...
- "Watch your foot."

767
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,010
- Why must we look at our feet?
- "Watch your foot."

768
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,360
- Let's do as he said.
- Watch your foot and speed up.

769
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,390
- "Watch your foot."
- "Watch your foot."

770
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,150
- He can move ridiculously fast.
- "Watch your foot."

771
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,490
- Right. He's so fast.
- So...

772
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,660
- Don't look at him. Look at me.
- Got it.

773
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,100
Lift this up as soon as you know
I lost.

774
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,730
- Understood. I'll do that.
- All right?

775
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:22,870
He's not on the human level.

776
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,900
- I know. I understand.
- Okay?

777
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,310
Also, I don't think you'll ever
have to use the sword.

778
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,170
I have a feeling that you won't ever
use the sword.

779
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,470
Focus on the shield.

780
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,290
- He's not on the human level.
- Okay. Got it.

781
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,710
- Let's go. You're so good at this.
- Let's begin.

782
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,360
- Okay. Let's begin.
- We can't grab any of them now.

783
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,290
- "Watch your foot."
- "Watch your foot."

784
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,150
- It's your turn to attack.
- That's right.

785
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,220
Oh, really?

786
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,300
- Get it together.
- My gosh.

787
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,960
- We've got this.
- Get it together, Suk Jin.

788
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,190
- Get it together.
- What's wrong with you?

789
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Cham, cham, cham

790
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,200
(His attack was successful.)

791
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,260
Cham, cham, cham

792
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,700
- What? Oh, boy.
- You were supposed to hit him.

793
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,900
(Seul Ki can't seem to
think clearly either.)

794
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,000
- Why did you deliver it to him?
- I got startled.

795
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,120
- Hey, it was a rare chance.
- Hold on.

796
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,440
I'm so upset.

797
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,410
I wanted to see him getting hit.
It would've motivated me.

798
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,180
Seul Ki, come on.

799
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,980
You told me to focus on the lid.
It was unexpected.

800
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,090
I have a feeling
that you'll use the sword this time.

801
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,490
- Okay. Got it.
- Okay? I have a gut feeling.

802
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,990
Cham, cham, cham

803
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,460
Oh, gosh. What's going on?

804
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,070
Cham, cham, cham

805
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,900
(What a lousy teamwork.)

806
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,460
- He keeps getting hit. Poor him.
- That was hilarious.

807
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
My, that was funny.

808
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,380
- Gosh. Suk Jin, be a man.
- How many times did you attack?

809
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,740
- Suk Jin seems happy.
- Right. He's happy.

810
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,650
Hyun Woo, watch your foot.

811
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,710
- "Watch your foot."
- Hey...

812
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,320
Your father seems happy.

813
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,090
(Suk Jin likes this game
although he got hit many times.)

814
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,120
"Watch your foot."

815
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,620
- "Watch your foot."
- "Watch your foot, Suk Jin."

816
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,030
We might not get any garlic
this time at this rate.

817
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,860
- Exactly.
- I can guess his move easily.

818
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,250
- Can you? Are you sure?
- Yes, I can.

819
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,420
- I'll swing it to my left.
- Okay.

820
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,450
- "Watch your foot."
- Cham, cham, cham

821
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,330
- I'm sorry.
- You did great.

822
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,400
- Good job. Okay.
- Impressive.

823
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,730
All right. The final score is...

824
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,230
seven to two.
Jong Kook and Eunhyuk won.

825
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,760
- That was disappointing.
- Okay.

826
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,670
- It's okay. We won many before.
- We did well. Right.

827
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,900
- So Min, it's our turn.
- Oh, that's right.

828
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,150
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

829
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,440
- We've got this.
- Okay.

830
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,380
- Let's begin.
- They're good at this game.

831
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,510
You see, I'm really good at
this game too.

832
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,440
- Can you beat them easily?
- Jae Suk.

833
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,790
Watch Eunhyuk's hand and your foot.

834
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,910
- Okay.
- "Watch your foot."

835
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,180
- "Watch your foot."
- "Watch your foot."

836
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,450
Rock-paper-scissors, again,
one more time

837
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,490
- Okay.
- I knew it.

838
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,650
- The king of games.
- Will you go first?

839
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,190
- Sorry?
- Do you want to attack first?

840
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,920
- I'll let your team attack first.
- Okay.

841
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,640
- He got intimidated.
- We go first? Okay.

842
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,230
- He already got intimidated.
- My gosh.

843
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,140
- He should've attacked first.
- Okay.

844
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,170
- Okay.
- I'm nervous. What do I do?

845
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,470
- If he fails, I can attack him.
- Okay.

846
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:46,150
- Cham, cham, cham
- Oh, I grabbed the wrong one.

847
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,580
- Cham, cham, cham
- Hey. Gosh.

848
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,290
Cham, cham, cham

849
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,390
Wait. Hold on.
You guys are really fast.

850
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,390
- I mean...
- Why do you keep losing?

851
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,390
- Slow down, will you?
- You have to do better than that.

852
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,030
- Move your head to the other side.
- Cham, cham, cham

853
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,630
- Oh, okay. You won.
- Come on. Just hold on a second.

854
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,130
- You should've stopped it, So Min.
- We're done.

855
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,460
- You still have 2 attacks left.
- Do we have 2 attacks left?

856
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,800
- Really?
- So Min, you should stop it.

857
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,230
- It didn't count... Oh, I see.
- They attacked successfully.

858
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,610
He's looking at Eunhyuk's hand.
He's too kind for this.

859
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,140
That's not true.
I've made up my mind.

860
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,900
That won't work. I bet you will...

861
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,000
- fail again.
- Cham, cham, cham

862
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,470
Cham, cham, cham

863
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,910
(His glasses were hit.)

864
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,010
- Oh, no.
- His glasses came off.

865
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,210
(Jae Suk stood up
as he felt humiliated.)

866
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,510
- Why? She grabbed it again.
- That was funny.

867
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,820
- Hey.
- She should've picked this up.

868
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,790
- My glasses came off!
- Right. I should've picked that up.

869
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,150
It's good that we created
a funny situation though.

870
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,720
- That was an ideal sight.
- You should've left it as it was.

871
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,830
So Min, do your job.

872
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,300
So Min, you should
attack Eunhyuk too.

873
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,420
- Come on, So Min. Do your job.
- He's upset.

874
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
Cham, cham, cham

875
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,990
Cham, cham, cham

876
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,040
(Jong Kook hit his glasses again.)

877
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,160
That was just perfect.

878
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,810
- He got hit all five times.
- Oh, dear.

879
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,280
- I feel bad for him.
- I know.

880
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,340
- Jae Suk, it's...
- Why can't you defend?

881
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,380
It's your turn to attack, Jae Suk.

882
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,880
- Okay.
- It's our turn to attack.

883
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,410
All right. So Min, do you want to
play the game?

884
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,010
- Shall I?
- Yes, give it a try.

885
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,650
(They're switching their positions
before attacking.)

886
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,890
- She'll play the game?
- So Min...

887
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,820
- So Min could do better.
- She's good at games like this.

888
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,410
- This isn't good.
- I think she'll do better than me.

889
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,030
- It's unpredictable now.
- She's quite tactful.

890
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,980
- But she could get hit too.
- True.

891
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,800
Cham, cham, cham

892
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,370
Jong Kook blocked the attack.

893
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,570
Cham, cham, cham

894
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,430
(Hitting)

895
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,490
(Hold on a second.)

896
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,500
Hey, calm down and sit down.

897
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,070
I got flustered.
I didn't mean to hit you.

898
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,400
- He got flustered, Jong Kook.
- I got flustered.

899
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,900
- I just got flustered.
- He got flustered.

900
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,900
- I didn't mean to hit you.
- Jong Kook.

901
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,610
- He just got flustered.
- Trust me. It wasn't intentional.

902
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,350
- Could that explain what he did?
- Of course. He was flustered.

903
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,010
- I was flustered.
- Look. He's intimidated.

904
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,210
- Could that happen?
- Yes, when you get flustered.

905
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,210
- It wasn't intentional.
- What was that?

906
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,820
- You know he always gets nervous.
- Exactly.

907
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,560
- It happens when he's flustered.
- He was taken aback.

908
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,290
- He was taken aback.
- I was just flustered.

909
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,180
- Because it was his first time.
- Okay. I understand.

910
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,180
- Try not to get flustered.
- Okay.

911
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,420
- It wasn't intentional.
- It's okay if you get flustered.

912
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,650
- I was flustered.
- Cham, cham, cham

913
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,720
- I was flustered.
- Cham, cham, cham

914
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,190
(Jong Kook hit him
while biting his teeth.)

915
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,930
- Why did you do that?
- I'm sorry.

916
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,700
- I got flustered.
- Why did you hit me?

917
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,400
- Besides, we won.
- Okay.

918
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,810
- So I got flustered.
- I'm sorry, Eunhyuk.

919
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,310
- Right. You won.
- We won.

920
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,970
Cham, cham, cham

921
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,320
Cham, cham, cham

922
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,320
(Jae Suk hits him nonstop.)

923
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,410
- What was that?
- Did you get flustered again?

924
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,030
- I'm sorry.
- Were you flustered?

925
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,330
- I'm sorry, Jong Kook.
- He's angry.

926
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,420
You should've stopped
after hitting me once.

927
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,130
- I'm sorry.
- You hit me so many times.

928
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,920
- I apologize.
- You got flustered too many times.

929
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,130
I'm sorry.

930
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
I'm sorry.

931
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,040
You should've learned
from your mistake...

932
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,300
- and made sure not to do it again.
- I'm sorry.

933
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,160
- I mean...
- I won't do that again.

934
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,340
- You should stay alert.
- He has a problem.

935
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,700
- I'm really sorry.
- Seriously.

936
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,610
- I must've lost my mind.
- Stay focused.

937
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,900
- Jae Suk is...
- I'm sorry.

938
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,550
- Gosh. Jae Suk is the real bully.
- I'm sorry.

939
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,780
- I'm sorry.
- You wouldn't stop hitting me.

940
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,970
- I'm sorry.
- Gosh, seriously.

941
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,180
- It's like a battlefield.
- No more getting flustered.

942
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,620
- Understood. I'm sorry.
- Do they have one attack left?

943
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,620
Okay.

944
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,910
(After Jae Suk got a warning
the game resumed.)

945
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,720
- That's good.
- Right. Keep going.

946
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,420
- Here you go again.
- Pardon?

947
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,300
- Oh, my.
- Is that a love bullet or what?

948
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,300
She might shoot him.

949
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,900
Cham, cham, cham

950
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,400
- Great. She pulled it off.
- Good.

951
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
(Her cheesy strategy worked.)

952
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,140
- Good job, So Min.
- That was a good move.

953
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,900
- She's fast, right? Let's win this.
- Yes.

954
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,500
- That's great.
- She put her foot on the table.

955
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,410
- So Min, you're doing great.
- Why did you put it on here?

956
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,670
- Her foot...
- I'm ready.

957
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,790
Cham, cham, cham

958
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,820
(Jong Kook hit her face
unintentionally.)

959
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,090
(Taken aback)

960
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,090
Are you okay?

961
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,420
- I'm fine, Jong Kook.
- Hit him back.

962
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,420
(Slapping)

963
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,030
So Min, that was great.

964
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,950
- What's with that reaction?
- I really liked it.

965
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,260
- I couldn't hit him hard though.
- She slapped me in the face.

966
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,300
I couldn't hit him hard.

967
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,540
- You got slapped after a long time.
- Exactly.

968
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,840
(She knocked him out
with a single slap.)

969
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,160
- No one has slapped him... Right.
- I didn't see that coming.

970
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,880
Cham, cham, cham

971
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,440
Okay. That was good.

972
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,610
- Are they tied?
- Okay.

973
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,000
- I'm sure we won.
- I think we won.

974
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,650
- No.
- We won.

975
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,910
- We were neck and neck.
- I think we won.

976
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,710
We did better than them.

977
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,820
The score is 5 to 4.
Jong Kook and Eunhyuk won.

978
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,980
- Okay. We won.
- We won.

979
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,360
- I'm sorry, So Min.
- Don't be.

980
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,180
- We won by a narrow margin.
- You did well. That was fun.

981
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,400
- Let's begin the final match.
- They're good at this game.

982
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,750
In the final match,

983
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,900
you will dump water on the opponent.

984
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,600
- Dump water?
- My goodness.

985
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,640
Make sure to fill your glasses.

986
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
(Jong Kook and Eunhyuk won
2 matches in a row.)

987
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,140
- Haha, make sure to block it.
- I'm not sure if I can do well.

988
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Let's go.

989
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,540
(The eyes of a viper)

990
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,110
(Scared)

991
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,310
Gosh.

992
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,470
Cham, cham, cham

993
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,050
Cham, cham, cham

994
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,240
(Jong Kook dumped water on him.)

995
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,710
- My gosh. He moved so quickly.
- Good job.

996
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,150
- That was impressive.
- You didn't even try to block it.

997
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,410
- He moved too quickly.
- I'm impressed.

998
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,910
- That was amazing.
- He was so fast.

999
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,530
- He dumped water right on his face.
- You should at least try.

1000
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,030
I can block it next time.

1001
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,420
- Block it no matter what.
- Se Chan.

1002
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,990
- Cham, cham, cham
- Block it.

1003
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,070
Oh, gosh.

1004
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,530
- Cham, cham, cham
- Block it.

1005
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,720
(Jong Kook dumped water
on him again.)

1006
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,840
He's too fast.

1007
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,800
- You didn't even try.
- I'm not lying.

1008
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,310
I could see it too.
Block it as I told you.

1009
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,370
- Okay. I'll do that.
- Block it, okay?

1010
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,430
- All right.
- You can block it.

1011
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,000
- Block it when I fail to defend.
- Okay. I'll do it this time.

1012
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,080
- Just block it.
- But he's so fast.

1013
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,700
- Cham, cham, cham
- Good.

1014
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,410
- You should dump water on him.
- Like this?

1015
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,350
(Splash)

1016
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,940
- Gosh.
- You should've attacked Eunhyuk.

1017
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,510
You should've dumped water
on Eunhyuk.

1018
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,710
- Okay. I understand.
- It's confusing.

1019
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,980
- Okay.
- I was just confused.

1020
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,360
- It's okay. Let's switch our seats.
- Believe me.

1021
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,920
- It wasn't intentional.
- Let's switch our positions.

1022
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,420
- Let's just switch our positions.
- I didn't do it on purpose.

1023
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,720
- Let's switch our seats.
- Okay.

1024
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,990
- Okay.
- Okay. I'll sit here.

1025
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,830
- Do I use this to block?
- Correct.

1026
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,600
- And I use this cup, right?
- I got confused. I'm not lying.

1027
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,990
They switched their seats.
He's in trouble.

1028
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,100
- Goodness, you.
- That team is so good at this game.

1029
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,430
- They're amazing.
- Goodness.

1030
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,810
- But...
- It's our turn to attack, Haha.

1031
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,000
- You don't have to be nervous.
- You're right.

1032
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,900
- It's up to us.
- That's right.

1033
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,000
Don't be scared.

1034
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,280
- Okay.
- He did really well before.

1035
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,400
This is the final match. Let's go.

1036
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,210
(The final match will decide
the winning team.)

1037
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,280
Cham, cham, cham

1038
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,910
Cham, cham, cham

1039
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,030
(The unexpected team kill)

1040
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,200
I'm sorry, Haha.
I should've blocked it. Oh, gosh.

1041
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
- No, but the wrong target.
- Okay.

1042
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,360
- Did you get confused?
- Yes, I was confused.

1043
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,470
- He got confused.
- Were you taken aback?

1044
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,930
- Yes, I was taken aback.
- He was taken aback.

1045
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:41,990
He was just taken aback.

1046
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,570
Hey, focus on the game!

1047
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,010
- You can do this.
- Focus!

1048
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,700
- Let's begin.
- Listen. "Watch your foot."

1049
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,930
Got it. I understand the rules now.

1050
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,450
- Se Chan, stay focused.
- I know what to do now.

1051
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,070
I can't help but follow his hand.

1052
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,820
Cham, cham, cham

1053
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,070
(Haha's attack was successful.)

1054
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,950
- Oh, no. I was...
- He failed to defend.

1055
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,010
- Cham, cham, cham
- He failed to defend.

1056
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,610
(Se Chan dumped water
on Haha anyway.)

1057
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,380
- That was a mistake.
- Haha won.

1058
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,430
- Did you get confused?
- Yes, I did.

1059
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,090
- Why is it so confusing?
- I got confused.

1060
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,320
- It's confusing.
- I made it confusing.

1061
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,090
- It's confusing. Yes.
- It really is confusing.

1062
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,530
- Really?
- It was a mistake.

1063
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:13,900
- I got confused.
- It's confusing.

1064
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,300
- Okay.
- You came up with a fun game.

1065
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,530
- It's confusing.
- It's really confusing.

1066
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,610
- Did we lose a point? We can do it.
- I was...

1067
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,530
- My movement must've confused him.
- Right.

1068
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,200
- It's so confusing.
- It was my fault.

1069
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,240
- Do you understand the rules now?
- Yes, I do.

1070
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,180
Suk Jin seems to be so jealous.

1071
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,150
He wishes he were in that situation.

1072
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,150
(Seok Sam wants to be in every
situation where he can be funny.)

1073
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,990
- I'll block it this time.
- Why would you put it there?

1074
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,090
It's easier for me
to pick up the cup.

1075
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,900
I'll show you. See? It takes me
more time to pick it up here.

1076
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,820
- Right.
- I can dump water right away.

1077
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,930
You're going to
block it this time, right?

1078
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,470
Se Chan, stay alert.

1079
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,930
I've got this.
Why am I getting nervous?

1080
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,070
Haha, move your hand.

1081
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,030
- Okay. Good.
- I'll just look down at this.

1082
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,110
- Okay.
- Ready.

1083
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,510
(Sighing and chuckling)

1084
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,880
Eunhyuk hasn't been attacked
until now.

1085
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,430
(Haha's last attack)

1086
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,410
The winner has already been decided.
Let's go.

1087
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,010
Cham, cham, cham

1088
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,550
I blocked it.

1089
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,740
Cham

1090
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,820
(He said, "I blocked it.")

1091
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,510
- Oh, no. Darn it.
- Hey.

1092
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,320
- What was that?
- It was too late.

1093
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,720
- You moved too slowly.
- I should've blocked it and...

1094
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,530
- Hey, what was that?
- You moved too slowly.

1095
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,630
- I moved too slowly.
- Yes.

1096
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,530
- I moved too slowly.
- Oh, no.

1097
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:20,430
- Se Chan, get it together.
- Believe me, Haha.

1098
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,430
- They're really good at it.
- We couldn't beat them.

1099
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,510
They were unbeatable.

1100
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,630
Jong Kook and Eunhyuk...

1101
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,130
- came in first.
- Okay.

1102
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,610
Each of you will receive
ten garlic cloves,

1103
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,780
and get a chance
to change the team members.

1104
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,340
Haha and Se Chan came in second.

1105
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,740
- Each will get eight garlic cloves.
- Okay.

1106
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,110
Jae Suk and So Min who came in 3rd
will get 6 each.

1107
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,240
- Six? Okay.
- Six?

1108
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,410
Suk Jin and Seul Ki came in fourth.

1109
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,650
- Are we in the last place?
- You'll get four each.

1110
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,260
Soo Ah and Ji Hyo came in last.

1111
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,110
- You'll get two each.
- All right.

1112
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,260
The poachers already got
half of their partners' garlic.

1113
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,260
The winning team will get a chance
to find out each other's identity.

1114
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,800
- Okay.
- I see.

1115
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,820
(Jong Kook already knows
Eunhyuk's identity.)

1116
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,840
Okay.

1117
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,400
(Jong Kook already knows
Eunhyuk's identity.)

1118
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,700
I trust you, Jong Kook.

1119
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,970
- Of course.
- Yes.

1120
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,910
- I'll reveal your identities.
- Okay.

1121
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,380
- As you know, he's a poacher.
- Yes, I know that.

1122
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,470
And Jong Kook is...

1123
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,110
- an animal.
- I see.

1124
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,820
(Jong Kook is not a poacher.)

1125
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,010
Exactly.

1126
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,380
- Currently, Jong Kook has...
- You were an animal.

1127
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,990
Jong Kook, you had
four cloves before.

1128
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,630
- You won 5, so you have 9 now.
- Right.

1129
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,930
- As for Eunhyuk...
- Then I must have a lot of garlic.

1130
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,050
You had 12 cloves before.

1131
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,720
- You just got 15 more cloves.
- I have so many.

1132
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Now you have 27 cloves.

1133
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,840
Why does he have so many?

1134
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,630
- Is it because he's a poacher?
- I took half of yours.

1135
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:32,010
- What?
- I took four cloves from you.

1136
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,630
So I had a total of 12 cloves.

1137
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,880
Hey.

1138
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,340
- Jong Kook, didn't you know...
- Why would he take...

1139
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,200
- Don't we share the garlic evenly?
- No.

1140
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,240
- He takes half of mine?
- Yes.

1141
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,110
- Gosh, you little...
- You knew about that rule.

1142
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,280
You should've explained it to me.

1143
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,590
I thought you understood the rules.

1144
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,410
So that's why
we should switch partners.

1145
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,160
Anyway, you know
how many cloves you have.

1146
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,320
Are you going to swap partners?

1147
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,160
If you think about it,

1148
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,720
as long as we find
who the bear poacher is...

1149
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,950
(As long as we find
who the bear poacher is...)

1150
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,450
It'll benefit both of us.

1151
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,430
You...

1152
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,090
This can benefit us both.

1153
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,490
- Together...
- In that case,

1154
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,840
you can't afford to get caught.

1155
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,010
It should only be me
who is suspicious of you.

1156
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,680
- I...
- Only I need to win.

1157
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,430
- Do your best in the games though.
- Of course.

1158
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,240
(They agree to stay together
so that they can score big.)

1159
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,280
All right.

1160
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,820
You'll keep losing cloves
to Eunhyuk then.

1161
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,910
(They agree to stay together
so that they can score big.)

1162
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,180
- Study their expressions.
- Can we go?

1163
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,090
- I'm not a poacher.
- Go ahead, then.

1164
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,510
They don't seem too happy.

1165
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,950
- One out of the two, right?
- It's Eunhyuk.

1166
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,490
- They seem frustrated.
- Did you switch partners?

1167
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,550
We will...

1168
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,660
- Did you switch partners?
- Do you both know now?

1169
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,800
- We...
- We didn't switch partners.

1170
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,070
- We didn't switch partners.
- They already knew.

1171
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,200
Yes, of course.

1172
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,700
We should've made sure
that they won instead.

1173
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,110
I thought that's what
you were going for.

1174
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,910
Haha said...

1175
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,610
that he should check
what Se Chan is.

1176
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,280
- Did Haha say that?
- Yes, he did.

1177
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,700
It seemed to me...

1178
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,550
like Haha wasn't interested
in winning.

1179
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,570
How is it done?

1180
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,280
Only one of you will learn...

1181
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,610
the identity of your partner
and how many cloves you have.

1182
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,740
Please play rock-paper-scissors.

1183
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,050
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

1184
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,050
- Okay.
- Only Se Chan...

1185
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,090
will receive the information.

1186
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,180
- Don't you want me to see it?
- It's fine.

1187
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,220
Got it.

1188
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,430
I'm really not a poacher.

1189
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,260
(Haha has been suspected
since early this morning.)

1190
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:06,660
(What role is Haha playing?)

1191
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,090
They're taking quite a long time.

1192
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,910
It's true. They must have
a lot to talk about.

1193
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,160
Judging by
how long they're taking...

1194
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,200
They probably have
a lot to think about.

1195
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,010
They wouldn't take this long
if they were both animals.

1196
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,410
- You know from experience.
- Right.

1197
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,300
If they were both animals,
they'd come straight back out.

1198
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,320
Here comes the sheriff.

1199
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,550
- What?
- What's with that tone?

1200
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,410
Everything is clear to me now.

1201
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,780
That's an odd thing to say.

1202
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,320
That's an odd thing to say.

1203
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,160
- They could be in cahoots.
- How can everything be clear?

1204
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,030
- Right.
- This team decided...

1205
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,160
(The team in 2nd place decided...)

1206
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,760
They decided to switch partners.

1207
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,800
- What?
- Really?

1208
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,400
- Why?
- Why are you switching partners?

1209
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,430
- To find the poacher.
- To find the poacher.

1210
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,660
One must be a poacher then.

1211
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,200
- Between the two of them...
- One of them is a poacher.

1212
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,300
- I'm sure of it.
- Check Jong Kook out.

1213
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,700
- How can that be?
- Exactly.

1214
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,700
It's not like that.

1215
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,160
- I'm sure of it.
- There's no need...

1216
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,610
to find the poacher.

1217
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,340
- We have to.
- It has to be done.

1218
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,570
After each game,

1219
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,780
- one's identity is revealed.
- If I win the game...

1220
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,110
- or win second place...
- We learn one's identity.

1221
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,680
It's why we should split up
and discover your identities.

1222
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
One of them is a poacher.

1223
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,740
One of them has to be a poacher.

1224
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,910
- You're right.
- We need to figure out who it is.

1225
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,090
That being said,

1226
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:04,050
these are the teams they chose.

1227
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,030
- We should stay clear of them.
- Se Chan...

1228
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,630
chose Jae Suk.

1229
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,630
(Tiger Se Chan
chooses Bear Jae Suk.)

1230
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,360
You're coming after my garlic!

1231
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,720
What?

1232
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,200
- No, I'm not.
- You...

1233
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,970
- He's trying to take what's mine.
- Of course not.

1234
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,200
- I'm not a poacher.
- That's a good choice.

1235
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,300
- And Haha...
- That's a good choice.

1236
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,340
Haha chose Soo Ah as his partner.

1237
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,950
(Soo Ah over Se Chan)

1238
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,180
He's trying to...

1239
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,740
brush away any suspicion.

1240
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,180
Our goal...

1241
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,970
is to identify you all
through the games we play.

1242
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,820
- That's odd.
- Are you switching partners?

1243
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,880
If you think about it...

1244
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,280
- Right.
- Of course.

1245
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,680
- Do well in games, okay?
- With her,

1246
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,160
he won't be able
to win a lot of games.

1247
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,360
It's why he chose Soo Ah instead.

1248
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,800
You're right.
Being in 1st or 2nd place...

1249
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,400
It'll be hard for his team
to win the games.

1250
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,630
I'm not a poacher.
Se Chan knows for sure.

1251
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,160
- He's not a poacher.
- I'm not.

1252
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,930
I learned about his identity.

1253
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,700
- He knows.
- He's not a poacher.

1254
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,740
(What role could Haha be playing?)

1255
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,760
They make a good couple.

1256
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,340
- Hey!
- That looks good.

1257
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,510
Nice!

1258
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,050
- Gosh.
- No way.

1259
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,110
- We have pizza.
- We're having pizza.

1260
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,510
One pizza per person, right?

1261
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,380
Gosh, that looks good.

1262
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,050
- Is that coke?
- Yes.

1263
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,260
- That one's mine.
- All right.

1264
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,410
- It's lunchtime.
- Right.

1265
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,930
But it's also time
for product placement.

1266
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,200
In order to provide
a seamless advertisement,

1267
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,530
we will be offering you
additional garlic cloves.

1268
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,900
- In what way?
- Additional garlic?

1269
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,130
- Additional garlic?
- Only the tigers will participate.

1270
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,300
- The tigers?
- The tigers.

1271
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,630
The tigers...

1272
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,030
will call someone you know...

1273
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,910
and eat a slice of pizza
within 100 seconds.

1274
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,970
You should not be asked
if you're eating anything.

1275
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:34,970
(They should not be asked
if they're eating anything.)

1276
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,470
The game will be over
once you hear it.

1277
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,220
Those who manage
to stay undetected...

1278
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,950
will be rewarded
with cloves of garlic...

1279
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,610
depending on how well they did.

1280
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,820
- Do you understand the rules?
- Who should I call?

1281
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,860
You can call anyone.

1282
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,180
But only the tigers
are playing this game.

1283
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,950
- Just the tigers?
- So Min's not a big eater.

1284
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,130
Maybe Sang Yeob.

1285
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,400
I'm going to call Sae Ho.

1286
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,200
Please keep it down
while Se Chan makes his call.

1287
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,700
Is this my pizza slice?

1288
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,240
He's going to call Cho Sae Ho.

1289
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,340
Sae Ho, got it.

1290
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,740
The countdown will begin
as soon as he picks up.

1291
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,030
Hey, Se Chan.

1292
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,340
Sae Ho, where are you?

1293
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:07,010
I was out exercising...

1294
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,840
and now I'm on my way home.

1295
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,910
Are you heading home?

1296
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,490
- Yes.
- Sae Ho!

1297
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,450
- Hey, So Min.
- Gosh.

1298
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,260
Sae Ho, I hurt myself.

1299
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,490
Yes, I heard about your toe.

1300
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,880
So Min injured herself.

1301
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,860
Tell me about it. I feel terrible.

1302
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,200
She...

1303
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,320
tripped.

1304
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,260
I know. Why did it happen though?

1305
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,990
Was there no one there
for her to grab?

1306
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,700
- Where are you right now?
- What?

1307
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,300
(Where are you right now?)

1308
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,510
Where are you right now?

1309
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,780
I'm in Gangnam.

1310
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,840
Did you say Gangneung?

1311
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,300
No, not Gangneung.

1312
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,950
Wait.

1313
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,010
- Did you say Gangneung?
- Seriously.

1314
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,380
I'm in Gangnam.

1315
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,570
Gangnam?

1316
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,380
Yes. Gangneung is miles away.

1317
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,550
Who are you with?

1318
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,510
- I'm with Kyung Ho.
- Kyung Ho?

1319
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,860
(Se Chan just stuffs his face.)

1320
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,050
Who's Kyung Ho?

1321
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,700
Kyung Ho used to be
a fellow comedian.

1322
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,700
So that's who you're with.

1323
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,860
Have you eaten, Sae Ho?

1324
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,930
I'm thinking about
grabbing a salad or something.

1325
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,090
A salad?

1326
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,740
(How can Sae Ho not be curious?)

1327
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,910
A salad?

1328
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,630
You know what I mean. Vegetables.

1329
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,300
Oh, vegetables.

1330
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,380
What on earth?

1331
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,510
- This is crazy.
- He's not even being careful.

1332
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,180
- See?
- Okay!

1333
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,380
My gosh.

1334
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,820
Hold on.
You can't eat that last bite.

1335
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,550
- Sae Ho.
- How can he not know?

1336
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,880
- Thanks, Sae Ho.
- How can he not tell?

1337
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,280
- Jae Suk, is that you?
- Yes, it's me.

1338
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,720
Are you guys filming something?

1339
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,820
He probably knew.

1340
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,720
- Unbelievable.
- I'm sure he knew.

1341
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,470
- He knew, didn't he?
- You didn't know,

1342
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:34,570
but yet you gave us a laugh.

1343
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,470
- Did I?
- Yes.

1344
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,260
Wasn't it difficult
to understand Se Chan?

1345
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,180
It was terrible!

1346
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,880
Didn't you know
that he was eating something?

1347
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,570
I thought he had...

1348
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:46,910
a question to ask
while eating lunch.

1349
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,650
It did seem like
he wasn't listening though.

1350
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,220
- I see.
- That's right.

1351
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,150
Anyway,

1352
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:55,550
former-Mr. Cabbage-now-Mr. Cho Sae Ho,
thank you.

1353
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,090
- Could I say hello to the viewers?
- I'm sorry?

1354
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,950
- He wants to say hello.
- Would that be all right?

1355
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:02,450
- Since this will air on TV...
- To the Running Man viewers.

1356
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,200
- Oh, right.
- Wouldn't that be better?

1357
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,530
I'm afraid...

1358
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,700
the other guests
have to make phone calls too.

1359
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,430
But it'll only take
about five seconds.

1360
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,570
(Running Man won't even
let him have 5 seconds.)

1361
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:13,740
Then,

1362
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,530
please make sure
you only take five seconds.

1363
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,150
Sure. It's a pleasure to greet you.

1364
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,240
Thank you, everyone.

1365
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,450
Happy New Year.

1366
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,880
I hope to see you soon
on Running Man...

1367
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,910
(He hangs up.)

1368
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,180
I hope to see you soon
on Running Man...

1369
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,150
(Jae Suk hangs up
after 5 exact seconds.)

1370
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,320
Well...

1371
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:28,880
- He made a promise.
- It was agreed upon.

1372
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,990
Of course.

1373
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,930
- It was agreed upon.
- Right.

1374
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:34,130
- I counted it down.
- Nicely done.

1375
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,090
- Next up is Soo Ah.
- Soo Ah's next.

1376
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,430
I don't have any celebrity friends.

1377
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,590
- It can be anyone.
- It can be any friend.

1378
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,470
- It can be a family member.
- What if no one picks up.

1379
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:45,010
- This friend is an American.
- Nice.

1380
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,700
We play tennis together, you see.

1381
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,740
- Sounds good.
- They're entering...

1382
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:48,740
a tournament next week.

1383
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,050
- Really?
- What if she doesn't pick up?

1384
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:53,300
- A tournament?
- Soo Ah's athletic.

1385
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,840
(Will she be able
to stay undetected for 100 seconds?)

1386
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,180
What if she doesn't pick up?

1387
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,220
Isn't this Lee Hyun Woo's song?

1388
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,510
This song...

1389
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,720
She answered!

1390
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:03,930
- Hello?
- Hi, Manda.

1391
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:05,820
- Hey.
- What's up?

1392
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,990
I'm at work.
Are you on set right now?

1393
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,990
Yes, I'm on the set of Running Man.

1394
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:14,400
(Soo Ah frantically
stuffs her face.)

1395
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,930
Could this be a scam?

1396
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,240
I'm filming...

1397
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:20,110
I'm...

1398
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,570
I'm filming something right now.

1399
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,240
Are you eating something?

1400
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,650
(Are you eating something?)

1401
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,680
(Are you eating something?)

1402
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,610
(She gets caught
only after 19 seconds!)

1403
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:33,780
- Nice!
- Okay.

1404
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,010
- Nice timing.
- All right!

1405
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:38,720
Nice!

1406
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,860
(Soo Ah's perceptive friend
might have her finish last.)

1407
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,030
Nice!

1408
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:43,430
It's over for you.

1409
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,800
- How did you know?
- You can hang up now.

1410
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,300
- So Min, who will you call?
- What if he doesn't answer?

1411
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,800
- I'm calling Sang Yeob.
- He'll probably answer.

1412
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,360
He texted me yesterday,
but I didn't reply.

1413
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,570
- Why didn't you?
- Soo Ah's friend was hilarious.

1414
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:53,660
It ended as soon
as the call went through.

1415
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:55,570
- It ended the second I started...
- Yes?

1416
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,650
- You need to wait.
- Sang Yeob.

1417
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,880
- You need to wait.
- Sang Yeob.

1418
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,180
Jeonsobari.

1419
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,740
- I...
- Yes?

1420
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,740
got injured.

1421
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:07,780
Why?

1422
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,630
I tripped on the stairs and fell.

1423
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,160
But...

1424
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,030
(But...)

1425
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,260
This must be a prank.

1426
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,820
(He thinks it's a prank call.)

1427
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,030
I...

1428
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,700
- Yes?
- My foot is in a cast.

1429
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:28,740
(Laughing)

1430
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,340
(He bursts out laughing.)

1431
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:33,570
Why is he finding this funny?

1432
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,650
(He seems to be aware
of what's happening.)

1433
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:36,720
So Min!

1434
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,780
- It hurts.
- So Min.

1435
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,380
Are you hurt?

1436
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:41,550
- Yes.
- He's using his acting voice.

1437
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:43,110
Where are you right now?

1438
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,820
- Did you hear that?
- He's putting on a show.

1439
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,550
He thinks we're playing a game.

1440
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,630
- Right.
- He's trying to guess the phrase.

1441
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,030
I'll come to you this instant.

1442
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,760
He thinks she's trying
to get a phrase out of him.

1443
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,130
- He's trying to guess the answer.
- That's right.

1444
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,110
- It's what So Min wants to hear.
- "I'll come to you this instant."

1445
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:01,570
So Min, where are you?

1446
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,510
I'm...

1447
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,240
So Min.

1448
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,950
- I...
- Did you hurt your teeth too?

1449
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,150
Her teeth too?

1450
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:15,220
(Sang Yeob's passion
is pointed in the wrong direction.)

1451
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,760
So Min!

1452
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:19,950
(So Min!)

1453
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:22,720
He knows how to give people a laugh.

1454
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,820
(Sang Yeob cries out
as 100 seconds pass.)

1455
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,860
- Sang Yeob.
- He thought this was a game.

1456
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,090
Sang Yeob thought
that this was a game.

1457
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,240
- Right.
- That's what he thought.

1458
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,470
Mr. Substitute!

1459
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,610
I see that it's Monday.

1460
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,970
You should know that
you made a mess of things.

1461
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,130
I'll be right over, Jae Suk.

1462
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,410
Him and his ambition.

1463
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,470
Well, it's not...

1464
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:39,780
- That's not...
- Jae Suk,

1465
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,950
I haven't greeted the viewers
of Running Man in a while.

1466
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:43,990
- It's been so long.
- Just hang up already!

1467
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:46,410
- Come to Dosan Intersection.
- That's enough.

1468
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,780
(Throwing the bait)

1469
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,030
- That's enough!
- We're at Dosan Intersection!

1470
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,130
- It's a mission!
- That's enough!

1471
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:55,160
- Come to Dosan Intersection!
- Stay still.

1472
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,570
Come now!
You must come to Dosan Intersection!

1473
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,160
- No!
- Dosan Intersection!

1474
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,070
- Sang Yeob.
- Dosan Intersection!

1475
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,760
- Sang Yeob, go work out now.
- He might actually go.

1476
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,070
- He could be there for real.
- I think he'll really go.

1477
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,180
Don't go to Dosan Park!

1478
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,470
Come to Dosan Intersection!

1479
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,950
- Don't trust him! No!
- Don't go to Dosan Park!

1480
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:13,150
- We're at Dosan Intersection!
- Save us!

1481
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,740
- Save us!
- Don't trust him!

1482
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:17,550
This is not a mission.
Do not go to Dosan Park!

1483
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,740
- Go work out!
- Did he actually leave home?

1484
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,820
(Confused)

1485
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,510
- All right. I'll call you later.
- He's going to contemplate.

1486
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,050
- He's going to contemplate.
- All right!

1487
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,900
- He's contemplating.
- He might actually go.

1488
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,360
- I think he already left.
- He's immersed in the game now.

1489
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,930
- It looks like that.
- Hurry up and text him.

1490
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,970
I'm going to call Shim Chang Min
of TVXQ.

1491
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:37,660
- Eunhyuk?
- Chang Min.

1492
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,930
Can you sing for me a little longer?

1493
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,910
(Countless times)

1494
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,180
He's so slow-witted.

1495
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:49,380
How does "Fever" go again?

1496
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,740
(Vocalizing)

1497
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,160
(Singing passionately
for the second time)

1498
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,860
(He enjoys the pizza
while listening to Chang Min sing.)

1499
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,860
- What did you say?
- All right.

1500
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,430
- Amazing.
- He ate quite a lot.

1501
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:02,660
You can put it down. We did it.

1502
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,800
- Seul Ki will call her husband.
- All right.

1503
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,400
Is it lunchtime?

1504
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:11,840
No, it's not lunchtime.
We're just taking a break.

1505
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,340
What were you up to?

1506
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,240
Tell me what you did today.
I called to ask you that.

1507
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:18,970
I didn't do anything much.

1508
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:21,320
(He's the type
who gives only short answers.)

1509
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:23,450
- She's done.
- What?

1510
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,950
What?

1511
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,410
It's the end of the conversation.

1512
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,490
(She's facing a crisis.)

1513
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,260
- Ask him if he loves you.
- Do you love me?

1514
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,530
(She held out for 100 seconds
but couldn't eat much of her pizza.)

1515
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,200
- She couldn't eat much.
- Oh, gosh.

1516
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,400
- Hey!
- Bye.

1517
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,070
Let's weigh the leftover pizza...

1518
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:40,530
- and add the seconds.
- We won.

1519
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,570
Sae Ho helped out a lot.

1520
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,930
All right. Please place your pizza.

1521
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,510
That's right. You ate a lot.

1522
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:47,800
(Jae Suk and Se Chan,
Ji Hyo and So Min...)

1523
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,740
- You should've finished it.
- Mine is too big.

1524
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,800
We got it.

1525
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,680
All right. Here's the result.

1526
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,110
You're not going to measure ours?

1527
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:55,280
(They nonchalantly skip Team Haha
who is obviously in last place.)

1528
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,510
All right. First place...

1529
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,380
goes to Jae Suk and Se Chan.

1530
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,360
- Well done!
- Thank you, Sae Ho.

1531
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,450
- You guys won?
- Thanks, Sae Ho!

1532
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:05,320
No, we're in second place.

1533
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,720
Next. Second place...

1534
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,260
goes to Jong Kook and Eunhyuk.

1535
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,760
They keep winning.

1536
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,760
(Jong Kook and Eunhyuk
get 8 garlic cloves.)

1537
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,300
They shouldn't keep winning.

1538
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,660
- You're in second place?
- We should stop them.

1539
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,930
- Next...
- It's an individual match though.

1540
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:20,340
Third place goes to
Ji Hyo and So Min.

1541
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:22,970
Suk Jin and Seul Ki
are in fourth place.

1542
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:24,010
For real?

1543
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:25,550
- What? Us?
- You're in fourth place.

1544
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:28,680
That's it. Now, you can have
the pizza.

1545
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,950
(The bears finally
get to taste the pizza.)

1546
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:31,380
It's really good.

1547
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:32,590
All right.

1548
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:33,990
- It's good.
- It looks so good.

1549
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,490
- Take it.
- It's really good.

1550
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,280
Thank you.

1551
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,300
- Isn't it really nice?
- The toppings are really nice.

1552
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,360
They added a lot of toppings.

1553
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,900
I can definitely finish
a bowl of rice with this bulgogi.

1554
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:48,160
I miss my kids. They'd love this.

1555
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,090
You always say that
when you're done with your meal.

1556
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:52,910
Can't you pay my performance fee
with pizza?

1557
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,930
- We can.
- You can?

1558
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,740
- It's a PPL. He's working hard.
- I thought you wouldn't be able to.

1559
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,070
I guess they can.

1560
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,110
Sang Yeob actually said he'd call me
when he gets to Dosan Intersection.

1561
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:05,610
(The bears and tigers'
lunchtime ends.)

1562
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:06,740
Let's check it.

1563
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,880
(Third time to check
their identities)

1564
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,950
You're not a looter, are you?

1565
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,320
A looter? It's supposed to be a poacher.

1566
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,450
How did it become a looter?

1567
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,590
You're a looter
since you steal goods from me.

1568
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:19,220
No. You must be feeling guilty.

1569
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:21,430
- Why would you call me looter?
- No, I'm not it.

1570
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:22,590
- Right?
- Of course not.

1571
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:25,110
- If you're it...
- Come on.

1572
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,410
(Is Jae Suk, who tends to get
talkative when he's given a role,)

1573
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:27,470
(a poacher?)

1574
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,510
- It's you. Darn it.
- I'm really not it.

1575
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:32,550
The two of you can open
your garlic can and check.

1576
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,180
- I should open mine?
- Check the number of garlic cloves.

1577
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:37,590
- I collected a lot so far.
- You did. I collected a lot too.

1578
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:39,820
You collected a lot.
You have so many.

1579
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,950
I'll tell you your identities.

1580
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:45,130
- Se Chan is a tiger.
- I'm a tiger.

1581
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:56,400
(Se Chan is a tiger.)

1582
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,020
- What about Jae Suk?
- Jae Suk is...

1583
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,540
(Jae Suk's identity is...)

1584
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,980
(a bear.)

1585
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,940
a bear.

1586
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,020
(Both were not poachers.)

1587
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,880
- A looter?
- I see. You're not.

1588
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,520
- I'm not a looter. We both are not.
- He's not.

1589
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,290
- You can make your choice now.
- We should switch teams.

1590
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,100
- Is that so?
- We need to switch teams...

1591
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,420
- So we can find out.
- so we can see who they are.

1592
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,630
Also, Haha is not a poacher.

1593
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,060
- He's not?
- Haha is not a poacher.

1594
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:21,710
- Then who should I team up with?
- We need to divide them up.

1595
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:22,770
They seem suspicious.

1596
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:24,440
- Let's divide them up.
- We'll divide them up.

1597
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:26,770
- Then I'll team up with him.
- Then I'll team up with Jong Kook.

1598
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,600
- Is that your final decision?
- Yes.

1599
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,040
(Their plan is to enter
the tiger's den.)

1600
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,520
- Why did you think I was?
- So you're not a looter.

1601
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,540
No, I'm not.

1602
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,750
We'll give information
to only one of you.

1603
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,440
- But I already know who he is.
- But we already know.

1604
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,520
So you are...

1605
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,580
(They know each other's
identity as it's their third visit.)

1606
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,020
Then it's useless
to switch teams now...

1607
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,020
because there's no one else...

1608
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,380
- who can help me win.
- That's true.

1609
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,900
- Then I'll stick with him for now.
- All right.

1610
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,330
- We have no other choice.
- You're right.

1611
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,520
Darn it. We have no other choice
than to wait.

1612
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,690
Eunhyuk, what took you so long?

1613
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:53,290
Gosh. What happened?

1614
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:55,270
- What took you guys so long?
- They're fishy.

1615
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,230
He said they were fishy.
We got you. You're done for.

1616
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,400
- Everyone.
- Yes?

1617
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:00,770
The first top three teams...

1618
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,600
- are done checking identities.
- Are we switching teams?

1619
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,850
The team in first place
decided to switch teams.

1620
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,150
(The team in 1st place
decided to switch teams.)

1621
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,880
The team first-place team
switched to...

1622
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,750
- is Eunhyuk and Jong Kook.
- Eunhyuk.

1623
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,120
- Eunhyuk and Jong Kook,
- Come here.

1624
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,350
- the first-place team chose you.
- We switched teams.

1625
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:15,420
- We are going to separate you two.
- With whom?

1626
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,750
- Sorry?
- Jae Suk and me?

1627
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:19,630
- Also... It's Jong Kook and me.
- It's Eunhyuk and me.

1628
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,560
Then your identity will be revealed.

1629
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,600
What are you talking about?

1630
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,270
Don't you think one of them
is a poacher?

1631
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,900
The two teams are divided.

1632
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,400
- Then it's not me, it's not you...
- I'm not a poacher.

1633
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,440
- Jae Suk is not a poacher.
- Jae Suk is not?

1634
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,480
Se Chan and I are not poachers.

1635
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,210
- Me neither.
- You're not it either.

1636
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:37,270
- I'm not a poacher either.
- Jong Kook and I are not it.

1637
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:40,310
Jae Suk, don't be so sure
that Haha is not a poacher.

1638
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:41,690
Why do you think he's not a poacher?

1639
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:42,750
I'm not!

1640
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,790
(Jae Suk is only trusting
Se Chan's words on Haha's identity.)

1641
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:45,850
Why are you so sure that Haha is
not it just because Se Chan said it?

1642
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:46,920
Why would he lie?

1643
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,850
- The two could've plotted this.
- Se Chan is not a poacher.

1644
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,150
- Se Chan is not a poacher.
- No, they could've plotted this.

1645
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,850
- Come on. I'm not a poacher.
- Okay.

1646
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:55,370
Everyone, please gather.

1647
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:57,100
- Gather up.
- Yes, sir. Salute!

1648
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,870
This mission...

1649
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:01,730
is a game where you have to keep
your eye on the ball until the end...

1650
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:02,770
while avoiding
the tiger's sharp eyes.

1651
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:04,830
It's called
More and More Foot Volleyball.

1652
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,580
- More and More Foot Volleyball?
- More and More Foot Volleyball?

1653
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,580
It follows the rules
of foot volleyball,

1654
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,810
but the longer the rally lasts,

1655
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:12,210
the more points will you get.

1656
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,850
Which means, every time
the ball touches someone's foot,

1657
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,580
- one point will be added.
- That sounds good.

1658
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,960
And the team that wins the attack
will take all the points.

1659
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,980
(The team that succeeds
in the attack takes all the points.)

1660
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,480
(They'll be able to win
all the accumulated points.)

1661
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,560
The longer the rally, the better.

1662
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,650
Each team can kick five times...

1663
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:28,230
- at most.
- Five times per team?

1664
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,690
Oh, I get it.

1665
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:32,770
- More and more points accumulate?
- We should receive the ball well.

1666
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,000
What about us?

1667
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,400
I'll tell you.

1668
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,230
We couldn't change the game
because it was last minute,

1669
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,730
so So Min can take
the role of a referee.

1670
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:41,770
We prepared a referee uniform for you.

1671
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:43,170
- Finally!
- All right! At last.

1672
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,440
- Your dream came true.
- Can't I be the referee?

1673
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,580
- That's the coolest role.
- Can't I be one, Jae Suk?

1674
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,940
- I've really wanted to be one.
- I've really wanted too.

1675
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,290
- She gets a whistle too?
- It's the most desired role.

1676
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:52,560
- I hate to be the referee.
- She gets a whistle too?

1677
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,150
- She gets a whistle.
- She's like Thanos.

1678
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:58,500
- Only So Min can be a referee.
- Why?

1679
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,750
- This is too... Okay, fine.
- What can I do?

1680
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:02,060
- I want to be a referee too.
- The referee...

1681
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:04,190
can declare the opening of the game.

1682
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:06,770
- My gosh.
- She gets to declare it too?

1683
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:08,630
Hey!

1684
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:11,670
Hey! You were born to be a referee.

1685
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:12,830
She's good.

1686
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:15,000
- Gosh.
- You're a superb referee.

1687
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,020
We divided you into two teams.

1688
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:20,170
- We divided you fairly.
- Did you?

1689
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:22,790
- On this side, Jae Suk, Eunhyuk,
- Okay.

1690
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:25,020
Haha, Soo Ah, So Min, and Ji Hyo
will be on one team.

1691
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,790
- All right.
- This is great.

1692
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,520
There are only four of us?
No, it's better without So Min.

1693
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,650
- It's better without So Min.
- It's better without So Min.

1694
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:33,290
Let's always have two men
and two women on the court.

1695
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:35,020
- Two men and two women?
- I'll sit on the bench first.

1696
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,560
There are no limits
to how many points you can earn,

1697
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,130
so we'll tally up the scores
after exactly 15 minutes.

1698
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,330
We should kick as much as we can...

1699
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:43,540
- before passing it over.
- That's right.

1700
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,670
- That's right.
- I should kick like this...

1701
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:45,940
- when it comes to me? Got it.
- That's right.

1702
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:48,000
- All right.
- Now,

1703
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,650
More and More Foot Volleyball Match
will begin.

1704
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,380
- All right. Hit it.
- Let's start.

1705
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:55,650
- "Hit it?"
- Serve it first.

1706
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:57,190
- Did you say hit it? Not serve?
- "Hit it?"

1707
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,250
"Hit it?"

1708
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,350
(At Referee Jeon's whistle...)

1709
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,650
- My gosh. How charismatic.
- Who will receive it?

1710
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,060
- Who will receive it? I will.
- Nice serve!

1711
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,420
- One.
- All right. That's one. One point.

1712
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,690
- Two.
- Two points.

1713
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:09,600
- Wait. I should pass it over.
- That's it.

1714
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:11,540
- Wait. I should pass it over.
- That's it.

1715
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,500
- Receive it. That's it. Good job.
- One point.

1716
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,400
One more time. That's it.

1717
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,830
- That's it. Great job.
- Pass it over.

1718
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,880
- That's it. Great job.
- Pass it over.

1719
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,810
How many points did we earn?

1720
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:23,040
- It's 8 to 0.
- All right!

1721
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,880
- I'll hit it.
- We got eight points.

1722
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,020
- I didn't do anything though.
- We got eight points.

1723
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,080
- It's 8 to 0. My gosh.
- Serve it.

1724
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:30,790
It was close.

1725
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,190
- All right.
- All right. I got it.

1726
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:34,420
(Haha serves again.)

1727
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,730
- We got it.
- That's one point.

1728
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,060
- One.
- One.

1729
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,190
- Two.
- Two.

1730
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,730
- Seul Ki, take this.
- You won't be able to pass it over.

1731
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:42,730
My ball.

1732
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:43,790
We got it.

1733
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,100
- Take it easy.
- One. Oh, no.

1734
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,400
- He got it!
- There you go. Good one!

1735
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,600
One. Oh, no.

1736
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:51,230
(Haha quickly received
the ball that almost went out.)

1737
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,310
- He got it!
- Pass it over.

1738
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:54,000
Three.

1739
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,380
- Pass it over, Haha.
- Pass it over.

1740
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,120
- There you go.
- That's it!

1741
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,810
- Good one. It's okay.
- There you go.

1742
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,920
- Go for it.
- Pass it over. There you go.

1743
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,520
- Go.
- Good one.

1744
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:05,250
Good one. Take it easy.

1745
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,750
This is worth so many points.

1746
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,380
- We must take this.
- It's worth so many points.

1747
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,460
- We must take it.
- Good one.

1748
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,520
- Two.
- Ji Hyo!

1749
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,020
- Three.
- Pass it over!

1750
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,630
Four.

1751
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,130
We took it!

1752
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,290
How many points did we win?

1753
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:18,460
- We took it!
- What was that?

1754
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:20,730
- I'm so sorry, Haha.
- It's okay.

1755
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:22,040
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1756
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,500
- Or you could move over for him.
- They earned 14 points.

1757
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,500
You should let him take it.

1758
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,500
We got 14 points.

1759
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,500
- Team Suk Jin earned 14 points.
- We're winning.

1760
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,750
- It's okay, everyone.
- Let's just pass it over.

1761
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,810
I'll give it to Ji Hyo.
Take it, Ji Hyo.

1762
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,040
My ball!

1763
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,420
(Screaming)

1764
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:37,790
- All right.
- She received it.

1765
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:38,980
- Good job.
- She's good.

1766
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,190
Pass it over.
It's more important to pass the ball over.

1767
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:43,250
Take it easy, Suk Jin.

1768
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:45,250
- He got it.
- That's it.

1769
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,420
- Go ahead.
- Just pass it over.

1770
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,650
- Hit it. Pass it over.
- That's it!

1771
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:48,670
(Slipping)

1772
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,460
- Go ahead.
- Just pass it over.

1773
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,730
- Hit it. Pass it over.
- That's it!

1774
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:52,830
Yes!

1775
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:54,040
(Big Nose's smashing
is especially on point today.)

1776
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,940
- Why are you so good today?
- Why is he so good?

1777
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,040
- Why are you so good?
- Why am I?

1778
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,940
- Why are you so good?
- Why am I good?

1779
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:00,130
- Why are you so good?
- Soo Ah.

1780
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:01,130
Switch with her.

1781
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:02,900
- Jae Suk, join us. You must join.
- Okay.

1782
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,020
- Soo Ah, come. I'll play.
- Me?

1783
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,580
- You must kick it in the air.
- Why am I so good?

1784
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,620
(Seul Ki gets ready to serve.)

1785
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,250
It's not that.
Se Chan saved your pass.

1786
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:12,060
- All right.
- I'm sorry.

1787
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,920
(My goodness!)

1788
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,020
- It's okay.
- That was intense.

1789
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,650
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry!

1790
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:20,350
The referee is at a dangerous spot.
Can she sit at the back?

1791
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,230
- Sit behind the cameras.
- Is the referee okay?

1792
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:23,830
- It's dangerous, that's why.
- What's wrong with you?

1793
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:26,870
- It's because it's dangerous.
- So Min is doing well as a referee.

1794
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,770
Seul Ki, take this.

1795
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:30,670
- It's mine.
- Seul Ki.

1796
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:31,730
- Give it to Se Chan.
- All right.

1797
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:33,480
- Do you want to kick it?
- Okay. I'll hit it lightly.

1798
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,480
Go for it, Suk Jin.

1799
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,000
Oh, no!

1800
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
(Oh, no!)

1801
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,380
(Receiving it with her stomach)

1802
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,520
Oh, no!

1803
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:43,650
- You did it. Well done.
- Are you okay?

1804
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:45,710
- Well done.
- "Oh, no!"

1805
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:47,210
- "Oh, no."
- Well done.

1806
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,190
It was like a comedy skit. "Oh, no!"

1807
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:51,630
- But I like her mindset.
- What's the score?

1808
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:53,520
Wait. I think Soo Ah
will be a good referee too.

1809
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:56,020
I think you will be.
Do you want to give it a try?

1810
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,500
- Let's just play first.
- My gosh.

1811
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,770
- I didn't go after it either.
- Soo Ah is indeed athletic.

1812
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,230
- I'll pass over whatever comes.
- Let's pass over the ball.

1813
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:03,810
We need to catch up.

1814
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,730
- I'll pass it to Eunhyuk.
- Go ahead.

1815
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:06,980
- Here, Eunhyuk.
- Give it to him.

1816
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:08,650
- Eunhyuk.
- Okay. Pass it.

1817
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:12,710
- Leave it, Suk Jin.
- He told you to leave it!

1818
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:15,850
(Hitting the bull's-eye)

1819
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,580
(Grunting)

1820
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,190
(Seok Sam received
a tornado shot with his forehead.)

1821
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,650
- Suk Jin.
- Nice one.

1822
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,630
- It wasn't expected.
- I thought he was doing well.

1823
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:25,000
Good work.

1824
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,130
- Nice.
- Good work.

1825
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,650
It's 44 to 15.

1826
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:30,690
- That's it. It's out.
- Catch it. There you go.

1827
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,040
- That's it. It's out.
- Catch it.

1828
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,730
(A perfect receive)

1829
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:36,270
- You shouldn't have caught it.
- Wasn't it out?

1830
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,130
- Nice catch.
- Hey.

1831
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:39,500
- Seul Ki, give it to me.
- Nice catch.

1832
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,230
- We lost.
- Thank you.

1833
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:42,850
- You shouldn't catch it.
- It's okay. It was only one point.

1834
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,210
- Nice catch.
- Good job, Seul Ki.

1835
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:46,210
(Team Jae Suk carefully
collects even 1 point.)

1836
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,480
Good one.

1837
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,850
- Nice receive.
- Let's pass it over no matter what.

1838
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:50,040
- One.
- Do you want to hit it?

1839
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,560
- Should I do it or you?
- What?

1840
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,520
That's not it.

1841
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:56,980
(The worst ball control)

1842
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,520
- That's not it.
- Hey, Eunhyuk!

1843
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:00,650
Why don't you
just leave it to your team?

1844
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,000
He's terrible at it.

1845
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,130
- Eunhyuk is a terrible player.
- What's with Eunhyuk?

1846
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:05,730
- What's wrong with Eunhyuk?
- He's horrible.

1847
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:07,290
- Leave the back to me.
- Are you going to...

1848
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:08,830
- Hey, Eunhyuk.
- play soccer this week or what?

1849
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:10,000
It's because she suddenly ran away.

1850
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,130
We should stay in the back.

1851
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:12,580
I'm sorry about that.

1852
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:13,630
- We caught him off guard.
- Here we go.

1853
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:14,940
- We caught him off guard.
- Let's earn some points.

1854
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,650
- Eunhyuk is...
- It's for Eunhyuk.

1855
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,100
All right.

1856
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,380
- Jae Suk hits to a certain spot.
- All right.

1857
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:23,210
- What do I do?
- There really is.

1858
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:24,210
(A tornado shot)

1859
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:26,250
(But Jong Kook predicted it
and received the ball.)

1860
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,020
- All right!
- Use your head!

1861
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:31,350
- It's Ji Seok Sam!
- Use your head!

1862
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:33,520
(Delayed attack)

1863
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,560
Suk Jin!

1864
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,100
- He tried to make it funny.
- How could you...

1865
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,830
- It was really hard to receive it.
- You shouldn't do that.

1866
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,000
- He couldn't hit it.
- That's old-fashioned slapstick.

1867
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,940
- It was really hard to receive it.
- He couldn't hit it.

1868
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,730
- It was really hard to receive it.
- It wasn't close enough.

1869
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:45,210
It was old-fashioned slapstick.

1870
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,730
Thank you for your slapstick.

1871
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,270
All right.

1872
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,120
- We should keep the winning streak.
- Go ahead.

1873
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,210
- Here we go.
- One point.

1874
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,190
- Two points.
- It's Ji Seok Sam!

1875
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:59,460
- Two points.
- It's Ji Seok Sam!

1876
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,380
Suk Jin! You should receive it.

1877
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,630
It worked.

1878
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,190
(With an intensive attack on
Seok Sam, they got 3 more points.)

1879
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:07,830
- That was great.
- It worked.

1880
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,020
That attack was useful.

1881
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:10,230
You should've
passed the ball nicely.

1882
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:11,500
How much nicer could it get?

1883
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,130
Suk Jin, you should've
attacked back right away.

1884
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:15,130
Please don't say,

1885
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,310
- Suk Jin, watch carefully.
- "It's Ji Seok Sam."

1886
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:17,400
- Referee!
- What?

1887
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,380
He can't yell out Ji Seok Sam
during a game.

1888
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,380
- What's wrong with it?
- Ji Seok Sam!

1889
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:22,440
Red card!

1890
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,500
(Ji Seok Sam gets a red card.)

1891
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,040
- It's my fault?
- Good one, So Min.

1892
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,520
- I got a red card?
- She has the authority.

1893
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:27,850
Suk Jin, watch carefully.

1894
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,040
Let's turn the tables.

1895
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,940
That's it! Hold on.

1896
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,520
- Pass it over!
- Pass it over!

1897
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,620
(Screaming)

1898
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,750
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong with him?

1899
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,350
Why did he come to me?

1900
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:40,100
- All right!
- All right!

1901
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,920
- You guys are so good.
- We won.

1902
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,900
- All right!
- You guys are so good.

1903
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,060
- Good job.
- All right.

1904
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:47,730
We won.

1905
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:49,000
- We did it.
- All right.

1906
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,540
(Ji Seok Sam and his friends
lost just like that.)

1907
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,480
(The final whistle)

1908
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,350
- No!
- I'm sorry.

1909
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:58,150
Hey, that's my role!

1910
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,750
- Sorry.
- I mean...

1911
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:00,940
- Come on. She's the referee.
- That's...

1912
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,520
I can't believe we won.

1913
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,850
(The production crew unintentionally
breached the contract.)

1914
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:05,420
You guys are so good.

1915
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,920
- What's wrong, So Min?
- So Min, we won.

1916
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,980
(Blowing whistle)

1917
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:10,190
- I mean...
- That was my role.

1918
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:11,350
(She fulfills her wish
although it's late.)

1919
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:12,900
- I can't believe we won.
- Announce the winner.

1920
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,520
- You should announce the winner.
- All right.

1921
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,190
They win!

1922
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,560
- "They win?"
- Now, switch sides.

1923
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,900
- We're switching sides?
- The match is over.

1924
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:20,540
We're not switching sides?

1925
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:21,940
(The match is over.)

1926
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,500
So Team Jae Suk won.

1927
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,580
You guys are so good.

1928
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:28,100
The representatives of Team Jae Suk
will play rock-paper-scissors.

1929
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:30,040
- Soo Ah, you play it.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

1930
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,270
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

1931
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,750
Suk Jin and Seul Ki are 4th.
Jong Kook and Se Chan are 5th.

1932
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:37,250
Rock-paper-scissors

1933
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,850
- All right!
- You're in first place.

1934
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:40,120
- We're in first place?
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

1935
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,290
- We're in first place.
- Rock-paper-scissors

1936
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:43,880
- Gosh, we lost.
- We're in second place.

1937
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,020
(2nd-place team can also find out
one of their identities.)

1938
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,830
We can now reveal
each other's identities.

1939
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:47,830
- I'm glad we're in second place.
- Really?

1940
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:48,830
- What?
- Now we'll know.

1941
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:49,920
Soo Ah, watch carefully.

1942
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,130
Okay. Let's go, Soo Ah.

1943
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:53,770
We should've won first place.

1944
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,500
I feel so wrongly accused.
I'm really not the poacher.

1945
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,540
Why do they keep accusing me
of being one?

1946
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:59,830
- Are you suspecting me?
- I think you are the poacher.

1947
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:01,580
To be honest, you seem suspicious.
I'm not the poacher.

1948
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:04,270
- I'm really not.
- I'll tell you your identities.

1949
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:06,310
- I'm a bear.
- Haha is...

1950
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:09,580
- Please return to the hall.
- Okay.

1951
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:11,120
(Tiger Soo Ah found out
Haha's identity.)

1952
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:12,880
How many more games
are we going to play?

1953
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,920
We only have one last game.

1954
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,130
We only have one more?

1955
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,290
Then we should know
who the poachers are by now.

1956
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:19,920
I suspected Eunhyuk,
but he doesn't seem like one too.

1957
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,650
My only fault is playing hard.

1958
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:23,730
Doesn't Eunhyuk seem fishy?

1959
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:25,100
I think he didn't try hard...

1960
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,370
- because he's the poacher.
- I'm not really good...

1961
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:27,630
at foot volleyball, to be honest.

1962
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:28,940
- It's not that.
- You're confessing that now?

1963
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:30,100
- You're confessing that now?
- You didn't play intentionally, no?

1964
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,830
- I'm better at soccer.
- If you won, you'd be revealed.

1965
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:33,500
- I think you're the poacher.
- I was so out of it earlier, so...

1966
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,350
It didn't look like Eunhyuk
played terribly on purpose.

1967
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:38,380
(Right then, Jong Kook
defends Eunhyuk.)

1968
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:39,480
- I think...
- What?

1969
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,150
- He's just bad at it?
- He didn't do it on purpose.

1970
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,940
You're striking
a deal with me again.

1971
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:43,940
A deal.

1972
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:46,060
- Gosh, who could it be?
- Hold on.

1973
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,650
(Eunhyuk dodged a bullet
thanks to Jong Kook.)

1974
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:49,020
Did I pick the wrong one?

1975
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,130
Why? What happened?

1976
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:53,460
Haha is the poacher, right?

1977
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,130
- He must be.
- Haha...

1978
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:57,190
- Haha is the poacher, right?
- What is it?

1979
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:58,230
What's Haha's identity?
Tell us honestly.

1980
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:59,270
- What?
- Haha's identity.

1981
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:01,270
He's just an animal.

1982
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:02,310
- Who? You?
- Who?

1983
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:03,500
- Haha?
- Haha is an animal.

1984
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,630
- Haha?
- He is just a bear?

1985
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:05,630
He's not the poacher.

1986
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:07,380
I think it's either
Ji Hyo or Suk Jin.

1987
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:08,770
If no one is the poacher,
then who could it be?

1988
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:10,150
I think you're the poacher.

1989
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,380
- Me?
- Aren't you the poacher?

1990
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,150
Because if we won this time,
his identity...

1991
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:14,770
- would've been revealed.
- It would've been revealed.

1992
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:16,310
- So he...
- But I...

1993
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:19,080
I only played hard. That's all.

1994
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,830
You didn't play hard.

1995
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:23,730
I did. I scored so many times.

1996
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:24,880
Gosh, this guy...

1997
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,960
Suk Jin is not the poacher.
I can guarantee that.

1998
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,020
- I'm not the poacher.
- He's not?

1999
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:29,630
- I can guarantee it.
- Listen to her.

2000
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:31,330
- It must be him.
- He's not the poacher?

2001
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:33,500
I can guarantee
that he's not the poacher.

2002
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,560
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

2003
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:38,440
Then it must be Ji Hyo.

2004
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,130
Will you decide
with rock-paper-scissors?

2005
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:41,270
Yes.

2006
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:42,380
- Okay.
- I'm really not the poacher.

2007
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,540
- I'm not the poacher either.
- Rock-paper-scissors

2008
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:46,480
Whose identity did you check?

2009
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,520
Ji Hyo.

2010
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,580
- What is Ji Hyo?
- What is she?

2011
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,750
- No, Ji Hyo checked mine.
- I...

2012
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,190
- Then what is So Min?
- Why...

2013
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,250
- You must've told each other.
- Did they tell you?

2014
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,710
- I won in rock-paper-scissors.
- You should've checked Ji Hyo's.

2015
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:55,830
- So Min is not the poacher?
- I'm not.

2016
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:56,960
- Well, So Min...
- She's not.

2017
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:58,960
- I'd be too weak to be a poacher.
- So Min is not the poacher?

2018
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:00,520
- What?
- Then what is So Min?

2019
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,830
- She seems tied up.
- I didn't see it.

2020
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:03,370
- It's her.
- You should've checked Ji Hyo's.

2021
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:06,040
We decided with rock-paper-scissors.

2022
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,440
That's not it. We gave you an order
to check Ji Hyo's identity.

2023
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,130
(She's definitely the poacher.)

2024
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,880
So what is she? Tell us.

2025
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,980
- Suk Jin.
- I'm sorry. We wanted to...

2026
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,650
You must hate me right now.

2027
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:19,440
So after the game,

2028
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,520
the 1st-place and 2nd-place teams
made their choices.

2029
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,790
I didn't see it.

2030
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:25,210
The first-place team,
Haha and Soo Ah,

2031
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:26,920
decided to switch their partners.

2032
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,250
- They did?
- They should.

2033
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,290
They should
if they're not the poachers.

2034
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:32,730
So Soo Ah picked Jong Kook.

2035
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,900
Haha picked So Min.

2036
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,100
- Who?
- Haha did.

2037
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:38,770
That makes
Se Chan and Ji Hyo a team.

2038
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:42,230
Let's change your vests
and play the last mission.

2039
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,230
Okay.

2040
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,540
(They'll play the last mission
after changing their vests.)

2041
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:47,330
Gosh, it's been a while
since I teamed up with Ji Hyo.

2042
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:50,350
Should I get hit?
Or do you want to get hit, Eunhyuk?

2043
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:51,480
I should...

2044
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,770
- Are you sure?
- get the taste of it.

2045
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:54,170
You can if you want.

2046
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:56,520
- The taste of the variety show.
- I don't mind.

2047
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:58,420
- I'm fine with...
- You're on different teams.

2048
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:02,230
- You and I are on different teams.
- Oh, right.

2049
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:03,250
(Forming alliance out of habit)

2050
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,500
- Jong Kook, you're my partner.
- Oh, right.

2051
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,920
- He just adores Eunhyuk so much.
- Jong Kook.

2052
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,670
Eunhyuk, Jong Kook
must adore you so much.

2053
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:10,630
I accidentally almost followed him.

2054
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:12,940
I thought we'd always
be on the same team.

2055
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,130
I almost followed him.

2056
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:15,630
Soo Ah, you can sit in front.

2057
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,770
Ji Hyo, I'm sure I'm right.

2058
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,380
These two are the poachers.

2059
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:21,540
Everyone, this is the last mission.

2060
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,770
After the mission,
the 1st-place and 2nd-place teams...

2061
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:25,270
will get a chance to check
each other's identities.

2062
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:26,710
Then we'll carry on
with the vote right away.

2063
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:29,850
I'm not sure who the poachers are,
to be honest.

2064
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,380
In the last mission,

2065
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:35,420
you can check the patience
and knowledge you have.

2066
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,230
It's called Heart Attack Quiz.

2067
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:38,250
Heart attack.

2068
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,290
Everyone has a chance to answer.

2069
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,500
Only the members
under the metal trays...

2070
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:42,900
will get hit with them.

2071
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:45,440
The questions we give...

2072
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:47,960
will have multiple answers.

2073
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:51,210
If you know an answer,
yell out, "Let me answer."

2074
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,210
The next person to answer...

2075
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:55,770
must give a bigger number of answers
than the previous one.

2076
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:58,000
So if the first person
got one correct answer,

2077
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:02,040
the next person must give
two or more correct answers...

2078
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,080
- to avoid the tray.
- It won't be easy.

2079
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,190
- It will be better to go first.
- It will be incredibly hard.

2080
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:07,290
A question might be,

2081
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:09,690
- "What does KBO stand for?"
- Right.

2082
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:11,190
Let's say someone said "Korea"...

2083
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:12,330
and got the other two wrong.

2084
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:13,750
Then he or she will be
in the first place.

2085
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:15,020
The next person might get,

2086
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:17,500
"Korea Baseball."
Then that person will survive.

2087
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,790
It ends when someone has
the full answer,

2088
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:19,900
- Okay.
- What does O stand for?

2089
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:20,940
Orange.

2090
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,460
- What does O stand for?"
- Orange.

2091
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:24,770
- Is it "Orange?"
- Organization.

2092
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,130
Why would it be "Orange?"

2093
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:27,310
She said it's "Orange."

2094
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,600
She said it so confidently.

2095
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,310
I thought
it stood for "Orientation."

2096
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,600
This is fun already.

2097
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,250
- Is it an acronym?
- This is fun already.

2098
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,440
I thought we just had to say...

2099
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:35,880
- the fitting words.
- That was insane.

2100
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,020
"Korea Baseball Orange"
sounds ridiculous.

2101
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,150
So it's an acronym.

2102
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:43,190
I thought, "Orange must have
a different meaning."

2103
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:44,290
I didn't know the last one either.

2104
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:45,920
Here comes the first question.

2105
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,100
The first question is...

2106
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,600
CNN.

2107
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,170
- Let me answer.
- Haha.

2108
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,460
(What does CNN stand for?)

2109
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:52,600
It will be hard.

2110
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,670
- Do you know the answer?
- Christmas.

2111
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:54,730
- I think I knew the answer.
- Cinema.

2112
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:56,230
Choo...

2113
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:57,600
- Christian.
- Choo...

2114
01:07:58,270 --> 01:07:59,400
Congratulations.

2115
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:00,810
Pass.

2116
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,540
Let me answer.

2117
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,480
- My goodness.
- Let me answer.

2118
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,480
So Min.

2119
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,350
Central...

2120
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:11,250
Night Night.

2121
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,420
Pass.

2122
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,650
Let me answer.

2123
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:14,650
I don't know what C stands for.

2124
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:15,690
- Let me answer.
- CNN.

2125
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:16,790
CNN.

2126
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,850
- Control...
- CNN.

2127
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:20,250
- Network...
- That isn't it, is it?

2128
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:21,650
Where did "Network" come from?

2129
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:23,330
- Natural.
- All right.

2130
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,270
- One word is correct.
- What?

2131
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:26,900
What did you say?

2132
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:28,460
- Control... What?
- Did he get one word right?

2133
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:30,170
He got one word right.

2134
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:32,330
- What did you say?
- He is in the first place.

2135
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:33,440
He didn't get C right.

2136
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,980
- I got a word right.
- What does C stand for?

2137
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,850
- "Control?"
- What does CNN stand for?

2138
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:38,980
I will give it a try. Central...

2139
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,220
Network News.

2140
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:43,790
- Jae Suk got two words right.
- Let me answer.

2141
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:44,980
For your information,

2142
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:47,220
the latter part is "News Network."

2143
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:48,390
- News Network.
- News Network.

2144
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:49,630
Let me answer.

2145
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,590
- Cyber News Network.
- It isn't "Cyber."

2146
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:54,150
- Cyber.
- Cyber.

2147
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:56,720
- Cyber.
- Let me answer.

2148
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:57,760
- What?
- I figured it out.

2149
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,260
- What is it?
- What is it?

2150
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,370
Cross!

2151
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:01,470
No.

2152
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:03,710
- Why would it be "Cross?"
- Let me answer.

2153
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:05,600
It must be the name of a place.

2154
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,270
- So Min.
- Comedy.

2155
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,580
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2156
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,210
Gosh, it hurts.

2157
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:13,050
Coca-Cola News Network.

2158
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,270
My goodness.

2159
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:16,720
All right. Let's go.

2160
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,290
- Coca-Cola.
- Let me answer.

2161
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,290
Combo... Combo News Network.

2162
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:22,760
- "Combo?"
- Is it a pizza?

2163
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,330
- It isn't a burger.
- "Combo?"

2164
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:26,650
Why do you keep hitting me?

2165
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,970
- It wasn't Suk Jin's answer.
- I let it go once.

2166
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:30,060
(There are mistakes
since the operation is manual.)

2167
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:31,370
It was my answer,
but Suk Jin got hit with a tray.

2168
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:32,690
He should have gotten hit.

2169
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:35,730
Would you tell us
the letter that comes after C?

2170
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:37,670
- The letter that comes...
- The letter that comes after C.

2171
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:38,840
- after C.
- The letter that comes after C...

2172
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:40,600
- is A.
- Let me answer.

2173
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:43,800
- In 3, 2, 1.
- A?

2174
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:45,440
- Let me answer.
- Cacao.

2175
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,470
- "Cacao?"
- Let me answer.

2176
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:48,750
So Min.

2177
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:50,480
This can't be the answer. Camera.

2178
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,550
(Laughing)

2179
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:54,790
Number three, what is up with you?

2180
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,130
- So it starts with "Co."
- Is that person angry?

2181
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:58,050
- Number three, what is up with you?
- It starts with "Ca."

2182
01:09:58,050 --> 01:09:59,590
- "Ca?"
- Candy.

2183
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:01,460
"Candy?"

2184
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:03,760
- Is that your answer?
- No.

2185
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:06,300
If everyone gives up,
Jae Suk and Eunhyuk will score.

2186
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,760
- Ca.
- Ca.

2187
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,300
It starts with "Ca."

2188
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,260
In five,

2189
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:12,880
- four, three,
- Do we know the word?

2190
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:14,380
- two...
- I have no idea.

2191
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:16,080
- Let me answer.
- I have no idea.

2192
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,250
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2193
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,510
- Come on, Suk Jin.
- Cable...

2194
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,120
- News Network.
- That must be it.

2195
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:22,680
- Cable News Network.
- That must be it.

2196
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,810
That must be it.

2197
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:25,960
("Cable News Network" is correct.)

2198
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:27,960
Suk Jin, that was incredible.

2199
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,590
My memory suddenly worked fast.

2200
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:31,630
"My memory suddenly worked fast?"

2201
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:32,760
That was incredible.

2202
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,090
We did it.

2203
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:36,720
Suk Jin, that was incredible.

2204
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,720
- It's "Cable."
- Cable.

2205
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,190
- Cable.
- It's a word we know.

2206
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:40,300
This time,

2207
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:43,140
- the answers are predetermined.
- Predetermined?

2208
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:44,840
- Thus, speed is essential.
- That's what I like.

2209
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,640
- What? I didn't hear him.
- The answers are predetermined.

2210
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,600
Name the four members
of The Beatles,

2211
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,580
the legendary British rock band.

2212
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,140

2215
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:57,250
Hey, that's...

2216
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,960
- That's ice cream.
- Isn't it "Shooting Star?"

2217
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:00,790
- I know their names.
- Let me answer.

2218
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:02,930

01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,150

(Correct)

2224
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,040
I gave away a hint
with my answer, "Shooting Star."

2225
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,670
When did his name change
to Ringo Starr?

2226
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,540
- It used to be Shooting Star.
- Hey.

2227
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:19,600
- What is up with "Shooting Star?"
- It's at Baskin-Robbins.

2228
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,600
- At least he came close.
- I am so annoyed.

2229
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,180
(His answer was pretty close.)

2230
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,380
- Right?
- I am so annoyed.

2231
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:26,840
- "Star" part was nearly the same.
- I know.

2232
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,290
Name the members of BTS,

2233

I will give Haha a chance.

2254
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:04,980
Why would you give him a chance?

2255
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:06,090
V,

2256
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:07,260

- You punk!
- Let me answer.

2261
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:14,550

the names of random people.)

01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:01,840
- Jimin, Jin,
- Si Won, Hee Chul.

2333
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,430
- RM, Suga...
- Hee Chul.

2334
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:04,560
- There you go.
- Hee Chul.

2335
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,400
- Hee Chul.
- j-hope.

2336
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,230
I missed j-hope.

2337
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:10,100
- There is j-hope.
- You did it.

2338
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:11,470
- j-hope.
- j-hope, I am sorry.

2339
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:12,840
- j-hope, I am sorry.
- I am sorry.

2340
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,620
- I was so confused.
- I am sorry.

2341
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,090
- j-hope, I am sorry.
- I am sorry.

2342
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,620
- Here comes the last question.
- Okay.

2343
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:20,620
Is it already the last question.
I want to answer more questions.

2344
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,520
Name the Chinese zodiac signs...

2345
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:23,850
in the right order.

2346
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:25,050
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2347
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:27,020
- Bakumaru, Hols, Gao, Cream...
- That's how I remember the order.

2348
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:28,960
Bakumaru, Hols, Gao, Cream
are the Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit

2349
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,970
Drago, Nyorori, Pakaracchi, Souffle
are the Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat

2350
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:33,040
Monk, Tart, Pochiro, Urii
are the Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig

2351
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,470
- We are the Eto Rangers
- Please say my answer is correct.

2352
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,930
Please.

2353
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:39,510
("Juuni Senshi Bakuretsu Eto Ranger"
is a cartoon series about...)

2354
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:42,210
(the 12 Chinese zodiac animals
aired in 1996.)

2355
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:46,340
(Bakumaru, Hols, Gao, Cream
are the Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit)

2356
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:48,550
Drago, Nyorori, Pakaracchi, Souffle
are the Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat

2357
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,620
Monk, Tart, Pochiro, Urii
are the Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig

2358
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:51,980
- We are the Eto Rangers
- Please say my answer is correct.

2359
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:53,350
Let me answer.

2360
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,390
- We are the Eto Rangers
- Rat,

2361
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:56,790
- Ox,
- The Eto Rangers

2362
01:14:56,790 --> 01:14:57,960
Tiger...

2363
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,690
Gao, Cream... Rabbit.

2364
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:01,500
- Isn't she answering too slowly?
- Drago... Dragon.

2365
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:03,520
- Nyorori.
- Snake,

2366
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,690
- Horse, Goat...
- Cat.

2367
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,470
- Cat.
- Go ahead.

2368
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:08,670
Time's up.

2369
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:10,370
- We are the Eto Rangers
- Bakumaru, Hols...

2370
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:11,800
Let me answer.

2371
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,730
- Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit,
- There you go.

2372
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:17,550
- Dragon, Snake,
- There you go.

2373
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:19,250
- Horse, Goat...
- There you go.

2374
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:20,470
You are almost done.

2375
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:22,140
- Monkey...
- You are almost done.

2376
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:24,420
- Three...
- Rooster and Pig.

2377
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:25,480
Rooster.

2378
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,810
Time's up. You named nine signs.

2379
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:28,420
(Seul Ki named 9 signs.)

2380
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:30,550
Is it okay to get the order wrong?

2381
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:31,680
You need to get the order right.

2382
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,890
- Do we need to get the order right?
- Yes.

2383
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:34,800
- Ji Hyo, do you know the songs?
- No.

2384
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:37,020
Rat. Bakumaru, Hols...

2385
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:38,430
Ox.

2386
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,040
Gao. Tiger.

2387
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,340
(Gao, Tiger)

2388
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:43,670
Tart.

2389
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:45,260
- Rabbit.
- Tart.

2390
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,040
- Water deer.
- Drago.

2391
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:48,710
- Dragon.
- Tart.

2392
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,180
- Snake.
- That's exactly what So Min did.

2393
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,140
- Horse.
- Thomson's gazelle.

2394
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:54,810
Goat.

2395
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,420
- Are we allowed to go that slow?
- Monkey.

2396
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,650
Rooster. Pochiro is...

2397
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:01,850
Dog. Pig.

2398
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:03,460
I answered the same way.

2399
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:05,330
I answered the same way.

2400
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:07,190
We are the Eto Rangers!

2401
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:11,090
Monk, Tart, Pochiro, Urii
are the Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig

2402
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:13,300
We are

2403
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:15,190
The Eto Rangers

2404
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,010
It's from our generation.

2405
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:18,430
- What is it?
- A cartoon series.

2406
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:20,010
A cartoon series
from their generation.

2407
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,680
- That was so funny.
- Was it from your generation?

2408
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,210
- Yes, it was from our generation.
- That was so funny.

2409
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:24,470
We don't know what it is.

2410
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:26,080
- My goodness.
- All right.

2411
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:27,420
The game has ended.

2412
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,920
Jae Suk and Eunhyuk placed first.

2413
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,140
(1st place, Jae Suk and Eunhyuk)

2414
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:31,590
Who placed second? That's important.

2415
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,090
Suk Jin and Seul Ki placed second.

2416
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:35,120
Ji Hyo and Se Chan placed third.

2417
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:37,480
Jong Kook and Soo Ah placed fourth.

2418
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:40,130
Haha and So Min placed fifth.

2419
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:43,370
For the last time,

2420
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:46,140
the top two teams
will receive a hint.

2421
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,800
This is an important moment.

2422
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:51,600
- Eunhyuk.
- It's over for Eunhyuk.

2423
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,140
- This is a very important moment.
- But Jong Kook saw his identity.

2424
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:56,900
I am telling you that I saw it.

2425
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:00,270
- Isn't it Haha?
- Eunhyuk isn't a poacher.

2426
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:01,680
Se Chan said Haha isn't a poacher.

2427
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:03,550
Seul Ki, did you see
Suk Jin's identity?

2428
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:04,980
- Isn't he a poacher?
- I saw it. He isn't a poacher.

2429
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:08,350
Soo Ah and Se Chan saw my identity.

2430
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,130
- Haha isn't a poacher.
- Eunhyuk isn't a poacher.

2431
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:13,150
- Se Chan said Haha isn't a poacher.
- He isn't.

2432
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:14,350
That means no one is a poacher.

2433
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:17,170
- I want to check your identity.
- I am not a poacher.

2434
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:19,470
Many people think
Eunhyuk is suspicious.

2435
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:21,800
That's because Se Chan started
that rumor.

2436
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:25,600
That poacher is framing me.
It's a witch hunt.

2437
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,580
I don't know who the poacher is.

2438
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:30,180
- I love how he doesn't give up.
- I really don't know.

2439
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,550
Someone is lying.

2440
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:34,580
(This poacher is under suspicion.)

2441
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,290
I got a sense of it after checking
two people's identities.

2442
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:38,750
The first person...

2443
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,680
- Eunhyuk, let's go.
- No one checked your identity.

2444
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,010
(Jae Suk and Eunhyuk
go to check each other's identity.)

2445
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:43,830
- Should I check mine?
- All right.

2446
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,930
- My garlic cloves.
- Open your container.

2447
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:47,330
Should we check our baskets?

2448
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:49,220
Are there more garlic gloves
than there were earlier?

2449
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:51,300
(Full)

2450
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:55,230
(This poacher has stolen
garlic gloves from animals.)

2451
01:17:55,230 --> 01:17:56,670
Hold on. This...

2452
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:59,140
- Can we check each other's garlic?
- I bet you have a lot.

2453
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:01,010
(Gasping)

2454
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,080
It's you.

2455
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,400
What? I played the games well.

2456
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,250
- I played the games well.
- Really?

2457
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:10,840
All right. Jae Suk is
a regular bear.

2458
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,760
Eunhyuk is a poacher.

2459
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:13,850
For goodness' sake.

2460
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:16,050
The two of you can't switch teams.

2461
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:18,050
(The two of you can't switch teams.)

2462
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:21,090
The only thing that remains
is arresting the poachers,

2463
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:22,690
so it won't help you to reveal
that Eunhyuk is one.

2464
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:25,430
- At least you know one poacher.
- That's right.

2465
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:27,670
You just need to find out
who the bear poacher is.

2466
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:30,430
- Still...
- Still...

2467
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:33,340
Each member has to guess
who the two poachers are, right?

2468
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,730
Yes. You will receive garlic cloves
if both answers are correct.

2469
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:39,340
Why did you take
so many garlic cloves?

2470
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:40,810
Eunhyuk has 63 garlic cloves.

2471
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:41,880
(Eunhyuk has 63 garlic cloves.)

2472
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,640
I think I will be
in the first place.

2473
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,220
- Thank you, Jae Suk.
- All right.

2474
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:47,720
(Jae Suk learned about
Eunhyuk's identity.)

2475
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,760
- If multiple people get it right,
- That's right.

2476
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,630
- the garlic cloves must be shared.
- Yes.

2477
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,150
- It's Eunhyuk.
- I think...

2478
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:55,150
the tiger poacher is
either Eunhyuk or Se Chan.

2479
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:56,870
I want to know
who the bear poacher is.

2480
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:58,220
- It's either one of them.
- The bear poacher.

2481
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:00,040
The bear poacher is
either Haha or...

2482
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,060
- You.
- But Soo Ah said it isn't him.

2483
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:04,560
- She said it with seriousness.
- It isn't Haha. It's Jong Kook.

2484
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,380
- It's Jong Kook or Haha.
- You aren't a poacher, right?

2485
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:08,270
- I am not a poacher.
- It isn't Haha.

2486
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,100
- It's me.
- It's Jong Kook.

2487
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,210
- Is it you?
- Isn't he a poacher?

2488
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:14,180
- Is it you?
- He is acting. I know it.

2489
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:16,440
He keeps saying
that he is a poacher.

2490
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,890
Don't be fooled.
Jong Kook is a poacher.

2491
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:21,850
I think it's him. I am certain.

2492
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:24,220
- Is it you?
- It's Jong Kook.

2493
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:26,330
- He was Seul Ki's partner.
- Suk Jin must be a poacher.

2494
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:28,430
- I am not a poacher.
- He isn't a poacher.

2495
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:29,760
- I saw her identity.
- He really isn't a poacher.

2496
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,370
- No?
- He really isn't a poacher.

2497
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,260
- Isn't Seul Ki a poacher?
- No.

2498
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:36,430
- She isn't a poacher.
- Is Se Chan a poacher then?

2499
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:38,300
- I am not a poacher.
- I think it's him.

2500
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:39,800
- I am not a poacher.
- No one is a poacher.

2501
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,540
Then who is a poacher?

2502
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:43,250
Everyone became a good liar.

2503
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:45,380
- Eunhyuk isn't a poacher.
- Of course not.

2504
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,050
- Everyone.
- It isn't him.

2505
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:48,580
I will give you the rules
of the final vote.

2506
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,510
- I have no idea.
- All right.

2507
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:52,920
Write down
the names of the two people...

2508
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,010
whom you suspect are the poachers.

2509
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:56,050
(They will each vote on two people
suspected as poachers.)

2510
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:57,790
If you arrest both poachers,

2511
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:59,500
- you will receive 20 garlic cloves.
- Did he say 20 garlic cloves?

2512
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:01,430
Getting one name right
is meaningless.

2513
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:02,870
- We need to get both of them.
- Yes.

2514
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:05,330
As for the poachers,

2515
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:07,760
they will lose
twice as many garlic cloves...

2516
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,670
as the votes they receive.

2517
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:14,340
So a poacher who received 10 votes
will lose 20 garlic cloves.

2518
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:17,400
The person whose eyes shifted
upon hearing those words...

2519
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,680
So vote well to make them lose
their garlic cloves.

2520
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,080
My goodness.

2521
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:24,390
But you will win more garlic cloves
if you answer correctly by yourself.

2522
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:25,750
(They might aim
to answer correctly by themselves.)

2523
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:28,010
All right. I will hand out
the ballots.

2524
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:29,850
- Let's vote.
- This is so hard.

2525
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,390
Poachers can write down any names.

2526
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:34,430
Their votes are meaningless.

2527
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,690
I will go with my initial hunch.
I am sorry.

2528
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:40,730
- For goodness' sake.
- I know who the tiger poacher is,

2529
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:42,370
- but not the bear poacher.
- I changed my mind.

2530
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:44,710
Arresting the poachers
is the only solution.

2531
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:46,710
There is no other way.

2532
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:49,880
I didn't go with my initial hunch.
I changed my mind.

2533
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,050
(Jong Kook chose Ji Hyo
as the bear poacher.)

2534
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:53,010
I think it's him...

2535
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:56,510
because Eunhyuk and Jong Kook
teamed up for a while...

2536
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:59,960
- before they split up.
- You are right.

2537
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:02,290
- Go with your hunch.
- Isn't Eunhyuk a poacher?

2538
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,260
He is bound to say no.

2539
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:05,850
- That's right.
- He wants to get it right alone.

2540
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:07,460
That's how it is.

2541
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:09,690
Even if he is a poacher?

2542
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,300
- But Eunhyuk...
- Seul Ki, are you done?

2543
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,670
Yes, I am done.

2544
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:14,840
- She was torn until the end.
- Didn't you turn in the ballot?

2545
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,370
Gosh, I was so torn.

2546
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:19,230
- All right, everyone.
- I trusted my hunch.

2547
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,180
- The results are out.
- I trusted my hunch.

2548
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:24,510
- Okay.
- I trusted Soo Ah.

2549
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:25,510
Firstly...

2550
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,750
- Did someone get them right?
- Yes.

2551
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:28,750
- Really?
- Both poachers?

2552
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,250
Someone got both poachers right.

2553
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,440
(There is an animal
that got 2 poachers right.)

2554
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,590
- Really?
- Both poachers?

2555
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:33,720
Someone got both poachers right.

2556
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:35,850
- Really?
- Are there more than one?

2557
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,830
- Really?
- I will tell you soon.

2558
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:41,220
I bet we got them right.
Eunhyuk and...

2559
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,650
- That's impressive.
- All right.

2560
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:44,170
(Before announcing the result)

2561
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:47,970
I will first reveal
how many votes everyone received.

2562
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:49,540
- Okay.
- Okay.

2563
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:51,710
Eunhyuk received six votes.

2564
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:53,710
It's Se Chan's doing.

2565
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:55,270
For goodness' sake.

2566
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:56,580
(Eunhyuk worked hard,
but he received 6 votes.)

2567
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:59,940
- Most of us voted for him.
- Everyone was swayed by him.

2568
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:02,920
Jong Kook received five votes.

2569
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:05,440
- You received many votes.
- Gosh.

2570
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,760
He is a good actor.
He should debut as an actor.

2571
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,890
- People are quick-witted.
- He should debut as an actor.

2572
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:11,480
- My goodness.
- Next.

2573
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:14,630
- Se Chan received 2 votes.
- Only 2 votes?

2574
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:16,760
Did Se Chan receive two votes?

2575
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:18,590
Haha, Suk Jin, and Ji Hyo
received one vote each.

2576
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:22,390
I will reveal
the poachers of the day.

2577
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:24,170
- Who are they?
- Jong Kook and Eunhyuk.

2578
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:26,710
Firstly, the poacher
who hid among the tigers is...

2579
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:28,180
Eunhyuk?

2580
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:29,210
(The poacher
who hid among the tigers)

2581
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:30,510
It must be Eunhyuk.

2582
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:32,300
- Eunhyuk.
- It's Eunhyuk.

2583
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,010
Roar.

2584
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:35,140
(The tiger poacher, Eunhyuk)

2585
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:37,180
(Roar!)

2586
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:40,550
- Roar.
- From the start...

2587
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:42,120
- He hid his identity well.
- Everyone suspected him.

2588
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,890
- He is sneaky.
- Everyone suspected him.

2589
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:45,150
Next.

2590
01:22:45,150 --> 01:22:46,890
(The poacher
who hid among the bears)

2591
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:48,760
- The one who hid among the bears.
- Who is it?

2592
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:15,970
- I am so curious about this one.
- Jong Kook.

2593
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:17,310
- He tortured me all day long.
- Haha.

2594
01:23:17,310 --> 01:23:18,640
(The bear poacher hid
behind Jong Kook's back.)

2595
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:19,940
- He tortured me all day long.
- Haha.

2596
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:22,610
(The bear poacher
sent everyone into confusion)

2597
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:24,820
I am really not a poacher.

2598
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:26,520
It really isn't me.

2599
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,480
- The one who hid among the bears.
- Who is it?

2600
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:30,390
- He tortured me all day long.
- Haha.

2601
01:23:30,890 --> 01:23:31,910
It's Suk Jin.

2602
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:34,360
(Suk Jin)

2603
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:35,390
No way.

2604
01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:39,790
(Suk Jin was the bear poacher.)

2605
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:42,290
(Frozen)

2606
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:43,770
(Everyone is shocked,)

2607
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:48,200
(but Seul Ki and Suk Jin cheer.)

2608
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,640
I thought about picking
between the two of them.

2609
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:51,640
(Suk Jin and Ji Hyo)

2610
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,870
This is so satisfying.

2611
01:23:53,870 --> 01:23:56,110
- I fooled everyone.
- This is so satisfying.

2612
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:57,870
You are the only one
who got both names.

2613
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:02,040
I thought about picking
between the two of them.

2614
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,480
I told you that I am not a poacher.

2615
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:04,480
My goodness.

2616
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:07,580
- How did he stay hidden?
- Seriously.

2617
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:10,230
(During the role selection,)

2618
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,820
(Suk Jin picked a poacher.)

2619
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,470
(His team placed 1st
and his cover got blown right away.)

2620
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:16,290
- How did we place first?
- I can't believe you are a poacher.

2621
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:17,860
- I will switch teams.
- No.

2622
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:20,510
It would be more advantageous
to maintain this arrangement.

2623
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:23,470
If you catch the poachers,
you will receive a big benefit.

2624
01:24:23,610 --> 01:24:25,870
- We should be a team until the end.
- I understand.

2625
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:27,150
Let's not switch teams.

2626
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:28,280
- We won't switch teams.
- We won't switch teams.

2627
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,980
(Thus, Seul Ki formed an alliance
with a poacher.)

2628
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:34,720
(Everyone time
people suspected Suk Jin)

2629
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,040
(Suk Jin is not the poacher.
I can guarantee that.)

2630
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:40,780
(Seul Ki actively protected
Suk Jin.)

2631
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:43,360
(Seul Ki was the only one
who knew about his true identity,)

2632
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:46,450
(so the members trusted
Suk Jin to be a bear.)

2633
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:48,430
I want to know
who the bear poacher is.

2634
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,600
(It was all thanks
to the smart tiger.)

2635
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,600
- Did you know?
- I knew.

2636
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,770
You knew.

2637
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,070
- It was Suk Jin.
- I knew.

2638
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:59,610
Haha, why did you pretend
to be a poacher?

2639
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:01,570
I didn't do anything!

2640
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,240
- He seemed like a poacher.
- What did I do?

2641
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:07,150
- We had a good plan.
- I know.

2642
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:09,350
- Seul Ki.
- Seul Ki did an incredible job.

2643
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:12,080
- Only Seul Ki got both poachers.
- Seul Ki...

2644
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,980
totally fooled us.

2645
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,690
- Seul Ki fooled us.
- I trusted her.

2646
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:18,030
- Seriously.
- That should have been me.

2647
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:21,160
Thus, Seul Ki received
20 more garlic cloves.

2648
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:23,900
- Yes.
- Eunhyuk lost 12 garlic cloves.

2649
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:25,100
- Did I lose garlic cloves?
- Yes.

2650
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:27,030
Oh, no. Oh, my goodness.

2651
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:29,160
Suk Jin lost two garlic cloves.

2652
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,270
- Two?
- Yes.

2653
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:34,010
Now, you will see the present
the top three members will receive.

2654
01:25:34,010 --> 01:25:37,010
- What are those?
- This will air on Lunar New Year.

2655
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,280
(Barley croaker
and king-sized rib set)

2656
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:40,980
It's the barley croaker
and king-sized rib set.

2657
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:42,440
- One each?
- Yes. One each.

2658
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,280
- Gosh, please.
- It looks delicious.

2659
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:47,280

Eunhyuk with 51 garlic cloves.

2662
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:52,930
Gosh. After losing
some of his garlic cloves?

2663
01:25:52,930 --> 01:25:54,570
- Who's the second?
- And the second place...

2664
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:56,290
is Suk Jin with 43 garlic cloves.

2665
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:58,190
(The 2nd place is
Suk Jin with 43 garlic cloves.)

2666
01:25:58,270 --> 01:26:00,160

2667
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:02,270

2668
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:04,180
- Congratulations.
- Okay.

2669
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:05,940
These three will get the prize.

2670
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:09,780
So Min is the 8th, Soo Ah is
the 9th, and Jong Kook is the 10th.

2671
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:11,720
(So Min, Soo Ah, and Jong Kook
will get the penalty.)

2672
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,110
- Why Jong Kook?
- Are you the last?

2673
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,520
He's been the 1st and 2nd
the whole time.

2674
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,950
- I took all his garlic cloves.
- He took mine.

2675
01:26:17,950 --> 01:26:18,980
Really?

2676
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,650
I protected him to win.

2677
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:23,760
I wanted to arrest
the poachers myself.

2678
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,620
So the three of you
will get the penalty.

2679
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:27,620
(The last 3 members
will get the penalty.)

2680
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:29,360
You will mince...

2681
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,100
the garlic you earned today
before going home.

2682
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,530
- My goodness.
- That sounds like a lot of work.

2683
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:36,440
- I'm good at mincing the garlic.
- Good.

2684
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:38,480
- Mince the garlic.
- I'm good at it.

2685
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:41,370
Is there an easier way
to mince the garlic?

2686
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:42,680
Should I crush them all?

2687
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,410
We should crush them all.

2688
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:47,240
I made my bid for victory
after a long time today.

2689
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,980
This is my first time here,
but I'm crushing garlic.

2690
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:55,060
Gosh, this helps me
work out my forearm muscles.

2691
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:57,060
- Seriously.
- Is this part of your workout?

2692
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:58,820
This gives me a good workout.

2693
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:01,930
- I'm good. They are all minced.
- This is good enough.

2694
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:04,100
(Running Man Country Club
located in Ilsan)

2695
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,070
(Without the female members,)

2696
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:08,030
(they are like reckless
middle-aged men at a golf course.)

2697
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:09,660
(To meet them,)

2698
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:10,780
(a strict variety show director,)

2699
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:13,200
(Pak Se Ri is here.)

2700
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:17,240
(Variety hole-in-one:
A body for a slapstick comedy)

2701
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,820
(Risk your life
for the variety show golf.)

2702
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:23,650
(Variety show lie:
Body type that makes people laugh)

2703
01:27:23,650 --> 01:27:24,650
(Isn't that the parallel universe theory?)

2704
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:27,260
(Variety show hazard: Obstacles that
you have to overcome for laughter)

2705
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:29,260
(They are the most difficult
students to deal with.)

2706
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:30,560
(However...)

2707
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,150
(I will break through)

2708
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:38,030
(And pull ahead)

2709
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:42,570
(And I'll finally win)

2710
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:45,640
(Se Ri and Birdie Buddy)
