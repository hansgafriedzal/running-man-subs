1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,810
- Hello.
- Hey.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,610
- Are you wearing golf clothes?
- Yes, I am.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,480
- That's so cool.
- You look nice.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,950
We should go golfing sometime.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,040
You're here.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,520
I heard Se Chan was good.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,780
- People say that.
- Hello.

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,090
This is a fairway snack bar.

9
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,990
I see. This is a snack bar.

10
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,030
But it's so sunny in here.
There is no shade.

11
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,400
Hello.

12
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,290
You guys should carry
a golf bag around like this.

13
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,290
What are you doing with the toilet bag?

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,290
This isn't a toilet bag.

15
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,760
Are you going to a bathhouse?

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,510
Have you not played golf before?
This is a clutch bag.

17
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,870
If your shirt is torn,
you should buy a new one.

18
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,300
It has patches.

19
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,150
Aren't these climbing clothes?

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,150
- What is he wearing?
- Am I wearing the right one?

21
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,940
- What are the gloves for?
- What's with your gloves?

22
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,580
- I was just told to wear these.
- This isn't UFC.

23
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,120
- The gloves...
- Suk Jin.

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
- What?
- You look cool.

25
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,340
People wear things like this these days.

26
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,010
- That's not true.
- Are you a kangaroo or what?

27
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,980
- Kangaroo?
- Are you a kangaroo? What's this?

28
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,720
Hey, you could use some pockets
while playing golf.

29
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,290
- That's too weak.
- What's weak?

30
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,120
Are you a golf instructor?

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,090
- He looks like an instructor.
- All right, guys.

32
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,400
- I think I've seen him before.
- He's a golf instructor.

33
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,010
- I saw him before.
- You're a pro, right?

34
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,710
Good shot.

35
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,570
In that outfit, you look...

36
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,210
(You look like Gook Jin.)

37
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,410
You look like Gook Jin.

38
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,120
I'm telling you.

39
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,650
Right?
He looks just like Gook Jin, doesn't he?

40
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,050
"Hello? Excuse me?"

41
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,550
- "What?"
- "What?"

42
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,990
- "Don't stay up all night."
- "What?"

43
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,220
- They look alike.
- They are similar in size.

44
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,490
- I know.
- Well... I'm a little...

45
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,990
My goodness.

46
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,600
- Seriously, Jae Suk...
- "Hello?"

47
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,770
You shouldn't play golf.

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,830
Good shot.

49
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,870
(His weak points stand out
when he's dressed in golf clothes.)

50
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,410
- "Hello?"
- My goodness.

51
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,910
- You look horrible.
- Okay.

52
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,770
- What?
- Are you a kangaroo?

53
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,210
- They already said that.
- Are you a kangaroo or what?

54
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,770
- Why are you doing this?
- He's tearing it off.

55
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,520
Hey, this is the point.

56
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,180
Is this a cushion?

57
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,580
- Hey.
- What is this?

58
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,180
- What are you doing?
- It's a diaper.

59
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,850
- A diaper.
- It's a diaper.

60
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,660
He should use it in an emergency.

61
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,660
My jacket is too simple without it.

62
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,760
Give me back.

63
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
(Innocent)

64
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,660
The girls won't be here today.
We shouldn't be so excited.

65
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,960
- This is so fun.
- We're being too...

66
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,990
(The snack bar is
like an indoor playground.)

67
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,680
I'm happy as long as you guys have fun.

68
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,140
This is what Suk Jin likes.

69
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,000
He loves it.
Who else would play with him like this?

70
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,620
You should shift weight.

71
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,310
- How?
- You stand like this. Look.

72
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,450
Those who are not good
swing the club like this.

73
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,750
That's what you do.

74
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,490
You shouldn't do this.
You should move your body.

75
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,990
Suk Jin, who are you looking at?
Do you see someone?

76
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,460
Move your hips like this. Gosh.

77
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,200
- Gosh, Suk Jin.
- Are you all right?

78
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,300
- Suk Jin, it just made...
- Suk Jin.

79
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,900
- a cracking sound.
- You should be careful.

80
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,400
- You should warm up first.
- Gosh.

81
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,060
- Be careful in the morning.
- I'm fine.

82
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,300
I've never played golf before.

83
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,500
You've never played golf?

84
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,930
I've never gotten on the field.

85
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,680
- Have you ever swung a club?
- I have.

86
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,110
- You have?
- So you played it before.

87
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,150
- Indoor...
- You two...

88
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,000
You two look like typical...

89
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,120
You two look like typical bullies.

90
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,920
- No, we're not.
- You look like bullies.

91
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,050
We look like local gangsters, right?

92
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,280
- And I'm his minion.
- Exactly.

93
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,730
- "You're right, boss."
- "All right. Have a seat."

94
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,930
"Yes, boss."

95
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,460
"I'm sorry I'm late, boss."

96
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,830
"Hey, have a seat."

97
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,830
- "Hey, guys."
- It's so typical.

98
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,300
The weather is nice today.

99
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,300
- By the way, today...
- What's going on?

100
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,670
- Some members are absent.
- Unfortunately,

101
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,400
- So Min got...
- I was waiting.

102
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,580
- Her leg.
- She had surgery.

103
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,740
- She's leaving the hospital today.
- I see.

104
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,740
- Right.
- And...

105
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,610
Ji Hyo didn't...

106
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,920
- She didn't get the vaccine.
- Right. She couldn't.

107
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,020
- She's allergic to western drugs.
- That's right.

108
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,120
- We all know that.
- So she rarely takes...

109
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,890
- western medicine.
- She just fights sickness.

110
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,080
- Totally.
- She can't even take antibiotics.

111
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,650
She will have a PCR test on Wednesday.

112
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,120
- Then the self-isolation ends.
- It will end.

113
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,090
I talked to her on the phone.

114
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,960
Ji Hyo says she loves being isolated.

115
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,200
I've talked to her too.

116
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,740
I called her
and asked if she was doing okay,

117
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,830
- and she was just happy.
- She's really happy.

118
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
That's how she lives.

119
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,770
- I know.
- Seriously, she's just happy.

120
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,400
Ji Hyo calls me once a day.

121
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,300
- Really?
- Yes.

122
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,000
- She does?
- Yes.

123
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,310
She's changed a lot.

124
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,980
- Ji Hyo has changed a lot.
- Gosh.

125
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,920
And So Min calls me morning and night.

126
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,580
So Min does? I see.

127
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,650
I asked Ji Hyo, "What are you doing now?"

128
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,650
"I'm making hot pot bulgogi."
Seriously, she said this.

129
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,200
Who did? You mean Ji Hyo?

130
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,800
- I'm serious.
- She sounds so sweet.

131
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,990
- She was so excited.
- What's with her?

132
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,730
Did she really talk with a melody?

133
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,040
- Yes, she did. I was shocked.
- She did?

134
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,470
- "I'm making hot pot bulgogi."
- "I'm making hot pot bulgogi."

135
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,470
I can imagine that though.

136
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,200
It feels awkward to shoot
this show without them.

137
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,500
- It's strange.
- It's awkward.

138
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
I know. It feels weird.

139
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,570
This is when...

140
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,570
- So Min weighs in.
- Right. That's what she does.

141
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,310
- She'd walk around here.
- And she'd talk about our clothes.

142
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,350
Ji Hyo is quiet during the opening,
but I can feel her absence.

143
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,490
- I know.
- Exactly.

144
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,090
So Min would've already tried
swinging the club several times.

145
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,490
I know. She would do that.

146
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,100
Today, we have a special guest
who's perfect for this place.

147
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,120
Someone's coming.

148
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,190
Please bring in the guest.

149
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,300
- Who is it?
- "Hello?"

150
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,740
- It'd be funny if it was Gook Jin.
- Gook Jin?

151
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,410
- "Hello?"
- I wish we'd have Gook Jin here.

152
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,200
(Who's today's special guest
at Running Man Country Club?)

153
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,410
My goodness.

154
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,300
- I wish we'd have Gook Jin here.
- Who is it?

155
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,850
(The golf master, Pak Se Ri)

156
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,440
Coach Pak.

157
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,010
(A golf hero)

158
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,750
(A golf empress)

159
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,390
(A golf master)

160
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,990
(She made Korea stand back up.)

161
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,730
Pak Se Ri's superb winning mentality.

162
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,340
(The living legend of Korean golf)

163
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,910
(She's the legend
with all kinds of records.)

164
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,700
(She will guide the novice golfers
of Running Man today.)

165
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,850
(Today's guest is Pak Se Ri.)

166
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,420
(This is her first time here,
but she looks somewhat familiar.)

167
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,010
- Jong Kook.
- She's Pak Se Ri.

168
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,090
(Jong Kook!)

169
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,680
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook.

170
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,810
Jong Kook.

171
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,790
- Please play "One Man" for her.
- They look alike.

172
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,990
- Play "One Man" for her.
- Please come here.

173
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,050
Why would I sit next to him?

174
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,490
Just sit.

175
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,690
It's like a decalcomania.

176
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,120
- Did you two go to the same salon?
- She looks like Jong Kook.

177
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,490
You two really look alike.

178
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,300
You should've told me.
I would've worn a matching shirt.

179
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,840
I would've worn a vest.

180
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,630
You two are wearing matching tops.

181
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Hello.

182
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,570
- We talked on the phone before.
- Right.

183
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,680
When?

184
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,500
- When?
- We talked the other day.

185
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,680
- We talked on the phone.
- Why are you acting friendly?

186
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,570
- We did talk on the phone.
- Someone called me.

187
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,850
- Who was it?
- Suk Jin did?

188
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,740
You called her on "Se Ri Money Club."

189
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,350
- That's right. He did.
- Oh, right.

190
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,090
- During the shoot.
- That's when.

191
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,290
- Suk Jin.
- What?

192
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,590
The shoot should go smoothly,
but why did you bring that up?

193
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,590
We just talked on the phone.

194
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,950
You broke the flow.

195
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,860
- It was nice talking to you.
- You too.

196
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,930
- Please have a seat.
- Let's sit.

197
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,870
He's acting as if we're at a restaurant.

198
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,390
Suk Jin seems upset.

199
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,240
This isn't a restaurant.

200
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
- No.
- She didn't seem so excited.

201
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,480
- Why are you sulky?
- That's not true.

202
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,800
- I'm not sulky.
- Don't be sulky.

203
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,070
- They are just saying that.
- Anyway,

204
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,220
Coach Pak Se Ri is...

205
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,050
- She's really...
- She's a legend.

206
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,120
She's a hero.

207
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,740
I met her on "Happy Together."

208
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,350
- Did she join the show?
- She did.

209
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,290
- It was a long time ago.
- I see.

210
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,380
- Right.
- It was "Metal Tray Karaoke Room."

211
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,880
- Yes.
- Seriously?

212
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,950
- That's true.
- It was a really long time ago.

213
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,950
That's when she looked just like me.

214
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,990
Is he talking about that time?

215
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,100
(Upset)

216
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,490
You two really look alike
when you sit next to each other.

217
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,700
- Totally.
- That's true.

218
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,870
You must get that a lot.
I bet you're tired of hearing it.

219
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,680
I was once invited...

220
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,870
- to Running Man before.
- You were?

221
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,980
Back then, the theme was...

222
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,120
- the doppelganger special.
- Right.

223
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,620
- I know.
- I see.

224
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,380
Why did you not join us?

225
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,750
- She should've been here.
- I asked what it was about,

226
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,590
and I heard I'd be here
as Jong Kook's doppelganger.

227
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,820
So I was like, "Forget about it."

228
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,950
- I gave a flat refusal.
- Back then,

229
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,820
K.Will joined us instead.

230
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,970
- Right.
- Right.

231
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,930
- That's when.
- That's when.

232
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,000
And I kept my distance from Running Man.

233
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,700
I just felt distant from this show.

234
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,500
But my niece loves Running Man.

235
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,000
- She does?
- Seriously?

236
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,940
Whenever I go to see her,
she's watching Running Man.

237
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,620
So I knew she loved this show.

238
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,290
She likes our show because it has
someone who looks like her aunt.

239
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,010
- Exactly.
- That's why.

240
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,290
- It features her family.
- I know.

241
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,230
Let me tell you something.

242
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,450
She hates it when someone
she just met talks down to her.

243
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,250
Make sure not to talk in a casual way.

244
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,870
Would it be strange
if we talked in a casual way today?

245
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,870
(The man who's 11 years older than her
asks her carefully.)

246
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,370
I want to talk in a casual way.

247
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,500
- You should never let him do that.
- What?

248
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,130
Don't let him talk casually.
You should never do that.

249
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,910
Do you want to see how it feels?

250
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,850
- I will show you.
- Don't do that.

251
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,910
Stop it.

252
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,480
- Se Ri, did you eat?
- Suk Jin, did you eat?

253
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,540
- She likes it.
- My gosh.

254
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,190
Don't treat our national hero like that.

255
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,650
I just want her to see how it feels.

256
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,690
Feel comfortable.

257
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,280
- Gosh, Suk Jin.
- What was that?

258
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,990
My gosh. What's with you?

259
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,360
Don't talk casually.

260
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,600
She likes it when I talk casually.

261
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,290
- This is awkward.
- No.

262
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,920
Are your bodyguards here?

263
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,290
I'm sorry. I'll stop.

264
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,240
- Are your bodyguards here?
- She likes it.

265
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,310
- I don't think so.
- He should learn his lesson.

266
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,670
Your bodyguards should teach him a lesson.

267
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,480
- This is funny.
- Today,

268
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,500
we have Pak Se Ri who's a rich friend
and the national team coach.

269
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,220
And we will have a race called
Se Ri and Birdie Buddy.

270
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,280
- Se Ri and Birdie Buddy?
- Birdie Buddy.

271
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,460
Today, Se Ri will be a variety show coach.

272
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,750
She will lead the five reckless members
of Running Man...

273
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,200
- doing the 18 mission holes.
- My gosh. The 18 mission holes.

274
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,460
It will be too difficult.

275
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,700
All the five members of Running Man are...

276
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,530
subject to a penalty now.

277
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,530
(The 5 members are subject to a penalty.)

278
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,030
Only those who buy an exemption card...

279
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,530
will be exempted from a penalty.

280
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,540
And you will get the money
to buy an exemption card...

281
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,370
after each mission.
The six of you will be a team.

282
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,580
And we will give you prize money.

283
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,450
You can buy penalty exemption cards...

284
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,990
- and even the prize with the money.
- Okay.

285
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,990
All the prize money will be
paid to Coach Pak.

286
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,460
Everything will be
at Coach Pak's discretion...

287
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,830
including planning strategies
and distributing money.

288
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,990
Is it okay not to give them
any money at all?

289
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,700
If you don't do well,

290
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,200
you're not going to get any money.

291
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,970
- Se Ri wouldn't give us any money.
- I'm not sure if I can say this.

292
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,710
You did a TV show
with the disobedient guys before.

293
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,440
But we're not like them. You'll see.

294
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,240
- Look at you.
- He's so sly.

295
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,740
- You are flattering her.
- Look at him.

296
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,080
He's so annoying.

297
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,510
He will make her upset today.

298
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,080
- She will get upset because of him.
- I know.

299
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,910
- He will upset her all day.
- She'll get furious.

300
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,190
Coach Pak, I'm very obedient.

301
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,060
- He should play well.
- You'll see.

302
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,730
Coach Pak, you will start
the race with 100 dollars.

303
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,250
- Hundred dollars.
- And you'll get the menu.

304
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,230
You can do whatever you want with it.

305
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,070
- Okay.
- What's that?

306
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,700
Please take a look at the menu.

307
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,870
(Running Man Country Club Menu)

308
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,900
The blanks will be revealed
at the end of the race.

309
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,840
- Exemption card.
- It will be revealed at the end.

310
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,110
There's a Korean rib eye set.

311
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,210
The hidden option will be revealed...

312
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,770
- if some of you pay 200 dollars.
- Hidden option?

313
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,500
The hidden option is revealed
when 200 dollars is paid.

314
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,040
(They should pay 200 dollars
to open the hidden option.)

315
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,240
- It's not open yet.
- The bills have my face on them.

316
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,010
Coach Pak,

317
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,460
you can give this to your niece.

318
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,990
- She will love it.
- Right.

319
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,860
- She will love it.
- This is actually nice.

320
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,360
Your niece will be excited.

321
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,120
- I know.
- She'd love it.

322
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,290
Tell her not to use it though.

323
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,620
I guess Coach Pak likes stuff like this.

324
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,240
She likes small and cute things.

325
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
She loves it.

326
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,210
- Give her some of our scratchcards.
- And R coins.

327
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,370
(We did give her some souvenirs
after the shoot.)

328
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,940
Before we start the race,

329
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,710
we will give you a mission...

330
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,270
where you can check
the members' basic golf skills.

331
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,850
It's called Putting Genius.

332
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,270
- Putting Genius.
- Putting.

333
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,410
- Jong Kook.
- I haven't done it for a while.

334
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,850
You will try...

335
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,280
putting in turn
on the miniature golf course.

336
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,650
If you pass level 1, you get 100 dollars.

337
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,750
And 120 dollars for level 2,
and 140 dollars for level 3.

338
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,520
- You will each be given one chance.
- Okay.

339
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,490
If you want to try again,
Coach Pak should try ten dollars.

340
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,660
- Then we will let you try again.
- Pay ten dollars?

341
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,340
Yes. You can pay the money
if you see anyone talented.

342
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,370
I don't think Coach Pak is so generous.

343
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,610
- She's not.
- You know me.

344
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,840
(The rich woman,
Pak Se Ri, is quite strict.)

345
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,980
I'm not generous.

346
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,770
Give us the balls.

347
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,820
(There were a lot of rumors
about the members' golf skills.)

348
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,350
- This is...
- You know what?

349
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,950
- Coach Pak...
- This will be fun.

350
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,690
I only use...

351
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,250
Cameron.

352
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,590
(He's quite picky when he's not so good.)

353
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,330
Those who are bad care about brands.

354
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,750
I want the thing that Tiger Woods uses.

355
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,560
I use the half-moon putter.

356
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,960
I use Cameron.

357
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,200
You each get to try it once.

358
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
- Can we practice?
- Let's practice.

359
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,990
- You get to practice only once.
- We get to practice once.

360
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,130
Only once?

361
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,370
I'm not good at this.

362
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,970
- Let me practice.
- It's all right.

363
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,070
Coach Pak, I'm not doing this on purpose,

364
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,340
but I hit the ball
without looking at it. Is it okay?

365
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,610
- What do you mean?
- Without looking at what?

366
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,870
- I hit the ball without looking.
- Where do you look then?

367
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,110
- Where do you look?
- This is what I do.

368
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,910
- Where do you look?
- I look at the hole.

369
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,010
- How...
- You can do that.

370
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,640
- This is what I do.
- You get to practice only once.

371
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,950
- Just give it a try.
- Okay.

372
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,010
- Here...
- That's strange.

373
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,510
He's standing here, but...

374
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,910
Good. Go ahead.

375
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,920
What? My goodness.

376
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,990
(He almost made it.)

377
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,960
(It's true that
Suk Jin doesn't look at the ball.)

378
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,620
Why do you hit the ball
looking at the hole?

379
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,200
- That's what I do.
- Seriously?

380
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,760
- I look at the hole.
- It works anyway.

381
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,370
It goes in the right direction anyway.

382
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,070
- It went well.
- It's the power that matters.

383
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,400
- It should've been stronger.
- Exactly.

384
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,630
It was a good stroke.

385
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,040
Why don't you go for 100 dollars?

386
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,170
I need 140 dollars.

387
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,620
It's too far. Try the closer one.

388
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,140
I want 140 dollars.

389
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,120
- I can win 140 dollars here.
- It offers more money.

390
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,240
The money is different.

391
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,690
I can get 140 dollars.

392
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,010
I've never seen Jae Suk play golf before.

393
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,360
I've seen it a lot.

394
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,730
He shakes a lot when he plays golf.

395
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,460
- He does?
- Look at him.

396
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,560
(His buck teeth stick out
as he's nervous.)

397
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,860
- My gosh.
- My gosh.

398
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,800
- Jae Suk is playing.
- My gosh.

399
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,140
Oh, no.

400
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,670
(He got too enthusiastic and hit a homer.)

401
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,910
That wasn't even close.

402
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,940
It was so close.

403
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,470
- It was a homer.
- You should hit it like this.

404
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,100
- Who'd putt like that?
- It was like...

405
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,180
He's like Gook Jin.

406
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,740
- "What?"
- I'll go with 140 dollars.

407
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,740
Gook Jin.

408
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,550
I want to see Jong Kook play.

409
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,940
He does look good.

410
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,550
I think I saw a man like him
at the Giheung Country Club.

411
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,820
(He's a bully golfer who cares
only about his driving distance.)

412
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,020
The Giheung Country Club.

413
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,520
- Right.
- At the Giheung Country Club.

414
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,660
- At the Giheung Country Club.
- Jong Kook,

415
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,760
you've still got the putting posture.

416
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,400
That's because...

417
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,690
- Coach Pak scolded him a lot.
- I had a good scolding back then.

418
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,460
- She criticized my posture.
- It was his weak point.

419
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,300
He wouldn't let someone else
scold him like that.

420
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,010
But you need to get a good scolding.

421
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,700
(Staring sharply)

422
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,470
- He learned it the hard way.
- He's right. You should be scolded.

423
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,510
He should.

424
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,810
You should be scolded
if you don't do it right.

425
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,200
That's how I've improved.

426
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,070
You hit it well. It's nice.

427
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,210
- Oh, dear.
- You pulled it a little.

428
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,520
I did? I do that every time.

429
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,660
He's got a good sense of distance.

430
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,790
- I do it every time.
- Don't pull it.

431
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,190
- But...
- I pulled it.

432
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,530
- he's got a good sense of distance.
- My gosh.

433
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,320
Haha, you should take a lesson.

434
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,190
You should get some advice
from the national hero.

435
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,320
- He's never done this before.
- You can't hold it like that.

436
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,990
Get some advice from the national hero?

437
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,300
Move over. What do you know?

438
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,330
He's holding it like this.

439
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,070
- Hey, back off.
- Ask her.

440
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,270
You've never tried this before?

441
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,940
You won't have a chance
to get a lesson like this.

442
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,730
- Hey.
- Se Ri is teaching you.

443
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,940
It's not something you can buy with money.

444
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,410
When you play golf...
No, hold it like this.

445
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,680
You should take a day off.

446
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,070
(The novice golfer is
encouraged to take a day off.)

447
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,650
- Why is he wearing gloves?
- This is a lot of work.

448
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,110
- Okay.
- Why are you wearing gloves?

449
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,690
You can imagine
that the triangle moves together.

450
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,080
It's like playing pool.

451
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,480
(What's the result of her lesson?)

452
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,620
My goodness.

453
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,900
(The ball bounces out of the hole cup.)

454
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,170
- You're good.
- That's right.

455
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,140
- It's like playing pool.
- You're a genius.

456
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,440
- How could you be so good?
- This is...

457
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,330
You can do this.

458
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,570
Of course he can.

459
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,730
- This is no big deal.
- But...

460
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,370
- you don't do as you're told.
- Is the practice over?

461
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,680
- Shall we try now?
- Let's try.

462
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,570
Golf is really fun.

463
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,920
Is it fun?

464
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,210
I should try level one.

465
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,480
- I should...
- Try the middle one.

466
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,150
- You get to try only once.
- It was too strong.

467
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,520
I should do this right.

468
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,660
(The members are proud
of their golf skills.)

469
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,080
Suk Jin, that's...

470
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,260
Look to the right.

471
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,320
(The gallery is quite loud.)

472
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,580
Suk Jin, look to the right.

473
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,450
Who would do that at a golf course?

474
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,900
- This is Running Man.
- This is Running Man.

475
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,960
(The gallery has no manners
on Running Man.)

476
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,090
- Can we distract him?
- Stay quiet.

477
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,640
- Don't do that.
- We can interrupt him.

478
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,690
You should look at Kang Chan Hee's feet.

479
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,070
- Kang Chan Hee's feet.
- Look to the right.

480
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,140
- You can do this.
- Kang Chan Hee's feet.

481
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,010
You can do this if you control the power.

482
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,540
You can do this...

483
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,550
- if you control the power.
- See?

484
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,180
- I pulled it.
- You did.

485
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,870
- See?
- I pulled it.

486
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,740
- You did.
- It wasn't even close.

487
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,020
I heard Se Chan was really good.

488
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,580
- Is he really that good?
- He says he's good.

489
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,650
- He's good.
- Is he?

490
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,890
- Se Chan is really good.
- That's what I heard.

491
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,390
- He's very good.
- He can't be that good.

492
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,350
Guys like him...

493
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,580
- are good at many little things.
- Right.

494
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,850
- You should move over.
- What?

495
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,930
Are you standing there on purpose?

496
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,900
They are just like bullies.

497
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,530
They are not supposed to be here.

498
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,900
It feels like I'm surrounded by a wall.

499
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,460
You should keep your distance.

500
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,690
This is where I was standing.

501
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,640
I should look at it from a distance.

502
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,540
- This is where I was standing.
- We don't have to back off.

503
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,680
You don't have to back off?

504
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,870
- This is an individual match.
- I was standing here before.

505
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,570
- You're unbelievable.
- All right.

506
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,420
- Look at him.
- Se Chan is serious.

507
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,110
You can hit it like that.

508
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,150
There are guys...

509
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,190
- who are serious about golf.
- I know.

510
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,740
You're being too serious.

511
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,190
Your girlfriend isn't here today.

512
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,390
- He doesn't care about her.
- He doesn't.

513
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,790
Are you trying to distract him now?

514
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,760
She's leaving the hospital today.
What are you doing here?

515
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,800
You look so happy.

516
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,120
You're the worst boyfriend.

517
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,770
Do you call yourself a human being?
It's not going in.

518
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,360
- You pulled it.
- It's not going in.

519
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,040
Look at that.

520
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,100
- It's not even.
- Right.

521
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,200
It's not even.

522
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,360
And you pulled it.

523
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,780
- It's not even, is it?
- It's not even.

524
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,230
Who's next?

525
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,680
- It's not even.
- Can I try?

526
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,240
- I'll go next.
- Jong Kook.

527
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,110
- It's not easy.
- You can still try level one.

528
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,840
We don't do that.

529
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,390
- My gosh.
- This is about our pride.

530
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,020
- We don't want 100 dollars.
- We have a bigger goal.

531
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,950
We're not petty.

532
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,890
- This is...
- Jong Kook should make it.

533
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,080
You should make it.

534
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,160
That was nice.

535
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,090
- Good.
- That was a nice one.

536
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,120
- Like this.
- Okay.

537
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,620
- Did I pull it?
- No. Just do it.

538
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,620
Like this.

539
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,200
Your girlfriend is now
under home quarantine.

540
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,070
Gosh, this is crazy.

541
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,510
"Ji Hyo, what are you doing?"

542
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,870
"I'm making hot pot bulgogi."

543
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,070
- He should do this for her.
- Exactly.

544
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,450
- Your girlfriend is in quarantine.
- He should make money.

545
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,480
He pulled it.

546
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,450
- Your girlfriend is in quarantine.
- "I'm making hot pot bulgogi."

547
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,670
(He fails.)

548
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,340
- Oh, no.
- He pulled it a lot.

549
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,790
- It's not even.
- Hey.

550
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,680
Why did you hit it like that?

551
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,560
Why would you do this
after hitting the ball?

552
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,290
- You should do it right.
- Gook Jin.

553
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,300
- All right.
- This is a lot.

554
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,320
(Revenge)

555
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,820
(He gave as good as he got.)

556
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,240
You can't use your knee like that.

557
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,900
I was trying to help you.

558
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,310
Did he give you a knee kick?

559
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,570
- You can't give a knee kick.
- Coach Pak.

560
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,600
I can overcome things like this.
Don't worry.

561
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,480
(2nd knee kick)

562
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,900
Go ahead and do it.
I was standing like this.

563
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,550
- Did you just kick me?
- No, I didn't.

564
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,840
- Go ahead and do it.
- Didn't you kick me?

565
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,580
I was standing like this.

566
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,880
This is how I was standing.

567
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,030
- That's a nice chair.
- Good.

568
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,380
- Check the ground.
- There's a chair.

569
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,460
- It's a nice chair.
- Did you check the ground?

570
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,500
It is nice.

571
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,200
- Around here. Good. I'm ready.
- Good.

572
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,530
He usually gets lucky
when it comes to things like this.

573
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,030
You're too close to the ball.

574
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,570
I think you should straighten
your back a little bit.

575
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,570
- Should I?
- Yes.

576
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,400
I'll do as you tell me, Coach Pak.

577
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,830
You can think of me as your avatar.

578
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,170
- He does look like Gook Jin.
- Don't worry, Coach Pak.

579
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,600
- "Hello?"
- I think he's pulling it.

580
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,710
- I won't let you down.
- I think he's pulling it.

581
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,670
- Swing it gently as you do now.
- Gently. Got it.

582
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,950
Also, this half-moon shape...

583
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,750
All right. Come on. Seriously.

584
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,250
I'm the half-moon!

585
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,550
- Really? Aren't you a thug?
- I'm the half-moon.

586
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,880
- He's a half thug.
- I see.

587
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Just do it already.

588
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,220
- He's a half thug.
- Good. It was perfect just now.

589
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,460
(He finally hits the ball
after chattering for a while.)

590
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,680
- Oh, no.
- He pulled it.

591
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,200
(How well did
the talkative Yoo Gook Jin putt?)

592
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,890
- Oh, no.
- He pulled it.

593
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,470
- Darn it.
- He failed.

594
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,360
- Oh, no.
- He pulled it.

595
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,810
(The ball went past the hole.)

596
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,860
(Darn it.)

597
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,470
Maybe you should've hit it
a little more to the right.

598
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,010
- Why would all of you...
- It wasn't even close.

599
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,980
- Why are you so disappointed?
- I knew I was pulling it a little.

600
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,100
- As I said, it wasn't even close.
- What a shame.

601
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,170
- I could've gotten 100 dollars.
- Putting is difficult.

602
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,750
- You all pulled it.
- Why did I do that? Gosh.

603
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,050
I'll place it here.

604
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,550
- Go ahead.
- Haha is...

605
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,720
- He might pull it off unexpectedly.
- He has a good chance.

606
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,180
Beginners who know nothing can be bold.

607
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,610
- That's true.
- That's why they can do better.

608
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,650
- He may surprise us.
- Right?

609
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,880
- Yes, it's true.
- Those who know a little act up...

610
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,030
- Is it really a golf outfit?
- Acting up?

611
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,090
You're too close to the ball.

612
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,970
Are you holding it
as I taught you earlier?

613
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,570
- You should adjust it right.
- You don't have a good memory.

614
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,740
Hit the right spot.

615
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,830
I have a really bad memory.

616
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,710
- Listen to Big Sister Se Ri.
- Right, you should listen to her.

617
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,770
You can straighten your knees more.

618
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,870
Can I call you "Big Sister?"

619
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,370
- Of course. She's older than you.
- Relax this arm.

620
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,750
- She wouldn't mind that.
- Lower your upper body.

621
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,780
The direction seems...

622
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,910
- Just go ahead.
- Trust yourself and go for it.

623
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,070
- Hit it as you are.
- Just hit it.

624
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,180
- Look at the ball.
- Hit it lightly.

625
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,290
- That's good.
- What?

626
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,960
(Has Se Ri's lesson helped him improve?)

627
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,460
It's going in.

628
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,420
(It almost fell into the hole.)

629
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,620
It's going in.

630
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,800
(Every cast member including Haha failed.)

631
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,850
- What a shame.
- It almost went into the hole.

632
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,120
- Exactly.
- Can't you give us another chance?

633
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,320
You can get another chance
only if Coach Pak pays ten dollars.

634
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,660
- Really?
- Just give us another chance.

635
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,510
- Ten dollars for one person?
- Only one person? Come on.

636
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,210
Make it two at least.

637
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,540
Then I should pay 50 dollars
to give everyone another chance.

638
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,370
- Right. You wouldn't pick just one.
- Exactly.

639
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,520
(She will try in front of her pupils
who are whining.)

640
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,020
- That's great.
- It's going in.

641
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,680
(How well could their teacher putt?)

642
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,120
- That's great.
- It's going in.

643
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,920
(A clean shot)

644
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,620
- That's great.
- It's going in.

645
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,090
(1 shot, 1 kill.)

646
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,330
- She's amazing.
- She's incredible.

647
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,860
- She's absolutely amazing.
- Indeed.

648
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,540
- She's on another level.
- That was amazing.

649
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,930
- Coach Pak...
- Here's 140 dollars.

650
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,640
- Give this to her, please.
- Help us out. You won 140 dollars.

651
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,140
- So we can try again.
- I really want another chance.

652
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,750
- Oh, I won it for putting.
- Correct.

653
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,340
- Please pay ten dollars for us.
- Except for Suk Jin.

654
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,380
- All of us except for Suk Jin.
- But I barely know you guys.

655
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,520
Well, you know...

656
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,680
- She has a point.
- I met you for the first time.

657
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,020
- She's good.
- We speak casually to each other.

658
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,380
- What's wrong with him?
- Coach Pak.

659
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,030
- Don't drop the honorifics.
- Except for Suk Jin.

660
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,590
- You don't have to help him out.
- I really like playing golf now.

661
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,620
- Give us ten dollars each, please.
- Please help us out.

662
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,920
How about we play rock-paper-scissors?

663
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,430
- I like the idea.
- What do you say?

664
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,930
That's a good idea. I'll help
the three of you this time.

665
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,300
- Three of us?
- Yes, only three of you.

666
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,570
- Three of us? Then...
- Then...

667
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,630
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Let's do that.

668
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,130
- Yes. That'd be fair.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

669
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,280
- Let's play palm face down or up.
- Okay.

670
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,900
- The majority wins.
- Right. Got it.

671
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,070
- You mean the three of us?
- Rock-paper-scissors is better.

672
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,340
(Se Chan sends a hand signal.)

673
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,450
The three whose palms are facing
the same side.

674
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,550
- Three of us.
- Okay.

675
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,520
- What if... Okay. Three winners.
- Let's begin.

676
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,150
- Palm face down or up
- Palm face down or up

677
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,580
(Seok Sam is out.)

678
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,650
Okay.

679
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,850
- Palm face down or up
- Palm face down or up

680
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,500
(What?)

681
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,390
- He's out. It's over.
- Right.

682
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,470
- You're 4, not 3.
- You're out.

683
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,590
- We agreed on three of us.
- You're out.

684
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,160
- You're out, Suk Jin.
- It's over for now.

685
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,000
- You're out, Suk Jin.
- The four of us should play again.

686
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,770
We should play the game
until we have three winners.

687
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,210
One got eliminated for now.

688
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,270
- No.
- One more will be eliminated.

689
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,100
- The three of you get a chance.
- Right.

690
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,430
- Let's...
- Did you see that, Coach Pak?

691
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,250
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors...
- They're ruthless.

692
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,310
Suk Jin, move aside.

693
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,840
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors...
- They're ruthless.

694
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,750
(The habitual swindler got caught
trying to scam him.)

695
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,140
- Hey.
- What happened?

696
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,580
- Hey.
- He just raised his arm...

697
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,910
- How dare you give them a signal?
- No, he didn't.

698
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,820
He didn't give us a signal.
He was just doing a stretch.

699
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,460
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Hey, did you give them a signal?

700
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,060
- Did you do that earlier too?
- No, I didn't.

701
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,420
All right. Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

702
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,960
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

703
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,300
- Okay.
- Two won, and two lost.

704
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,160
- We won.
- We should play it again.

705
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
- The two of us won.
- Let's play...

706
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:23,770
Ready.

707
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,360
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

708
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,470
- Okay.
- Done.

709
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,600
(Haha won.)

710
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,310
- Okay.
- Done.

711
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,430
- You got what you deserved.
- The two oldest members are out.

712
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,570
- Okay.
- Gosh.

713
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,480
- The oldest two are out.
- Coach Pak.

714
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,640
- Let's do this.
- Here's 30 dollars.

715
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,980
- Okay. Good.
- For the three of them.

716
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,170
- Coach Pak, spend ten more dollars.
- I'll pull it off this time.

717
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,450
- No matter what. That won't happen.
- Just ten more dollars, please.

718
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,260
- Mister, step out of the mat.
- No way.

719
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,180
- I'll try to win 100 dollars.
- Jong Kook.

720
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,230
- That'd be good enough.
- Winning the money will be helpful.

721
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,290
I'll place the ball
closer to the hole too.

722
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,150
But it's not easy to hit it
from here either.

723
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,200
Come on. It's cowardly of you.

724
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,590
- Gosh.
- He should win some money.

725
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,860
Fine. I'll place it here.

726
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,890
Let's do this.

727
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,000
- You should put it in the hole.
- Choose an easier spot.

728
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,040
- I'll do the same.
- But...

729
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,860
- It's okay. He can do this.
- I'll give it a try.

730
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
It's not that hard.

731
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,870
Gosh. Just hit it already. Seriously.

732
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,330
(Gosh. Just hit it already. Seriously.)

733
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,250
- This is not being broadcast live.
- You see,

734
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:14,080
Jong Kook loses his confidence
when playing golf.

735
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,180
- That's so true.
- I see.

736
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,320
- I mean...
- He gets so timid.

737
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
- Right? He gets timid...
- I have little knowledge of this.

738
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,520
and always hits balls too lightly.

739
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,120
- Your stance is good.
- Indeed.

740
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,200
- Try to be a little bold, will you?
- You know...

741
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,960
It's not easy to control it.

742
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,090
It's normal to get timid.

743
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,500
- His stance is not bad.
- Try to be a little bold, will you?

744
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,330
I really don't want to play golf with him.

745
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,390
- Nice. He did it.
- I really don't want to...

746
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,970
Nice. He did it.

747
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,310
- No. He hit it too hard.
- He did it.

748
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,900
- No. He hit it too hard.
- It curved a little at the end.

749
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,330
- Why did you make the same mistake?
- You hit it the wrong way.

750
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,840
- Didn't it curve a little?
- I'll try the 100 dollar distance.

751
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,170
I'll try the 100 dollar distance.

752
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,170
You won't pull it off anyway.

753
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,610
Go ahead. Putting it in the hole is
what matters.

754
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,640
He'll be so embarrassed
if he fails to put it in the hole.

755
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,490
It's not easy to do it from this distance.

756
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,790
- Stop it. We agreed on the rule.
- Just one, please.

757
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,490
- Put it back in.
- You don't have to give it to me.

758
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,960
- It's my money.
- I know, but...

759
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,350
- I can spend it as I want.
- It's going in.

760
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,350
(Yoo Gook Jin convinced her
to give him 10 dollars.)

761
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,390
(Meanwhile, Se Chan hit the ball.)

762
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,470
- It's going in.
- But...

763
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,620
It's going in.

764
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,500
- Yes! I won 100 dollars!
- He pulled it off.

765
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,630
It's going in.

766
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,900
(He pulled it off perfectly.)

767
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,630
(Yes! I won 100 dollars!)

768
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,010
Se Chan, we'll give you 100 dollars.

769
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,070
Yes!

770
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,370
- I'll pay ten dollars. Thank you.
- Okay.

771
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,050
Can I give my money to another member too?

772
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,250
Yes, you can.

773
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,840
Hey, I can give away my money too.

774
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,450
- Really?
- I can give you...

775
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,380
- When you hit it...
- Hey, repay me 100 dollars.

776
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,410
Pardon me?

777
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,760
- Repay her the money now.
- Coach Pak, please.

778
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,020
Why should I give you the money back?

779
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,620
- You owe me.
- Of course you should repay her.

780
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,620
That's ridiculous.

781
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,760
Repay her the money now.

782
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,150
- I lent you the money.
- Exactly.

783
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,920
- Se Chan, don't repay her.
- Just give her the money now.

784
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,420
- Pardon?
- Invest the money in me.

785
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,590
- Give me back the money.
- Repay her now.

786
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,240
- Hold on a second.
- I'll give you back if I succeed.

787
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,390
Pay me the money back
and invest the rest in him...

788
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,930
- or anyone else.
- I can't believe...

789
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,160
the national heroine is demanding
to repay only ten dollars.

790
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,540
- Come on. It's hard to earn money.
- Okay. Here you go.

791
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,980
- Give her the money.
- You don't have to give it to him.

792
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,950
- Okay. I'll invest in you.
- Thank you.

793
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,910
Everyone has another chance now.

794
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,480
- It's fair now, right?
- Okay.

795
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,640
- Here. Try again.
- Sorry?

796
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,990
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

797
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,990
(Jong Kook succeeded in getting
an investment.)

798
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,380
- It's fair now, right?
- Okay.

799
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,410
(Haha challenges to win 100 dollars.)

800
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,880
- Oh, no.
- You hit it too hard.

801
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,490
- He's done.
- All right.

802
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,650
- I didn't know it was this hard.
- I should've coached him.

803
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,060
- It's too difficult.
- I gave Jong Kook ten dollars.

804
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,090
- Okay.
- Se Chan.

805
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,300
- It's Yoo Gook Jin's turn.
- It's so difficult.

806
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,470
It's okay. If he pulls it off...

807
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,270
It'd be more rewarding
if we could win 200 dollars.

808
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,890
- Hit it lightly. Gosh.
- He hit it too hard.

809
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,310
- Come on.
- He hit it too hard.

810
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,330
(Jae Suk failed again.)

811
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,740
- Come on.
- He hit it too hard.

812
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,600
(Yoo Gook Jin messed up the chance
he got by begging.)

813
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,100
- I told you to hit it lightly.
- That's too bad.

814
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,070
I'll give you 50 dollars.

815
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,050
- It almost went into the hole.
- I know.

816
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,520
You hit it too hard.

817
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,610
I didn't know golf was so fun.

818
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,750
My gosh. They must be out of their minds.

819
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,680
- This is not an official game.
- Come on.

820
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,020
I'll give you 30 dollars.

821
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,680
- Give me 40 dollars.
- Deal.

822
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,760
- I have no money left now.
- Okay.

823
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,880
Aim to win 100 dollars.

824
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,500
They're all going crazy
for a game for the opening.

825
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
Further to the back.

826
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,500
(Another golf addict tries again.)

827
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,630
Look to your left, Suk Jin.

828
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,700
That's good.

829
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,770
- Okay! Yes!
- He pulled it off.

830
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,480
- Okay.
- Good job.

831
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,170
- Move.
- Nice.

832
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,340
- Take your ball out of the hole.
- Place it closer to the hole.

833
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,510
- I'll place it here no matter what.
- Come on.

834
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,910
- Where did he get the money?
- So I can give you 40 dollars.

835
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,550
- Place it closer to the hole.
- I borrowed ten dollars from him.

836
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,640
Place it closer to the hole.

837
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,790
- So I can give you 40 dollars.
- He's acting like a thug.

838
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,460
- I want to have 100 dollars left.
- I want to borrow money too.

839
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,820
Don't forget you promised me
that you'd pay me.

840
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,320
- Hit it less hard than earlier.
- The direction was perfect.

841
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,820
- He got two more chances... Oh, no.
- Gosh.

842
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,230
- Why would you keep pulling it?
- That wasn't even close.

843
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,530
- He hit it too hard.
- Gosh.

844
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,390
- Why would you keep pulling it?
- That wasn't even close.

845
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,770
- He pulled it.
- That wasn't even close.

846
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,660
Coach Pak is starting to get annoyed.

847
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,330
- How many times did you hit?
- Of course she gets annoyed.

848
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,630
- A hundred dollars?
- She got upset.

849
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,980
I'll aim to win 120 dollars this time.

850
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,310
I think I can do this.

851
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,170
I just have to hit it slightly to...

852
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,170
Just hit it already.

853
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,870
You took more time, Jae Suk.

854
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:33,990
I'll just hit it.

855
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,340
- Look to your right.
- I'll hit it now.

856
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,410
Slightly to the right.

857
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,560
(Jae Suk got scolded by the teacher
and took it out on Jong Kook.)

858
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,760
- To the right?
- This is your last chance.

859
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,230
Who are you to make that decision?

860
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,260
We can't play this game all day long.

861
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,200
- That's true.
- We haven't even begun the race.

862
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,240
- This won't improve our ratings...
- Gosh, seriously.

863
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,360
(Angry)

864
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,310
Does he always sabotage others
when playing golf?

865
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,570
- He's driving me crazy.
- But...

866
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,250
- It's actually not allowed.
- People would start fighting.

867
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,600
But people do that
when playing golf with friends.

868
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,280
Slightly to the right?
I should look that way.

869
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,450
Okay. I'll do that.

870
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,480
- Lightly.
- That's good.

871
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,520
- Did I hit it too hard?
- You did it!

872
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,250
- Great job.
- Jong Kook!

873
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,490
- That's good.
- Did I hit it too hard?

874
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,460
- You did it, Jong Kook!
- Great job.

875
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,650
(Jong Kook pulled it off too.)

876
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,730
Okay.

877
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,730
- As a result of the game,
- He must've spent all his money.

878
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,800
- some of you won money.
- Yes.

879
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,420
The money you won will be useful.

880
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,540
- Coach Pak can give you her money.
- Got it.

881
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,900
Let's go to the first location now.

882
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,430
- Okay.
- Let's go.

883
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,100
What are we going to do here?

884
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,050
What will we do? Those computers
make me anxious.

885
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,880
- I'm not good with computers.
- It's okay.

886
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,610
I'm really bad with computers.

887
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,150
- I'm not good with computers.
- I can't even turn it on.

888
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,460
Me too. What am I supposed to do?

889
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,850
- I guess we'll be doing a search.
- I guess so.

890
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:49,920
I just...

891
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,060
(Suk Jin sits next to Se Ri.)

892
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,500
Are your visions cloudy? Is that the case?

893
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,730
- I've aged. That's all.
- I saw you...

894
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,770
- Oh, I see.
- I've aged.

895
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,770
Why?

896
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,130
I don't think he's good with computers.

897
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,160
I'll sit here, so I can ask you
some questions.

898
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,360
- He kept looking at it.
- I'll ask you what I don't know.

899
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,430
(She sat next to the younger member.)

900
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,870
- I'm younger than him, right?
- Sorry?

901
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,780
Yes. And it'd be more comfortable
to ask you questions.

902
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,100
- I don't think he knows much.
- I'm younger than Suk Jin.

903
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,070
I know what I need to know.

904
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,950
We'll probably search for golf courses.

905
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,750
- As I said, you will play 18 holes.
- Yes.

906
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,820
The 1st mission you'll complete
before the 1st to 3rd holes is...

907
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,080
Search Engine King of the Field.

908
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,680
- Oh, I get it.
- I knew it.

909
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,730
- Right.
- Okay. Let's do this.

910
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,260
We'll show you a photo,

911
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,360
- and you'll have 20 minutes...
- Yes.

912
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,160
to figure out...

913
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,510
the name of the person in the photo
based on the characteristics...

914
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,210
or anything you can see in the photo.

915
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,210
- What?
- I see.

916
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,400
- Someone we don't know?
- Correct.

917
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,710
- Then how do we get information?
- You can find him or her easily.

918
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,370
- Let's give it a try.
- We can find the person easily?

919
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,870
- It could be a golfer.
- All right.

920
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,480
- I don't know many golfers.
- If you can't figure it out...

921
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,910
based on the first photo,

922
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:52,080
you can move on to the next level,
which is up to Coach Pak.

923
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,530
It'll be easier to find the person.

924
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,920
- I guess we'll have to pay money.
- I see.

925
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,080
However, you'll get less money...

926
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,650
- whenever you see another photo.
- Okay.

927
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,620
Therefore, you'd better get it done
with the least number of photos.

928
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,090
We'll have to be quick, but we can
do it within the given time.

929
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,930
Correct. And you can say
the six of you are on the same team.

930
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,710
- Really?
- Are we going to do it as a team?

931
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,070
- Okay.
- We should work together.

932
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,170
- Of course.
- Let's work together.

933
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,830
- Let's share information.
- Let's do that.

934
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,010
- That'll make it much easier.
- We can share information.

935
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,640
There are four levels for each question.

936
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,070
If you think that the first photo is
too difficult for you,

937
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,250
ask us to show you the next one.

938
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,680
- That's how it's done.
- Show us. It won't be difficult.

939
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,790
Here's the first-level photo.

940
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,080
- Show us.
- We'll work together.

941
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,150
(The 1st level photo)

942
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,530
- Show us.
- We'll work together.

943
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,820
- Hey, I know who that is.
- I know who he is.

944
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,850
I know who he is.

945
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,090
Is he French?

946
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,090
- Isn't he an actor?
- No.

947
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,090
No, he's not. He's...

948
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,890
- He's not an actor.
- I've seen him somewhere.

949
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,930
- Wait. He may be an actor...
- I think he's an actor.

950
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,160
- Is he a politician?
- No.

951
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,660
- He's not an actor.
- Isn't he the governor of a state?

952
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,710
- Right. I think so too.
- He's a politician.

953
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,670
- It's a scene from a movie.
- He's the governor of a state...

954
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,010
- No, I don't think so.
- You may begin.

955
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,010
- This is all we have?
- Yes.

956
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,720
- This photo is all we have?
- Hang on. I think...

957
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,610
- Hold on.
- I think I saw him...

958
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,790
- He's not the governor of France.
- What do you think?

959
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,610
Maybe New York...
"The governor of France?"

960
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:02,620
(Se Chan thinks the US national flag
is the French national flag.)

961
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,320
What makes you think he's French?

962
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,620
- The governor of New York...
- Hold on.

963
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,500
(Meanwhile, Coach Pak...)

964
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,700
(was typing English
only with her index fingers.)

965
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,890
What makes you think he's French?

966
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,830
(What? Why do I see
English letters on the screen?)

967
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,310
Why can't I delete this?

968
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,310
- New York...
- Why?

969
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,070
- Pardon?
- Why can't I delete this?

970
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,210
You can delete it with this key.

971
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,480
- Oh, I was mistaken.
- Convert the language like this.

972
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,520
This one?

973
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,570
- Wait.
- I think...

974
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,380
(Se Ri's doppelganger types
with only 2 fingers as well.)

975
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,410
Why am I typing English letters?

976
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,290
(He also typed English letters
just as Se Ri did.)

977
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,620
(He deletes everything
and types English letters again.)

978
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,200
Gosh. How should I change it
to Korean? Wait.

979
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,270
- He can't...
- Oh, okay.

980
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,500
(While the 2 doppelgangers are
struggling with typing...)

981
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,200
Wait. The badge on his jacket...
That's the US national flag, right?

982
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,270
- If you search...
- Things like that badge...

983
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,570
must be hints.

984
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,170
(Actor from "Don't Look Up")

985
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,210
(The American series lover searches
for an American actor for now.)

986
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,370
- You know... Something...
- Hold on. Can you see...

987
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,370
(The cast of "Don't Look Up")

988
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,480
I've seen him many times before.

989
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,980
- Suk Jin.
- I'm sure he's a politician.

990
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,990
- He must be a politician...
- That badge looks like...

991
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,990
(What?)

992
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,290
Isn't it a badge of a political party?

993
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,650
(Can I say the answer now?)

994
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,060
- Can I say the answer now?
- Yes, you can.

995
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,820
Isn't he Mark Rylance?

996
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,820
(Mark Rylance)

997
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,890
Mark Rylance.

998
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:16,000
- Incorrect.
- What a shame.

999
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,390
I'm pretty sure he's a politician.
Isn't that the American flag?

1000
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,470
- Chuck Schumer?
- Incorrect.

1001
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,660
Who is Chuck Schumer?

1002
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,740
I'll type in "US senators."

1003
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,710
Se Ri, you can tell us to show you
the next photo anytime.

1004
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,450
- We've got this.
- We don't need that.

1005
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,840
Don't show us that yet. Wait.

1006
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,340
How... I can't see the details
of the badge.

1007
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,680
- In what year was this taken?
- Can you bring it to us?

1008
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,350
- It's the American flag, right?
- Yes.

1009
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,420
- The badge?
- Didn't I already tell you before?

1010
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,790
- Take a look at it.
- We already talked about it.

1011
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,150
- Show me. Let me have a close look.
- He's definitely a politician.

1012
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,820
- I've seen him somewhere.
- Show me.

1013
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,160
I'll take a look first.
Let's take turns, okay?

1014
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,630
Oh, looking at it closely,
I see that he's not the actor.

1015
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,000
- Hey.
- I've never seen him before.

1016
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,090
- Hey, you guys...
- There's a badge on his jacket.

1017
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,540
- Bring it to me.
- It's the American flag.

1018
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,930
- Let us have a look.
- It's not fair.

1019
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,540
- Let me take a look first.
- Just give us a minute.

1020
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,310
- Don't you think it's unfair?
- What is this?

1021
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,980
I was the one who brought it here.

1022
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,340
And he said, "Let me take a look first."

1023
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,720
- Okay.
- He's a married man.

1024
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,910
- I see a wedding ring.
- First of all,

1025
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,180
- you see the flag, right?
- I've never seen him before.

1026
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,790
- You mean the badge?
- Let's search for the badge first.

1027
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,350
- Right. Let's do that.
- The badge with the flag on it.

1028
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,060
- It's called a badge, right?
- Wait. Hey.

1029
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,590
You can get a badge with the flag
on it for 58 dollars online.

1030
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,800
Can you order one for me?

1031
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Will you buy one?

1032
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,830
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Hey, how do you spell "badge?"

1033
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,660
- Is it V or B?
- It's B.

1034
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,660
It's B.

1035
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,100
I see a lot of people wearing badges.

1036
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,710
- Right? Check out each of them.
- There are so many of them.

1037
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,480
- I just have to find his face.
- I see a lot of photos.

1038
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
Great. Let's take a look.

1039
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,070
I must say, you guys are
unbelievably stupid.

1040
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,720
- Let's see who finds him first.
- You have no idea...

1041
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,490
They don't even know what to search for.

1042
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,640
Can't we ask for a hint?

1043
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,910
- They all look the same now.
- I know, right?

1044
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,680
Let's see the second-level photo.
We can't find him with this photo.

1045
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,680
We're running out of time.
We must find him in 20 minutes.

1046
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,500
- Is that so?
- I agree.

1047
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,820
If Se Ri approves, we'll show you.

1048
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,530
- We need more hints, Se Ri.
- Let's go for it, Se Ri.

1049
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,090
- Se Ri.
- Time is of the essence.

1050
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,300
- Se Ri.
- Yes?

1051
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,700
How much money will be deducted?

1052
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,890
Hundred dollars.

1053
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,830
- From 300 dollars?
- Yes.

1054
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,330
- That's too much.
- A presidential candidate.

1055
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,070
- Okay. We'll spend 100 dollars.
- All right.

1056
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,050
Here's the second photo.

1057
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,450
(The 2nd level photo)

1058
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,250
- What?
- He's standing next to Joe Biden.

1059
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,260
I know! He's the vice president of the US.

1060
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,620
- Is he?
- The vice president of the US.

1061
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,920
(The empty heads still have no clue.)

1062
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,090
- Oh, right. It's Kamala Harris.
- Jae Suk.

1063
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:28,470
- I was wrong.
- He gets confused all the time.

1064
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,500
He's right next to Joe Biden.
Then I should type in his name.

1065
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,630
I already typed in his name.

1066
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,310
(He typed in "Joe Biden's photo.")

1067
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,710
I typed in his name a while ago.

1068
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,600
What should I type in?
"Joe Biden's best friend?"

1069
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
- Come on. Tell me.
- I'll type that in.

1070
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,640
No, that's not what you should type in.

1071
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,210
We just have to look for that photo.
They're clearly at an event.

1072
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,570
If you look at the photo...

1073
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,550
- That's an election campaign.
- Biden's presidential campaign.

1074
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,820
- Exactly.
- I don't think so.

1075
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,720
We should find the man next to Joe Biden.

1076
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,260
The vice president of the US is
Kamala Harris.

1077
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,460
- Let's see...
- Why is he...

1078
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,030
alone in most of his photos?

1079
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,700
(That's because you typed in
"Joe Biden's photo.")

1080
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,030
There might be a hint
on the area where it was taken.

1081
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,000
My gosh. This is difficult.

1082
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,700
Show me.

1083
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,930
(Show me.)

1084
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,970
Show me. Let me take a look first.
Give me that.

1085
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,010
Show me. I'll have a look first.

1086
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,570
- Why should you be the first one?
- Come on. Show me.

1087
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,570
- Why...
- Bring it to me.

1088
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,900
They were at a high school.

1089
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,840
- A high school?
- It says...

1090
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,780
- Did they go to the same school?
- "High school."

1091
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,910
If they were at a high school...

1092
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:25,350
(Joe Biden's college alumni)

1093
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,550
(Images)

1094
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,680
I think it says, "Charter High School."

1095
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,260
- It's "charter."
- Yes.

1096
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,220
I see the word "college"
written here too.

1097
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,990
I guess... I'll explain to you.
Look at this photo.

1098
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,300
Look. What do you think it is?
He's running for president.

1099
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,390
- This man went there to help him.
- To support Biden?

1100
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,930
- Yes, I think that's the case.
- Right. This tie...

1101
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,530
(Joe Biden's suit)

1102
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,410
(Joe Biden's sunglasses,
Joe Biden's inauguration ceremony)

1103
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:47,800
(Joe Biden's presidential campaign)

1104
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,100
(Haha typed in just as he heard.)

1105
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,910
- "Biden's presidential campaign"...
- Let's type that in.

1106
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,910
"Support for Biden's
presidential campaign."

1107
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,080
(Support for Biden's
presidential campaign)

1108
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,180
I typed in "Joe Biden's
inauguration ceremony."

1109
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,780
I'll find this man.
I found him shortly.

1110
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,200
Gosh, this is so frustrating.
I really want to find out who he is.

1111
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,700
He said, "I found him shortly."

1112
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,700
- "Biden's man."
- Yes. Good.

1113
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,470
- "Biden's man."
- No. "Biden's..."

1114
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,930
- Gosh.
- "Biden's..."

1115
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,240
Who on earth is this man?

1116
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,680
Who on earth is he?

1117
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,180
- No, he looks younger than that.
- Since we...

1118
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,680
Let's see the third photo.
How much time do we have left?

1119
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,120
- You have 4 minutes left.
- Let's win 200 dollars at least.

1120
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,640
- He's right. Let's do that.
- Okay.

1121
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,890
- Show us.
- Here's the third-level photo.

1122
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,080
I don't see it yet.

1123
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,280
(The 3rd level photo)

1124
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,120
It says...

1125
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,580
Can you read
the letters above his name?

1126
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,950
- All right.
- Let me have a closer look.

1127
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,200
I can see "30330."
I'll type in that number.

1128
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
(It's written "Text CA to 30330."
It seems to be a big hint.)

1129
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
- Type this phrase.
- "Text CA to..."

1130
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,890
- What did you say?
- "Text to CA to..."

1131
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,100
- Does it stand for Texas?
- Yes.

1132
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,240
He must be the governor of Texas.

1133
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,200
- Wait.
- I found him.

1134
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,700
- The governor of Texas?
- It's him.

1135
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,850
(I found him. It's him.)

1136
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,010
("The governor of Texas Lifts
the Mask Mandate")

1137
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,180
(They look completely different
from each other.)

1138
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
- The governor of Texas?
- It's him.

1139
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,410
- That's not him.
- Really?

1140
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,990
- You didn't have to yell at me.
- I'm sorry about that.

1141
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,450
You're the only one
I can yell at now.

1142
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,660
- "Texas..."
- Do you want to...

1143
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,490
- What did you find?
- Is he Beto O'Rourke?

1144
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,600
- Incorrect.
- No, he's not Beto O'Rourke.

1145
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,490
- I can't believe Jae Suk.
- Don't just say any random names.

1146
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,370
What are you searching for?
Why don't you look at the photo?

1147
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,260
- Me?
- Regarding the election.

1148
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,160
- I found him!
- Okay.

1149
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,370
(I found him!)

1150
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,080
I... This is... I found his photo.

1151
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,180
- You found him.
- This is him.

1152
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,700
- I found his photo. This is him.
- You found him.

1153
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,950
(Haha found
the same person's photo.)

1154
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,680
- I found his photo. This is him.
- You found him.

1155
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,680
- Nevada Caucus.
- Nevada Caucus.

1156
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,450
(Before the Nevada Caucus)

1157
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,180
(Nevada Caucus!)

1158
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,450
- Incorrect.
- No, wait.

1159
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,780
(They started reading
all the words they could see.)

1160
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,450
- No, wait. Bloomberg.
- Bloomberg.

1161
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,450
(Biden, Bloomberg)

1162
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,760
Incorrect.

1163
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,700
- Hey, what did you find?
- What did you...

1164
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,530
- Haha found his photo.
- Sanders.

1165
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,890
- Incorrect.
- Chasing Fiercely.

1166
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,260
I'm looking at him.
He's in this photo.

1167
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,260
- Newspim?
- Incorrect.

1168
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,260
"Chasing Fiercely?"

1169
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,930
- What's that? Hey.
- We're almost there. This is it.

1170
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,470
As I said, I found his photo.

1171
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,870
- Come and have a look.
- Show me.

1172
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,680
- Haha found this photo.
- That's him.

1173
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,120
- But we can't figure out his name.
- Is it?

1174
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,780
- Haha found his photo.
- Is it really him?

1175
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,780
- Let me take a look.
- But...

1176
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,490
- Isn't his name written there?
- There are six foreigners in it.

1177
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,490
- What is his name?
- Gosh, this is frustrating.

1178
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,950
Isn't it so funny?
Haha found the photo,

1179
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,600
but he can't figure out his name.

1180
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,970
Gosh. This is driving me nuts.

1181
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,120
You have 30 seconds left.

1182
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,300
You said you'd found a photo.
What are they doing in the photo?

1183
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,740
They're smiling.

1184
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,410
- That's not what I meant.
- They're smiling happily.

1185
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,680
- A good thing must have happened.
- Why did they gather?

1186
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,100
The article must explain
about the occasion.

1187
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,180
Time's up.

1188
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,950
- What? Hey.
- Time's up.

1189
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,100
Who is he?

1190
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,580
- I'll show you the fourth photo.
- We didn't see the last one.

1191
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,140
- And I'll tell you his name.
- Okay.

1192
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,910
This is the last photo.

1193
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,780
- "Safer L.A.?"
- L.A.?

1194
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,490
Is he the governor of Los Angeles?

1195
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,160
- "Safer L.A.?"
- L.A.?

1196
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
(Is he the governor of Los Angeles?)

1197
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,100
He's Eric Garcetti,
the current mayor of Los Angeles.

1198
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,430
- Gosh.
- The mayor of Los Angeles?

1199
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,100
I searched for the mayors of Manhattan...

1200
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,200
and New York City.
Why didn't I think of Los Angeles?

1201
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,430
- He's the mayor of Los Angeles?
- Is there a mayor in Los Angeles?

1202
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,800
He's the mayor of Los Angeles.

1203
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,200
- Oh, I found an article about him.
- Gosh, seriously.

1204
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,740
He's the mayor of Los Angeles.

1205
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,680
- Wasn't he in the group photo?
- I'll pull it off this time.

1206
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,910
- Let's move on.
- Gosh.

1207
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,600
- This person is also very famous.
- I see.

1208
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,720
- Here's your next question.
- Let's take a look.

1209
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,180
(The 1st level photo)

1210
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,680
I know who he is. He's an actor.

1211
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,680
(I know who he is. He's an actor.)

1212
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,550
- He must be... Hold on.
- He's an actor.

1213
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,550
- Hold on.
- Could he be someone...

1214
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,550
with extraordinary powers?

1215
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,100
- He's quite fit.
- Wasn't he in "Iron Man?"

1216
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,490
- The glass is shattered.
- The wine glass is shattered.

1217
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,970
Someone who shattered a wine glass.

1218
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:30,970
Shattered wine glass.

1219
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,870
A photo like that isn't enough to...

1220
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,240
(Someone who shattered a wine glass.)

1221
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,010
This is annoying.
How can I search for this man?

1222
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,580
- I hate things like this.
- What should be the keyword?

1223
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,910
I looked up a shattered wine glass...

1224
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,180
and got "Is wine glass recyclable?"

1225
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,410
- That's what I got as well.
- Right?

1226
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,640
Isn't he Michael Rooker?

1227
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,370
Isn't he Michael Rooker?

1228
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,550
(Answer: Michael Rooker)

1229
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,680
- I'd be amazed if that's right.
- Is he right?

1230
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,720
You are correct.

1231
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,850
How did you find him?

1232
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,530
(He got it from the level 1 photo.)

1233
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,550
He was in "The Walking Dead."

1234
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,390
- He also played Yondu.
- Okay!

1235
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,490
What did you type in?

1236
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,870
- Yondu?
- What did you type in?

1237
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,530
- Actor from "The Walking Dead."
- You knew he was an actor.

1238
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,600
We'll move on to the third round.

1239
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
Who on earth is he?

1240
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,010
- Hold on.
- Does he have hives?

1241
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,470
He has only half a beard.

1242
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,080
- A beard.
- Do you know who he is?

1243
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,240
A man with half a beard.

1244
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,600
- Does he play soccer?
- That's not him.

1245
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,640
- That's a beard.
- Found him!

1246
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,140
- He's a high jumper.
- You're right.

1247
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,140
- You got him.
- Really?

1248
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,180
Then say his name!

1249
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,740
Italian high jumper Tamberi.

1250
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,080
Super handsome... Sorry about that.

1251
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,160
- Gianmarco Tamberi.
- That is correct.

1252
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,180
- Nice.
- What a relief.

1253
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,930
- Unbelievable.
- And like that,

1254
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,550
you earned 600 dollars
over the course of three holes.

1255
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,550
- Really?
- Is that it?

1256
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,300
- That was fun.
- We earned 600 dollars?

1257
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,300
- Yes, 600 dollars.
- Another round would've been nice.

1258
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,330
Head Coach Pak will distribute the money.

1259
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,700
I'd appreciate it
if you considered our contribution.

1260
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,370
- Coach Pak.
- Coach Pak, here you go.

1261
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,850
- A total of 600 dollars?
- Thank you.

1262
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,550
Coach Pak?

1263
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,140
There are exactly six of us.
What a coincidence.

1264
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,550
A few complained during the entire game.

1265
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,640
- This is for your hard work.
- Absolutely.

1266
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,780
Is that 50 dollars? Thank you.

1267
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,760
And...

1268
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,580
Thank you.

1269
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,990
Jong Kook, you also get 50 dollars.

1270
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,760
- You found one of the people.
- Thank you.

1271
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,030
I also looked someone up.

1272
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,390
- Coach Pak?
- I almost found the right person.

1273
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:10,570
(They keep eyeing the coach's move.)

1274
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:13,100
I did nothing to deserve the money, but...

1275
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,470
(She pockets the money.)

1276
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,930
- Coach Pak, what are you doing?
- What?

1277
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,910
- Only those on "Se Ri Money Club."
- I found L.A., you know.

1278
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,430
- It just happened that way.
- We should be grateful.

1279
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,850
You only gave money
to those on "Se Ri Money Club."

1280
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,740
- Coach Pak.
- But I looked up the last person.

1281
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,680
- We contributed the most.
- But Se Chan was faster.

1282
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,220
- But Coach Pak...
- Okay, fine.

1283
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,620
- Me too.
- I should receive some of it.

1284
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,580
- Gosh.
- But Suk Jin...

1285
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,950
- Right?
- I tried my best.

1286
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:34,050
- About ten dollars should do.
- Yes, that should do.

1287
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,620
- That sounds like enough.
- How about 30 dollars?

1288
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,950
- Is this 20 dollars?
- How generous of her.

1289
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,430
I shouldn't be giving out
free money like this.

1290
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,830
- Can't I get 30 dollars?
- You should pocket the rest.

1291
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,430
- Please pocket the rest.
- It's not like I can cut the note.

1292
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,570
Don't you have 5,000 won bills?

1293
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,930
(Don't you have 5,000 won bills?)

1294
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,640
That's too generous of her.

1295
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,410
Do you promise to try harder?

1296
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,800
- Se Ri, wait.
- You didn't have to.

1297
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,530
- Coach Pak, this isn't necessary.
- Cut the note in half.

1298
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,030
He didn't do anything
to deserve the money.

1299
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,200
There won't be a next time.

1300
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,910
Why not?
The money's supposed to be distributed.

1301
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,550
- That's nonsense.
- That's enough, Suk Jin.

1302
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,010
- But...
- I'm not a bank, you know.

1303
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,350
- That's enough.
- But...

1304
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,640
- Give it back then.
- You're going to make him cry.

1305
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,180
- I'll take it back.
- No way.

1306
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,320
Thank you.

1307
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,120
The money is supposed
to be distributed, you know.

1308
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,580
- Don't complain.
- So why...

1309
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,120
Who are you to keep it all?

1310
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,930
What on earth is happening?

1311
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,300
(Seok Sam's speaking in a peculiar way.)

1312
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,990
- It's upsetting, you know.
- What are you saying?

1313
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,220
What's with that tone?

1314
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,490
We have up to 18 holes to play.

1315
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:22,470
From hole number 4 to hole number 6,

1316
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,200
your teamwork will be tested.

1317
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,800
The game is Team Play Good Shot.

1318
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,850
What's that?

1319
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:28,870
You will go around...

1320
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:32,620
naming the right word
that fits into the category.

1321
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,890
We will decide upon
the number of answers required.

1322
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,620
- Okay.
- From one corner to the next,

1323
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,050
let's say you're supposed
to name ten words.

1324
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,680
You can answer more than once
if you know more answers.

1325
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,930
You must all name at least one though.

1326
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,530
You will win 100 dollars
every time you succeed.

1327
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,600
But Coach Pak must pay ten dollars...

1328
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,490
- each time you answer incorrectly.
- Okay.

1329
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,830
- Name three if you know more.
- Okay.

1330
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,640
So she loses ten dollars...

1331
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,180
- every time we answer incorrectly?
- Yes.

1332
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,580
That doesn't sound easy.

1333
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,080
- All right.
- We'll start with Jong Kook.

1334
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,100
- Sure.
- Go ahead.

1335
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,680
You must name ten...

1336
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,740
and Haha must name at least one.

1337
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,850
- Okay.
- Got it.

1338
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,510
- Haha needs to answer.
- We must hand it over to you.

1339
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,850
I must at least say the ninth word.

1340
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:10,910
- The ninth.
- No pressure, guys.

1341
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,660
- Say as much as you can.
- Here's the first round.

1342
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,080
What is it?
We're not feeling the pressure.

1343
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,330
- What is it?
- What's the category?

1344
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,390
- Bring it on.
- What is it?

1345
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,760
- Come on!
- We can do this.

1346
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,260
- We can do this.
- We can answer ten for sure.

1347
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,830
- You underestimate us.
- Bring it on.

1348
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,160
- Capital cities in Europe.
- What?

1349
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,300
Rome.

1350
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,660
Say a few more.

1351
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,160
Zurich.

1352
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,300
- Why not?
- European cities?

1353
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,010
Zurich isn't the capital city.

1354
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,410
It's Bern.

1355
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,580
Are you kidding me?

1356
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,780
Bern is the capital city of Switzerland.

1357
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,470
You must pay a ten-dollar fine.

1358
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,970
- I was clueless.
- Please pay up.

1359
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:39,580
Are you kidding me?

1360
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,950
- Hear me out.
- Coach Pak,

1361
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,050
make him pay the ten dollars he has.

1362
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,490
It's okay.
We're all allowed to make mistakes.

1363
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,850
I'll...

1364
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,550
- Seriously?
- Coach Pak!

1365
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,930
Just make him pay out of his own pocket!

1366
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,220
He named the wrong city.

1367
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,070
- Why must you pay the fine?
- But...

1368
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,070
Coach Pak, I'll hand it in for you.

1369
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,600
- Allow me.
- Coach Pak!

1370
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,160
- Suk Jin should've paid.
- All right.

1371
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,200
You have a limited number of chances.
Here's round two.

1372
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,510
That was a difficult one.

1373
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,910
Tell me about it. I was just as clueless.

1374
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,910
Should we start with Haha this time?

1375
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,050
- Sure.
- No way.

1376
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,780
- We'll start with Haha.
- Go ahead.

1377
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,240
Capital cities in Europe.

1378
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,820
Lisbon.

1379
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,680
Luxembourg.

1380
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,050
(Capital cities in Europe)

1381
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,580
(Her time is up.)

1382
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,450
(Se Ri's mind stopped thinking.)

1383
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,850
- There's Rome.
- There's also Bern.

1384
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,700
- Remember?
- An answer was already said.

1385
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,390
You could've said the same city.

1386
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,640
- You could've said the same city.
- You heard us in the last round.

1387
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,240
She already has ten dollars ready.

1388
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,930
How can you not know the capital cities?

1389
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,430
Coach Pak!

1390
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,830
Yes, I don't know them. So what?

1391
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,240
(She pays the fine
with an absence of guilt.)

1392
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,550
There's also Geneva.

1393
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,140
- Geneva isn't the capital city.
- And Bern.

1394
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,410
Geneva is just a city in Switzerland.

1395
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,220
- What else is there?
- Switzerland's capital is Bern.

1396
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,820
- There's France, Paris.
- Paris, of course.

1397
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,580
Brussels, Belgium.

1398
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,330
- England, London.
- London and Paris.

1399
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,580
- There are many.
- London and Paris.

1400
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,990
- Paris, Rome...
- What's the capital of Germany?

1401
00:43:58,990 --> 00:43:59,990
- Just so you know...
- Germany?

1402
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:02,470
- Coach Pak glared at me just now.
- Why?

1403
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,430
- As I named the cities...
- You are the annoying type.

1404
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,830
- I kept on naming them.
- For a second,

1405
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,570
- I flared up.
- What's the capital of Germany?

1406
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,430
Is it Munich? What is it?

1407
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:10,870
- Munich.
- What's the capital of Germany?

1408
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:12,280
- Germany.
- That would be Berlin.

1409
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,600
- Berlin, okay.
- What's Munich then?

1410
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,280
- Just a city.
- A city in Germany.

1411
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,370
Is it a city?

1412
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,050
That was close.

1413
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:19,970
- What was close?
- All right.

1414
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,820
This is your third attempt.

1415
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,390
- Start from there.
- We'll start with Jong Kook.

1416
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,050
- Austria, Vienna.
- Right, Vienna.

1417
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:26,850
- Vienna, noted.
- Let's do this.

1418
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,050
- It'll be an easy one.
- Bern.

1419
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:30,220
- Bern, Vienna...
- I can name ten by myself.

1420
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,330
Bern, Vienna, and Rome.

1421
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,890
- Here we go.
- This will be easy.

1422
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,120
It's only ten.

1423
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,470
Name Asian cities...

1424
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,200
- that aren't in Korea.
- What...

1425
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:38,640
- Three, two...
- Cities?

1426
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,800
Tokyo.

1427
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,030
Shanghai.

1428
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,160
Hanoi.

1429
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,640
Malaysia?

1430
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,200
- What's the category?
- Asian cities.

1431
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,010
- Just cities.
- Like Kuala Lumpur.

1432
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:51,050
- She already has her money out.
- Hold on.

1433
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,450
- Are you kidding me?
- She played with it in her hands.

1434
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:54,620
That's how generous she is.

1435
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,240
She is like Ji Hyo.

1436
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,910
- Are you kidding me?
- What's all this?

1437
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:00,580
I can afford it. So what?

1438
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,450
It's mine, isn't it?

1439
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:04,700
What can we say to that?

1440
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,300
- Please pay the fine.
- It's here.

1441
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,970
(Generous Madam Pak
is an earnest taxpayer.)

1442
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,120
How adorable.

1443
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,490
- You'll try again.
- Sure thing.

1444
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:12,970
This is your fourth attempt.

1445
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,760
Asian cities outside of Korea.

1446
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,140
(Asian cities outside of Korea)

1447
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,280
Shinjuku, Tokyo, and Shanghai.

1448
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:20,530
Shinjuku isn't a city.

1449
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:23,180
(Shinjuku?)

1450
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,350
Shinjuku isn't a city.

1451
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,220
- What on earth?
- That's...

1452
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,850
- Haha!
- It's a neighborhood.

1453
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,910
- Seriously?
- Have you lost your mind?

1454
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:32,180
- Just name one, darn it!
- You know what he told me?

1455
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,080
- Why get ahead of yourself?
- What did I say wrong?

1456
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,930
- Unbelievable.
- What was that?

1457
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,620
- Shinjuku is a neighborhood.
- Shinjuku...

1458
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,430
- Like Apgujeong.
- Guys, hear this.

1459
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,530
He said I only had to say Shinjuku.

1460
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,530
It's as if he was going
to name all ten cities.

1461
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:48,140
- Because you said that...
- What you said is this.

1462
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,800
So Shinjuku is a neighborhood
in the city of Tokyo.

1463
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,700
- But Shanghai is a city, right?
- I apologize.

1464
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,970
Are you kidding me?

1465
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,850
- Kuala Lumpur.
- Pay the ten-dollar fine.

1466
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:57,010
- I was only trying to help.
- Pay up.

1467
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:58,140
- I'm sorry.
- Pay ten dollars.

1468
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,740
- Please let it slide this once.
- It serves you right for boasting.

1469
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,890
- Coach, you also...
- Okay, fine.

1470
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:03,240
- Thank you.
- Shinjuku? What a joke.

1471
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,890
Coach Pak already has her money out.

1472
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:07,890
- Tokyo, Osaka, and...
- Unbelievable.

1473
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,950
Osaka is a city, right?

1474
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,780
- I'll name the most cities.
- Sure.

1475
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,450
- I'll say the most.
- That sounds good.

1476
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:15,220
Here we go again.
Jong Kook, we start with you.

1477
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,720
All right.

1478
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,990
- Capital cities in Europe.
- Good.

1479
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,470
Rome.

1480
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:21,930
Bern.

1481
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:24,200
Vienna and Brussels.

1482
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,200
Paris.

1483
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:27,700
Luxembourg.

1484
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,280
London and Lisbon.

1485
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:31,240
- How many more do we need?
- Two.

1486
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,320
- And Haha must say them?
- You said you'd take care of it!

1487
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,620
Hold on.

1488
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,240
- How many more do we need?
- Two.

1489
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,080
- And Haha must say them?
- You said you'd take care of it!

1490
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,390
Hold on.

1491
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:40,510
- I thought it'd come around.
- Must it end with Haha?

1492
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:42,890
- Must it end with him?
- We need to say all ten by then?

1493
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:44,950
- I thought we could say more.
- No wonder it's a tough game.

1494
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,200
- I thought it'd come back.
- We didn't know.

1495
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,370
One must say at least two then.

1496
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,220
- We had no idea.
- We didn't know.

1497
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,740
Jae Suk,

1498
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,800
- you said you'd name a lot for us.
- We didn't know.

1499
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:53,990
- We had no idea.
- You only said two.

1500
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,530
- This is the staff's fault.
- We didn't know.

1501
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:57,010
Jae Suk promised...

1502
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:58,740
He promised to say a lot.

1503
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,350
But he named two cities
and glanced over at Se Ri.

1504
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,080
(He only named two cities.)

1505
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,350
(I'm done.)

1506
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,180
- No wonder she was flustered.
- It's because...

1507
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,580
- Even I was flustered.
- I didn't want...

1508
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,280
to catch the others off guard.

1509
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,660
I thought we'd get another chance.

1510
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,890
- Me too.
- Same here.

1511
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:15,120
- I thought that as well.
- Me too.

1512
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,220
- So much for naming a lot.
- We must say at least two each.

1513
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,300
- Only two...
- All I have to do...

1514
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,390
is leave you with three.

1515
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:20,490
- Okay.
- Okay.

1516
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:22,070
- That's the plan.
- Good.

1517
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,330
Luxembourg is mine.

1518
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:24,700
- Okay.
- No one is allowed to say it.

1519
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,140
- London and Lisbon are mine.
- Okay.

1520
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,240
- We'll start with Haha.
- Then how many should I...

1521
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,330
Jae Suk must say the rest.

1522
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:30,760
- I'll make sure of it.
- Leave them with two.

1523
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,180
- I must leave you with two.
- Okay.

1524
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,410
- Good.
- Okay.

1525
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,870
- Here we go.
- London and Lisbon.

1526
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,050
- We'll start with Haha.
- Let's go.

1527
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,240
Okay, I won't.

1528
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,240
Milan?

1529
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,820
- European countries.
- Countries?

1530
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:43,510
What? Canada... No, wait!

1531
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:44,620
Hold on.

1532
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,010
(Is Canada in Europe?)

1533
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,120
Unbelievable.

1534
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,490
- Someone said Canada.
- Get over here.

1535
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:50,780
- Someone said it.
- Get over here.

1536
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:53,120
- Why did you change it up?
- Get back here.

1537
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,300
- Get back here.
- Guys, wait.

1538
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,700
- We were doing capital cities.
- I was just kidding.

1539
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,970
- It was funny, right?
- France!

1540
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,490
- I'll pay the ten-dollar fine.
- Germany!

1541
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,490
I'll pay up, so don't be angry at me.

1542
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,410
- Canada?
- Don't be angry at me.

1543
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,330
- Canada?
- Didn't someone say Canada?

1544
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,830
As if!

1545
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,330
It did catch us off guard though.

1546
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:08,910
The staff gave us an easy one.

1547
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:10,350
The head coach must pay the fine.

1548
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:11,680
Oh, then she should.

1549
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,220
The staff gave us an easy one.

1550
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,350
Countries in Europe.

1551
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,950
How about a 1-on-1 battle then?

1552
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:17,990
- Fine!
- Okay, fine.

1553
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,260
How about a 1-on-1 battle then?

1554
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,760
- I hate naming capital cities.
- I'd definitely win.

1555
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,160
- We've moved on to countries.
- Countries.

1556
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,120
I hate naming both of them!

1557
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,760
- Seriously.
- Remember those.

1558
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,700
- Let's go for it.
- I'll answer all except for two.

1559
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,890
Okay. Let's try it first.

1560
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,430
- There he goes again.
- Make sure to do that.

1561
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:31,470
- You should do it.
- Say one answer each.

1562
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,140
- Just keep going.
- I'll give five answers.

1563
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,200
Let's go.

1564
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,030
- Don't be intimidated. Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

1565
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,510
All right. Here we go.

1566
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:40,100
Asian cities outside of Korea.

1567
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,580
- Cities.
- Three, two,

1568
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,580
- one.
- Tokyo.

1569
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,100
Shanghai, Osaka.

1570
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,580
I was going to say Shanghai.

1571
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,910
- All right. Hanoi.
- Okay.

1572
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,390
Hanoi, and...

1573
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:50,640
- You can't do that!
- Kuala...

1574
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:52,490
Hey!

1575
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,260
(And?)

1576
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,430
(Hey!)

1577
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,390
You're just too much.

1578
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:01,370
I thought you were going
to say all the answers.

1579
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,890
Why did you mention Shanghai...

1580
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,370
- when I thought of it?
- Hey.

1581
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,160
Is Shanghai the only city in Asia?

1582
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:09,370
- You could've mentioned others.
- That made me flustered.

1583
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:11,600
- There's Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City...
- I was flustered.

1584
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,530
- There's Jakarta too.
- The director is sneaky.

1585
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:15,300
- You can't answer right away.
- He's sneaky.

1586
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,550
Also, why do you say "all right"...

1587
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:19,280
before you give your answer?

1588
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,370
You were looking to stall time.

1589
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:21,410
"All right."

1590
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:23,010
It's okay. Coach Pak is rich.

1591
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:24,490
- Let's begin with Haha this time.
- Okay.

1592
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,550
(They only have two chances now.)

1593
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,120
Don't look up!

1594
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,180
I was looking up
the capital cities in Europe.

1595
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,890
- Let's go!
- Let's start with Haha.

1596
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:33,120
It's confusing because they keep
mixing the questions.

1597
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,570
Name the states or cities of the US.

1598
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,620
California.

1599
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,240
Manhattan, LA.

1600
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,430
Manhattan is...

1601
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:42,660
Manhattan is not a city.

1602
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,870
- What about Manhattan?
- It's a borough in New York City.

1603
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:46,410
It's a borough.

1604
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:48,100
It's just like Shinjuku.

1605
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,300
Isn't that in the US?

1606
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,140
That's in the US. The only places I know
are LA and Manhattan.

1607
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,220
- Manhattan.
- It's in New York.

1608
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,390
There are many different places
in New York?

1609
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:56,410
(He's never heard of it.)

1610
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,450
Oh, really? I didn't know.

1611
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,780
Brooklyn is in New York.

1612
00:49:58,780 --> 00:49:59,850
How come we can never answer ten?

1613
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:01,890
I'll try to answer it all this time,
Coach Pak.

1614
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:02,990
The three of us should say
as many answers as we can.

1615
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:04,490
We should do that.

1616
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,830
- Here's the last question.
- Let's go.

1617
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:07,830
It's the last question.

1618
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,330
- Give us an easy one.
- This is quite hard.

1619
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:10,990
- Weren't all the questions easy?
- Who would like to go first?

1620
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:12,370
You can decide since it's the last one.

1621
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:13,570
- From this side?
- I'll give only one answer.

1622
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:15,740
You should all pass until my turn.
We can only win...

1623
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,070
- if Jae Suk makes it.
- That's right.

1624
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:19,780
Jae Suk needs to make it for us to win.

1625
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,200
Seriously... All right. Let's do it.

1626
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,370
Here we go.

1627
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,180
Excuse me.

1628
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,950
How come you keep excluding South Korea?

1629
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,180
- Busan! It's a beautiful city.
- I'm just so curious.

1630
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,550
- Daegu is such a beautiful city!
- Why do you keep excluding it?

1631
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:33,160
- I love Gwangju!
- I love Korea so much.

1632
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:34,660
- All right. Here we go.
- Why do you keep excluding it?

1633
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,850
- Let's take our time.
- Let's do it.

1634
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:36,890
Here we go.

1635
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:39,120
Capital cities in Europe.

1636
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,660
Paris.

1637
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,160
London.

1638
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,390
Lisbon.

1639
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,490
Luxembourg.

1640
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,490
- Bern.
- I was going to say that.

1641
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:48,640
Rome.

1642
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,700
Brussels.

1643
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,580
- Three more to go.
- Zurich.

1644
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,740
- Geneva.
- One more.

1645
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,080
- The last one.
- We're naming capital cities!

1646
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,100
Why do you keep mentioning that?

1647
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,180
(He just says
whatever city comes to his mind.)

1648
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,240
(Zurich, Geneva)

1649
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,350
(Oh, right.)

1650
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,580
- Zurich?
- Why do you keep mentioning that?

1651
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,950
What's wrong with you?

1652
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:04,990
We were supposed to name capital cities.
Why did you do that?

1653
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,450
We were almost there.

1654
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:07,550
- I said two answers though.
- I mean...

1655
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:09,180
- I even named three.
- It's capital cities!

1656
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,160
I can't remember capital cities,
to be honest.

1657
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,050
- He's right.
- I thought of saying Bern,

1658
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:16,530
but Coach Pak said it first,
so I thought the sky would fall.

1659
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,570
(It was a bolt out of the blue for him.)

1660
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:21,600
When you mentioned the answers
I had in mind...

1661
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,600
Bern.

1662
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,010
- So I could only think of Zurich.
- Right.

1663
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:26,330
- Is Zurich a capital city?
- Zurich.

1664
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:27,800
It's wrong, right?

1665
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,780
I told you it's Bern. Zurich and
Geneva are cities in Switzerland.

1666
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,470
You must love Switzerland.

1667
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:33,850
He just loves Switzerland.

1668
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:36,120
- This is really...
- It's not easy.

1669
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,740
- It's because you're flustered.
- Right.

1670
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,620
- When you watch it on TV...
- It looks easy.

1671
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:43,530
But now that I'm shooting it myself,
I went all blank.

1672
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:44,530
It's because you're flustered.

1673
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:45,800
I noticed that every time.

1674
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,550
Gosh, I'm in trouble.
My niece must be watching.

1675
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:50,030
- Please pay your fine.
- How much did we pay in total?

1676
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:51,160
You spent 90 dollars.

1677
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,430
- I can't believe we failed this.
- We spent a lot.

1678
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:54,970
It makes me feel ashamed.

1679
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:56,470
Why did you give me the money
when you were going to take it?

1680
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,800
He only gave it to you
so he could take it back.

1681
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,680
All right. We'll carry on right away
after setting up the cameras.

1682
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,700
- All right.
- We should play it with our senses,

1683
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,050
not with our eyes.

1684
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:05,080
All right!

1685
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,640
(The players gather to play
the mission for holes 7 to 9.)

1686
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,910
Are we jumping over this?

1687
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,390
Oh, so there are lines here.

1688
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,450
What's with this menu?

1689
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:14,930
- I know.
- Coach Pak.

1690
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,330
- The menu...
- Shouldn't we buy some of them?

1691
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,800
The Hidden Option costs 200 dollars.

1692
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,760
It's 200 dollars? It costs
200 dollars to reveal each option?

1693
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,220
Then are you giving us something to eat?

1694
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,220
(Hidden Option)

1695
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,700
(They were told to pay 200 dollars
to find out the Hidden Option.)

1696
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,830
- If you reveal the Hidden Option,
- Oh, only for the Hidden Option?

1697
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:28,970
there's something written under it.

1698
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:29,970
- Oh, if we pay 200 dollars...
- Then I'll pay for it.

1699
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:31,830
- Only if we pay 200 dollars?
- Yes, we must pay first.

1700
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:33,180
- Could it be food?
- Then let's pay up.

1701
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,140
But this is... Here's what I think.

1702
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,080
Even if we save on the money,
we can't use it outside anyway.

1703
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:41,350
Coach Pak, I think you should
use the money when you have it.

1704
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:42,410
Use it when you have it.
Use it to reveal the Hidden Option.

1705
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:43,780
It'll go to waste if you save on it.

1706
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,180
I think the staff hid a good option here.

1707
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,660
- Coach Pak, it's a hidden option.
- I don't think it's something good.

1708
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,660
We should reveal it now.

1709
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,930
- It's all a lie. You've been there.
- Should we reveal it now?

1710
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:51,950
- Don't be like this.
- We might end up...

1711
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,660
getting the penalty.

1712
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,100
- They already took 90 dollars.
- You're right.

1713
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,700
- Coach Pak, listen to us.
- You should spend 200 dollars.

1714
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,330
We're a team.
This isn't an individual game.

1715
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:00,490
- Right.
- Coach Pak.

1716
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:02,070
- Coach Pak, you should trust us.
- Let's reveal it.

1717
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,300
- Then shall we split it?
- Pardon?

1718
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,580
- Shall we split it?
- She's one crazy woman.

1719
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,970
- Shall we all pay up?
- I'm sorry.

1720
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,850
- She's crazy.
- Since we have the team money...

1721
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,820
Coach Pak,
then I'll collect from everyone.

1722
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,490
- I'll collect from them.
- You will?

1723
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:18,280
- Give me some of your money.
- Why are you acting up again?

1724
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:19,780
- Who are you to do that?
- Why are you acting up?

1725
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,120
- Why?
- Why are you acting up again?

1726
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,180
Gook Jin.

1727
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,580
- We should pay at least half.
- Let's come up with 100 dollars.

1728
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,720
Okay. That'll be better.

1729
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,100
Let's split it. We'll pay 100 dollars.

1730
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,070
- Okay.
- Okay.

1731
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:31,220
- Here.
- You know when to spend money.

1732
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,530
- Give it to me.
- Reveal the bottom option only.

1733
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,390
You should reveal it, Coach Pak.

1734
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:36,640
I'm not sure what it is,
but it must be worth...

1735
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,200
- the money we spent.
- It must be something nice.

1736
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,240
(They open the Hidden Option
with 200 dollars.)

1737
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,410
- What is it?
- What is this?

1738
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:41,470
- What does it say?
- "If you pay 500 dollars,"

1739
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,300
"the coach can receive
the penalty as well."

1740
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:58,550
- Come here.
- How much?

1741
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,090
- Why would I...
- I see.

1742
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:02,720
(Penalty ticket for Coach Pak)

1743
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,570
(Come here.)

1744
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:07,260
Why did I have to spend that money?
Give it back.

1745
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,360
I don't want this.

1746
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,470
- My gosh. This is absurd.
- This is...

1747
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:14,280
- How much?
- I see.

1748
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,550
(The opportunists
learned of something fun.)

1749
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:16,800
Coach Pak...

1750
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,070
There's no way we can
make 500 dollars until the end.

1751
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:20,150
- This is...
- Hey.

1752
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:22,510
- You can just disregard it.
- We don't have enough money anyway.

1753
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,010
- I think...
- You're going to pay for this.

1754
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,320
- If I get the penalty,
- I'll never buy it.

1755
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,550
I'm going to make the director
pay for this.

1756
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:28,550
- At the end...
- I mean it.

1757
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:30,930
It'll only be possible
if they make us earn money easily...

1758
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,660
- Of course, they will.
- toward the end.

1759
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,320
- We can never earn 500 dollars.
- Forget it.

1760
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,070
- We can never do that.
- I'll never buy it.

1761
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,990
If you do, I'm going to slap you.

1762
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:39,630
I decided to sacrifice my life...

1763
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,260
- for Coach Pak.
- Okay.

1764
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,910
Let's just work hard
and buy our exemption cards.

1765
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:44,970
- Of course.
- There's no point.

1766
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:46,380
Nonetheless, I'll make you pay for it.

1767
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,030
The Hidden Option?

1768
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:49,450
- Just wait and see.
- All right.

1769
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,610
The third mission
for hole number 7 to number 9...

1770
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,820
- is Hazard in the Air.
- I know that game.

1771
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:57,220
- He got it.
- He got it.

1772
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,660
- He threw it so well this time.
- How do I do it?

1773
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,720
Did I?

1774
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,760
- He got it.
- He got it.

1775
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,760
What is he doing?

1776
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,380
- He didn't look at it at all.
- You should look at it.

1777
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,630
- He got it!
- He got it!

1778
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,400
- Gosh, that was amazing.
- He got it.

1779
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,470
- He got it. Great.
- He got it.

1780
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,990
- He got it!
- Did he catch it?

1781
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,300
You earned 1,000 dollars in total.

1782
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,240
- All right!
- We did it. Good job.

1783
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,430
We need to divide it
among ourselves again, right?

1784
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:17,660
That's up to Coach Pak.

1785
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,380
- She'll give it to me for sure.
- That was close though.

1786
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,010
- This is...
- Who caught the balloon?

1787
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:22,570
- Me. Us.
- Me. We caught the balloon.

1788
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:23,680
- What about the ones who threw it?
- I threw it well.

1789
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,510
- I contributed.
- Give to those who caught it first.

1790
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:27,320
- I caught it and threw it.
- You caught it.

1791
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,150
- Thank you.
- You caught it.

1792
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:30,510
- I threw the balloon.
- What about those who threw it?

1793
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:31,650
- Fifty dollars for you.
- Thank you.

1794
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:32,680
(Se Chan, Jong Kook, Haha, and
Jae Suk all received 50 dollars.)

1795
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,880
- I threw the balloon.
- What about those who threw it?

1796
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,660
(He's the only one
who didn't get the money.)

1797
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,130
They caught it well
because I threw it well.

1798
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,630
(Seok Sam is completely disregarded
every time she distributes money.)

1799
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:40,860
- I should keep some for myself.
- No.

1800
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:41,860
(Seok Sam is completely disregarded
every time she distributes money.)

1801
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,470
Wait. Coach Pak.

1802
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:46,030
- All right!
- Wait.

1803
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:47,530
I'm done distributing it.

1804
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:49,360
Coach Pak, is there a reason...

1805
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,700
- you're acting this way?
- Not at all.

1806
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,910
Is there a reason?

1807
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:53,300
- It's not even real money.
- There's no reason.

1808
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,340
I should be cool-headed.

1809
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,450
He's so desperate.

1810
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,380
He's 56 though.

1811
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,150
- Coach Pak, don't fall for it.
- She's very adamant.

1812
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,470
- Let's move on.
- Everyone.

1813
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,320
The final nine holes...

1814
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,910
are available on the Running Man's
golf course.

1815
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:05,950
Is that so?

1816
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:08,260
Let's move to the next place
and play some golf.

1817
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,380
- All right.
- A golf course?

1818
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,550
- We're going to a golf course.
- There's a golf course?

1819
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:12,090
All right. Let's go!

1820
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:13,550
Please put on your seatbelts.

1821
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,090
- All right.
- Seatbelts.

1822
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,130
- Seatbelts.
- Let's put on our seatbelts.

1823
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,800
- Where is it?
- Over here.

1824
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,900
My gosh.

1825
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,160
- Let's put this down.
- Gosh, that hurt.

1826
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,660
- Come on!
- I'm sorry.

1827
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,740
Come on, Suk Jin.

1828
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,110
(The chair hit Se Ri's hand.)

1829
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,780
- Come on!
- I'm sorry.

1830
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,280
- She almost hurt her hand!
- Sorry.

1831
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,410
- You'll be in big trouble...
- You're not hurt, are you?

1832
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:30,550
- if you hurt her hand.
- Do you even know...

1833
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:31,680
how much her guarantee is?

1834
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,150
- Seriously, that guy...
- Be careful!

1835
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:35,650
- You're not hurt, are you?
- How dare a lowly man like you...

1836
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,650
- I'm sorry. Are you hurt?
- How dare a lowly man like you...

1837
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:39,860
Be careful! I'm apologizing!

1838
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,990
How dare a lowly man like you hurt her?

1839
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,010
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

1840
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:43,930
- It hurts.
- Do you want me to blow on it?

1841
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,130
- No, thanks.
- Do you...

1842
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:47,130
(Do you want me to blow on it?)

1843
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:48,800
Why would you blow on it?

1844
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,320
What are you, a grandpa?

1845
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,930
How dare a lowly man like you...

1846
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:53,530
- I know!
- Which do you prefer?

1847
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:54,760
Will this be better for you?

1848
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,930
- This is better, right?
- That's fine.

1849
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:57,240
You can put it here.

1850
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,030
- I should text Suk Jin.
- What will you say?

1851
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:00,180
She has her own standards.

1852
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,530
She and Woo Sung seemed close.

1853
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,680
- You mean Jung Woo Sung?
- He was on Running Man?

1854
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,880
- He was.
- He was.

1855
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,340
He loves our restaurant.

1856
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,650
- Oh, really? Woo Sung does?
- Yes.

1857
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:08,990
Suk Jin. You got a text.

1858
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:10,820
I got one. What is this?

1859
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:12,490
I can't believe
he comes to our restaurant.

1860
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:13,990
Gosh. Take a look at this.

1861
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,930
He's my junior.
I'm older than him, you know.

1862
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:19,430
And he texted me, "Behave yourself."
What do you think about this?

1863
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:20,490
What do you think about this?

1864
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:22,660
He texted me, "Behave yourself."
What do you think about this?

1865
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:24,970
- But you're his senior.
- Well done.

1866
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,800
Don't be rude...

1867
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,430
- What do you think about this?
- Don't be rude to Coach Pak.

1868
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:29,470
- What do you think about this?
- Stop it.

1869
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,360
- I said, don't be rude to her.
- This is...

1870
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,430
- He wasn't behaving himself.
- Tell me about it.

1871
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,910
- He kept acting up next to her.
- Think about it.

1872
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,970
- It must be difficult for you.
- No, it's not that.

1873
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:40,010
- You're all bullying him.
- No, that's not it.

1874
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:41,010
- Coach Pak.
- That's not true.

1875
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:42,610
I'm only telling him this on your behalf.

1876
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:44,240
- Excuse me, Coach Pak.
- He deserves to be criticized.

1877
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,550
The one who bullied me the most...

1878
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,590
was you.

1879
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,780
(You're the one who bullied me the most.)

1880
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,720
You gave 50 dollars to everyone except me.

1881
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,050
I was just being cool-headed.

1882
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:54,900
Until when are you going to mention that?

1883
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,990
- Stop with that talk already.
- Stop it.

1884
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:58,970
I know. I'm done with the payment.

1885
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:00,800
- She gave more money to us...
- Exactly.

1886
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,340
- because we had too little.
- That's right.

1887
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,610
She even gave you ten dollars.

1888
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:06,010
- That's right.
- We've never had a guest like her.

1889
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:07,510
Only those who received the money
are touched.

1890
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:08,610
Suk Jin, you got another text.

1891
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,470
- I got another one?
- Yes.

1892
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:11,910
(This time, another junior comedian
sent the text.)

1893
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:13,320
- I'm curious.
- Did he text me through KakaoTalk?

1894
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,510
- How come you get so many texts?
- What did he say?

1895
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:16,110
- He's really popular.
- He is.

1896
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:17,510
- He's really popular.
- No, I'm...

1897
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:18,990
(Laughing)

1898
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:20,590
- What is it?
- Must I let this slide?

1899
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:22,280
- What is it? What does it say?
- What does it say? Who sent it?

1900
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,780
My junior comedian...

1901
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,860
It's not even Jae Suk. It's Se Chan.

1902
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,720
He told me to shut my mouth
and just look ahead.

1903
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,590
(Shut your mouth and just look ahead.)

1904
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,700
(His dear junior comedian advised him
to keep his eyes on the road.)

1905
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,800
Just look ahead, will you?

1906
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,110
- Just look ahead.
- I mean...

1907
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:37,300
- Why do you keep turning?
- There's carp bread!

1908
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,070
- That looks good!
- Hey!

1909
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:41,740
How can I only look ahead
when a global star is sitting next to me?

1910
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,650
That was hilarious.

1911
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:45,970
- She's our legend.
- That's right.

1912
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:47,010
Seriously...

1913
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:48,510
- Okay.
- What is this?

1914
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:49,650
What's this?

1915
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:50,650
(What's this?)

1916
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:52,820
- What's this?
- What is this?

1917
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,550
They made a golf course?

1918
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:56,160
What's this? A par-three hole?

1919
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,950
- What's this?
- My goodness.

1920
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,800
(Welcome to Running Man's Golf Course.)

1921
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,090
- Look behind you.
- There's a bunker.

1922
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:05,320
- Gosh.
- What is this?

1923
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,800
There's water too.

1924
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:08,300
There's a bunker too!

1925
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,930
What's happening? This is incredible.

1926
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,910
They made a golf course.

1927
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:17,200
- What's this?
- There's water.

1928
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,200
(A detailed replica of a golf course)

1929
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,010
- My gosh.
- What's happening?

1930
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:21,910
- This is unbelievable.
- This is...

1931
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:23,090
Running Man is on another level.

1932
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:24,720
You guys did so much work.

1933
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,820
What's this?

1934
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,680
- Goodness, what are you doing?
- This is so cool.

1935
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,450
You spent all the money on this.

1936
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:32,220
- What's this?
- It's like "Let's Go! Dream Team."

1937
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,450
(What kind of game will they play here?)

1938
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:34,450
Please gather.

1939
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:37,090
Let me tell you about the rules
of the remaining nine holes.

1940
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:38,090
- All right.
- What are they?

1941
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:41,400
Your high-level golf skills
and a little bit of luck...

1942
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:44,910
will come in handy in this mission.
It's called Sticking Golf.

1943
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:46,470
- What's that?
- It must be made of Velcro.

1944
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:49,510
On a golf course made of Velcro,

1945
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:52,410
you're going to play golf
using a golf ball made of Velcro.

1946
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:56,820
Keep in mind that the ball might not roll
as it sticks on the course.

1947
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:57,990
My gosh.

1948
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:01,410
It'll be a match between 2 teams of 3.

1949
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:03,590
Two balls will be given to each team.

1950
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:05,700
The team that puts both balls
in the hole first wins.

1951
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:06,950
- In that hole?
- Yes.

1952
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:08,200
Oh, to that hole?

1953
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,860
(Each team gets 2 balls.)

1954
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,490
(The team that puts both balls
in the hole first wins.)

1955
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,160
The winning team...

1956
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,700
will receive 1,500 dollars
as prize money.

1957
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,470
- We'll get 1,500 dollars?
- If Team Se Ri wins,

1958
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:23,050
the three of you will take
300 dollars each.

1959
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,680
For the remaining 600 dollars,

1960
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,240
Se Ri can distribute it however she wants.

1961
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,550
This must be it.

1962
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:29,280
This must be the last round.
All right. Let's do it.

1963
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,820
If the other team wins,

1964
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:32,880
the three of you
can take 500 dollars each.

1965
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,590
- All right. This must be it.
- We're taking 500 dollars each.

1966
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,490
Then which clubs are we using?

1967
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:39,320
Please bring in the clubs.

1968
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,160
- We must be using real clubs.
- I don't think so.

1969
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,200
- See?
- What is that?

1970
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,200
Please bring in the balls too.

1971
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,630
Haha, I think it won't matter
for both of us.

1972
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:49,240
- It has nothing to do with skills.
- Right. It doesn't matter.

1973
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:50,910
- This is...
- They're just toys.

1974
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:53,280
- Even I can't play well with them.
- That's true.

1975
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:57,200
You must use both hands
like how you play real golf.

1976
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,410
That's a basic rule.

1977
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:01,740
We divided you into different teams,
considering the skill difference.

1978
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,610
The first team is Team Se Ri.

1979
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:06,610
- I must be on her team.
- It's Se Chan and Haha.

1980
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:08,490
- Gosh!
- Great. Why?

1981
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:10,430
- Because I love it so much.
- We can do it.

1982
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:11,680
- I love it.
- Coach Pak.

1983
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:12,860
- We should win big dollars.
- Let's do it.

1984
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:15,090
- We can do it. We've done it.
- Let's give it a try.

1985
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:18,260
Give us 50 dollars each
to celebrate us becoming a team.

1986
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,990
- What do you say?
- That's right.

1987
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:21,590
If you give us 50 dollars each,
it'll motivate us.

1988
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:23,610
- All right. Give me five.
- I'll really do my best.

1989
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:25,430
- You'll do your best?
- I'll give it my all!

1990
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:27,110
- I'll really do my best.
- Thank you.

1991
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:28,110
Since I have more money...

1992
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:29,450
- Didn't I do well?
- You did.

1993
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:31,510
Stand behind the start line.

1994
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:34,280
You'll take turns to play.

1995
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,450
It's going to fall into
the water for sure.

1996
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:37,490
It will.

1997
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:39,380
- Gosh.
- It won't be easy.

1998
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:41,110
What happens if the ball
falls into the hazard?

1999
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:43,090
- We can re-drop it?
- Yes, you can.

2000
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:46,720
Haha. This won't do.
We should play like this.

2001
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,360
(Sticking right on the golf course)

2002
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,630
Oh, it sticks onto it right away.

2003
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,360
Wait a minute.
Has the director tried playing this?

2004
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,510
- Have you?
- Of course.

2005
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:00,300
How many times?
How many times have you tried?

2006
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,300
(Through many simulations,
we found the perfect grass for the show.)

2007
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,910
- Gosh, this is...
- You can't hit it?

2008
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,550
- It's difficult.
- Give it a try.

2009
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,240
(The amateur golfers can't go beyond 1m.)

2010
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,010
- Darn it.
- I'm sure the total number...

2011
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:10,490
Suk Jin, I think
we'll get 400 strokes for this hole.

2012
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:11,490
My gosh, this is...

2013
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:13,160
- I'll play now.
- Yes, let's start.

2014
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,610
Here's the first player
for the final hole.

2015
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,930
I want to beat them.

2016
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:19,700
- I'm going to beat them.
- It's like gateball.

2017
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:22,700
The key to leading the game
is to hit the tee shot well...

2018
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:26,700
and keep the ball on the fairway.

2019
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,860
- You hit so well.
- That went pretty far.

2020
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,610
(Nice shot.)

2021
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:33,280
- That was a great tee shot.
- Right?

2022
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,530
- It was a long drive.
- It was a long drive.

2023
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:37,340
- It was a long drive.
- You call this a long drive?

2024
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,880
I'll hit it first,
then you can hit it over the water.

2025
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:41,570
Would it be better if you hit it?

2026
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,320
- All right. We'll play.
- Hit it high and as far as you can.

2027
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,590
It'll be embarrassing
if you can't hit it as far as I did.

2028
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:48,610
This isn't easy.

2029
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:51,090
- Don't provoke them.
- That's right.

2030
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:52,590
I think she'll be bad at it.

2031
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:54,300
- Will this work?
- She still got the swing.

2032
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,360
It's so funny how she still has the swing.

2033
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,590
- She still got the swing.
- How can she still swing like that?

2034
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:00,430
Her swing is incredible. It's amazing.

2035
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,360
(She manages to make
the Velcro ball fly in an arc.)

2036
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,630
- She hit a long drive.
- Nice shot, Se Ri.

2037
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:08,630
- It was a long drive.
- A long drive. Well done.

2038
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,180
Nice shot, Se Ri.

2039
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,200
- It was a long drive.
- A long drive. Well done.

2040
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,510
You can hit the second ball
or the ball on the course.

2041
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:16,840
You need to put both balls in the hole.

2042
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,360
- Oh, there are two balls?
- Yes.

2043
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,510
- It's their turn anyway.
- All right.

2044
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:24,860
(Yoo Gook Jin,
an expert talker on golf courses)

2045
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,300
It might be better to hit from here.

2046
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,900
- Right? I should hit from behind.
- Yes.

2047
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,090
Give it an impact. That's what matters.

2048
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:32,090
You got it.

2049
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:33,900
It's pretty good. It's a long drive.

2050
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,300
- It's a long drive.
- You did well.

2051
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,430
You did well. It's a long drive.

2052
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,260
You should try...

2053
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:41,910
and scoop up the ball as much as
you can. You know it, right?

2054
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,840
Like this?

2055
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:46,240
- Hey!
- Hey, that's...

2056
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,050
We should cut down everything
that gets in the way.

2057
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:49,550
- This is also...
- Be careful.

2058
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:51,510
- This is also part of the game.
- Here I go.

2059
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:54,090
- Hit it high.
- I don't think he can do it.

2060
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:55,280
He's going to drop it
right in front of him.

2061
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,990
That's it. All right.

2062
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:59,700
(It only went 1m forward.)

2063
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,400
You should hit it high.

2064
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,220
Gosh, my back hurts.

2065
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,070
- That was weak.
- Gosh, this is upsetting.

2066
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:06,400
- It's Jong Kook's turn.
- Is it my turn?

2067
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:08,970
Let's just avoid
hitting it into the hazard.

2068
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,700
(Protein Kim, often appears
at Giheung Country Club)

2069
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,160
Just hit it straight.

2070
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,450
- All right.
- Good shot.

2071
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:20,070
- All right.
- Good shot.

2072
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:21,070
He can do that?

2073
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:22,550
- You got this.
- We can allow that.

2074
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:23,610
- That was...
- Great job.

2075
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:26,260
Haha, just push it like this.

2076
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,180
- What's that? You can't do that.
- Hey!

2077
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:31,090
- You're hitting it with your hand.
- Michelle Wie does this.

2078
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:32,590
- He should put both hands together.
- Michelle Wie?

2079
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:33,990
Coach Pak.

2080
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:35,990
- Be quiet when someone plays.
- That's...

2081
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:37,630
- Just push it.
- He won't do well.

2082
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:39,200
(Ha Dong Hoon, estimated to be 168cm tall)

2083
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,630
- Nice!
- All right. That wasn't bad.

2084
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:43,200
(The little golfer
hit it better than expected.)

2085
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,410
You hit it well.

2086
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:46,800
Next player. Hey, that's ours.

2087
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,240
- That's our ball.
- I'm just pushing it down.

2088
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,800
- Hey, punk. That's our ball.
- I'm just pushing it down.

2089
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,970
- I just pushed it down.
- How can you touch our ball?

2090
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:55,050
- I just pushed it down.
- Why would you push it?

2091
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,910
- We'll allow that.
- Hit the bottom part.

2092
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:59,610
Hit the bottom part.

2093
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:01,090
- You touched the ball.
- That's one stroke.

2094
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:02,990
- That's one stroke!
- He touched the ball!

2095
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:05,260
- He touched the ball.
- That's one stroke.

2096
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,130
- He really did.
- Stop the nonsense.

2097
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:10,200
It... It doesn't matter
if they touch the ball.

2098
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,630
- Just hit it like that.
- It...

2099
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:12,800
If it's allowed, you can do it.

2100
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,260
I'm going to hit it however I want.

2101
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:16,470
- What is he doing?
- That's really annoying.

2102
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:18,610
You should pull back a little.

2103
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,880
- All right!
- Come on.

2104
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,240
My gosh.

2105
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,410
- You didn't have to swing so much.
- All right.

2106
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:25,740
(Laughing)

2107
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:27,220
- It's your turn.
- Is it?

2108
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:29,410
- My goodness.
- You should pull back only a bit.

2109
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:31,650
- It's my turn. That's mine.
- Okay.

2110
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:32,660
(Jae Suk presses down the ball.)

2111
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,410
- Okay.
- Don't step on it!

2112
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:36,160
What do you mean?
It just happened to be on my way.

2113
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,160
- Let me pat it.
- He didn't step on the ball, punk.

2114
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,490
My gosh.

2115
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:44,220
(Staring sharply)

2116
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,700
Wasn't that the parallel universe theory?

2117
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,410
- Right?
- I thought they were twins.

2118
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:50,530
You need to push it.

2119
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:51,740
Gosh, she's indeed great.

2120
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:54,180
- Her swing is amazing.
- She still got her swing.

2121
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:55,800
(They say giving compliments is
a classy way to keep them in check.)

2122
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:59,380
- My gosh.
- Not bad.

2123
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:01,180
What do you mean it wasn't bad?
It was bad.

2124
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:02,610
This isn't easy.

2125
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:03,740
- Darn it.
- Hit it.

2126
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:05,110
- Hey!
- Wait a minute!

2127
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:06,280
Why would you...

2128
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:07,610
- You stepped on the ball!
- It's dented!

2129
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:09,360
- I thought that was allowed.
- She just crushed it.

2130
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,630
Wait. The ball is dented.

2131
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,090
(She's completely adjusted
to Running Man's rules of golf.)

2132
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:16,590
- Hey.
- Don't be too greedy.

2133
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,400
They touched the ball.

2134
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,470
- Nice posture.
- It'll be a long drive.

2135
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:21,470
Great.

2136
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:23,630
(Will he do well when they're
endlessly holding him in check?)

2137
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:25,160
He's going to hit behind the ball.

2138
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:27,610
I don't think this will work.

2139
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:31,700
- Wait.
- Wait. It must be in the water.

2140
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,820
(He hit it pretty far.)

2141
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,380
- It's in the hazard.
- It's in the hazard, right?

2142
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:36,450
- Is it in the hazard?
- It didn't fall in the hazard.

2143
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,240
- It's there.
- It's stuck on the wall.

2144
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,240
(Luckily, it didn't fall in the water.)

2145
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,720
- How do we hit that?
- Well done.

2146
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:44,380
(It narrowly missed the hazard
and is stuck on the wall.)

2147
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:45,680
You hit it well.

2148
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,900
- You did well. It wasn't easy.
- You did really well.

2149
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,470
- My gosh.
- I'll try and hit it over.

2150
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:50,570
You should hit it to the top.

2151
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:53,200
You can't brush it like that.

2152
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,990
- Hey.
- Just let him do it.

2153
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:56,300
It's okay as long as
he does the backswing.

2154
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,430
- You can't just push it.
- I'm going to hit it like this.

2155
01:06:58,430 --> 01:06:59,800
It's a practice swing.

2156
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,410
You're supposed to hit the ball,
not push the ball.

2157
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:03,110
I'm hitting it. Like this.

2158
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:04,380
Go ahead.

2159
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:06,880
Isn't he holding the club too short?

2160
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:07,910
- Nice!
- All right.

2161
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:09,550
Isn't he holding the club too short?

2162
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:10,990
- It's stuck on the wall.
- Wait a minute.

2163
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:12,610
- He held it too short.
- It's stuck on the wall!

2164
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:14,260
How am I supposed to hit it
when it's on the wall?

2165
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,990
- You can push it up like this.
- Go for it.

2166
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,860
- Hit it.
- Hit it to the other side.

2167
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:19,450
- You must hit it to the other side.
- You must hit it to the other side.

2168
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:21,260
(Current location)

2169
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:23,470
- What are we doing?
- Hit it to the other side.

2170
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:26,970
The crew could make this game
since they aren't exactly normal.

2171
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,760
Send it over.

2172
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,860
- Okay.
- No.

2173
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:32,970
(A whiff)

2174
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:34,340
It wasn't a stroke.

2175
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:35,840
- It wasn't a stroke.
- Yes, it was.

2176
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,050
- It was a stroke.
- We saw it.

2177
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:38,200
- Okay.
- It was a stroke.

2178
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,680
- Hey.
- You wanted to hit it.

2179
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,320
- The intention wasn't there.
- The intention was there.

2180
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,450
The intention wasn't there.

2181
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:43,880
- Yes, it was.
- It was 100 percent there.

2182
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:45,510
It was a stroke.

2183
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:47,760
- Why couldn't you hit the ball?
- It was a stroke.

2184
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:49,220
- I will hit it. Move.
- Why couldn't you hit the ball?

2185
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,930
- It was a stroke.
- It was a stroke.

2186
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:52,090
You missed it.

2187
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:54,950
There you go.

2188
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:56,220
- All right.
- Okay. Go.

2189
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,590
Hit it hard.

2190
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,130
There you go.

2191
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:00,260
(He said golf is all about hitting,
not pushing.)

2192
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:01,360
There you go.

2193
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,610
- When will you hit it?
- There you go.

2194
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:04,740
Scrape the floor.

2195
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:06,740
- Okay.
- For goodness' sake.

2196
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:09,010
- This won't do.
- We are in trouble.

2197
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:10,610
- I warned you.
- It will be hard to hit.

2198
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:11,800
We are in trouble.

2199
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,320
- Se Ri.
- You should have sent it over.

2200
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,010
Se Ri, we need to get the ball
over the hazard.

2201
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,490
- I know.
- Things became difficult.

2202
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:20,550
I should really send it up.

2203
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:22,950
She yelled at us about it earlier,
but she is scraping the floor now.

2204
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,030
- I watched and learned.
- Scrape the floor.

2205
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:28,860
Sending the ball over the hazard
is the priority. All right.

2206
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:30,590
I can tell that you are having fun.

2207
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:31,720
(Giggling)

2208
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,490
- Scrape the floor.
- I hate losing.

2209
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,860
(The legendary golfer only made
winning shots in her life.)

2210
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,510
(Will she do the same this time?)

2211
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:41,180
- Scrape the floor.
- I hate losing.

2212
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:47,470
(She made a decisive move
by moving the ball by 8cm.)

2213
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:48,540
It was a stroke.

2214
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,380
- Okay. You did it.
- You did it.

2215
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,290
- You did it.
- Did you see it? It moved.

2216
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:54,160
- I hit the ball.
- You hit the ball. Let's go.

2217
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,420
This is driving me crazy.

2218
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:57,380
Gosh, this is bad.

2219
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:59,030
- Both of us need to do it.
- Which ball will you hit?

2220
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:01,620
- It will be a difficult task.
- Send it up like this.

2221
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:03,900
This kind of golf is
absolutely ridiculous.

2222
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:07,260
This is absolutely ridiculous.

2223
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:08,790
- Do it, Jae Suk.
- I will scrape the wall like this.

2224
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:10,210
Keep the club short.

2225
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:11,710
- You have never done this before.
- Keep the club short.

2226
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:12,970
It will come up well.

2227
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:14,630
This is the worst trouble shot.

2228
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:15,870
- Keep the club short.
- You have never done this before.

2229
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:16,970
- You can do it.
- It will be the first in Korea.

2230
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:18,450
I think it will be easy
to send the ball up.

2231
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:20,470
All right.

2232
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:21,470
- Okay.
- Come on.

2233
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,150
- Okay.
- Come on.

2234
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,580
You need to keep using it.

2235
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:28,880
- You need to keep using that club.
- Hold on.

2236
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,120
- Let's go.
- You need to be careful.

2237
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:32,790
There you go.

2238
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:34,000
You are good.

2239
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:35,790
- You are thorough.
- Seriously.

2240
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:37,120
You are like a professional golfer.

2241
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:40,290
Darn it!

2242
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:42,910
(He misses again!)

2243
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:45,040
- Did he miss again?
- He missed the ball.

2244
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,870
- Here I go.
- Go.

2245
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:48,930
- Here I go.
- It will be a nice shot.

2246
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:50,950
This is so hard.

2247
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:53,250
- Nice. Okay.
- I sent it over the cliff.

2248
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:54,420
This is so hard.

2249
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:56,540
- Nice. Okay.
- I sent it over the cliff.

2250
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:58,320
- Okay.
- You did it.

2251
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:00,290
- All right.
- It's Seok Sam's turn.

2252
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:01,580
Okay. Go first.

2253
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,490
- Okay.
- It's okay.

2254
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,180
- What?
- You know,

2255
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:07,590
- I will put it on the wall first.
- You should do that.

2256
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:09,250
- I should do that, right?
- Yes. Put it on the wall.

2257
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,920
Scrape the floor and send it up.

2258
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,170
There is no other way.

2259
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,200
- There you go.
- Nice.

2260
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,290
- Okay.
- Suk Jin.

2261
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:16,740
- It was a difficult shot.
- That was the absolute worst.

2262
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,260
How could you ask me to do
something so hard?

2263
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:20,130
That was the absolute worst.

2264
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:21,170
Go.

2265
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,740
- Okay.
- Not bad.

2266
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:24,300
- Gosh.
- We need to work on them.

2267
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,000
- We need to work on them.
- Firstly,

2268
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:27,750
- put it on the wall.
- Okay.

2269
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:29,250
- Dig it out.
- Here we go.

2270
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,540
There is no need to be ambitious.

2271
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:31,750
- Put it on the wall.
- One.

2272
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:32,920
Okay. It was a stroke.

2273
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,010
- Put it on the wall.
- One.

2274
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:35,180
Okay. It was a stroke.

2275
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:37,030
- For goodness' sake.
- What was that?

2276
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:39,830
Why did you send it to a corner?
I told you to dig it up.

2277
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,330
(He sent the ball to a corner.)

2278
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:44,120
Everyone, this is a gentlemen's sport.

2279
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:45,290
Okay.

2280
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:46,430
What are you doing?

2281
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:47,670
Now...

2282
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:49,960
I will hold the rope.

2283
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,710
- Go ahead.
- We have a lot of money.

2284
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:52,740
- I am ready.
- Go ahead.

2285
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,470
A bit forward, Haha.

2286
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:55,540
A bit forward. Okay.

2287
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:56,710
(It's time to show the skills
of Dongducheon's Broom.)

2288
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:57,840
Okay.

2289
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:01,510
Here I go.

2290
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,840
- Okay.
- There was an intention.

2291
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:06,080
- There was an intention, right?
- No!

2292
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,580
There was an intention. Come on out.

2293
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:08,880
- It was a stroke.
- Come on out.

2294
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,250
(There was an intention
in his solemn "Here I go.")

2295
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,220
- It was a stroke.
- Hey.

2296
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:13,900
- It's impossible.
- How did you do that?

2297
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,420
We are in trouble.

2298
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,260
- Dig it out.
- Send it up a bit at a time.

2299
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:18,290
(The problem-solver appears.)

2300
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:20,200
Is this really golf?

2301
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,200
- What is this?
- No. Golf isn't like this.

2302
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,930
- How will he get it out?
- Go ahead.

2303
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:24,960
(The Running Golf Course
is quite suspicious.)

2304
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:26,540
Go ahead.

2305
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:27,580
(Screaming)

2306
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:28,970
You did it.

2307
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:31,210
- You are a technician.
- He used his strength.

2308
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,540
He used his strength.
This is driving me crazy.

2309
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,320
Do you want me to hold it?
Send it up gently.

2310
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:37,450
(The wall-climbing match continues!)

2311
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:38,650
Okay. Nice.

2312
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:39,790
Send it up.

2313
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:42,080
- It wasn't that bad.
- Good job.

2314
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,080
- Se Ri.
- Good job.

2315
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,960
Hold on. Don't touch me.
My shoulders got dislocated.

2316
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,360
Your shoulders got dislocated.

2317
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,420
That's right.
You need to watch your shoulders.

2318
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:51,090
- Her shoulders got dislocated.
- Why?

2319
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:52,900
I don't know. I guess they can come off.

2320
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,200
(He suddenly says that
Se Ri's shoulders can come off.)

2321
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,260
Nonsense.

2322
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:57,710
- Her shoulders can come off.
- They are like Lego.

2323
01:11:57,710 --> 01:11:58,710
Hold on.

2324
01:11:58,710 --> 01:11:59,740
- Can you do that?
- You can't do that.

2325
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:01,300
- Coach Pak.
- You can't do that.

2326
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:03,780
- The ball has to hit here.
- There has to be a swing.

2327
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:04,910
You can't do that.

2328
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:05,970
You can hit it like that.

2329
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:07,250
No, you can't.

2330
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,150
- How is this so different?
- There has to be a swing.

2331
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:10,920
- You can't do this. Watch.
- You are talking nonsense.

2332
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,250
You have to hit it like this.

2333
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:13,420
- Come on.
- How is this so different?

2334
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:14,510
- There is no difference.
- You can't do that.

2335
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:16,550
- They look good together.
- Watch.

2336
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:17,720
- Decalcomania.
- If you do this,

2337
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,660
- it will be like the pool.
- This could be a meme.

2338
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:21,050
It will be like the pool.

2339
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:22,120
- Listen.
- Hit it like this.

2340
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,030
- Hit it like this.
- You need to swing the club.

2341
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:25,720
That's right. There has to be a swing.

2342
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:26,760
Are you calling this a swing?

2343
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,500
That's right. You should do that.

2344
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,740
Hit the ball like this.

2345
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:32,000
- Unbelievable. Come over here.
- Listen. The handle is the axis.

2346
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,670
The head should move.

2347
01:12:33,970 --> 01:12:35,000
There you go.

2348
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:37,370
Just send it up a little.

2349
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:39,080
There you go.
If it falls into the water...

2350
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,840
Why are you being so chatty
when I am playing golf?

2351
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,180
- I was just giving advice.
- Fine.

2352
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:44,920
- All right.
- I will hit it in my style.

2353
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,580
Stop telling me what to do.

2354
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:48,050
Go ahead. Swing.

2355
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:50,330
Okay. That's the way to do it.
There you go. That's good.

2356
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,080
There you go. That's good.

2357
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:53,750
- She did it.
- See?

2358
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:55,750
- You are so good.
- My advice helped!

2359
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,030
- Where did it go?
- It went up.

2360
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:58,530
- It went up.
- Good shot.

2361
01:12:58,530 --> 01:12:59,870
- We need to work on that one next.
- Jae Suk.

2362
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:00,900
Nice one.

2363
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:01,930
- You saw what she did.
- Yes, I did.

2364
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:03,430
You should do it like that. Hold on.

2365
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:04,540
What are you doing?

2366
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,300
Why are you using your left hand?
You aren't left-handed.

2367
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,080
I have my right hand on the handle.

2368
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,150
- I don't think that's correct.
- It's correct.

2369
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:11,650
Shouldn't you hold it backward?

2370
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:13,040
Shouldn't you hit it like this?

2371
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,210
- Go ahead.
- I plan to send it up.

2372
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:15,620
- Go ahead.
- It will go up.

2373
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:16,950
- Okay.
- See?

2374
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:18,450
- What did I tell you?
- Hey.

2375
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:19,650
- It will go up.
- Okay.

2376
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:20,710
See?

2377
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:22,120
- What did I tell you?
- Hey.

2378
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,050
- You should hit it like this.
- Watch.

2379
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,660
You should hit it like this
with your right hand.

2380
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:27,790
For goodness' sake.

2381
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,290
Why did you hit it like this?

2382
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,700
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

2383
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,830
(Each team has one ball in the hazard.)

2384
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:35,870
You should hit it like this
with your right hand.

2385
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:40,500
(Se Chan, the professional golfer,
thinks about what will be funny.)

2386
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,000
(Is he reenacting that moment?)

2387
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:46,970
(As if he made up his mind,)

2388
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:49,650
(Se Chan takes off his socks.)

2389
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:54,990
(In 1998, Se Ri gave energy
to the nation.)

2390
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:00,360
(Like her, Se Chan
will hit a shot barefooted.)

2391
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:03,290
- Haha, support him.
- You know,

2392
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:04,960
his feet stink.

2393
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:07,460
The sour smell is traveling up.

2394
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:09,500
- Seriously.
- His feet really are a hazard.

2395
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,040
- They really stink.
- They are a biohazard.

2396
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,830
(Every spot Sour Feet touches
is a hazard.)

2397
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:14,110
You shouldn't go into the water.

2398
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:15,410
His feet stink.

2399
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:18,710
- Hey.
- Haha, hold the rope.

2400
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,210
There you go.

2401
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:21,870
- Okay.
- There you go.

2402
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:23,820
- Lean back a bit more.
- A bit more.

2403
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:26,150
- A bit more.
- So Min will fall for you.

2404
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:27,320
Se Chan.

2405
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,210
If you fall backward...

2406
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,530
- It will be funny.
- Send it to the left.

2407
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:31,830
Send it to the left.

2408
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:34,420
It will be really funny
if the ball falls into the water.

2409
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,000
- Like this?
- It should hit the camera first.

2410
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,090
- Like this?
- There you go.

2411
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:38,200
One, two.

2412
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:39,790
- Okay.
- Okay.

2413
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:41,570
- It was a stroke.
- I can't send it up.

2414
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:42,930
- It's our turn.
- It's our turn.

2415
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:45,130
Since you took off your shoes,
you should go into the water.

2416
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,830
- Okay.
- Okay. We did it.

2417
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:49,410
- Are you calling this a swing?
- Nice.

2418
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:51,170
- We won.
- We are at an advantage.

2419
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,710
- Okay.
- Things are getting serious.

2420
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:56,080
- This is bad.
- Scrape the floor.

2421
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,680
Don't think about sending it up. Okay.

2422
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,180
- It won't end today.
- Okay.

2423
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:00,210
(The petty golf round continues on!)

2424
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:01,660
- I think it will work.
- It's okay.

2425
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:03,080
I will send it up.

2426
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:04,290
Watch.

2427
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:06,530
- Suk Jin.
- I am the king of approach shots.

2428
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:07,620
- Okay?
- Move out of the way.

2429
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:09,530
Suk Jin, don't hit it hard.

2430
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:11,090
No. It will be too hard.

2431
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:12,920
- No.
- It will be too hard.

2432
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,900
(However, the green has a steep slope.)

2433
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:18,130
The closer you are to the hole,

2434
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:19,540
the slope will be steep.

2435
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:21,280
(There is a danger of sending
the ball to the other side.)

2436
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,970
Don't hit it hard.
It just needs to climb up the hill.

2437
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:25,650
He doesn't even listen to Coach Pak.

2438
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:26,750
You need to put it on the top.

2439
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:28,320
You need to put it on the top.

2440
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,250
- You need to put it on the top.
- I knew it.

2441
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:31,680
I told you so!

2442
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,950
(It passes the hole
and stops at the velcro slope.)

2443
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:34,420
We can hit it from there.

2444
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,920
Will you send it over there?
Why don't you send it that way?

2445
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:39,080
It won't go as I plan.

2446
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:40,290
This isn't proper golf.

2447
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:42,000
This is ridiculous.

2448
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:44,260
Isn't she exactly like Jong Kook?

2449
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:45,530
Daejeon Loser.

2450
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:48,960
(They even get angry the same way.)

2451
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:51,040
Okay.

2452
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:53,330
- It's okay.
- It's here.

2453
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:55,500
It's hard to put it on the top.

2454
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,840
Yes. You need to measure
the distance right.

2455
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,300
A bit more. Okay.

2456
01:16:00,710 --> 01:16:01,710
That's good.

2457
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:03,040
This is hard.

2458
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:04,620
It's on the velcro.

2459
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,290
It's a good spot.

2460
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:09,210
Jae Suk, it's close to the hole.
Let's go.

2461
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,420
(Team Se Ri has a long way to go.)

2462
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:12,490
All right.

2463
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:16,050
- Nice.
- Nice.

2464
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:17,330
- Good.
- Go ahead.

2465
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:18,530
(The little golfer's long shot
helps them advance.)

2466
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:20,070
- Is it our turn?
- Hey.

2467
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,090
If you get the direction right,

2468
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:22,370
- it will go in.
- They are almost done.

2469
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:23,910
- Jae Suk.
- Aim to put it into the hole.

2470
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:26,110
- Okay.
- If you get the direction right,

2471
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:27,170
- it will go in.
- Okay.

2472
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,430
The hole is very big. It will go in.

2473
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:30,840
- It's very big.
- It will go in.

2474
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,280
- Aim to put it into the hole.
- It will go in.

2475
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:34,620
This isn't easy.

2476
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:37,080
- Here I go.
- Aim to put it into the hole.

2477
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,750
- Let's put it into the hole.
- Don't hit it too hard.

2478
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:39,880
- Okay.
- Hit it gently.

2479
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,160
(This is Jae Suk's chance to get ahead.)

2480
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,180
This is hard.

2481
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,530
- Let's put it into the hole.
- Don't hit it too hard.

2482
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:44,720
He might succeed.

2483
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,420
The direction is off.

2484
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:48,030
- Adjust the direction.
- Okay. There you go.

2485
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:49,330
- That's good. Hit it.
- Hit it hard.

2486
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:51,570
- Okay.
- He touched the ball.

2487
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:52,760
- Hit it.
- Hit it hard. Okay.

2488
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,460
He touched the ball.

2489
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:55,740
Good job.

2490
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:57,800
Hey. Who is going next?

2491
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,870
- Do you want to try it?
- Go ahead.

2492
01:16:58,870 --> 01:16:59,970
- It's not easy.
- I will try it.

2493
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:02,080
You need to hit it gently. Not yet.

2494
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,170
Not yet. It isn't our turn.

2495
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:04,450
How do you push it?

2496
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,410
I think she will put it in the hole
in one go.

2497
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:08,250
The velcro is in the way.

2498
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,150
Put it on the top of the slope.

2499
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,040
- Not bad.
- Okay.

2500
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:14,250
We are set.

2501
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,080
- I am so annoyed.
- Scrape the floor.

2502
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,620
Scrape the floor.
Hit it gently. There you go.

2503
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:18,920
Just get the direction right.

2504
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,160
- It will be too hard.
- The direction.

2505
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,220
The hole is big.

2506
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,330
It will come this way.

2507
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:26,330
- Gosh!
- I told you it will come this way.

2508
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:29,430
- Gosh!
- I told you it will come this way.

2509
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:30,960
- Okay.
- I told you it will be too hard.

2510
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,170
- I hit it too hard.
- I told you so.

2511
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:33,930
It's not easy to control your strength.

2512
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:35,500
This is hard.
Send it on top of the hill.

2513
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,670
It will be better
to send it over the hill.

2514
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,280
- You know,
- Not bad.

2515
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:42,340
- this is hard.
- I will hit this one.

2516
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:44,510
- I will hit this one.
- Aim to put it into the hole.

2517
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:45,920
- Here.
- I will do that.

2518
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,210
Jong Kook,
aim to put it into the hole.

2519
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:49,510
- Suk Jin seems to be on the field.
- I will put it in.

2520
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:50,550
I will put it into the hole.

2521
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,990
If you want to see the line,
you should hit it this way.

2522
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:55,090
This way.
It will hit the ground and...

2523
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:56,200
Why didn't you do that?

2524
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,570
The distance was too short on this side.

2525
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,530
- I will aim to put it in.
- This way.

2526
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:00,700
- Totally.
- Yes.

2527
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,070
All right.

2528
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:03,710
- It's coming.
- Gosh.

2529
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:05,370
- It's coming.
- Gosh.

2530
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:06,370
- Stop.
- Okay.

2531
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:07,830
It's our turn.

2532
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,740
I think it will go back and forth.

2533
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:11,780
I don't think
we will get it done by today.

2534
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:13,970
- This is getting serious.
- I know.

2535
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:16,580
- Gosh.
- Okay.

2536
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:17,620
- Well done.
- Okay.

2537
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:19,010
- Put it here.
- Aim to put it in the hole.

2538
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:20,580
Get the direction right.

2539
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:21,860
- Aim to put it in the hole.
- Get the direction right.

2540
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:23,620
It's okay if it goes to the other side.

2541
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:24,790
(Dragging)

2542
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:25,920
What was that?

2543
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,500
(His chance evaporates
with a petty sound.)

2544
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,790
- Can't you move it more than 10cm?
- Why are you so timid?

2545
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,220
You are so timid. Just hit it hard.

2546
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:34,590
You need to put the ball
on the top of the hill.

2547
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:36,370
He really looks like a coward
from the back.

2548
01:18:36,370 --> 01:18:37,760
Seriously. Gook Jin.

2549
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:38,930
Seriously.

2550
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:40,630
- We will go.
- You moved it 3cm and 10cm.

2551
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:42,300
I can't see it.

2552
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:45,370
- She is serious.
- Let's move a little at a time.

2553
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:46,370
She has a serious look on her face.

2554
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:48,150
I hope I can send it into the hole
at once.

2555
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,320
The two teams are
in similar positions now.

2556
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,820
They might succeed first.

2557
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:57,530
(What will be the result?)

2558
01:18:58,330 --> 01:18:59,360
She sent it up.

2559
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:02,420
- She sent it up.
- Okay.

2560
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,070
(A nice chip shot
sent the ball close to the hole.)

2561
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:05,290
It was an approach shot.

2562
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:06,830
- Good.
- Get the direction right.

2563
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:08,460
You will hit it too hard.

2564
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:10,260
- No. Look.
- Listen.

2565
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:11,670
There is no angle.

2566
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:13,000
- It's...
- I think the ball will go...

2567
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,540
- in a curve.
- No.

2568
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:17,250
It won't happen. It looks that way,
but the ground is flat.

2569
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:19,040
You need to focus on the direction.

2570
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,370
Hit it like that.

2571
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:21,670
It will be impossible to succeed at once.

2572
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:23,820
He is done.

2573
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,150
He is done.

2574
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:29,710
I am sorry,
but are you a comedy team?

2575
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:31,160
(I am sorry,
but are you a comedy team?)

2576
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:34,200
- No, we aren't.
- Se Chan, go ahead.

2577
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,250
Go ahead.

2578
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:38,170
I am sick and tired of this.

2579
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:39,920
- Good. My goodness.
- That startled me.

2580
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:40,960
Okay.

2581
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,400
- We are in the same position now.
- Yes.

2582
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,130
- We are in the same position now.
- Not bad.

2583
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,460
We are set.

2584
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:46,830
- Here I go.
- Practice.

2585
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,410
- Go.
- Push it forward.

2586
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,370
(At that moment,)

2587
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:52,670
(Haha's shot heads toward the hole.)

2588
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,950
- Gosh.
- You did well.

2589
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:58,840
- Jae Suk.
- This is it.

2590
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:00,660
Don't hit it too hard.

2591
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:02,960
It will reach the flat ground right away.

2592
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,880
- There you go.
- Gosh!

2593
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,720
We are in the same position.

2594
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:07,790
- It's okay.
- This is...

2595
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:08,790
(It's a nerve-racking match.)

2596
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:10,500
We can send it onto the mound.

2597
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:11,900
- It's my turn, right?
- One by one...

2598
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,420
- This is so stressful.
- Try hitting that ball.

2599
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:14,930
- No. I will hit this ball.
- This is so stressful.

2600
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:16,910
- I will put it on the mound.
- That's right.

2601
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:18,040
- Hit it gently.
- This ball.

2602
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,670
- What do you think?
- That's a good idea.

2603
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:21,470
What?

2604
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:24,170
That's a good idea.

2605
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:28,870
(Se Chan makes a lucky shot
and surprises everyone.)

2606
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:30,010
He did it.

2607
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,180
(It goes into the hole cleanly.)

2608
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:33,320
(Dongducheon's Tiger Woods
putted the ball nicely.)

2609
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,710
- Good job.
- Nice.

2610
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:38,750
(They got ahead of Team Old Men
in the end.)

2611
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:40,620
- We can put it in the hole.
- I will keep it there.

2612
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:42,220
- Let's put it in the hole.
- I can't believe it went in.

2613
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:43,290
Unbelievable.

2614
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:44,570
I got so lucky.

2615
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:45,720
Jong Kook, let's put it in the hole.

2616
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,330
- Here I go.
- Three.

2617
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:51,430
(The ball rolls toward the hole.)

2618
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:54,280
(Will it go into the hole?)

2619
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:00,340
(It passes through the hole.)

2620
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:02,250
It almost went in beautifully.

2621
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,680
I think she will succeed.

2622
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,650
Se Ri, just put it on top of the mount.

2623
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,790
I want to do that.

2624
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:08,880
Hit it gently.

2625
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,160
Se Ri, hit it gently.

2626
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,550
It's okay if it goes over.

2627
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,720
- Not bad.
- Okay.

2628
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:15,030
- Stop.
- It's pretty bad.

2629
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:16,030
It's very bad.

2630
01:21:16,030 --> 01:21:17,260
Suk Jin, hit it gently.

2631
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:18,460
- Like this?
- No. It will be too hard.

2632
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:21,370
- Will it be too hard?
- Just put it on top of the mound.

2633
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:22,430
- Here?
- Yes.

2634
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:23,740
- Here?
- That's right.

2635
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:24,870
Hit it like that.

2636
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,300
Just get the direction right.

2637
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:27,370
- Nice.
- I told you to put it on the top.

2638
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:28,370
Stop.

2639
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:30,340
(Suk Jin misses once again.)

2640
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:32,040
I told you to put it on the top.

2641
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,110
Gently.

2642
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:36,670
- I told you to put it on the top.
- It was hard.

2643
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:37,950
Hit it gently like the last time.

2644
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:39,540
You did it just now.

2645
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:40,960
(The man who succeeded first,
Yang Woods goes next.)

2646
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,680
Just put it on top right here.

2647
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:44,420
It's better than sending it down.

2648
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:45,720
- You did it.
- You did it.

2649
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:46,960
Stop. Oh, yes.

2650
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,550
- Nice.
- Oh, yes.

2651
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,530
- Yes!
- Nice!

2652
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,030
- You did it. Stop.
- You did it.

2653
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:54,090
(The ball rolls beautifully...)

2654
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:56,930
(and lands next to the hole.)

2655
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:59,300
- You are a genius.
- It was a good shot!

2656
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:02,130
(We are ruined.)

2657
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:03,130
(Try to push their ball away.)

2658
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:04,840
- Try to push their ball away.
- You are a genius.

2659
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,250
It was a good shot!

2660
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:08,370
Mark the ball. Hold on.

2661
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:10,340
- Jong Kook, hit this ball.
- Mark the ball.

2662
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:12,620
- Can't we mark the ball?
- We will keep going as we are.

2663
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:14,790
- Hit this ball. You have to do it.
- No.

2664
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:17,330
- That's the only way.
- You have to do it.

2665
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:19,120
- Send it through here.
- Yes.

2666
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,250
You have to hit it.

2667
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:22,330
You have to hit it.

2668
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:24,670
(It's their last chance,
so he must hit the ball.)

2669
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:25,720
- Good.
- Hit it.

2670
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,170
- You have to hit it. Good.
- Hit it.

2671
01:22:29,870 --> 01:22:31,870
- He missed.
- Hey.

2672
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:33,000
I told you to hit this ball.

2673
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,370
- I tried.
- Hey.

2674
01:22:34,370 --> 01:22:35,970
- Who will finish it up?
- Me.

2675
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:37,870
In my time playing golf...

2676
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,750
Haha, this is an easy shot.

2677
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:41,150
Don't be flippant.

2678
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:42,710
- Hey.
- Don't be flippant.

2679
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:44,210
- Hit it gently.
- Hit it hard.

2680
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:45,320
Hit it gently.

2681
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,290
- Haha!
- Nice!

2682
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:49,920
- Haha!
- Nice!

2683
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:50,990
(Haha wrapped it up.)

2684
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:51,990
- Good shot.
- Nice!

2685
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:54,400
- It was impossible to miss.
- We almost lost, right?

2686
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,120
- We should have won.
- Good job.

2687
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,290
- Good shot.
- Nice!

2688
01:22:57,290 --> 01:22:59,720
- It was impossible to miss.
- We almost lost, right?

2689
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,460
- We should have won.
- Good job.

2690
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:02,670
Se Chan, thank you.

2691
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:05,930
- Golf is really fun.
- You did really well.

2692
01:23:05,930 --> 01:23:07,040
You are good.

2693
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,410
Nice.

2694
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:09,870
Haha, take it home.

2695
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:12,450
- We were losing.
- I know.

2696
01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:14,580
(So Wool, did you see that?)

2697
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:15,840
I can't believe we won.

2698
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,680
- When it went into the water...
- I know.

2699
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,120
We fought well.

2700
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,210
- We fought well.
- We fought well.

2701
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:21,210
We fought well.

2702
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:22,510
We couldn't wrap it up nicely.

2703
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:24,960
Team Se Ri will receive 1,500 dollars.

2704
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,530
(They receive the prize money
of 1,500 dollars.)

2705
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:28,720
This is the money you will distribute.

2706
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:31,070
I will give 300 dollars to each member.

2707
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:32,900
- We will receive more money.
- Their situation suddenly improved.

2708
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:35,200
- I will distribute this money.
- Oh, yes.

2709
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:37,500
Their situation suddenly improved.

2710
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,960
- We fought fair and square.
- Yes.

2711
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,330
We didn't want to be on a different team.

2712
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:43,630
- Things were decided that way.
- I know.

2713
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:45,250
- I will give you 50 dollars each.
- Thank you.

2714
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:47,580
All right. It's time for the ending.

2715
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:50,820
I will let you see
the price on the menu now.

2716
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:52,450
How much is it?

2717
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:53,860
- Penalty.
- This is insane.

2718
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:55,860
I bet it's ridiculously expensive.

2719
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:57,720
- Penalty exemption card.
- How much is it?

2720
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:58,750
Let's see it.

2721
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:00,530
- It's 300 dollars.
- You can buy the exemption card.

2722
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:01,550
I will be exempt.

2723
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:04,220
(Haha and Se Chan can purchase
the penalty exemption card.)

2724
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:05,500
- There is nothing to buy.
- The sirloin set.

2725
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,700
The Korean beef sirloin set
costs 500 dollars.

2726
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:08,900
I want to buy it.

2727
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:10,540
You should purchase it.

2728
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:12,260
The pork set costs 300 dollars.

2729
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:15,170
The Waffle maker and dough set
costs 200 dollars.

2730
01:24:15,170 --> 01:24:16,410
Why is everything so expensive?

2731
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:17,840
Look at the Korean beef.

2732
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:19,210
The grade is two plus.

2733
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:21,870
Say the item name as you pay.

2734
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:23,990
I have 30 dollars.

2735
01:24:24,150 --> 01:24:25,950
You said it's 300 dollars, right?

2736
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:27,750
- Haha.
- Hold on.

2737
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:30,320
Hold on. I can buy something.

2738
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,860
- Please give me 70 dollars.
- Is the pork set 300 dollars?

2739
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:33,920
Hey.

2740
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,030
Don't you think my life matters more...

2741
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:37,720
than the pork set?
I will buy it for you afterward.

2742
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:39,030
Three, four...

2743
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,590
- I will buy it for you afterward.
- Four, five...

2744
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:43,930
- I will...
- I can buy the waffle maker.

2745
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:45,630
I will buy you a waffle maker.
Please give me 70 dollars.

2746
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:48,000
- Jae Suk.
- Thank you.

2747
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:50,000
- Thank you.
- Seriously.

2748
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,040
Thank you.

2749
01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:53,000
- That's incredible.
- Would you give me ten dollars?

2750
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,510
Thank you. She is the best.

2751
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:57,040
- I just need 20 dollars.
- In that case,

2752
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,040
I will purchase the exemption card.

2753
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:01,210
- Are you exempt now?
- She is incredible.

2754
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:04,120
- Coach Pak is incredible.
- The pork set.

2755
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,860
The pork set
and an exemption card for Haha.

2756
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:07,330
I will purchase an exemption card.

2757
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:08,660
Jae Suk purchased an exemption card.

2758
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:10,790
- It was exhausting.
- The pork set.

2759
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:12,830
Thanks to Coach Pak,
I can purchase an exemption card.

2760
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:15,200
- Counting 10, 20...
- Do you have enough?

2761
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:17,110
Don't you need to buy something?

2762
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:18,370
- Come on.
- Like the Korean beef set?

2763
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:19,410
(She even saves her doppelganger.)

2764
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:21,330
- No.
- Will everyone be exempt?

2765
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:23,000
- No one will receive the penalty.
- No one will receive the penalty.

2766
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,170
Would that be okay?

2767
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:25,710
- That would be okay, right?
- Would that be okay?

2768
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:26,840
Would that be okay?

2769
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:30,420
I will purchase a waffle maker
for my niece.

2770
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:31,450
(She purchases a waffle maker
for her niece.)

2771
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:33,510
You should take one for your children.

2772
01:25:34,010 --> 01:25:35,320
It's okay. I have one at home.

2773
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,160
- A waffle maker?
- Yes.

2774
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,880
- Then please give me one.
- Okay. Give me another one.

2775
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,220
- What was that?
- Hey.

2776
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:41,500
- Why are you...
- Hold on.

2777
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:42,900
- She offered it.
- Why are you taking a present?

2778
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,920
Why are you taking a present?

2779
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,370
- It's 300 dollars.
- Is it 300 dollars?

2780
01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:47,570
It's less than 200 dollars.

2781
01:25:47,570 --> 01:25:49,130
I will give you 30 dollars as a tip.

2782
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:50,170
(She uses up the prize money
in a heartwarming way.)

2783
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:51,540
She used the money in a cool way.

2784
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:54,040
Se Chan, what will you purchase?

2785
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,130
- Everyone is exempt.
- Coach Pak used the money for us.

2786
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:57,150
What will you do?

2787
01:25:57,150 --> 01:25:59,040
Can I purchase
the penalty ticket for Coach Pak?

2788
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,210
Hey.

2789
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:01,920
Can I purchase
the penalty ticket for Coach Pak?

2790
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:04,990
I can purchase it
because I have 500 dollars.

2791
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:06,510
I have exactly 500 dollars.

2792
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:08,210
Give me back the money.

2793
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:09,250
That transaction is over.

2794
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:10,830
- Give it to me. It isn't over.
- It's over.

2795
01:26:10,830 --> 01:26:12,290
I will pay up.

2796
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:13,750
- Are you a thug?
- Penalty ticket for Coach Pak.

2797
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:14,960
Are you a thug?

2798
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:16,200
Are you a thug?

2799
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:19,530
Se Ri, you visited the show.

2800
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:22,070
- Coach Pak will take the penalty.
- That's right.

2801
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:24,430
- She is cool.
- She is cool indeed.

2802
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:26,170
She gave us everything.

2803
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:27,970
It's quite original.

2804
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:29,170
"Are you a thug?"

2805
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:34,040
In that case, Se Chan and Se Ri...

2806
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:36,170
- will receive the penalty.
- Okay.

2807
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:37,210
Here is the penalty.

2808
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,120
We put a lot of work
into this golf course,

2809
01:26:40,290 --> 01:26:42,320
so please have another match
before you go home.

2810
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,860
(Have another match before you go home.)

2811
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:47,050
It's an honor for me.

2812
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:49,090
When else would I play golf
with the national hero,

2813
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,620
Se Ri?

2814
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:51,670
That's so funny.

2815
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:54,040
The generous woman, Coach Pak Se Ri.

2816
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:56,070
Thank you so much.

2817
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:57,740
She is really generous.

2818
01:26:58,170 --> 01:26:59,540
I won't let you off.

2819
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,410
- We should have another round.
- Yes.

2820
01:27:01,410 --> 01:27:02,670
Let's have another round.

2821
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:07,000
(It's a perfect day to gamble.)

2822
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,280
(Card Shark Association is back...)

2823
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,340
(for a higher play.)

2824
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:12,540
(We have enough people to win money.)

2825
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:13,790
(Now we need people to lose money.)

2826
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:16,050
(Pushover Joo is back.)

2827
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:18,720
(They need some
under-the-table negotiations.)

2828
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:21,550
(Psychological warfare is optional.)

2829
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:23,160
(You can't trust anyone!)

2830
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,920
(There's no winner or pushover
in the world of variety shows.)

2831
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:27,540
(You try to seize a chance of victory,)

2832
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:30,240
(but you might end up
becoming a pushover.)

2833
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:33,430
(You can't become a card shark
without risking your life.)

2834
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,500
Together?

2835
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,740
I'll definitely go.

2836
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:36,780
(Flustered)

2837
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:40,870
(Who will win this round
and make a fortune?)

2838
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:42,040
(Chairperson Ha)

2839
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,450
(Corporal Kook, Yoo Gook Jin)

2840
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:45,180
(Jjabkku, Ppikku)

2841
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:46,840
(And Pushover Joo)

2842
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:50,120
(Card Shark Association,
Through the Card Sharks' Minds)
