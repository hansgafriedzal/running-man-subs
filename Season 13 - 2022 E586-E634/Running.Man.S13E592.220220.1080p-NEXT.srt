1
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,630
Somewhere in Korea.

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,260
(A night in Korea when everyone is asleep)

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,730
There's a lonely place...

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,800
that's off the beaten track.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,230
Do you remember
the Card Shark Association there?

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,280
Asura balbalta.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,310
(One summer day in 2020)

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,370
Two years ago,

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,170
card sharks from
all over the country gathered...

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,940
and founded the Card Shark Association.

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,120
We have rules here.

12
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,190
It feels like...

13
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,350
(That's how
the Card Shark Association was founded.)

14
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,390
(The 1st chairperson Ji Suk Jin)

15
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,130
The first chairperson
of the association was Old Man Ji.

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,100
Yoo Jae Suk.

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,930
(The 2nd chairperson Yoo Jae Suk)

18
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,640
The second chairperson
of the Card Shark Association...

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,810
was Yoo Jae Suk.

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,780
(I'm nothing like the former chairperson.)

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,610
(The 2nd chairperson showed
his true colors seeking to make changes.)

22
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,520
(I need to collect the membership fees.)

23
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,920
(He exploited the members
and embezzled their money.)

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,810
But since he came to power,
the Card Shark Association...

25
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,290
has gone down a path of destruction.

26
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,290
And during the New Year's party in 2021,

27
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,070
Chairperson Yoo ended up getting impeached.

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,040
Kim Jong Kook who used to be a thug
was elected the new chairperson.

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,340
(He led the association
with his leadership of trust and revenge.)

30
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,600
But shortly thereafter,

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,650
he handed over his position to Haha.

32
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,790
(The 4th chairperson Haha)

33
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,560
(Chairperson Ha got to lead
the association with his leadership.)

34
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,620
And a year after that...

35
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,990
(A day in January, 2022)

36
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,030
(The association found a new hideout
with the R money they had saved.)

37
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,460
My day has finally come.

38
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,540
The symbol of greed,
Chairperson Ha is holding...

39
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,900
the third regular meeting.

40
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,900
(The 4th chairperson Haha, 168cm)

41
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,710
(The card sharks are gathering around.)

42
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,620
- Is this someone's house?
- What is this?

43
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,680
I think I've been here before.

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,450
Hey, guys.

45
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,920
- You will be searched first.
- All right.

46
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,260
- Search?
- Yes.

47
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,890
Well... You don't seem to know who I am.

48
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,360
You're just a weak man.

49
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,940
You're nothing.
Why are you pretending to be tough?

50
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,730
- What? Are you having a gig?
- No.

51
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,700
- I'm Aekku.
- All right.

52
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,700
(A gypsy is here to give a performance.)

53
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,540
- I don't have anything strange.
- You may go in.

54
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,950
All I've got is my fists.

55
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,220
- All right.
- Nice to meet you.

56
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,420
- Have you been doing well?
- Yes.

57
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,450
Oh, dear.

58
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,420
So we're here again.

59
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,660
You'd better be punctual.

60
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,000
(The members of the association
are meeting again in a year.)

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,420
I don't think
we need to introduce each other.

62
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,100
You're here, weasel.

63
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,390
- What's this?
- Gosh. Hang on.

64
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,200
- How dare you...
- What's all this?

65
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,640
- Can't you see this?
- What on earth?

66
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,800
- What is a beggar doing here?
- What?

67
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,230
A beggar?

68
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,010
I'm Ryoo Seung Bum
from "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks."

69
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,220
- "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks?"
- Ryoo Seung Bum?

70
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,140
- I'm Aekku.
- Hey.

71
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,920
Aren't you a primitive man?

72
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,250
- This is...
- Where's your hair?

73
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,820
What's with you?

74
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,260
Hey, you've been...

75
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,290
- You've been trying really hard.
- Gosh.

76
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,520
Is this because
you're afraid of Jong Kook?

77
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,100
- Are you afraid he might nag you?
- Are you satisfied now?

78
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,390
Your costume is just too much.

79
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,100
Let's sit. By the way,
why are you the chairperson?

80
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,830
Is he the chairperson?

81
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,570
He was the last chairperson back then.

82
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,570
- When?
- I see.

83
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,140
Kwang Soo and you lost the race.

84
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,330
Who's Kwang Soo?

85
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,450
He's in jail now.

86
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,770
Is he in jail?

87
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,540
(Lee Kwang Soo is arrested.)

88
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,510
(Long Legs was put behind bars
because of his habit of stealing.)

89
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,920
Your hair has grown a lot.

90
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,580
I know. My hair has grown long.

91
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,050
I have a new character now. I'm Aekku.

92
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,260
Gosh, this is...

93
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,200
You look like a deep-sea fish.

94
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,520
Did you say a deep-sea fish?

95
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,730
A deep-sea fish?

96
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,920
You look a lot like a deep-sea fish.

97
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,390
I'm Ryoo Seung Bum.

98
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,390
(While the lowers are
fighting a war of nerves...)

99
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,540
(A card shark who looks like a thug
shows up with a swaggering gait.)

100
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,140
The half-thug is here.

101
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,770
It's been a while, Mr. Half-thug.

102
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,140
Can't you come on time?

103
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,140
Who's talking over there?

104
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,880
Someone just told me to come on time.

105
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,220
- My gosh.
- What?

106
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,510
Someone just told me to come on time.

107
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,550
(A mysterious rocker shows up.)

108
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,120
- My gosh.
- What?

109
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,510
You are...

110
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,990
This isn't just right. My gosh.

111
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,130
What?

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
- This isn't just right.
- Suk Jin, this is...

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,520
- I'm Aekku.
- No, I'm Aekku.

114
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,000
You're Ppikku.

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,160
- Oh, dear.
- What's wrong?

116
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,660
- Aren't you a rocker?
- Right.

117
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,940
Park Wan Kyu.

118
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,330
This is Aekku. I'm Ryoo Seung Bum.

119
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,610
No, I'm Aekku.

120
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,610
You're just a rocker.

121
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,380
Give me an honest opinion.

122
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,610
- This is just...
- This is too much.

123
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,070
a rocker who is past his prime.

124
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,180
Now he just...

125
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,620
- He runs an LP bar as a diversion.
- Exactly.

126
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,910
He plays some music.

127
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,210
He runs a rock cafe in Misari.

128
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,510
That's not true.

129
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,520
This is Lee Yoon Seok from Hurricane Blue.

130
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,820
- This isn't right.
- Hey.

131
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,560
So have you been doing it lately?

132
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,800
- What's this?
- What do you mean?

133
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,390
What is he doing?

134
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,570
What do you mean?

135
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,800
Have you been flipping over
some cards lately?

136
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,510
Are you two from the same family?

137
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,510
Anyway, let's do this.

138
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,810
- Let's work together.
- All right.

139
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,450
He does look like
a business owner in Misari.

140
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,380
Are you a cop or something?

141
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,250
- He acts like a cop.
- You're like that every time.

142
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,710
- It's not like that.
- You are terrifying us.

143
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,010
- What?
- Let's have a seat.

144
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,410
- Your hair...
- Jong Kook, he's trying hard today.

145
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,890
I see. What did you do with this?

146
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,130
- Let's just sit.
- What's with your hair?

147
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,390
- Hey!
- What's that?

148
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,390
- What's this?
- What's with your hair?

149
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,720
What are you supposed to be?

150
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,090
He doesn't want you to nag him.

151
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,740
So what is this?

152
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,940
- My gosh.
- He wants you to notice.

153
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,010
He wants your praise.

154
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,260
He tried harder than when he was
on "How Do You Play?"

155
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,640
I bet he will look like this
when he's old.

156
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,110
- Right?
- I think so.

157
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,510
- This is how he will age.
- Stay quiet.

158
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,970
What are you doing?

159
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,640
- Hey.
- Haha is losing his hair anyway.

160
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,250
- This is your future.
- I draw some hair on my forehead.

161
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,710
Anyway, listen to me.

162
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,280
Have you been doing well?

163
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,710
- Not really.
- The thing is...

164
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,280
- Now...
- You sound so awkward.

165
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,930
We are meeting again in a year.

166
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,220
- It's been a year, right?
- Has it been a year already?

167
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,760
Did you get a script or something?

168
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,260
- Yes.
- What's going on?

169
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,930
- I'm trying my best.
- He's doing some skit.

170
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,090
Two of our members...

171
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,530
They got killed?

172
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,610
- They went to prison.
- What?

173
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,010
(They went to prison.)

174
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,900
- Are you serious?
- They are not in prison.

175
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,250
They are staying at home.

176
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,610
- They're home.
- They are in self-quarantine.

177
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,970
- They're in quarantine anyway.
- I warned them.

178
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,280
They're gone. He's right.

179
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,210
- Anyway, I'm glad you've survived.
- Okay.

180
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,450
Today, we will have
our last gamble and leave.

181
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,890
Are we a team?

182
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,390
Today, I brought a guy
who's known to be a pushover.

183
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,500
A pushover?

184
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,590
- A pushover?
- Good. We need a pushover.

185
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,430
My gosh.

186
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,440
We should extort money from him.

187
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,460
Suk Jin, this isn't a historical drama.

188
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,570
That sounds like a historical drama.

189
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,510
- You and I look like...
- He's so bad at things like this.

190
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,610
- You and I should work together.
- When he was younger,

191
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,510
he was often scolded
by his senior comedians.

192
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,810
The pushover is coming.
You have to do things right.

193
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,900
- Okay.
- Who is it?

194
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,010
I'll pretend to be innocent.

195
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,510
(He looks just like a pushover
with a lanky frame.)

196
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,710
I bet he's quite tall.

197
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,390
- It's Joo Woo Jae.
- That's him.

198
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,430
(The symbol of pushover, Joo Woo Jae)

199
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,300
(The card sharks are excited
to see the pushover.)

200
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,520
It's Joo Woo Jae. My gosh.

201
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,200
- You look so ugly today.
- My gosh.

202
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,320
(A surprise attack)

203
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,030
He looks like a loser.

204
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,460
What's with you? You look horrible.

205
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,460
He's Lee Yoon Seok.

206
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,510
You look so ugly today.

207
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,970
- You look terrible today.
- Are you wearing long underwear?

208
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,140
You look like a farmer
from the countryside.

209
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,700
I'm sure he's wearing long underwear.

210
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,570
Hey, Woo Jae.

211
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,210
Isn't it supposed to be a skit?

212
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,690
Why are they doing this?

213
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,120
Go ahead and do it.

214
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,360
- What?
- Are you Earwax or what?

215
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,860
I'm Hearing Aid from Gangnam.

216
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,220
Aren't you Earwax?

217
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,990
- What kind of name is that?
- Hearing Aid from Gangnam?

218
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,650
Isn't that the name I had the other day?

219
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,950
You're not wearing the padded shorts.

220
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,460
(You're not wearing the padded shorts.)

221
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,960
- What?
- Does he wear padded shorts?

222
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,030
- He has flat buttocks.
- I was surprised to see that.

223
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,260
- They are worse than Kwang Soo's.
- They are totally flat.

224
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,570
He's got no buttocks.

225
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,810
They are like silken tofu.

226
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,900
Silken tofu. They are so soft.

227
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,470
- What is going on?
- Totally.

228
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,250
- As soon as you show up...
- I mean...

229
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,140
- Let's have a seat.
- All right.

230
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,620
He's our new member.

231
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,680
- Okay.
- What?

232
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,050
His name is Lee Yoon Seok.

233
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,080
Yoon Seok.

234
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,450
How could you say something so harsh?

235
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,650
- Let's see.
- Woo Jae is here.

236
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,820
Is he the pushover?

237
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,760
He's known to be a card shark.

238
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,500
A card shark? Is he?

239
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,760
I'm worried about Woo Jae's health.

240
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,020
- Aren't you ill?
- I'm healthy.

241
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,140
Are you sure?

242
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,940
- There he goes again.
- Did you have a medical checkup?

243
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,970
- I didn't.
- You should have one.

244
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,140
You should do that.

245
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,670
- I'm sure you have some polyps.
- I think so.

246
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,350
What? Polyp?

247
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,140
- Is he that old?
- I'm sure he has one.

248
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,140
I think so.

249
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,250
- I'm sure he has one.
- He needs to have it removed.

250
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,910
- You should get it removed.
- Well...

251
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,990
- I have a headache.
- You should also take anthelmintic.

252
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,440
Do you take anthelmintic or not?

253
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,680
- I do.
- You do?

254
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,910
You should take anthelmintic.

255
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,960
You have straight intestines.

256
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,020
Anything you eat comes out right away.

257
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,520
- I often have diarrhea.
- I knew it.

258
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,520
- That's why he's so skinny.
- Stay quiet.

259
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,520
- Let me take your pulse.
- Hey.

260
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,420
I bet he's healthier than you.

261
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,420
(The chairperson worries about him
with a jaundiced face.)

262
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,390
- I suffer from cold hands and feet.
- You do?

263
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,510
I also have reflux esophagitis.

264
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,610
(The triple crown of weakling:
Diarrhea, cold hands, esophagitis)

265
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,480
- You don't have a serious illness.
- That's good.

266
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,980
I'm sorry, but it seems like...

267
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,610
you don't have a body.
You look like a clothes hanger.

268
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,880
- This is like a clothes hanger.
- He's all skin and bone.

269
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,940
Do you want me to flex my muscles?

270
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,850
(He sounds quite confident
for his weak body.)

271
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:22,850
Flex my muscles?

272
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,220
- He thinks highly of himself.
- Right.

273
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,720
What makes you so confident?

274
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,910
- Because...
- Because of you,

275
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,260
people call me Round Shoulders.

276
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,360
My shoulders...

277
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,470
- My shoulders are my everything.
- Are you serious?

278
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,920
Your shoulders are covered with dust here.

279
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,530
- Hey, stop that.
- Get him a duster or something.

280
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,930
That's enough.

281
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,110
- You're covered with dust.
- My gosh.

282
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,530
Look at him.

283
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,880
- You look as if...
- I knew it.

284
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,710
You look like a guy
who eats meat in the mountains.

285
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,980
- He's a primitive man.
- The man of nature.

286
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,250
- You're embarrassing me.
- Do you run a YouTube channel?

287
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,280
- Seriously, who are you?
- That's how you look.

288
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,990
- I'm Ryoo Seung Bum.
- My gosh.

289
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,680
I look like Ryoo Seung Bum.
I look like Aekku.

290
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,180
You are from the movie,
"War for the Planet of the Apes."

291
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,230
(You are from the movie,
"War for the Planet of the Apes".)

292
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,330
(An ape from
"War for the Planet of the Apes")

293
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,860
- My gosh. He's...
- An ape?

294
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,420
- You are...
- He's just...

295
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,260
- What about you?
- You are...

296
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,330
an ape from
"War for the Planet of the Apes."

297
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,330
"War for the Planet of the Apes"?

298
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,500
They both look scary.

299
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,390
Okay. I'm glad to hear that.

300
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,800
You look really strange.

301
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,300
So this is the regular meeting
of the Card Shark Association.

302
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,770
With our new member, Pushover Joo,

303
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,350
you will have a race called
Through the Card Sharks' Minds.

304
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,750
- You start with 20 caramels.
- We get 20 caramels.

305
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,350
As always, you will earn
more caramels after each mission.

306
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,680
And the two winners with
the most caramels will get the prize.

307
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,150
And one member chosen
by the winner will get a penalty.

308
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,280
The winner gets to pick one.

309
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,790
I should win favor with the winner then.

310
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,760
The current chairperson
of the association...

311
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,100
is Haha as he was elected last year.

312
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,060
The chairperson has the power
just like he did last time.

313
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,060
But he is given more power
that's upgraded today.

314
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,140
What is it?

315
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,530
On each mission,
he can reset one round of a game...

316
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,350
whenever he wants.

317
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,120
- The chairperson?
- He can reset the results.

318
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,670
- Reset.
- He can nullify the results.

319
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,390
He just goes all in.

320
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,180
- And if he loses, he can reset it.
- What if I lose?

321
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,780
Then the game will go
back to the previous round.

322
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,920
- That's huge.
- That's amazing.

323
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,890
- Go all in? Okay?
- That's a huge power.

324
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,000
If the members don't like the chairperson,

325
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,730
they can collect 20 caramels
in the proposal box...

326
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,560
to have the chairperson impeached.

327
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,430
And one of the members who
turned in caramels will be elected.

328
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,430
- Good.
- Okay.

329
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,300
Now I will give you 20 caramels each.

330
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,770
Okay. You know I'm a pacifist.

331
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,580
- Good, Woo Jae.
- Nice, Woo Jae.

332
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,540
- You should do things like this.
- Sure.

333
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,440
- He's good.
- He's good at this.

334
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,090
Jae Suk, are you eating it?

335
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,260
Of course.

336
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,150
Are you a thug or what?

337
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,730
- What are you trying to pull off?
- He's got guts.

338
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,760
Are you eating it?

339
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,050
- This is...
- My goodness.

340
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,860
You are unbelievable.

341
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,470
Once 20 caramels are collected,
there will be a new chairperson.

342
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,640
(A surprise attack)

343
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,660
This is...

344
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,340
- What's going on?
- Can he do this?

345
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,510
- Is it okay to do this?
- What is he doing?

346
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,540
- Is he a mugger or what?
- Can he do this?

347
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,210
Is it okay to do this?

348
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,170
Is this really okay?

349
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,910
- This is just...
- Can he do this?

350
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,120
- Hey!
- Give me half of them.

351
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,810
(He takes the whole bag
of Suk Jin's caramels.)

352
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,550
- Hey.
- Here.

353
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,550
Guess which one is yours.

354
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,960
(Guess which one is yours.)

355
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,360
(He starts swindling
caramels out of Suk Jin.)

356
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,520
(Headache)

357
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,660
It's 19 caramels.

358
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,730
One bag has 19 caramels in it.

359
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,340
And the other has 20.

360
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,740
- It's so confusing.
- All right.

361
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,430
What do you think?

362
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,800
He's really good.

363
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,670
If you want to survive in this world,

364
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,980
you must have some guts.

365
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,800
It's not easy to survive in this world.

366
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,350
But I'm a card shark.

367
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,580
I can pick out the good one.

368
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,310
With my deduction.

369
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,410
(Ppikku's Find My Caramels)

370
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,260
I bet mine is all wrinkly.

371
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,120
Because he rubbed it a lot.

372
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,390
(Rubbing fiercely)

373
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,860
(Ppikku's deduction is meaningless.)

374
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,500
I don't know what to pick.

375
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,970
Suk Jin, you're not supposed
to say that out loud. He heard you.

376
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,240
I was talking to myself.

377
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,100
(His plan is revealed to the whole world.)

378
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,260
Seriously, Ppikku is tender-hearted.

379
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,140
If I were him, I would've gotten mad.

380
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,210
If I were him,

381
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,440
- I would've poked him in the ribs.
- I just like a moment of choice.

382
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,940
That's what I do.

383
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,440
I love it when I'm supposed
to make a choice.

384
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,720
- Choose one.
- Make a choice.

385
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,180
(Which bag does Ppikku choose
with his gambling instinct?)

386
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,850
- What's your choice?
- Which one is it?

387
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,760
I'll go with this.

388
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,890
Okay.

389
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,360
- He hands it over right away.
- No.

390
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,520
(Did he manage to pick
the bag with 20 caramels?)

391
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,690
Two, four, six, eight, ten

392
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,660
Two, four, six, eight

393
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,740
Why does it have only 18 caramels?

394
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,190
(Why does it have only 18 caramels?)

395
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,510
(2 caramels are missing.)

396
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,660
Isn't it supposed to have 19 caramels?

397
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,670
- I don't know.
- Hang on.

398
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,580
It should have 19 caramels.

399
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,940
It has 18 caramels.
Two, four, six, eight, ten

400
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,510
Two, four, six...

401
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,350
Two, four, six, eight, ten

402
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,220
Two, four, six, eight

403
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,990
- You're good at counting numbers.
- They are 19.

404
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,360
A YouTuber who counts numbers.

405
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,890
Two, four, six...

406
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,000
It tastes so good.

407
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,420
Two, four, six...

408
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,630
So our Ppikku is back.

409
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,000
He's finally back.

410
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,160
I'm Aekku.

411
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,740
- It's okay. It's just one caramel.
- It tastes so good.

412
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,400
- Let's start the first mission.
- Okay.

413
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,430
- Okay.
- Okay.

414
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,610
It's hilarious.

415
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,980
(The first mission with the card sharks)

416
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,480
Come on up.

417
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,440
(The place for the first mission
has cards and a green blanket.)

418
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,480
From the beginning...

419
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,990
- My gosh. This is...
- Oh, dear.

420
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,540
Are we dealing the cards
from the beginning?

421
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,650
- Okay.
- Don't you dare pull tricks.

422
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,360
My blood is boiling.

423
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,020
- Good.
- Okay.

424
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,390
- Today...
- Today, you might lose your hand.

425
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,390
- Be careful.
- I'll get to deal the cards today.

426
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,520
The table has gotten so small.

427
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,600
(Sitting awkwardly)

428
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,640
The stool is too low.

429
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,340
And I'm facing the front.

430
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,640
- Hey.
- Why?

431
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,610
You have nothing to hide.
What's the problem?

432
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,350
- What did you say?
- What are you trying to hide?

433
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,850
You have nothing to cover.

434
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,410
No one finds it strange.

435
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,140
- You have nothing to cover up.
- Just stay confident.

436
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,350
- I do have something to hide.
- Why do you think you're there?

437
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,960
I have a lot to hide.

438
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,220
Hey, you should do this.

439
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,460
It's not like that.

440
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,680
He's known to have nothing.

441
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,860
He's got nothing to hide.

442
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,600
That's why you two are sitting there.

443
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,290
Two guys covered with dust.

444
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,560
- I can't believe this.
- Those with flat things.

445
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,100
You weaklings.

446
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,030
- You are so feeble.
- Those with flat things.

447
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,900
This is the first mission
for the Card Shark Association.

448
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,610
The proposal box is always open.

449
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,140
- Once 20 caramels are collected,
- Really?

450
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,850
One of the members who turned in
the caramels will be elected.

451
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,680
I didn't do anything wrong though.

452
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,850
- You'll see. Just wait.
- The chairperson gets...

453
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,220
to reset the game.

454
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,360
(The chairperson has a huge power
to reset the results of a game.)

455
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,460
(How long will
Chairperson Ha's time continue?)

456
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,230
This will be fun. What do we do?

457
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,230
For this mission,

458
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,560
you will need good strategies
as well as good luck.

459
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,900
It's called Asura Balbalta,
Do You Want More Caramels?

460
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,010
- I see.
- Asura Balbalta.

461
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,510
I guess we get to pick things randomly.

462
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,040
Each member gets...

463
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,220
cards that say 30, 20, 10,

464
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,940
- plus 1, minus 10, and minus 20.
- Okay.

465
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:08,090
You will hand out the cards
to the members.

466
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,630
I know what it is. It's random.

467
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,630
It's not like you just hand out the cards.

468
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,290
You just put the cards face down
in front of the members you want.

469
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,330
Once you're done distributing the cards,

470
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,060
the six of you will play
Card Game of Wits.

471
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,580
You're supposed to stand up
and shout someone else's name.

472
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,670
(They should stand up
and shout someone else's name.)

473
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,840
- Ha Dong Hoon.
- Yang Se Chan.

474
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,010
Just like that.

475
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,620
But you can't call the same name.

476
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,850
- The same name?
- Yes.

477
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,280
If someone fails,

478
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,540
he should turn in caramels.

479
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,680
If you manage to shout a name,

480
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,920
you will pick one of the cards
that the person you called has...

481
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,330
and get the caramels accordingly.

482
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,420
(If they succeed, they get a card
from the one whose name was called.)

483
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,460
Okay?

484
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,000
If you gave good cards to someone,

485
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,340
you would want to call his name,
so you could get a good card.

486
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,340
- For a higher winning rate.
- I see.

487
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,260
- Isn't that obvious?
- It's a battle of wits.

488
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,530
- We'd need good strategies.
- It will be on my face.

489
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,440
- All right.
- I'll just do it randomly.

490
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,170
Please go ahead and distribute the cards.

491
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,580
All right.

492
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,850
I'll just do this.

493
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,350
I'll hand them out randomly.

494
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,290
I'll do that too. I think that's better.

495
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,480
Knowing the cards wouldn't help.

496
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,420
- You can have better chances.
- If I know positive numbers,

497
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,360
I'm more likely to win.

498
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,950
But other members will
try to pick the cards as well.

499
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,450
That's right.

500
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,160
So I should call the name first.

501
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,960
- Just do as you want.
- We don't know that.

502
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,810
Since when did we use our brains?

503
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,230
(The old men don't
like to use their brains.)

504
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,000
In math, there are
probability and statistics.

505
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,880
They can be very helpful.

506
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,900
- Listen, Woo Jae.
- Yes?

507
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,200
There's no one here who knows...

508
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,080
- what that even means.
- We just go with our guts.

509
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,910
- I can just see through you.
- Hey.

510
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,180
- I've been doing this for years.
- You'll see.

511
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,910
- We just go with our guts.
- Exactly.

512
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,560
- I'll show you how important it is.
- All right. We'll see.

513
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,980
- Just go with your guts.
- I'll see my cards.

514
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,130
- I'm looking at my cards right now.
- I caught so many that way.

515
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,360
- I'm looking at my cards.
- We don't need that method.

516
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,650
He's acting up
just because he majored in...

517
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,360
- engineering, but we'll see.
- Exactly.

518
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,690
- See how we win in our way.
- This is just the beginning.

519
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,540
I'll show you how I win
by following my hunches.

520
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,460
- Math never betrays me.
- Hey.

521
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,570
- Hey.
- You're wrong.

522
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,610
- I believe in math.
- Math will stab you in the back.

523
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,670
- Right.
- I'm sure of it.

524
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,430
- I used to hate math the most.
- My math score...

525
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,700
My math score on the CSAT...

526
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,940
- was 4 out of 100 points.
- I just slept through the exam.

527
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,440
- Did you hear me?
- I just slept.

528
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,140
- All right.
- That's so funny.

529
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,320
- Here.
- I'll give the cards randomly.

530
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,750
- Se Chan, what's your problem?
- Did you see how I threw the cards?

531
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,950
You might lose your hand.

532
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,950
- Jong Kook, did you see your cards?
- Okay.

533
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,950
Don't you dare try to pull a trick.

534
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,950
Asura balbalta.

535
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,950
Are you trying to pull a trick?

536
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,770
- Do you want to be rich?
- Here you go, Woo Jae.

537
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,690
- That's for Suk Jin.
- This is such a simple game.

538
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,960
- How many cards should each have?
- Here.

539
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,040
You saw me how I distributed
the cards, right?

540
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,660
Here. Jong Kook, here's one for you.

541
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,310
- Jong Kook, did you see your cards?
- Okay.

542
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,540
You gave Jae Suk half of your cards?

543
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,900
Here you go.

544
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,940
- Why did you give me so many cards?
- Gosh.

545
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,940
- Pardon?
- That's not how you should play.

546
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,470
- You shouldn't do that. How many...
- You shouldn't.

547
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,550
- should each of us have?
- I picked the cards to give him.

548
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,740
Woo Jae, this is for you.

549
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,020
You didn't see your cards, right?
I gave out my cards randomly too.

550
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,090
- Me too.
- All right.

551
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,360
It's similar.

552
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,420
If more than one person shouts
at the same time...

553
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,720
he loses three caramels,
and so does the last person remaining.

554
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,130
- The last person remaining?
- Gosh, that's harsh.

555
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,630
- Okay.
- Let us begin.

556
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,190
It begins when I blow the whistle.

557
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,690
- I'll go first.
- I'll do the same.

558
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,900
- Here we go.
- I'll stand up right away.

559
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,730
- Woo Jae.
- Jae Suk.

560
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,780
Okay.

561
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,310
- Woo Jae.
- Jae Suk.

562
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,780
(Haha and Woo Jae will lose 3 caramels.)

563
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,140
- Nice.
- Hand in your caramels.

564
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,140
- Okay.
- Don't you know...

565
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,020
- that you can win if you wait?
- They shouted at the same time.

566
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,940
I'll go first no matter what.

567
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,090
I should be careful.

568
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,150
- Okay.
- I'll go first.

569
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,090
I'll go first this time
because I don't think he can.

570
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,980
- I'll go first. I'll do it.
- So will I. Go ahead.

571
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,390
- I'll show you. I'll go first.
- I'll do the same.

572
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,060
I'm the chairperson. Just remember that.

573
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,420
- I don't care.
- I'll go third.

574
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,650
- Here we go.
- I'll go first no matter what.

575
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,430
Suk Jin.

576
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,270
- Se Chan.
- Jae Suk.

577
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,640
- Haha.
- Jae Suk.

578
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,770
- Jong Kook.
- He said Jae Suk's name.

579
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,200
(Two of them shouted Jae Suk's name.)

580
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,730
(Jong Kook who shouted Jae Suk's name
again will lose 3 caramels.)

581
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,280
- What?
- Woo Jae shouted his name already.

582
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,670
- He shouted his name already.
- Oh, I see.

583
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,820
- Is that against the rules?
- All right.

584
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,020
(Card sharks always pretend
they don't know the rules.)

585
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,350
- Doesn't only the timing matter?
- No.

586
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,180
- You shouldn't pick the same name.
- All right.

587
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,620
- I really didn't know that.
- All right.

588
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,360
The four of you who won can take
a card from the person you picked.

589
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,450
- Okay.
- I picked Suk Jin.

590
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,530
I picked Haha.

591
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,560
- Jae Suk.
- I shouted your name.

592
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,950
- This is great.
- Gosh.

593
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,060
- Asura balbalta.
- Se Chan...

594
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,330
- Did you pick him?
- Yes.

595
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,720
(The old card sharks who have
no strategy get their 1st cards.)

596
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,890
- Asura balbalta.
- Se Chan...

597
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,160
- Se Chan...
- That's not allowed.

598
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,340
- Se Chan... Gosh, seriously.
- What is it?

599
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,730
- I took a card from Se Chan.
- I didn't know that.

600
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,340
- Gosh, seriously.
- What is it?

601
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,500
Minus 20.

602
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,810
Asura balbalta.

603
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,900
(He picked the worst card
from the beginning.)

604
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,200
- I'll pick one of Haha's cards.
- Okay.

605
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,320
(Next up is the primitive card shark.)

606
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,620
- Asura balbalta.
- I wish I'd picked a better card.

607
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,290
- What? Minus 10? Gosh.
- Minus 10.

608
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,360
Okay.

609
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,180
(Se Chan will lose 10 caramels.)

610
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,790
- Great.
- Gosh.

611
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,030
This explains why probability is
important in this game.

612
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,100
Whichever card I pick here,
I will win caramels. Watch me.

613
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,660
- Really? Let's see.
- I'll just pick one randomly.

614
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,720
Go ahead.

615
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,290
- You're all that.
- As I said, math always wins.

616
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,710
We must win this.

617
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,940
(This is the normal way
to play this game.)

618
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,880
- We can't let him win.
- We can beat him.

619
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,800
- Please pick a minus card.
- We will never let him win.

620
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,210
(Following Woo Jae, Haha will pick
1 of the cards Suk Jin has.)

621
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,950
Oh, that's a plus card.

622
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,810
- Oh, that's a plus card.
- No, it's a minus card.

623
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,340
Asura balbalta.

624
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,810
Plus one.

625
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,280
Asura balbalta.

626
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,350
(Haha picked a plus 1 card.)

627
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,390
He looks happy.

628
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,250
I must say, he never wins big.

629
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,250
(He seemed confident,
but he won only 1 caramel.)

630
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,970
- Why did you throw it on the floor?
- That was unexpected.

631
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:33,970
What was that?

632
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,230
- Haha.
- Gosh.

633
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,290
- This is so you.
- You...

634
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,700
- You're so adorable.
- Indeed.

635
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,400
- It's so little.
- That was funny.

636
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,970
(The bald chairperson is adorable.)

637
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,270
It's a shame. Okay.

638
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,770
It's so little.

639
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,880
(Only Woo Jae who gave Jae Suk
all the plus cards won big.)

640
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,270
- He gave me...
- Let's begin.

641
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,840
- many good cards.
- I'll go first this time.

642
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,540
- I will. I have nothing to lose.
- I'll go first.

643
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,040
- I'm serious. You know me, right?
- Remember that I'm the chairperson.

644
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,620
We must not let him go first.

645
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,690
I'll go first.

646
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,960
Guys, let me go first this time.

647
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,250
- I'll go 1st.
- Let me be the 1st.

648
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,660
- Let me go first just this once.
- I have no choice.

649
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,630
- Haha, will you go first?
- Yes.

650
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,200
I'll give you 1 caramel
if you let me go 1st.

651
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,320
- Deal.
- Okay.

652
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,560
Suk Jin, I'll go first too.
Give me a caramel too.

653
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,030
Or else, I'll go first. I'm serious.

654
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,990
- You weren't going to go first.
- I'll really stand up.

655
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,100
Go ahead then. I'll get up.

656
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,140
- Just give me a caramel.
- Then give me one too.

657
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,440
- Or I'll go first no matter what.
- I'll get up no matter what.

658
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,210
- I'll let you go first.
- If you want to get a plus card...

659
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,180
You see, I can win 20 caramels
if I go 1st, right?

660
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,380
- That'll be awesome.
- Of course.

661
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,120
- I'll let you go first too.
- I'll do the same.

662
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,150
I won't get up if you give me one.

663
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,740
- I won't get up. You can trust me.
- Suk Jin, listen.

664
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,080
- I'm in first place right now.
- Then...

665
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,280
- That doesn't matter.
- Okay.

666
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,750
I'll give each of you a caramel.
So let me go first.

667
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,850
- Sure.
- Okay.

668
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,320
I hope I'll get more than I spent.
Here you go.

669
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,050
- I really want to go first.
- Of course you will.

670
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,170
I'm giving away five caramels in total,

671
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,900
but if I win 20 caramels, I'll be okay.

672
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,290
- Jae Suk, are you eating it?
- My gosh.

673
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,030
Aren't you going to save any?

674
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,240
But I have 20 caramels.

675
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,260
- But...
- Hey.

676
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,530
(The gutsy card shark wastes
his caramels with no plan.)

677
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,680
Hey, you guys won't get up, right?

678
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,000
Okay. I won't go first.

679
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,100
(Ppikku made sure he would be
the 1st to go in the end.)

680
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,180
Let's begin.

681
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,380
Woo Jae.

682
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,420
- Let's see.
- We're ready.

683
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
Woo Jae.

684
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,580
Don't do that. Hey.

685
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,580
Woo Jae.

686
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,280
Woo Jae.

687
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,730
Woo Jae.

688
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,900
- I'm warning you. Seok...
- Woo Jae. I wasn't...

689
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,930
(Se Chan shouted
right after the whistle was blown.)

690
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,730
(Was he shouting his own name?)

691
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,400
- They got up at the same time.
- I wasn't the first one.

692
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,290
- You two got up at the same time.
- Suk Jin said his own name.

693
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,590
- He said his own name.
- You got up too fast.

694
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,910
Suk Jin said his own name.

695
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,760
- You punk. How could you...
- Why?

696
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,000
What is your problem?
Why did you do that? Hey.

697
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,950
- It wasn't my intention.
- That was so mean.

698
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,150
- They got up at the same time.
- Don't you think that was too mean?

699
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,180
That little...

700
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,620
What a jerk.

701
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,650
Why won't you guys criticize him?

702
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,420
By the way, why did you say your own name?

703
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,780
Well, I was taken aback.

704
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,020
I saw him standing up and got flustered.

705
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,850
Darn it. I shouldn't have trusted
those punks.

706
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,660
- Suk Jin.
- I'll go first this time.

707
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,660
- I'll go 2nd.
- I'll go 3rd.

708
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,670
- I said I'd go 1st.
- I'll go 2nd.

709
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,820
- Remember that I'm the chairperson.
- Okay.

710
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,030
- Don't say the same name, okay?
- I'll go first no matter what.

711
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,000
You'll be in trouble if it goes wrong.

712
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,710
- I want to go first this time.
- I'll do it no matter what.

713
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,940
No, I'll go first.

714
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,880
(Jae Suk walks
toward the corner quietly.)

715
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
What is he doing?

716
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,000
He wants to drag me down?

717
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,740
(He put his caramels in the proposal box.)

718
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,120
The chairperson will be replaced.

719
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,450
- All right. Okay.
- Good.

720
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,340
- Really?
- There will be a new chairperson.

721
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,420
- Okay.
- Really?

722
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,460
(20 caramels have been handed in already?)

723
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,580
(Earlier on, while Chairperson Ha
was raising his voice,)

724
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,870
(these 2 card sharks gave each other
signals secretly.)

725
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,240
(They gathered 20 caramels
and handed them in at once.)

726
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,240
- What's going on? Really?
- All right.

727
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,370
Get lost.

728
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,740
- You're not the chairperson. Move!
- Move.

729
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,980
- Move.
- How dare you?

730
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,240
- Come here.
- Give me that.

731
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,680
- Get lost.
- You arrogant punk.

732
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,410
- What's going on?
- Okay. That felt good.

733
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,810
Which of you two is the new chairperson?

734
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,740
- They'll choose one of us.
- We don't know yet.

735
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,780
I knew they were cooking up a scheme.

736
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,810
This is great.

737
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,810
- I didn't see that coming.
- Let's see who will be picked.

738
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,430
(Which of them will be chosen
as the new chairperson by lot?)

739
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,630
- I picked one.
- Okay.

740
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,900
(The chairperson has been chosen.)

741
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,970
Please show us.

742
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,830
- Either of them will be annoying.
- I hate both.

743
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,240
- The new chairperson is...
- Who could that be?

744
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,940
(The new chairperson is...)

745
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,000
- Jae Suk.
- Great.

746
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,100
(Jae Suk has been chosen
as the new chairperson.)

747
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,410
- Chairperson Yoo.
- Chairperson Yoo.

748
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,300
I contributed ten caramels...

749
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,380
to help you.

750
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,740
- Hey.
- Congratulations.

751
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,920
(The notorious former chairperson
is back.)

752
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,450
- Hey, guys.
- Congratulations.

753
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,250
The dictator is back.

754
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,510
All right.

755
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,050
This is for you.

756
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,160
What is this?

757
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,750
- Remember I gave you that.
- Okay.

758
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,320
- I'll put it around your arm.
- Okay.

759
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,670
I don't like having a boss.

760
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,930
Then you shouldn't be here.

761
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,130
- I like having a boss.
- Right.

762
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,170
I like having a boss too.

763
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,170
- I like it so much.
- I like serving a boss.

764
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,380
- Let's officially begin the game.
- Okay.

765
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,380
- Before we begin,
- No way.

766
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,240
- for the newly established...
- Right.

767
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,270
- He won't say that.
- He won't.

768
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,510
- No way.
- It's too soon.

769
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,770
- Let's chip in ten caramels.
- No way.

770
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,040
- Right after he was elected?
- We'd better hand in caramels.

771
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,510
How many do you want?
Rather than giving him three,

772
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,310
- it's better to hand in three.
- Let's gather our caramels.

773
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,990
- Wouldn't that be better?
- Let's gather our caramels.

774
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,690
- Let's gather 20 caramels.
- Will 3 be enough?

775
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,820
- Give me three caramels for now.
- Wait.

776
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,230
- If we contribute three caramels...
- Three... Hold on.

777
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,290
- Woo Jae, what do you say?
- Hey.

778
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,400
We might as well gather our caramels.

779
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,260
- Hey, 3 times 4 equals only 12.
- We're 5 people.

780
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,260
- We'll have 15 caramels.
- Let's do that.

781
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,560
- We can replace him with one more.
- That's right.

782
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,700
- Exactly.
- Why should we give him caramels?

783
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,200
- You can give me just two.
- We have to... No.

784
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,470
Why should we give him our caramels?

785
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,100
- He got scared. He's demanding 2.
- Give me just 2 caramels.

786
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,140
- He got scared. It worked.
- It worked.

787
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,410
- Why don't you forget about it?
- You can demand three.

788
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,410
He got scared.

789
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,650
- One caramel.
- We're not the ones we used to be.

790
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,180
- Or else, we'll replace you.
- One caramel would be reasonable.

791
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,420
- Let's settle it.
- Why should we give him any?

792
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,480
Just receive one.

793
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,650
Three caramels.

794
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,220
- But...
- Let's gather our caramels.

795
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,390
- You can give me only one.
- Let's do this.

796
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,120
(You can give me only 1.)

797
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,460
(Oh, really?)

798
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,850
My gosh.

799
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,490
Let's do it without him.

800
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,630
- Let's do it without him.
- Okay.

801
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,050
- Let's do it without him.
- You can give just one too.

802
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,670
- Just one?
- Give him the caramels, you punk.

803
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,930
- Let's do it without them.
- Okay.

804
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,990
- This is ridiculous. Let's do this.
- Just give him your caramels.

805
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,210
- One, two, three, four, five...
- You two can go ahead and try.

806
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,470
- We'll do it without them.
- Yes, we'll do it.

807
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,710
- Two, four, six...
- One of you can hand in two.

808
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,910
- Here you go.
- Me.

809
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,540
(They handed in caramels right away.)

810
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,450
(Ppikku ran to the chairperson
to pay the tax.)

811
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,240
Come on. I want the deduction too.

812
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,190
- Look at me.
- You should hand in four caramels.

813
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,620
- Hand in four caramels.
- I'll give you caramels.

814
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,890
- You should give me four caramels.
- Come on.

815
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,190
- Give me four caramels.
- You have no choice.

816
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,190
- Four.
- Okay. Give me just three.

817
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,780
I was upset since you demanded
caramels right away.

818
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,280
- Just hand in the caramels.
- Won't you see me again?

819
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,320
- Just give me your caramels.
- I'm happy although I gave him two.

820
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,730
- Three?
- I'll give you two.

821
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,130
- Three.
- Okay. Give me two for now.

822
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,200
Here you go.

823
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,240
- You should be careful.
- Gosh. He's really something.

824
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,090
- I'm at your service.
- Good.

825
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,440
- Now, Chairperson Yoo, let's begin.
- Let's begin.

826
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
Okay.

827
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,300
Okay!

828
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,100
(Haha got lucky
and picked a plus-30 card.)

829
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,380
This is awesome.

830
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,420
Okay. I'll reset this round.

831
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,310
- What? Hold on.
- Why?

832
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,040
- Okay. That's good.
- Okay.

833
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,160
- Okay.
- Give me back the card.

834
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,720
(The card sharks feel happier
seeing others lose than winning.)

835
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,230
- Didn't he pick a plus one card?
- Darn it!

836
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,930
(They continued playing the game
with no strategy.)

837
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,850
- I'll announce the result.
- Okay.

838
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,350
We deducted three caramels...

839
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,230
- every time you got caught.
- Yes.

840
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,870
Haha won 20 caramels in total.

841
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,990
- Impressive.
- That's not bad.

842
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:49,830
- Se Chan won 23 caramels in total.
- Great.

843
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,140
(Se Chan won 23 caramels.)

844
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,940
- Good job.
- Woo Jae...

845
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,800
lost 11 caramels.

846
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,840
You're doomed.

847
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,570
- That's the thing about math.
- Right.

848
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,150
- Math never betrays you?
- See?

849
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,340
Hey, Math Boy.

850
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,510
(Probability and statistics are
useless on Running Man.)

851
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,420
- Jae Suk...
- I bet he lost caramels.

852
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,280
lost 41 caramels.

853
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,630
What? He lost 41 caramels?

854
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,550
- Did you say 41 caramels?
- Calm down.

855
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,990
- Really?
- I mean...

856
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,200
- He advised me on how to play it.
- That's shocking.

857
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,470
- Don't worry.
- Let's replace him.

858
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,470
- He lost 41 caramels?
- Now that we've used him,

859
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,170
- let's replace him.
- It's time to replace him.

860
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,830
- I'll find a way...
- Let's replace him.

861
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,000
- For your information...
- Put your hands in front of you.

862
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,830
Suk Jin won 32 caramels in total.

863
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,950
- I can replace him with 20.
- That's amazing.

864
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,150
Jong Kook won 18 caramels in total.

865
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,310
Okay.

866
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,540
- We can gather 12.
- Give me 5 caramels...

867
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,040
as a membership fee.

868
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,690
- No. We'll drag you down.
- We'll replace you.

869
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,310
(No. We'll drag you down.)

870
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,620
- You should pay me first.
- We'll drag you down.

871
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,520
- No. We refuse to do that.
- We won't give you any.

872
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Will you make us?

873
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,050
- What? You have no power now.
- Now...

874
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,320
- Hey, let's... Right.
- Let's collect caramels.

875
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,790
I'll contribute ten caramels.

876
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,060
Yes. Then I'll contribute five caramels.

877
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,940
- Good. Chip in five caramels.
- Okay.

878
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,490
- You should contribute that much.
- Okay.

879
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,440
- I'll contribute too.
- How many? Ten?

880
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,470
- Shall I contribute five? Okay.
- Yes, five caramels.

881
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,140
- What did you say?
- Contribute just three caramels.

882
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,950
- How many do you have now?
- I handed in one caramel too.

883
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,570
- We won't accept yours.
- I handed in one caramel too.

884
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,840
(Surprised)

885
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,480
- You're the current chairperson.
- I already put it in the box.

886
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,120
You can't do that.

887
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,620
- I'm handing in one caramel too.
- Yes, I can.

888
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,690
- I handed in one too.
- Right.

889
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,310
- I handed in one caramel too.
- All right.

890
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,930
- Why did you do that?
- We all contributed.

891
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,190
- I contributed the most.
- I'm so upset.

892
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,630
I gave Jae Suk one caramel.

893
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,130
- Hey.
- I can't stand this anymore.

894
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,370
- We should've done it quietly.
- He's right about that.

895
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,740
- I hope I'll be chosen again.
- You see...

896
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,740
I want to make this
a peaceful organization.

897
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,800
- I hope Jae Suk will be chosen.
- Then we'll replace him again.

898
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,140
Jae Suk contributed just one.

899
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,330
Is it Jae Suk?

900
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,830
- That'd be hard to believe.
- Who is it?

901
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,210
That won't happen.

902
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,240
The new chairperson is...

903
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,150
- I contributed the most.
- It'd be awesome if it was me.

904
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,310
Please.

905
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,840
It's Woo Jae.

906
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,580
(Chairperson Joo Woo Jae)

907
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,990
- Gosh.
- What's wrong?

908
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,620
- Why?
- What's the matter?

909
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,780
(Woo Jae seems to be on edge.)

910
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,930
- Why?
- What's the matter?

911
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,020
How many caramels do you have now?

912
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,050
- What?
- How many do you have?

913
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,460
- Why?
- I have none.

914
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,630
- How many do you have?
- I have no caramels.

915
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,730
How many caramels do you have?

916
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,940
- We don't have to give him.
- That's right. We don't have to.

917
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,240
- We don't have to give him.
- Why would we?

918
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,530
Who are you to demand caramels?

919
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,060
- Hey.
- Who do you think you are?

920
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,170
- Isn't this how it works?
- Hey.

921
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,210
(Intimidated)

922
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,640
Not everyone can handle the job, Woo Jae.

923
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,450
- What are you talking about?
- That doesn't come with the job.

924
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,150
- Wait.
- You should win them over first.

925
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,680
- You should win them over first.
- If we hold out a little longer...

926
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,480
- Then to celebrate...
- Yes.

927
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,890
- that I became the chairperson,
- Yes.

928
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,720
- give me just one caramel.
- Okay.

929
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,010
- Hey.
- Just one?

930
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,130
- We'll let you keep your job.
- He's right.

931
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,930
- Okay. Fine.
- Hey.

932
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,230
- Just keep your job.
- Are you giving up?

933
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,820
I'll see which of you will
give me a caramel.

934
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,990
- I'll see.
- Hey.

935
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,020
Jong Kook, if things go well
for you in the next game,

936
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,560
- I'll reset that round.
- Okay.

937
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,170
- Hey, go ahead. I don't care.
- Just give me one now.

938
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,300
- Give you what?
- Then I won't do that.

939
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,640
- You messed with the wrong man.
- Hey.

940
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
- You made a big mistake.
- I will...

941
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,180
let you keep your arm,
so you can wear that armband.

942
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,570
(I will let you keep your arm,
so you can wear that armband.)

943
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,950
(Frozen with fear)

944
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,990
- My gosh. That's so scary.
- Hey. Don't ask for more.

945
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,420
Come on. What was that?

946
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,930
- You know what I mean.
- Will he get killed later?

947
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,020
- I mean...
- Will he get killed...

948
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,820
- at the end?
- As if we owed him something.

949
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,290
- You punk.
- You know...

950
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,290
- But...
- Stay out of this.

951
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,820
It's not like we're obligated
to give him caramels.

952
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,470
- But as you know,
- Why would he...

953
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,370
- he came here to help us.
- You punks.

954
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,440
- You know I'm right.
- Why would you scare him?

955
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,600
- I didn't intend to scare him.
- It's a matter of life and death.

956
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,870
You're too fainthearted...

957
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,500
- to be a chairperson.
- Just give him one caramel.

958
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,380
- How many caramels do you have?
- None.

959
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,740
Then how will you give him a caramel?

960
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,740
- He has nothing to lose.
- He has no caramels.

961
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,840
- Don't worry.
- It's lunchtime.

962
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,650
You will go downstairs 1 by 1...

963
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,580
and choose 1 of the 3 rooms.

964
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,780
And the people in the same room...

965
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,160
will evenly share the given caramels.

966
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
- Hold on.
- He has no caramels.

967
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,230
Can I nullify the result of that too?

968
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,970
You can nullify the result if you want.

969
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,200
- Can I?
- Of course you can.

970
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,430
Yes. You're the chairperson.

971
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,030
If you do, all of you will have to
come back and start over again.

972
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,560
- That sounds great.
- Right.

973
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,000
You should take advantage of
your power like this.

974
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,210
Don't be too greedy
and say you'll choose the 20 room.

975
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,910
Then we won't go into that room.

976
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,980
I'll choose the 40 room.

977
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,180
- The 40 room?
- You'll choose the 40 room?

978
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,720
- Don't be...
- He calculated the probability.

979
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,840
- He calculated the probability.
- You can reset it only once.

980
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,340
He's being too greedy.

981
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,450
- Is this for us?
- Can we eat this?

982
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,920
Take one bowl with you
when you go downstairs.

983
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,810
- Oh, we take it with us?
- I see.

984
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,890
- I'll eat jjamppong.
- I'll eat jjamppong too.

985
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,460
(I'll eat jjamppong.)

986
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,900
- Then I'll eat jjamppong today.
- I choose jjamppong too.

987
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,130
- Okay.
- Oh, dear.

988
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,930
(All 5 bowls of jjamppong were taken
in an instant.)

989
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,560
- We can be a little mean sometimes.
- I prefer jjajangmyeon.

990
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,790
- Do you?
- Yes, I always choose...

991
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,530
- jjajangmyeon over jjamppong.
- Really? Okay.

992
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,800
Hey, I didn't know Woo Jae was
so fainthearted.

993
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,240
- See you later, Woo Jae.
- He's too weak.

994
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,480
- I'll go into the 40 room.
- Okay.

995
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,150
- I can reset the result.
- Go ahead.

996
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,840
All tenacious people like us would
choose the same room.

997
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,650
- Choose wisely.
- I wouldn't say "tenacious".

998
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,540
I would say that we know too much
about variety shows.

999
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,960
- Like moths flying into the fire.
- We've been doing this for so long.

1000
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,520
Estimate the number of possible outcomes.

1001
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,790
(The 30 room)

1002
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,430
(He won't go into the 30 room.)

1003
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,820
(The 40 room, the 20 room)

1004
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,030
If I choose the 40 room,

1005
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,440
everyone will come
since this is the first round.

1006
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,800
If I choose the 40 room,
and they all choose the same room...

1007
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,840
And none in there.

1008
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,920
I choose the 20 room.

1009
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
(I choose the 20 room.)

1010
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,990
(He told everyone that he would
choose the 40 room.)

1011
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,050
Now that I'm in the 20 room,

1012
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,430
all I can do is
hope that they all choose...

1013
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,780
the 40 room.

1014
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,460
Detective Kim, you go first.

1015
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,130
- Okay. Let's go.
- Come on.

1016
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,440
Since Woo Jae said
he would choose the 40 room,

1017
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,640
I'll respect the chairperson's decision.

1018
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:24,000
He said he'd choose the 40 room, right?
Then I'll choose the 20 room.

1019
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,100
(Then I'll choose the 20 room.)

1020
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,570
I clearly remember him saying
he'd choose the 40 room.

1021
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:35,310
He didn't choose the 20 room
like a coward, right? Let's go.

1022
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,890
(Jong Kook chose the 20 room.)

1023
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,690
What? He's really not here.

1024
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,390
I'm impressed. Woo Jae must have...
Oh, gosh.

1025
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,230
I knew you'd choose this room.

1026
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,130
Come and sit down.

1027
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,240
- Let's say no one else comes here.
- Okay.

1028
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
But the others might choose the 30 room.

1029
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,290
- No, I don't think so.
- They won't do that.

1030
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,870
They all... Hey, listen.

1031
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,070
They're all reckless and awfully greedy.

1032
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,770
Make a decision
when you find out the result.

1033
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,840
(As Detective Kim predicted,
all the others chose the 40 room.)

1034
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,450
I'm not that kind of person.

1035
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,040
Everyone has made their choice.

1036
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,510
There are 4 members in the 40 room.

1037
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,780
(There are 4 members in the 40 room.)

1038
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,320
See? I was right.

1039
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,320
- Just as I expected...
- Is this scripted?

1040
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,320
(The pro card sharks always choose
the biggest room.)

1041
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,730
- Did you all plan this?
- No.

1042
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,630
- It's the same anyway.
- Each will get ten caramels.

1043
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,990
- Each of us will get ten.
- Yes.

1044
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,030
It wouldn't be so different.

1045
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,940
- Especially in this situation.
- You're right.

1046
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,810
- You should always be bold.
- It's so good.

1047
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,850
(They started eating in peace
after getting 10 caramels each.)

1048
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,450
Woo Jae decided to reset the result.

1049
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,020
- What?
- Woo Jae decided...

1050
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,990
(The chairperson used his power
to reset game results.)

1051
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,990
He's so stupid.

1052
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,950
Say that you'll choose the 20 room...

1053
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,620
and that they can choose
between the other rooms.

1054
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,080
Do as I say.

1055
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,700
Will you reset the result?

1056
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,160
Yes, I want to reset the result.

1057
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,330
(Chairperson Joo reset the result.)

1058
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,330
Should we go upstairs right now?

1059
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,540
- Gosh. Woo Jae, that punk.
- We should go now.

1060
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,060
- He keeps calculating.
- Will you go first?

1061
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,770
I'll go first. I'll tell you
which room I'll choose before I go.

1062
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,310
I'll go into the 30 room this time.

1063
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,330
- Okay.
- Okay.

1064
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,850
Do whatever you want. You can go now.

1065
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,720
He won't stop calculating.

1066
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,180
You learned the wrong math.

1067
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,080
- Where did you learn that?
- It's useless on this show.

1068
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,720
Don't act like you're highly educated.

1069
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,290
- Go on.
- You only ended up losing.

1070
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:22,220
We want others' failure
more than our own success.

1071
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,250
You misjudged us.

1072
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,430
At least take a risk.

1073
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,160
Don't try to predict our next moves.
That's not possible.

1074
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,370
- I'll go to the 30 room.
- All right.

1075
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,830
(The 30 room)

1076
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,560
(He just said that he was going to
choose the 30 room.)

1077
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,270
(What could be his choice?)

1078
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,850
(Woo Jae has chosen a room.)

1079
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,470
Okay. I'll choose the 20 room
no matter what.

1080
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,040
I hope he didn't choose this room
again unlike his words.

1081
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,450
There's no way he came here.

1082
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,450
No, he's not that stupid.

1083
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,830
(Did Woo Jae go into the 20 room
again this time?)

1084
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,660
Right? Okay. Good.

1085
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,270
(Relieved)

1086
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,740
- I have an idea.
- What is it?

1087
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,000
Let's play rock-paper-scissors
to pick one of us...

1088
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,540
to go to the 30 room.

1089
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,830
And the rest of us can choose the 40 room.

1090
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,750
The rest three of us. Okay?

1091
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,750
Even if Woo Jae is there,
you can get 15 caramels.

1092
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,750
- Right?
- Exactly.

1093
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,640
You can go first, Jae Suk. Go and eat up.

1094
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,640
- Let's let him go first.
- Okay then.

1095
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,790
- Which room will you choose?
- I'll choose the 40 room as I said.

1096
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,680
(He chose the 40 room as he said.)

1097
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,620
Yes, I knew it.
Of course, no one came here.

1098
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,330
Right. It's too soon to tell.

1099
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,200
(Following Jae Suk, Suk Jin comes in.)

1100
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,220
Okay, good. It's just the two of us.

1101
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,790
It's just us, Jae Suk.

1102
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,270
I'm going to the 30 room.

1103
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,140
- The 30 room?
- Do you want to go instead?

1104
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,370
I thought that was the case.

1105
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,470
Why you though?

1106
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,180
Because you said so.

1107
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,250
So what will it be?

1108
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,850
- Will you go to the 30 room?
- Yes, the 30 room.

1109
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:49,970
- Then I'll go to the 40 room.
- Okay.

1110
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,220
- I...
- You really are exhausting.

1111
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,580
Is this the main event today?

1112
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,250
(They're sick and tired of each other.)

1113
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,350
Se Chan, that brat.

1114
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,720
- Darn it.
- Of course.

1115
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,890
(Haha steps into the 40 room.)

1116
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,060
Okay, good.

1117
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,180
Where will Se Chan go?

1118
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,620
- The 30 room.
- Right?

1119
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,830
Why is everyone
coming to the 40 room though?

1120
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,470
I could ask you that myself.

1121
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,830
- Jae Suk...
- Tell me.

1122
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,890
One can dream, right?

1123
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,370
A chance could open up for me.

1124
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,810
- Did anyone order food?
- Seriously?

1125
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,970
(Se Chan enters.)

1126
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,470
(Startled)

1127
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,370
- Unbelievable.
- What are you doing here?

1128
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,680
Haha, why are you here?

1129
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,140
You said you'd go to the 30 room.

1130
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:29,080
I told you multiple times
that I was going to the 40 room.

1131
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,850
- You said you'd go to the 30 room.
- How many of you are in here?

1132
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,120
(Woo Jae joins the party.)

1133
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,890
Tell me how many of you are in here.

1134
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,220
What on earth are you doing here?

1135
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,720
Are you kidding me?

1136
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,100
Why are you here?

1137
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,500
- So no one is in the 30 room?
- Why are you here?

1138
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,540
- Is no one in the 30 room?
- No one's there.

1139
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,470
Going to the 30 room would mean a jackpot.

1140
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:51,180
What on earth are you doing here though?

1141
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,310
(He failed to calculate
the right probability.)

1142
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,970
You two shouldn't be here at all.

1143
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,310
Why did you come in here?

1144
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,910
Jong Kook, how many do you have?

1145
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,220
- Unbelievable.
- Twenty?

1146
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,810
- Did you go to the 20 room?
- Yes, 20.

1147
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,790
- I can't believe it.
- So the 30 room is empty.

1148
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,680
- How...
- There are five of us in here.

1149
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,680
Woo Jae.

1150
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,910
This is what math really is.

1151
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,750
This is the math
that applies to Running Man.

1152
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,790
This is the math known in Running Man.

1153
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,330
(The Running Man math isn't
taught in engineering classes.)

1154
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,600
I lost everything I had.

1155
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,660
Woo Jae ruined everything.

1156
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,000
I'm ruined.

1157
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:20,810
(Card Shark Association)

1158
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,560
(The card sharks
move on to their next game.)

1159
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,240
I really need to do better.

1160
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,350
Exactly, but when will it happen?
After the show ends?

1161
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Woo Jae, you shouldn't
mention math at this show.

1162
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,520
- But...
- Normal math doesn't apply here.

1163
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,790
I can win, you know.

1164
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,250
There's still a window of opportunity.

1165
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,160
- Woo Jae, math...
- I mean it.

1166
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,020
This is what math is.

1167
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:41,930
- Woo Jae.
- Right?

1168
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,560
Woo Jae,
you shouldn't be using your brain.

1169
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,700
- Let your heart guide you.
- Exactly.

1170
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,560
Look here, Woo Jae.

1171
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,370
Jae Suk, they said it all.

1172
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,890
- They already said everything.
- Math is irrelevant here.

1173
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,640
- Woo Jae, take it slow.
- They said it all.

1174
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,560
Just watch how I make it happen.

1175
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,180
Aren't you at minus 30?

1176
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,770
There's no need to fret.

1177
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,450
- Guys.
- Yes?

1178
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,370
You're now entering the second match.

1179
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,470
- Right.
- Sure.

1180
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,020
During the lunch break,

1181
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,250
- all 20 were received.
- What?

1182
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,750
- What?
- No way.

1183
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,310
- Who was it?
- Who had enough?

1184
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,490
Haha, Suk Jin, and Se Chan.

1185
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,560
- Okay.
- Gosh.

1186
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,000
Guys, listen up.

1187
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
The three of us
should pay enough right now...

1188
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,160
and have one of us become a candidate.

1189
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,200
Okay, good.

1190
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,270
Let's do this!

1191
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,430
- If I...
- I will only ask...

1192
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,930
for one from each of you.

1193
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,060
We're a union.

1194
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,740
- A union.
- I'm curious though.

1195
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,740
You said you'd only ask for one.

1196
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,040
Why must we pay up though?

1197
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,020
Just know that I don't intend to pay you.

1198
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,970
- Same here.
- That means none for me, right?

1199
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,790
Just know that
I don't have any to give out.

1200
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,520
The chairperson doesn't have
a lot of authority.

1201
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,120
It can always be nullified.

1202
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,020
- That's all we need frankly.
- All right.

1203
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,660
It must be Suk Jin.

1204
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,120
Today's third...

1205
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,020
No, you're already
at your fourth chairperson.

1206
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,600
Today's fourth chairperson is...

1207
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,700
No way.

1208
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,470
- That's true.
- Let it be Suk Jin.

1209
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,160
- It's Suk Jin.
- Nice!

1210
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,270
(Suk Jin is chosen.)

1211
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,470
Mr. Ji, congratulations.

1212
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,600
- Mr. Lee.
- I will not forget what you did.

1213
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,910
Suk Jin, we're a team.

1214
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,000
- I won't forget.
- The chairperson...

1215
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,140
I will turn the tables.

1216
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,270
I'll aim for the last election.

1217
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,770
Do whatever you want.

1218
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,850
As a membership fee,

1219
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,250
I'll accept ten.

1220
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,350
What a joke.

1221
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,790
(What a joke.)

1222
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,290
Seriously?

1223
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,580
Don't let them be this way.

1224
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,160
- Why?
- How does this make sense?

1225
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,250
It's not fair.

1226
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,620
(They're not going to participate
in the collection of funds.)

1227
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,220
- He asked for 10, not 1.
- Exactly.

1228
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,430
As if we'd pay ten each.

1229
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,020
- But the chairperson...
- Do something about them!

1230
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,120
- What?
- Why?

1231
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,240
When you two are elected as chairperson,

1232
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,930
we get into character and pay up.

1233
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,430
- But...
- How is that fair?

1234
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:37,160
- I'm a veteran myself, you know.
- Pay up!

1235
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,870
- But...
- Ten!

1236
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,470
Why should we pay up though?

1237
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,700
Because I'm the chairperson.

1238
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,750
- That's not a reason.
- That doesn't make sense.

1239
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,450
Okay, fine.
I'll give you a 50 percent discount.

1240
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,970
- Hear me out.
- No way.

1241
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,790
Unless the chairperson
does something for us...

1242
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:49,790
Of course I'm an influence.

1243
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,220
In my case,

1244
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,750
I will leave the association
unless I'm paid five.

1245
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,750
I'll leave the association.

1246
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,180
He's asking me to pay up instead.

1247
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,290
- That's a good idea.
- Right?

1248
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,330
You should pay up.

1249
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,000
I'll form another association.

1250
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,430
He's threatening to form his own.

1251
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,930
You should tell him that it's not allowed!

1252
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,500
The chairperson collecting money
isn't in the rules either.

1253
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,740
Shut it!

1254
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,930
After all the money I paid them?

1255
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,410
- There are no perks.
- This is hurting our pride.

1256
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,870
- We should make them pay.
- Our pride is on the line.

1257
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,040
- I'll form another association.
- You only have to pay one.

1258
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,180
You...

1259
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,750
- You're broke, right?
- No.

1260
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,890
- Aren't you broke?
- I'm not.

1261
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,220
- You have none.
- That's not true.

1262
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,410
How many do you have?

1263
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,450
I can't tell you that.

1264
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,330
Debt is categorized as an asset, you know.

1265
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,060
Debt is categorized as an asset!

1266
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,750
You're even worse than Jong Kook.

1267
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,930
- Bring it on!
- Why?

1268
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,470
Then let me suggest a deal.

1269
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,520
- Sure.
- Go ahead.

1270
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:40,200
I'll offer two and you'll do the same.

1271
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,660
We'll then play rock-paper-scissors
and the winner will take everything.

1272
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,470
(Winner takes all?)

1273
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,910
- What do you say?
- That's...

1274
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,540
So what you're suggesting is a fair game.

1275
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,680
- You suggested a mini game.
- Right.

1276
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,020
We...

1277
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,220
Does that serve a purpose though?

1278
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,750
- Of course.
- So we should play a game?

1279
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,850
I'm challenging you.

1280
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,180
So you're suggesting a mini game.

1281
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,450
- Yes, a mini game.
- Are you kidding me?

1282
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,410
- With two each...
- We can do that at any time.

1283
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,790
Let's drag Jae Suk down.

1284
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,520
- Three of his...
- Jae Suk...

1285
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,700
- He'll even crawl at your feet.
- He'll accept the deal.

1286
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,020
Offer three and
he'll crawl between your legs.

1287
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,470
- Jae Suk...
- Make him our minion.

1288
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,930
Join us and we'll give you two.

1289
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,240
- How many?
- Two.

1290
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,200
- Two isn't enough.
- Then three?

1291
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,270
No.

1292
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,270
- Then...
- Ask how many he wants.

1293
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,740
- The number will keep going up.
- Ask how many he wants.

1294
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,140
- Don't give him any.
- How many do you want?

1295
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,950
I'll move for five.

1296
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,700
You'll be our minion though.

1297
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,180
Bring us our water.

1298
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,870
- Okay?
- Okay, deal.

1299
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,970
- Is five enough?
- Yes.

1300
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,810
- Okay!
- Nice.

1301
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,140
- Okay.
- How adorable.

1302
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,560
You adorable punk.

1303
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,680
- You little...
- Okay.

1304
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,890
- Okay.
- What's with them?

1305
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:35,950
We have our new minion.

1306
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:36,990
- Get us some water.
- Get the water.

1307
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,790
As if I'd ever do that.

1308
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,220
Are you kidding me?

1309
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,560
- Hey.
- You need to pay back your debt.

1310
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,020
Pay what back?

1311
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,270
(Pay what back?)

1312
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,140
Must he pay you back right away?

1313
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,810
If you think about it,
your assets get frozen, right?

1314
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,200
You must pay back the debt right away.

1315
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,270
- This is infuriating.
- Jae Suk never gets to keep one...

1316
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,370
in his pocket.

1317
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:56,270
Where do you think you're going?
Stand back here.

1318
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,370
Your place is at this far end.

1319
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:59,410
We'll begin the next game then.

1320
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,620
For this next game,
luck must be in your favor.

1321
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,910
This is All-in for your Victory.

1322
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:05,990
How will it go?

1323
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,950
We have already set four rounds
of 1-on-1 games for you to play.

1324
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:14,160
While two of the sharks go head to head,

1325
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,930
the others...

1326
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,040
will place their bets on who they think...

1327
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,290
will win the game.

1328
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:21,770
The winner will take twice the amount.

1329
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,200
Okay, good.

1330
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,430
So here are the games.

1331
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,850
Round one. Jae Suk and Haha.
Arm wrestling.

1332
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,350
The winner will be obvious.

1333
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:33,910
Round two. Suk Jin and Se Chan.
Elephant trunk spin and flag race.

1334
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,540
Round three. Woo Jae and Se Chan.
One-legged fight.

1335
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,750
Round four. Jae Suk and Jong Kook.
Bottle cap flicking.

1336
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,060
I'd do well if it were a normal lid.

1337
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,850
We'll then begin with the first round.

1338
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,930
Jae Suk and Haha's arm wrestling...

1339
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:48,370
- will commence in three minutes.
- Three minutes?

1340
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,370
Do the winners of the games
get something as well?

1341
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:51,700
The winners of the games
will receive a prize of one.

1342
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:52,890
- Just one?
- One?

1343
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,700
The rest will take one of these.

1344
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:57,500
- Later, you will place your bets.
- Our bets?

1345
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,680
Who has the upper hand?

1346
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,850
- Jae Suk, of course.
- It's a best of three.

1347
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,370
- Haha can't win.
- Of course not.

1348
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,470
- Haha's strong as well.
- It won't happen.

1349
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,910
His arms are too short.

1350
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,990
- It's better to have shorter arms.
- I'm good at arm wrestling.

1351
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,910
And arm wrestling isn't what I'm good at.

1352
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,220
Is he not good at arm wrestling?

1353
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,080
There's no way he'll lose.

1354
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:14,790
- Jae Suk, right?
- Yes.

1355
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,330
- But...
- And he won't want to lose.

1356
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,250
He doesn't even lift weights
when he works out.

1357
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,370
I lift kids instead.

1358
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:23,970
I lift kids for a living.

1359
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:25,500
That doesn't really count though.

1360
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,140
- You have no idea.
- My gosh.

1361
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:29,370
- Let's see.
- Can his arms be mushier?

1362
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,240
His arms aren't muscular at all.

1363
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,580
We should check their status
like jockeys check their horses.

1364
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,950
- I'm not that bulky either.
- Let's see.

1365
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,370
- I'm not bulky.
- But still...

1366
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,520
- Okay.
- Do we bet on who'll win?

1367
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,810
Bet your desired amount on
who you think you'll win.

1368
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:44,910
Write it down.

1369
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,580
You can keep it with you.

1370
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,200
(The bets have been placed.)

1371
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,000
- It's a best of three matches.
- I placed my bet.

1372
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,270
- But this...
- You never know though.

1373
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,330
You never know.

1374
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,540
Besides, their pride...

1375
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,770
- hangs in the balance too.
- Of course.

1376
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:01,540
I'm going to win no matter what.

1377
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,970
- Go.
- This is to protect...

1378
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,410
- their dignity.
- Haha is strong in the arms.

1379
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,770
(That hurts!)

1380
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:08,950
Sir, come on.

1381
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:11,080
What do you think you're doing?

1382
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,520
It won't make you stronger.

1383
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,290
- He's gambling again.
- Loosen up a little.

1384
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,850
Haha has the losing grip.

1385
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:17,790
- Okay.
- Ready, set, go.

1386
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:19,120
Look at how strong Jae Suk is.

1387
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,090
Jae Suk's strong.

1388
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,840
(Right away, their hands
swing over to Jae Suk's side.)

1389
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,210
No! Hey!

1390
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,530
- Nicely done.
- Haha, don't!

1391
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,210
No...

1392
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,800
(The bald player is holding out.)

1393
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,020
- Haha lost. It's over.
- He lost. The game is over.

1394
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,020
It's over!

1395
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,590
Jae Suk is really strong.

1396
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,020
- All right!
- Jae Suk wins!

1397
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,650
- All right. I got it.
- Hey!

1398
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,250
- How could you lose?
- Look at this.

1399
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,320
Good job, Jae Suk.

1400
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,530
- Suk Jin.
- That was great.

1401
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:51,750
- He's really strong.
- He's tough to beat.

1402
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,460
Gosh, look how desperate he was to win.

1403
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:56,190
All right. I got it.

1404
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,670
What's wrong with you?
You said you could win.

1405
00:45:58,670 --> 00:45:59,670
(Right then,)

1406
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:00,940
(Detective Kim approaches Jae Suk.)

1407
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,710
I'll beat him.

1408
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,670
I'll give you five.
You should lose deliberately.

1409
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,500
(A dark proposal by a corrupt detective)

1410
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,250
(Jong Kook, who bet on Haha,)

1411
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,820
(suggested Jae Suk to lose deliberately.)

1412
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,210
I bet a lot on you.

1413
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,920
You can do it however you want.

1414
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,920
Just beat him.

1415
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,050
I'll give you five right away
if you beat him.

1416
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,190
But Jong Kook offered me five as well.

1417
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,150
- If you lose?
- Yes, if I lose.

1418
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,150
No, you must beat him.

1419
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,360
What kind of a deal did they offer him?

1420
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:29,630
You'll lose everything you have
if Haha loses,

1421
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,190
- so offer Jae Suk five.
- What?

1422
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,630
Jong Kook said
he'd give me five if I lose.

1423
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:34,770
If what?

1424
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:35,840
- Jong Kook...
- He offered me five.

1425
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,070
- In that case...
- said he'd give him five.

1426
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,570
- You...
- You should give him five too.

1427
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,530
If you win, I'll give you five.

1428
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,250
That means you'll get ten.

1429
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,380
- You should win.
- Okay? You can do it!

1430
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,820
- Okay, I got it.
- You should beat him right away.

1431
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,610
Gosh.

1432
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:48,380
(Player Yoo settled a dark deal.)

1433
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,340
Get ready. Let's play.

1434
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,360
Grab his hand.

1435
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,420
Get ready.

1436
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,780
One, two, go!

1437
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,960
- Go!
- Go.

1438
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,980
Haha.

1439
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,150
He's determined.

1440
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,190
- Go!
- Go.

1441
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,920
(The indebted card shark
is guaranteed 10 caramels.)

1442
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,420
Go.

1443
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:04,800
It's over.

1444
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,360
Finish him!

1445
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:09,300
- Nice!
- All right.

1446
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,170
- All right!
- All right!

1447
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:12,610
Jae Suk wins!

1448
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,800
Now, please reveal your betting results.

1449
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,210
- All right.
- Should I go first?

1450
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,070
I bet 20 on Jae Suk's win.

1451
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,820
All right. Se Chan won 20 caramels.

1452
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,190
Next, Woo Jae.

1453
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,880
- Four.
- Four?

1454
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,460
Let's check out Jong Kook's.

1455
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,480
I bet five on Haha.

1456
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,250
You need to pay up five caramels.

1457
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,980
I bet 30 on Jae Suk.

1458
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:35,070
All right. Suk Jin wins 30 caramels.

1459
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,090
Se Chan wins 20 caramels.

1460
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,530
- Woo Jae wins four caramels.
- I'll give you some.

1461
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:39,670
Jong Kook, pay up five caramels.

1462
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,840
Here are five caramels.

1463
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,000
You don't have to give him any.

1464
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,300
All right. Round Two...

1465
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,000
is between Suk Jin and Se Chan.

1466
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,440
It's getting a flag
after elephant trunk spins.

1467
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,500
But I'm not good at it.

1468
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,880
The winner can take three caramels.

1469
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,170
- Three?
- I think...

1470
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,380
- Wait, why didn't you give me any?
- Oh, right. I should give you one.

1471
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,380
- Just one?
- Just one?

1472
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,190
- Didn't you also win one earlier?
- You're so obsessed with it.

1473
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:58,960
You should eat it like you did before.

1474
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,250
- Try it.
- I'll have it later.

1475
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,530
He has to survive with one.

1476
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:03,190
- I know now that it's useful.
- You can't eat it?

1477
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:05,000
- I should make use of it.
- I'll give them to the rest of you.

1478
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,230
- Come here.
- What do we do?

1479
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:07,800
Whom should we bet on?

1480
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:10,690
I think this round will be a draw.

1481
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:11,900
We need to form an alliance.

1482
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,440
Join our alliance.

1483
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,300
Listen up, Jae Suk.

1484
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,070
- It's all about betting.
- Do you want me...

1485
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:18,880
to do the elephant trunk spin or not?

1486
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,900
- Of course you should.
- Okay, then.

1487
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,250
- What does he mean?
- Then you should...

1488
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:24,480
He said, "Do you want me to do
the elephant trunk spin or not?"

1489
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,650
You should give me three each.
I'll do my best.

1490
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,590
- If you give me 3...
- Will 3 be enough?

1491
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,020
But if you bet on me, you'll win.

1492
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,750
It's up to you.

1493
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,690
I'm telling you, I'm not good at spinning.

1494
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,030
- We know that.
- I think I'll lose.

1495
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,320
We all know that.

1496
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,820
- But he could lose on purpose.
- He could lose deliberately.

1497
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,900
Because he could make
the others lose their caramels,

1498
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,000
although he doesn't win any.

1499
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,030
- The thing is...
- But why would I do that...

1500
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,400
- when you'd give me the caramels?
- You're capable of that.

1501
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,280
I'll play properly for real.

1502
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,900
If he acts up, he could lose on purpose.

1503
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,070
(Elephant trunk spin and flag race)

1504
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,250
(Jae Suk bet 16 caramels on Se Chan.)

1505
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,050
Give me some first. Give me three.

1506
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:01,170
I bet 16 caramels on you.

1507
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:02,210
On me?

1508
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:03,780
- I'll give you three.
- Okay. Give them to me first.

1509
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,650
But you must do your best.

1510
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,750
- Jae Suk, I will.
- Okay.

1511
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,920
All right. Three caramels.

1512
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:10,590
I'll not lose for sure.

1513
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:11,860
I should lose on... What?

1514
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,090
You should lose on purpose.

1515
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,190
But I'll lose anyway.

1516
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:15,570
I know that, but...

1517
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:16,690
I'll give you half if you lose.

1518
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:18,860
- Really?
- Yes, I bet mine on Se Chan.

1519
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,190
(It looks like Woo Jae will bet
on Se Chan as well.)

1520
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,130
Please wrap up your bets.

1521
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,210
(Are you going to win or lose?)

1522
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:25,500
(I'll win.)

1523
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,300
Oh, that could happen.

1524
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,380
Se Chan could lose on purpose
after accepting a deal.

1525
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,520
If they bet on me...

1526
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,420
That could happen.

1527
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,880
Who are you talking to?

1528
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:39,880
Who are you talking to?

1529
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,190
Is there anyone here?

1530
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:42,920
(The betting time is over.)

1531
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,190
Are you done with the bet?

1532
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,300
- Yes, I am.
- I'll start from here.

1533
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,820
(The player who spins 5 times
and grabs the flag first wins.)

1534
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,170
All right. That's it.

1535
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,090
I'm already dizzy.

1536
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,940
- Let's play.
- Hey.

1537
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,940
It's five spins.

1538
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,770
- Se Chan.
- I went all in for you.

1539
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:58,000
- Are you ready?
- I'm not sure about Se Chan.

1540
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,030
- I'll play in earnest.
- Let's do this.

1541
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:04,070
You can start spinning
as soon as I blow the whistle.

1542
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:05,610
- I should spin fast.
- Please count for us.

1543
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,840
Ready.

1544
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,320
(The game starts.)

1545
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,320
One.

1546
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,650
- One.
- One.

1547
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,650
- He's doing his best. Look at him.
- Two.

1548
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:16,820
- Three.
- Suk Jin, yours is two.

1549
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,230
- Three.
- Four.

1550
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,320
- Five.
- Gosh, I'm so dizzy.

1551
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,320
Go, Se Chan.

1552
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,900
- Why that punk...
- Hey.

1553
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,030
Go, Se Chan.

1554
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,360
- Why that punk...
- Hey.

1555
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,860
Are you kidding me?

1556
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,110
Seriously.

1557
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,530
- Hey.
- Hey. Do a proper job.

1558
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,630
- Are you serious? Hey!
- Hey!

1559
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:33,800
- Gosh, I'm so dizzy.
- Hey.

1560
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,980
- Hey!
- Hey!

1561
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,210
- Hey.
- Get a grip.

1562
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:37,210
- Don't joke around.
- Hey.

1563
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,610
- I bet they won't reach the flag.
- I'm going to kill you.

1564
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,210
- Seriously.
- Gosh!

1565
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,840
- I'm going to kill you.
- I'm going to kill you for real.

1566
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,520
- Se Chan.
- That's a water bottle.

1567
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,190
- Hey.
- That's a water bottle.

1568
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,090
- Come over here. Hey.
- That's a water bottle.

1569
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:49,820
- Hey.
- I knew he'd do this.

1570
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,550
- That rascal.
- I knew he'd do this.

1571
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,230
- Stop it.
- Se Chan!

1572
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:56,670
- Hey.
- Hey, I bet all my caramels on you.

1573
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:57,860
- Se Chan, I bet all my caramels.
- Hey.

1574
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,190
I bet all my life on you.
Hey, that's a camera.

1575
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,130
- That's a camera.
- I'm going to kill you.

1576
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,530
- Hey, are you serious?
- I'm going to kill you.

1577
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:06,780
- Hey! Se Chan!
- This is driving me crazy.

1578
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,610
- Hurry up.
- Se Chan.

1579
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:10,170
- Come over here.
- The flag is right here!

1580
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,420
- Hey.
- This is the flag.

1581
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,440
- Suk Jin.
- It's here.

1582
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,980
You are almost there. Both of you.

1583
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,460
My gosh. He's unbelievable.

1584
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,650
- I even took out a loan to bet.
- Se Chan.

1585
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:21,590
Se Chan. Hey.

1586
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,980
- Hey, I...
- Suk Jin.

1587
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,300
Think wisely.
You'll get just three even if you win.

1588
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,530
- If you lose...
- Hey, Se Chan.

1589
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,900
Gosh, this is...

1590
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,230
- Hey!
- Seriously.

1591
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,530
(Suk Jin wins.)

1592
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:33,530
This is because...

1593
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,900
He wouldn't have grabbed it
even if we gave him an hour.

1594
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,840
- Gosh. I'm so dizzy right now.
- You know...

1595
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,030
I'd rather have them ruined
than to get a few caramels from you.

1596
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:42,400
You see? I knew this would happen.

1597
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,440
It's better that I won.

1598
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,710
Please reveal your bets.

1599
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,570
- Hold on.
- I...

1600
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,710
I knew he'd act up.

1601
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,320
I told you. You should've bet on me.

1602
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,520
He bet 16.

1603
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,780
I bet five on Se Chan.

1604
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,860
I told you.
You should've bet on me to win.

1605
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,650
- Next.
- I knew Se Chan would do that.

1606
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:58,230
I knew this would happen,
so I bet one on Suk Jin.

1607
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:59,960
(Haha bet 1 on Suk Jin.)

1608
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,500
Got it. What about Woo Jae?

1609
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,300
- This is because...
- I thought Suk Jin would lose,

1610
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,670
- He...
- and that Se Chan...

1611
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:06,800
- would give a twist.
- Woo Jae, it'd have taken long.

1612
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,960
I was dizzy!

1613
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,860
- You try it!
- What? You bet 28?

1614
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,610
You bet that many?

1615
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,570
Gosh, I'm so sick of him.

1616
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,610
- But this was...
- Gosh, seriously.

1617
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,940
- Se Chan...
- They are such jerks.

1618
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:19,980
Seriously.

1619
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,780
- Hey.
- You try spinning at this hour.

1620
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,920
I bet you'll be dizzy too.

1621
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,050
Be quiet.

1622
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,280
I couldn't see it for real.

1623
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,520
Se Chan, you're seriously...

1624
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,590
You must be on
"The Story of That Day" next week.

1625
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,360
Goodness, I still can't see it.

1626
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,250
All right.
Round Three is a one-legged fight...

1627
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,530
between Se Chan and Woo Jae.

1628
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:38,170
- Right away?
- The prize is five caramels.

1629
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,340
- Gosh, Se Chan...
- Se Chan will win for sure.

1630
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,710
Se Chan will win if he plays properly.

1631
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,110
But I can't trust him.

1632
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:44,800
(Se Chan has the key
to the game once again.)

1633
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,940
- Do you think he'll win?
- But in this condition...

1634
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,340
Listen. I'll do this.

1635
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:51,780
I think I'll win if we go at each other,

1636
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,610
but if we retreat,
I don't think I can manage to win.

1637
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,280
I was too dizzy.

1638
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,480
(Should we believe him or not?)

1639
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,090
I promise you. I'll play earnestly.

1640
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,780
Get lost.

1641
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,280
If you give me two caramels each,
I'll beat him.

1642
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,800
- Do you have a death wish?
- I mean it.

1643
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,150
You're seriously...

1644
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,800
Seriously. You...

1645
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,500
Can't you get it?
Jae Suk is really upset.

1646
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,860
He's really upset.

1647
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,840
Jae Suk is upset for real.

1648
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,460
He was frustrated with me earlier.

1649
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,570
He went,
"Of course, you should bet on Se Chan."

1650
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,400
What's worse is that
he gave me three caramels.

1651
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,320
This time... I'm serious.

1652
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:28,320
I'll return the three caramels
you gave me earlier.

1653
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,380
Here.

1654
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,440
You should go all in.

1655
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,920
I'm not kidding. I'll play earnestly.

1656
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,590
(You should go all in.
I'll play earnestly.)

1657
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,090
I'll play earnestly.

1658
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:36,650
There's nothing I can do in this round.

1659
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:37,880
Are you going to do your best?

1660
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,820
I'll beat him for real.

1661
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:41,920
Gosh, I'm not sure about this.

1662
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,800
I know that Se Chan will lose for sure.

1663
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,270
- Se Chan will lose for sure.
- That's true.

1664
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:50,340
I'll lose right away,
so give me ten caramels.

1665
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,980
Hold on.

1666
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,110
Gosh, Se Chan...

1667
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:55,380
I'm confident that I can lose.

1668
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,980
- I'm confident that I can lose.
- I see.

1669
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,280
- Your knees should...
- Give me ten.

1670
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,050
You can bet everything
on Se Chan and give me ten.

1671
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:01,280
I'm not confident that I can win.

1672
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,320
But I'm confident that I can lose.

1673
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,980
But you must lose.

1674
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:06,480
Of course. I have nothing to lose.

1675
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,960
I have nothing.

1676
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:09,380
This is all I have.

1677
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,460
All right. This is great.

1678
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:11,860
- I made my bet.
- I made my bet.

1679
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,090
All right. Are you done?

1680
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,300
I'm going to beat Se Chan here
since I couldn't...

1681
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,860
on "Love Me Actually."

1682
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,340
(Pushover Joo met his old enemy.)

1683
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,530
For your information,
I bet all 30 of my caramels.

1684
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:21,940
- Really?
- Yes.

1685
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,730
This is so nerve-racking.

1686
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:24,840
But I...

1687
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:26,530
They're deceiving all of us.

1688
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,610
I have nothing to lose.

1689
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:28,750
All right. I made my bet.

1690
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,110
(It looks like they all bet big
in this round.)

1691
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:31,150
You'd better do well.

1692
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:32,170
- Get ready.
- Let's do this.

1693
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,210
You should at least bump into each other.

1694
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,250
Get ready.

1695
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,750
(The game starts the moment
their knees touch each other's.)

1696
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,250
(They'll start with the starting posture.)

1697
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,320
You got this.

1698
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:41,460
Gosh, I hate the way he talks.

1699
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,250
Are you going to fall off on purpose
as soon as we start?

1700
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,800
- I'm going to play for real.
- Okay.

1701
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,590
I think we'll need a VAR.

1702
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:51,500
Here it comes.

1703
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,300
His face says that he's going to lose.

1704
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,940
His face says it all.

1705
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,670
He's thinking of how to lose.

1706
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,530
(The moment they touch each other,
the game starts.)

1707
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,570
They haven't bumped into each other.

1708
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,610
They haven't?

1709
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,070
- Gosh.
- It'll only start after they do.

1710
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,710
- I'll get five if I win, right?
- Go bump into him.

1711
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,280
Play hard, you guys.

1712
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,480
(They bumped into each other.)

1713
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:18,800
(You should go all in.
I'll play earnestly.)

1714
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:22,730
(Exclaiming)

1715
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,420
Yes!

1716
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,630
(Se Chan loses.)

1717
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,000
Woo Jae wins!

1718
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,230
(Pushover Joo wins.)

1719
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,030
I was going from below,
but he hit me from above.

1720
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,110
Please reveal your bets.

1721
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:37,440
- You're seriously...
- Gosh, I bet on Woo Jae though.

1722
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:38,980
- I bet one.
- I bet 30 on Woo Jae.

1723
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:41,150
- Give me one.
- That was one great bet.

1724
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:42,920
- That was incredible.
- Give me one.

1725
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,150
- Give me one.
- Gosh, Se Chan.

1726
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:46,380
- I should've bet five.
- I knew Se Chan would lose.

1727
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,520
- Really?
- I bet two on Se Chan.

1728
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,880
I bet 1 on Woo Jae. I should've bet 10.

1729
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,250
I did my best.

1730
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,420
(Se Chan claims he did his best.)

1731
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,030
- Are you going to beat him?
- I'll lose.

1732
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,170
- I'll fall as soon as we clash.
- You'll lose?

1733
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:58,300
I'm confident.

1734
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,130
Move over. Don't talk to them.

1735
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,670
- What? I'm talking with them.
- Move.

1736
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,610
I'm going to give it my all.

1737
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:06,400
(I'm going to give it my all.)

1738
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:10,210
How was I supposed to attack him
when he attacked me from above?

1739
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:11,670
- I should've bet ten.
- You are...

1740
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,210
Gosh, this is amazing.

1741
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:14,670
- All right.
- Okay, fine.

1742
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:17,110
I'm going to bet it all on the last round.

1743
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,280
All right, you're going to get
as many caramels...

1744
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,920
as the numbers here.

1745
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:21,980
I'll start.

1746
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,820
It's out.

1747
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,320
(Did Jong Kook make a mistake on purpose?)

1748
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,130
(Jong Kook unexpectedly lost
when he's obsessed with winning.)

1749
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:30,360
- What was that?
- What?

1750
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:31,800
We are...

1751
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:35,070
- All right!
- Yes!

1752
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:37,340
Please reveal your bets.

1753
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,710
- Yes! I bet 30!
- Yes!

1754
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,800
(Suk Jin and Haha
won 30 caramels from their bets.)

1755
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,050
I also bet 30!

1756
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:47,020
(Se Chan also won 30 caramels.)

1757
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,480
I'm going to reset the round if I lose.

1758
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,690
Oh, you're thinking of resetting it?

1759
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:53,210
- That's why I'm betting all.
- Oh, right. He's the chairperson.

1760
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:55,380
- I should've stuck with him.
- You're right.

1761
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:58,230
We should bet all 30.

1762
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,420
(He only shared the info
with Haha who listened to him.)

1763
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,420
It was a piece of cake to make the bet.

1764
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,960
I knew it. He's only bad with stocks.

1765
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,400
Gosh, I should have one.

1766
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,800
- Goodness, I lost so many.
- Right now...

1767
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,110
If you join me,

1768
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:10,770
- this is what happens.
- I know. That was so cool.

1769
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:12,610
- What's the point of betraying?
- Thank you.

1770
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:14,000
You can have it all.

1771
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
- The chairperson...
- We should change the chairperson.

1772
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,980
I think we should change the chairperson.

1773
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,210
Suk Jin, we're on your side.

1774
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:20,980
- I'm on your side.
- We won't change the chairperson.

1775
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:22,920
- Gosh, those punks...
- It's okay.

1776
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,480
- I'm joining you.
- It's meaningless.

1777
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,150
- We even took photos earlier.
- This is great.

1778
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,420
- It's meaningless.
- This is a nice mix.

1779
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,420
Family!

1780
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,630
You automatically formed teams.

1781
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:31,460
- This is great.
- All right.

1782
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:33,420
Those with makeup and without makeup.

1783
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,960
Let's finish them.

1784
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:36,920
The last mission...

1785
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,570
is something you all claim are good at.

1786
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:41,030
It's Card Game of Wits.

1787
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:42,030
- That's going to be fun!
- Bring it on!

1788
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:43,130
The one where we stick a card
on our forehead?

1789
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,230
- I'm good at it.
- We're finally playing it.

1790
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,500
- I'm good at this.
- We should do this well.

1791
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,230
(A card game to determine
the true card shark)

1792
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:49,940
This game is really nerve-racking.

1793
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,070
No, it's not nerve-racking at all.

1794
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,610
(A card game to determine
the true card shark)

1795
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:54,940
It is nerve-racking.

1796
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:59,150
By the way, we have more than
20 caramels in the proposal box.

1797
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:00,210
(There are more than 20 caramels
in the proposal box?)

1798
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,880
Jae Suk, Woo Jae, Haha,
and Se Chan paid up their caramels.

1799
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,250
- All right!
- I paid for mine too.

1800
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,530
- Jong Kook paid up too.
- Right. Jong Kook did too.

1801
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:08,320
I... Darn it.

1802
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,570
We have a one-fifth chance.

1803
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:12,190
- This will be our final bet.
- Gosh.

1804
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,570
Make me the chairperson.

1805
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:14,570
(It's time to pick a new chairperson.)

1806
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:15,800
All right. I'll draw one now.

1807
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,210
- Please...
- This is it.

1808
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:19,500
- You can totally win.
- Because you can turn the table.

1809
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,530
I think it'll be me.

1810
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,110
This round is a big one.

1811
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:24,250
- I'll go all in.
- You'll play with ease.

1812
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,170
- Then you can go all in.
- It's me.

1813
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:27,520
It's me.

1814
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:29,820
- The second chairperson.
- Please...

1815
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,320
Jae Suk won't be picked again, will he?

1816
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,110
(Everyone waits for the result
with bated breath.)

1817
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,590
- Jong Kook.
- All right!

1818
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:36,630
(Kim Jong Kook)

1819
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,050
(Jong Kook becomes the next chairperson.)

1820
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,730
- It'll be advantageous for him.
- I got this.

1821
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:41,230
It's completely advantageous for him.

1822
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,630
- I got this.
- Gosh, this is...

1823
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:45,030
It's advantageous for the chairperson.

1824
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:46,500
- It is advantageous.
- Everyone.

1825
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,730
This is the last round
for the card sharks.

1826
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:49,860
I must do well.

1827
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,400
It's Card Game of Wits
with your pride at stake.

1828
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,250
(It'll be carried out
with 4 people in a group.)

1829
00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:01,020
(There are red and blue cards with
numbers 1 to 10 written on them.)

1830
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,610
(Stick one of the red cards
on your forehead.)

1831
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:07,820
(Check the blue card on your own.)

1832
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:10,420
(After betting your caramel,)

1833
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:16,820
(the player with a higher
combination of numbers wins.)

1834
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:21,690
If one goes broke,
Haha will join the table.

1835
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:22,710
Okay.

1836
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:24,900
If no one goes broke,

1837
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,900
the player with the least caramel
will be eliminated,

1838
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,380
and Haha will join.

1839
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:32,710
The experienced ones know the game better.

1840
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,570
I just need to be good at it, right?

1841
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,050
- Of course!
- Of course!

1842
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:38,860
It's a matter of probability in the end.

1843
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:43,090
Now, please stick a card on your forehead.

1844
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:44,820
Gosh, this is...

1845
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,400
Don't look at the card,
and stick it on your forehead.

1846
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,590
Just stick a random card.

1847
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:49,270
- Let's do this.
- A random card.

1848
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:50,270
(They'll pick a card and stick it
on their forehead.)

1849
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:52,500
- All right.
- Do I stick it like this?

1850
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:54,400
Here we go.

1851
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,500
(Carefully picking a card)

1852
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:00,630
Let's see.

1853
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,610
- Time's up.
- All right.

1854
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:04,610
(They're done putting
the card on their forehead.)

1855
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:06,980
Check the hidden card on your own.

1856
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:07,980
The hidden card.

1857
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,210
This is the important part.

1858
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,840
The chairperson will go all in.

1859
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:13,980
(It's important to keep a poker face
no matter what number you see.)

1860
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,590
- Gosh.
- All right.

1861
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:17,750
(It's important to keep a poker face
no matter what number you see.)

1862
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:21,500
(They all carefully
check the hidden card.)

1863
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,090
Chairperson Kim, who should start first?

1864
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:25,570
I'll start first.
How many should we bet at first?

1865
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:26,940
Everyone should bet one each.

1866
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,460
- One each?
- I see.

1867
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:29,500
Here we go.

1868
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,980
If you throw it in the wrong box,
then that's it.

1869
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:33,730
Of course.

1870
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:34,900
All right, then.

1871
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:38,050
- I'll bet 1 first.
- He's betting 1.

1872
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:40,480
- Just one?
- I'll go all in at the end.

1873
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,920
Did you bet only one,
Chairperson Kim? My gosh.

1874
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,280
Here he goes again.

1875
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,520
He's going to start betting everything.

1876
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,860
- Goodness.
- I bet eight.

1877
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:53,000
- I bet eight.
- Woo Jae, it's your turn.

1878
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,000
Come on, guys.

1879
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:58,270
(The math lover was on about probability.)

1880
01:00:58,270 --> 01:00:59,400
I bet...

1881
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,860
(How many will he bet?)

1882
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,460
- I bet five.
- Five? No, that's not it.

1883
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,000
Since he bet eight, you should bet higher.

1884
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,280
- You should bet at least six.
- Oh, really?

1885
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,480
(He dropped one in Se Chan's box.)

1886
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,020
And since you dropped one
in Se Chan's box,

1887
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,380
you can't take it out again.

1888
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,520
- You saw that?
- Yes.

1889
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,520
- We all saw it.
- I thought you didn't.

1890
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:18,750
- We'll let it slide.
- Please let it slide.

1891
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,420
- Are you going to bet?
- I will...

1892
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,880
- You can bet on top of that.
- You can bet on top of that.

1893
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:26,150
But you have to bet
more than eight caramels.

1894
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,420
- Then I can't.
- You can't bet lower than that.

1895
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,820
- You have to bet 16.
- That's right.

1896
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:31,030
- He's bad at math.
- He is.

1897
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,960
Eight times two is sixteen.

1898
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:35,730
- He's an empty head.
- He really is.

1899
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,860
- How did he major in engineering?
- What's 8 plus 8?

1900
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,500
- It's 16.
- Then...

1901
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,710
- I just bet eight, didn't I?
- Then just say, "call."

1902
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:43,500
- Call.
- That's it.

1903
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,500
I'm out.

1904
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,520
(I'm out.)

1905
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,110
(He gives up fast.)

1906
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,210
You're out? Come on.

1907
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:51,690
- Gosh, he was Ppikku.
- He's Ppikku.

1908
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:53,520
- Hey!
- How could Aekku play like that?

1909
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,960
- I knew I'd lose.
- You're out?

1910
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,230
I'm out.

1911
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,250
I'm out too. I can't bet more.

1912
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,320
My number was too low.

1913
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,230
Since you both called for it,
you can open your cards now.

1914
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:04,070
Jae Suk, you guys
need to open your cards.

1915
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:06,530
- Are we revealing this card first?
- That's right.

1916
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,090
The two of you...

1917
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,500
It's seven!

1918
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,210
- It's 6 and 7.
- It's 7?

1919
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:13,210
- It was pretty high.
- It was.

1920
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:15,400
I don't think he knew.

1921
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,150
(Jae Suk is ahead by 1.
What is his hidden card?)

1922
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,300
Woo Jae called for it.

1923
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,210
You should show yours first.

1924
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:21,210
- Seven.
- Seven and seven.

1925
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:23,020
- It's 14.
- Woo Jae won.

1926
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:24,020
(Jae Suk's total score is 14.)

1927
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:27,210
(Woo Jae's hidden card needs to be
higher than 8 for him to win.)

1928
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:28,880
- What is it?
- I think it's ten.

1929
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,380
(Which player will take
all the caramels to himself?)

1930
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:32,730
- Come on!
- Yours was five?

1931
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:35,130
- I won.
- I think it's ten.

1932
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,630
(Jae Suk wins.)

1933
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:39,300
- He's bad at it!
- He's so bad at math!

1934
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,570
How did he get into Hongik University?

1935
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:41,590
We discard these, right?

1936
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:43,130
Yes, you should discard
the cards you used.

1937
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:45,110
- I'm so glad the number was low.
- All right.

1938
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:47,110
He's an empty head.

1939
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:48,300
He really is a pushover.

1940
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,900
- He's a bit...
- All right, now.

1941
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:51,900
(They move on to the next round.)

1942
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:55,250
- All right.
- He's got this.

1943
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:56,590
(Pushover Joo picked 9.)

1944
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:58,250
Please check your hidden card.

1945
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,190
- He looks relaxed.
- My card...

1946
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,420
The line...

1947
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:07,730
(The line...)

1948
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,960
- The bottom bar.
- Oh, is that so?

1949
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:11,960
(It must be hard for him to read numbers.)

1950
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,130
That fool.

1951
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,590
- He's so dumb.
- You actually revealed...

1952
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,840
- It's either 6 or 9.
- the number you picked.

1953
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,110
You fool. Gosh.

1954
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:20,000
- It's either 6 or 9.
- Oh, right.

1955
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:21,480
I got this.

1956
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:24,750
- My hidden card...
- This is...

1957
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,940
(It's 10!)

1958
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,380
(Keeping a poker face)

1959
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,110
Woo Jae should go first since he lost.

1960
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:33,610
(Woo Jae starts the bet.)

1961
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:37,130
(Everyone's eye is on Woo Jae
as the card on his forehead says 9.)

1962
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,770
(Pushover Joo goes all in.)

1963
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,530
(He bets all 35 caramels.)

1964
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,730
- How many are they?
- That's 36 caramels.

1965
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:49,300
No, I bet 35 caramels.

1966
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,130
- He bet 35 caramels.
- I'm out.

1967
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:52,380
(I'm out!)

1968
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,000
- Gosh, you are...
- Aren't you going to play at all?

1969
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,710
It's too low! I couldn't make a bet.

1970
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:58,500
Then the numbers you'll pick later
will be high.

1971
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,110
It will be crazy high.

1972
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:01,380
He bet 35 caramels?

1973
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,690
Let's go all in!

1974
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:03,710
Hold on.

1975
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:06,520
It's because...

1976
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,820
I must bet on a big round.

1977
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:12,500
- Do I have enough?
- Just put it on top.

1978
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,530
Call.

1979
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:14,900
All right. That's 36 caramels.

1980
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,070
It could go beyond that.

1981
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:17,420
Or won't it?

1982
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,030
- All right. It's Jae Suk's turn.
- I should bet at least two.

1983
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:20,690
- Gosh, this is...
- It's Jae Suk's turn.

1984
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:21,770
Go for it.

1985
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,960
- Here comes the beggar.
- It's just one round.

1986
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,570
- Here comes the debtor.
- I can't join this round.

1987
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,900
It's because we join after seeing the bet.

1988
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,480
- Jae Suk can't do this either.
- I can't join the round.

1989
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,210
- No.
- We join after seeing the bet.

1990
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:31,570
- There are only two of them.
- Woo Jae.

1991
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:33,780
I think he made his bet
because the number is high.

1992
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,150
- Let's check your hidden card.
- You'll open your cards, right?

1993
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:37,590
You should open yours first.
The card on your forehead is high.

1994
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,150
- It's nine.
- What's your hidden card?

1995
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:40,250
I think it's ten.

1996
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,530
(It's 10?)

1997
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,420
- What's your hidden card?
- I think it's ten.

1998
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,420
(The total is 19.)

1999
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:50,130
I lost. I can't beat that.

2000
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:51,630
I lost.

2001
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:52,670
Let's reset this round.

2002
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:53,770
(Let's reset this round!)

2003
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,110
(The chairperson resets the round.)

2004
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:57,960
Let's reset this round.

2005
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,300
(He'll reset this round?)

2006
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,480
Let's reset it.

2007
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,670
- All right!
- Let's reset it.

2008
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:04,400
- Let's reset it.
- All right!

2009
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,920
- Wait a minute.
- Please discard your cards.

2010
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,320
- Please think again.
- We need to discard the cards.

2011
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,020
Discard your cards.
Discard the good cards.

2012
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:10,250
- You must discard them.
- Discard the good cards.

2013
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:12,380
- You too.
- This is hilarious.

2014
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:13,480
Okay, let's take back the caramels.

2015
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,380
- This is what Running Man is like.
- We need to make our winning moves.

2016
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:17,130
- We need to make our winning moves.
- Let's play!

2017
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:19,050
Let's play!
We need to make our winning moves now.

2018
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:21,420
It's all about one big shot. You know it.

2019
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:22,800
Jae Suk, it's all about one big shot.

2020
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,170
I'm waiting for that big shot.

2021
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,000
- Let's play.
- Stick the card on your forehead.

2022
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,230
- But this is...
- This is fun.

2023
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:30,360
- It's really fun.
- Let's see.

2024
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,960
It's fun just watching from the side.

2025
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:32,980
Jong Kook can't reset
the round anymore, right?

2026
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:34,230
- He can't.
- I can't.

2027
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:37,300
(Checking Jae Suk's card)

2028
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,380
Check your card.

2029
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:39,670
Right. Did you check yours?

2030
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:40,820
Shall we begin?

2031
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,250
This is the important round.

2032
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,380
- Yes.
- Woo Jae, please go first.

2033
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:48,590
(Chuckling)

2034
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:49,650
He is determined.

2035
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,420
(The man with number 1
wants to win this time.)

2036
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,550
I can't help but laugh.

2037
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:56,590
- It's such a funny sight.
- This is insane.

2038
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:57,900
All right.

2039
01:05:58,170 --> 01:05:59,590
- Shall we begin?
- Yes.

2040
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,360
It's entertaining to watch them
from the side.

2041
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:04,610
(Pushover Joo bets first.)

2042
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:05,730
Look at Woo Jae.

2043
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:07,610
- He can't reset the round anymore.
- No.

2044
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,340
He is annoyed.

2045
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,650
Ten caramels?

2046
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,980
No.

2047
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,520
(10 caramels? No.)

2048
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,610
I will bet 15 caramels.

2049
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:16,940
- Look at that.
- You will bet 15 caramels.

2050
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,250
- Do that.
- He is nice.

2051
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:19,550
All right.

2052
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:23,550
It's your first time to bet, Ppikku.

2053
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:25,250
(Ppikku enters the game
for the first time.)

2054
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,630
That's new.

2055
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:27,820
It's your first time to bet.

2056
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:29,530
Why are you calling me Ppikku
before the game?

2057
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:31,070
- Why are you betting?
- Did you smell something?

2058
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:32,460
Here are 15 caramels.

2059
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,840
It's Ppikku's first time to bet.

2060
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,130
- And...
- And...

2061
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:37,840
Six, eight, ten.

2062
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,210
- Ppikku.
- Two...

2063
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:42,610
- Six, eight, ten.
- Is this a race?

2064
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:44,880
- I will bet 20 more caramels.
- So 35 caramels in total.

2065
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,210
(Se Chan submitted 15 the 1st time
and 20 the 2nd time.)

2066
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,840
The number he checked must be ten.

2067
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:49,780
(Ppikku bet 35 caramels in total...)

2068
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,150
The number he checked must be ten.

2069
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:52,360
(while maintaining a poker face.)

2070
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:53,590
I fold.

2071
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:55,190
- You will fold.
- Yes.

2072
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,780
- I will fold.
- You will fold.

2073
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,900
Woo Jae, you need to go all in.

2074
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,320
Can I keep playing if I go all in?

2075
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,960
- Go all in.
- Do you have 20 caramels?

2076
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,030
I have 20 caramels.

2077
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:08,190
- Two, four, six, eight, ten.
- Go all in.

2078
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,800
Two, four, six, eight...

2079
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,900
- I will fold.
- Okay.

2080
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:14,670
(He suddenly folds.)

2081
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:16,210
- Are you serious?
- You folded.

2082
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,800
- You fool!
- Are you serious?

2083
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,150
You can't do math.

2084
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,150
- Come on.
- Check the cards.

2085
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:23,090
- What's your card?
- You should have gone all in.

2086
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:26,280
(My goodness.)

2087
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:30,030
(Was it number 8?)

2088
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:32,280
- What's this number?
- Why can't you do calculations?

2089
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,230
- My goodness.
- Are you a fool?

2090
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:37,460
- What's this number?
- Why can't you do calculations?

2091
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:39,400
- My goodness. Why did you...
- Are you a fool?

2092
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,630
(He folded even though he had number 9.)

2093
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:42,000
(Woo Jae's total was 17.)

2094
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,360
- Why did you...
- What's his total?

2095
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,570
It's 17.

2096
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,340
- Why did you fold?
- What's your total?

2097
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,710
- Were his numbers 8 and 9?
- Yes. They were 8 and 9.

2098
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:49,210
My total was 15.

2099
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:50,440
His total was 15.

2100
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,710
Why did you fold?

2101
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:53,440
(Woo Jae's total: 17
Se Chan's total: 15)

2102
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,150
Why did you fold?

2103
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:57,420
- That's too bad.
- Are you a fool?

2104
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:58,920
Gosh, this is sweet.

2105
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,210
- You should have studied people.
- What is up with you?

2106
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:02,590
Woo Jae.

2107
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:03,960
Thank you.

2108
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,750
This is an allowance from Woo Jae.
This is sweet.

2109
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,030
- This is sweet.
- Let's eat it.

2110
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:08,230
- My goodness.
- It's tasty.

2111
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:09,900
- Woo Jae.
- Why didn't you go all in?

2112
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,320
- Are you a fool?
- It's tasty.

2113
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,630
I had already used 9 and 10.

2114
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:16,130
- You should have taken a chance.
- It's mathematics.

2115
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,230
(The novice gambler chickened out.)

2116
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:18,360
- Hey.
- How many...

2117
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,530
What are you really good at?

2118
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:20,800
(What are you really good at?)

2119
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:22,170
How many more did you need to bet?

2120
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:23,500
- Shall we go?
- He is really bad at this.

2121
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:26,380
- The loser will get eliminated now.
- Okay.

2122
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:28,380
- The forehead.
- It will be Woo Jae or me.

2123
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:29,610
I will put a number on my forehead.

2124
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:30,780
Woo Jae or...

2125
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:33,090
Will I be able to do well
and win some caramels this time?

2126
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:34,960
(Everyone put a number on his forehead.)

2127
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,030
My goodness.

2128
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:40,300
- The hand card.
- Yes. Check the card.

2129
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,630
(Jae Suk has 19 caramels
and Woo Jae has 20 caramels.)

2130
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:43,230
Please.

2131
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:45,120
- Please let me succeed this once.
- I need number nine.

2132
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,660
- Come on.
- I can't get eliminated.

2133
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:49,240
(They check the hidden card
that is important in placing a bet.)

2134
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:52,160
Five caramels.

2135
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,540
(Five caramels.)

2136
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:54,780
(Ppikku bets in a daring way.)

2137
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:56,500
When you are rich...

2138
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:59,950
Why do I always get a small number
for my hand card?

2139
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,710
I want to join that round.

2140
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:05,520
- I will fold.
- Wait for the next round.

2141
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:07,190
- Next is Jae Suk.
- As for me...

2142
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:08,820
How many caramels do I have?

2143
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,330
- He will bet caramels.
- Of course.

2144
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:13,250
On top of five caramels...

2145
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:15,250
- Will you bet everything?
- Yes.

2146
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:16,960
- Six.
- He is serious.

2147
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,700
I will bet 14 more caramels.

2148
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,570
(Jae Suk submitted 5 the 1st time
and 14 the 2nd time.)

2149
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:21,590
He bet 14 more caramels.

2150
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,000
You need to bet 19 caramels.

2151
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,570
- Woo Jae.
- Woo Jae, go all in.

2152
01:09:25,570 --> 01:09:28,240
You won't get to play the next game
if you fold this time.

2153
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:29,700
You will have
the smallest number of caramels.

2154
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,370
- So you have to go all in.
- No.

2155
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:32,450
- No?
- No.

2156
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:35,340
- If Jae Suk loses, I will survive.
- That's right.

2157
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:36,410
You are good.

2158
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:37,520
I will wait...

2159
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:39,790
for the next round. I will fold.

2160
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:42,250
- The next round?
- Yes.

2161
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,990
- If Jae Suk wins this round,
- Is that your decision?

2162
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:46,030
- you will get eliminated.
- That's right.

2163
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:47,590
What happens if I fold now?

2164
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:49,530
- Then Woo Jae will get eliminated.
- He will get eliminated.

2165
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,740
(If Se Chan folds,
Jae Suk will win caramels.)

2166
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:54,870
What did he do?

2167
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:56,160
(What did he do?)

2168
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,740
You should have betted caramels.

2169
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,540
I wasn't going to bet more caramels.

2170
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,200
What did you do? You folded, right?

2171
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,840
- Is that possible?
- Of course.

2172
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,580
- If you have the smallest number...
- He is right, Woo Jae.

2173
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,040
- You folded already.
- It's up to Se Chan's decision.

2174
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,380
(Se Chan's decision
will determine the loser.)

2175
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,990
I will fold.

2176
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:13,450
- Really?
- Will you fold?

2177
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:15,520
(I will fold!)

2178
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:17,830
- In that case...
- Listen.

2179
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:19,400
Woo Jae got eliminated.

2180
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,730
- No.
- I folded.

2181
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:22,050
- Woo Jae got eliminated.
- Number two?

2182
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:23,590
- He had number two.
- That's right.

2183
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:25,790
- Was your total only 6?
- I had number 1.

2184
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,790
- I am back in the game.
- Good job.

2185
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:29,770
- I am back in the game.
- Woo Jae.

2186
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:31,800
- Woo Jae, go home.
- Go.

2187
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,130
Get him a taxi.

2188
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:34,280
- Go away.
- Why didn't you listen?

2189
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,670
- You got eliminated.
- Woo Jae.

2190
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:38,240
- He kept talking about mathematics.
- Pushover Joo, go away.

2191
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:40,620
Woo Jae, you are unbelievable.

2192
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:44,020
Woo Jae, give me your hat.

2193
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:45,880
- You need to give him the hat.
- Give me the hat.

2194
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,050
And bring me water.

2195
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,750
Woo Jae.

2196
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:51,660
- Yes?
- Would you bring me a latte?

2197
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:53,090
- What?
- Latte.

2198
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:54,620
- Do you need anything?
- Latte.

2199
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:56,370
- I have water.
- Woo Jae, bring me water too.

2200
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:58,900
- "Woo Jae, bring me water too."
- Latte.

2201
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,160
Is there a latte?

2202
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,440
This is the semifinal.

2203
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,130
Now, it feels like...

2204
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:06,700
- the real deal.
- The real gamblers have gathered.

2205
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,740
Put a number on your forehead.

2206
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:10,410
Now is the time I place a bet.

2207
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:11,800
- Now is the time.
- Now is the time.

2208
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,020
Now is the time.

2209
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,620
I will place a bet
without checking my number.

2210
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,240
(Checking)

2211
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:17,910
I will place a bet
without checking my number.

2212
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,710
- Woo Jae.
- You checked the number.

2213
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:21,990
- What are you saying?
- I won't check my number.

2214
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:23,190
- Didn't you check it?
- You checked it.

2215
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:24,660
- I didn't check it.
- You checked it.

2216
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:25,900
- I didn't check it.
- Go ahead.

2217
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,750
- I'm sure you did.
- Jae Suk will go first.

2218
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:29,960
I will bet five caramels.

2219
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,530
(Jae Suk submitted 5 caramels.)

2220
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,770
(Solemn)

2221
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:36,460
- There he goes.
- He is ready to bet.

2222
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,000
Grandpa will bet.

2223
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:39,330
On top of five caramels...

2224
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:40,940
(On top of five caramels...)

2225
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:42,170
"All of us will die."

2226
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,910
- I will bet ten more caramels.
- Okay.

2227
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:47,170
- What?
- Let's get a new chairperson.

2228
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,870
(Let's get a new chairperson.)

2229
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:50,040
I submitted caramels in advance.

2230
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,410
I will submit 20 caramels.

2231
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:54,080
(While Pushover Joo was suffering,)

2232
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,660
(Haha quietly submitted caramels.)

2233
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:59,620
I will change the chairperson
when I enter the game.

2234
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:04,120
He submitted caramels in advance
to change the chairperson.

2235
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,120
Will you be the new chairperson?

2236
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:07,070
- It's meaningless.
- I will fold.

2237
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:09,540
I will fold.

2238
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,070
(Se Chan decides to fold.)

2239
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:12,160
I will fold too.

2240
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:13,500
Follow me.

2241
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,700
(Provoking)

2242
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:16,740
Even if you win caramels...

2243
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:19,320
- The chairperson will reset it.
- That's right. He will reset it.

2244
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,580
There is no reason to enter
a round with the chairperson.

2245
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:24,820
- Really?
- Of course.

2246
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:26,490
- It's best to fold now.
- Yes.

2247
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:29,160
Just let him take back his caramels.

2248
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:31,330
If you have a high number,
you should keep going.

2249
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:32,860
- I bet five caramels already.
- Then you should keep going.

2250
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:34,420
- We have a new chairperson now.
- Hey!

2251
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:38,570
I will change the chairperson.

2252
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:40,160
- I bet five caramels already.
- Then you should keep going.

2253
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,570
- We have a new chairperson now.
- Hey!

2254
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:42,630
(They have a new chairperson now.)

2255
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:44,370
- Give it to me.
- This is great.

2256
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,080
- This is great.
- Give it to me.

2257
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,440
I will bet ten caramels.

2258
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:51,300
- Bring it.
- I placed a bet.

2259
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,610
- Hey.
- Good timing.

2260
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:53,840
We are on the same side!

2261
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,150
- Let's go.
- Haha.

2262
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:56,380
You little...

2263
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,380
Why are you doing this to me today?

2264
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:00,320
- What did I do wrong?
- It's not like that.

2265
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,660
Tell me one thing.

2266
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:03,230
What did I do wrong?

2267
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:04,250
- You were too boastful.
- What?

2268
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:05,550
I didn't like your boastful tone.

2269
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:07,330
- Good job.
- For goodness' sake.

2270
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:08,700
He only comes after me.

2271
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,420
- Good job.
- Do you only have eyes for me?

2272
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,490
I am set.

2273
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:13,590
- Good job. Nice timing.
- Sit down.

2274
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:14,740
How dare you?

2275
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:16,070
- Nice timing.
- I am the chairperson.

2276
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:17,300
Let's reveal the numbers.

2277
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:18,830
Let's reveal the numbers.

2278
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:20,940
Okay.
It's a match between Haha and Jae Suk.

2279
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,980
- Let's reveal the numbers.
- I will check the forehead card.

2280
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,170
- The number is big.
- Is it big?

2281
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:26,240
Yes.

2282
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,340
It's big.

2283
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:28,740
His number is too small.

2284
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:30,290
His hidden card might show a big number.

2285
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:31,790
The hand card.

2286
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:32,860
(The hidden card might make a difference.)

2287
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:34,320
One, two, three.

2288
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:35,990
Take the caramels.

2289
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:37,160
Two, three.

2290
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,550
- Take the caramels.
- Okay.

2291
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:41,620
(Jae Suk won.)

2292
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:45,200
(Haha lost more hair.)

2293
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,370
I did it.

2294
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:47,660
I did it.

2295
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,410
It's over.

2296
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,200
What?

2297
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:53,670
It's the rule. Sit down, old man.

2298
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:56,480
You little punk. That's no way to behave!

2299
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,910
- You are such an old fossil.
- I will get back at you.

2300
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:01,620
- Let's go.
- I am so annoyed.

2301
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,540
He is so annoying!

2302
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:05,190
What is up with you today?

2303
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:07,210
- It's just that I like you.
- Hey.

2304
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:09,320
- He drives me crazy.
- Hey,

2305
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,330
- put a card on your forehead.
- Let's smile.

2306
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:13,450
- Let's smile, okay?
- Let's smile.

2307
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:15,420
This is no joke.

2308
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:16,920
- Let's smile.
- Let's smile.

2309
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,090
Let's smile.

2310
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:19,330
(They reveal the forehead card
with a smile.)

2311
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:20,540
Smile as you play the game.

2312
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,940
- Let's see.
- The hand card.

2313
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:24,570
Haha is the worst at this game.

2314
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,700
- Seriously.
- I don't know why he criticized me.

2315
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,170
For goodness' sake.

2316
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:36,320
(Jong Kook's hidden card is number 1.)

2317
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,950
What is up with my luck?

2318
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:40,660
(Se Chan, the chairperson,)

2319
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,050
- You know...
- I will bet ten caramels.

2320
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:43,550
(bets 10 caramels.)

2321
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:46,920
(Chairperson Yang bets freely
since he can reset the round.)

2322
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,330
Vroom.

2323
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:50,400
(Solemn)

2324
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,490
- Will you change the chairperson?
- Hold on.

2325
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:55,460
I will change the chairperson.

2326
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:58,700
(Will you change the chairperson?)

2327
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:00,000
- Bet as much as you want.
- That's good.

2328
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,410
- Really?
- That's good.

2329
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:02,410
Suk Jin became the new chairperson.

2330
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:03,450
Bring it.

2331
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,670
What did I do wrong?

2332
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:06,840
- Suk Jin.
- Bring it.

2333
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,320
I thought you were my gganbu.

2334
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,520
- Your boastful self is an eyesore.
- I thought you were my gganbu.

2335
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,620
Bring it.

2336
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:13,450
- Unbelievable.
- Listen.

2337
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:15,290
I still have caramels.

2338
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:17,160
- You really brought a latte.
- Latte.

2339
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,380
Did he bring a latte?

2340
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,250
You really brought a latte.

2341
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,860
- Yes. It's a latte.
- Thank you.

2342
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:24,120
Hey, kid. Bring me patbingsu.

2343
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,440
(Kid?)

2344
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,700
Hey.

2345
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,440
Here is a tip.

2346
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,500
(When Haha throws a caramel,)

2347
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,240
(Kid Joo picks it up without hesitation.)

2348
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,700
Woo Jae, I am sorry.

2349
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,910
It's tasty.

2350
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,040
How many caramels are you betting?

2351
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:42,450
I am betting ten more caramels.

2352
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:43,520
- Ten more caramels?
- Yes.

2353
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:46,320
My goodness.

2354
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,790
(He hesitates
because Haha's forehead card is 10.)

2355
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:48,880
Bring it on.

2356
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:50,730
- Will you place a bet?
- Yes.

2357
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:51,730
Let's see the numbers.

2358
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:52,750
I have no other choice.

2359
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:54,530
I think I will lose.

2360
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:57,290
There is a big difference.

2361
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:58,460
Your number was one.

2362
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,070
Se Chan.

2363
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:01,370
It was one.

2364
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:02,910
- My other number was ten.
- Here.

2365
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,980
(Se Chan trusted his hidden card,
but his forehead card was one.)

2366
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,440
It was a good match.

2367
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,650
Here. It was a good match.

2368
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:11,910
Good job.

2369
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:14,620
- Is the total 15?
- He did well.

2370
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:16,240
With number ten, he was bound to win.

2371
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,240
Hey, kid.

2372
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,040
(Take this.)

2373
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:22,250
Would you like condensed milk
or regular milk with your patbingsu?

2374
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:24,120
- What?
- This won't do.

2375
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,230
- Shall we begin?
- Hey!

2376
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:26,790
What are you doing?

2377
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,530
Let me join the game.

2378
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:30,090
He is a thief!

2379
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,330
Let me join the game.

2380
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:32,870
- What?
- What do you mean, "What?"

2381
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:34,660
It's good as long as you don't get caught.

2382
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,770
He got caught.

2383
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:37,240
Did he get caught? Then he is a thief.

2384
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:38,830
Let's go.

2385
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:41,300
How did I get ten?

2386
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,240
(Both of them have number 10!)

2387
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:45,910
Let's go.

2388
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:47,620
(Even Se Chan has 10!)

2389
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:54,190
(3 people's forehead cards
show number 10.)

2390
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:57,790
The numbers aren't very big today.

2391
01:16:58,490 --> 01:16:59,790
This will be fun.

2392
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:01,830
It's your turn.

2393
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:03,090
(Everywhere he looks,)

2394
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:04,120
(there is number 10.)

2395
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,460
(He can't help but laugh.)

2396
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,870
He is like an old man
you see in a cartoon.

2397
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:10,040
(He just laughs.)

2398
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,070
All right.

2399
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:12,660
Let's go.

2400
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:13,670
(The weak gambler goes first.)

2401
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,040
- Five caramels.
- Will he go all in?

2402
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,080
It has begun.

2403
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,300
Five caramels.

2404
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:18,780
I will go all in.

2405
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:22,580
(He goes all in even after seeing
Jong Kook and Se Chan's number 10!)

2406
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:23,740
- He will fold.
- I will fold.

2407
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:25,650
Will he bet caramels?

2408
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:26,880
I will fold.

2409
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,160
Se Chan, will you place a bet?

2410
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,160
You should.

2411
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,530
No. I will fold.

2412
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:32,690
You should have placed a bet.

2413
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:34,330
(He checks his forehead card.)

2414
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:36,230
- What's your total?
- Why did you...

2415
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:37,770
- Hey.
- What's your total?

2416
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:38,770
It's 17.

2417
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:39,770
(Se Chan's total is 17.)

2418
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:40,870
What was my number?

2419
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:41,940
(Jae Suk checks his card as well.)

2420
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,160
- Your total is higher, right?
- Hey.

2421
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,070
All 3 of you had 10.

2422
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:46,200
- Really?
- What was your hand card?

2423
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,500
Jae Suk, what was it?

2424
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:49,500
- The hand card.
- I can't tell you that.

2425
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:51,040
His total must be smaller than yours.

2426
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,580
My hand card has a small number.

2427
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:54,840
This is driving me crazy.

2428
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,620
You know, it's annoying...

2429
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:59,380
that I can't join the game.

2430
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:02,360
(Regardless of Suk Jin's wait,
the game continues.)

2431
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:03,830
I will enjoy the caramels.

2432
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:06,900
He went all in,
so Suk Jin should join the game.

2433
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:08,530
- Did he go all in?
- Suk Jin should join the game.

2434
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:10,870
- Did he go all in?
- I will join the game.

2435
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,490
Se Chan went bankrupt.

2436
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:15,490
You guys are weak.

2437
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:16,830
The real gambler is here.

2438
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:19,460
The real gambler is here.

2439
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:24,340
It has been a while since I played cards.

2440
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,620
He was desperate to play this game.

2441
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:29,320
I was about to go crazy.

2442
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,710
He waited until you guys went quiet.

2443
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:34,660
I was full of regrets.

2444
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:38,290
I waited all day long to play this game.

2445
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:41,660
It wasn't even about the shoot.
He wanted to play this game.

2446
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,070
Old man, you got a haircut.

2447
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:44,700
- Yes.
- I see.

2448
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,230
- He shaved his head.
- Let's begin.

2449
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:47,700
Put a card on your forehead.

2450
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:48,990
Let's begin.

2451
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,070
All right.

2452
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:52,040
- I should be a chairperson.
- Chairperson.

2453
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,670
You can't change the chairperson now.

2454
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:54,740
Let's begin.

2455
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:55,830
(Woo Jae became the chairperson
for the fair game.)

2456
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:57,370
Don't do that now.

2457
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:59,710
The winner will become
the Card Shark of the Year.

2458
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:00,910
- The Card Shark of the Year.
- The Card Shark of the Year.

2459
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:02,620
I really want that title.

2460
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:03,620
Let's go.

2461
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:05,410
(Jong Kook, Jae Suk, Haha, and Suk Jin)

2462
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:06,820
I waited a long time.

2463
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:09,620
One caramel.

2464
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,860
I will bet five caramels on top of that.

2465
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,530
He is cool.

2466
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,700
One, two, three, four, and five.

2467
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:18,490
- "And five."
- I will fold.

2468
01:19:18,990 --> 01:19:20,400
- I will fold.
- I will fold.

2469
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:21,490
Me too.

2470
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:22,900
(Haha gives up as well.)

2471
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:24,940
You guys are weak.

2472
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,740
My hand card had a small number.

2473
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:28,370
Is this all you can do?

2474
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:29,610
That wasn't a fun round.

2475
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,410
Is it a good idea to show the cards?

2476
01:19:31,410 --> 01:19:33,480
- It doesn't matter.
- All right then.

2477
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,340
His numbers were 5 and 4.

2478
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:36,790
- They were 5 and 4.
- Those numbers are out.

2479
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:38,540
- Those numbers are out.
- They were 5 and 4.

2480
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:39,580
He won three caramels.

2481
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:40,790
It doesn't matter.

2482
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:42,320
Suk Jin, you should give away
one caramel.

2483
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,420
He won three caramels.

2484
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:44,920
Kid, eat one.

2485
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:46,550
Okay. Let's begin.

2486
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:47,660
He won two caramels.

2487
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:49,360
He gave away one.

2488
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:51,900
You have to wait for the right time.

2489
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,130
(The second set of forehead cards
is revealed.)

2490
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,270
Let's see.

2491
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:56,330
Do I bet first?

2492
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,460
Yes. I will bet three caramels.

2493
01:19:58,940 --> 01:19:59,980
Maybe I should bet five caramels.

2494
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:01,780
- Five.
- Bet more caramels.

2495
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:03,870
Bet more caramels
to liven up the atmosphere.

2496
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:06,780
- I just feel bad for you.
- Bet more caramels.

2497
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:08,520
Okay. Ten.

2498
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,520
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

2499
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:11,620
- Ten caramels.
- Okay.

2500
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:12,710
(He bets 10 caramels.)

2501
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:14,380
- Jong Kook.
- I will fold.

2502
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:15,620
- I will fold too.
- Me too.

2503
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:16,750
It was a good round.

2504
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:17,750
- I will fold too.
- Me too.

2505
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:18,950
It was a good round.

2506
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:20,250
(Did everyone fold this time as well?)

2507
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:22,620
It was a good round.

2508
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:24,830
- Hey.
- My numbers were too low.

2509
01:20:24,830 --> 01:20:25,870
(The second game was so boring
that it almost got edited out.)

2510
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:28,130
Bet enough caramels
to liven up the atmosphere.

2511
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:29,200
Aren't you going to place a bet?

2512
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,000
- He really wanted to play the game.
- Hey.

2513
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,460
Why did you fold when my number was three?

2514
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:33,480
Go.

2515
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,540
(It's time to compete.)

2516
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:35,780
I am ready.

2517
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:38,410
- I won't check the hidden card.
- All right.

2518
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:39,780
- I won't check it.
- All right. Don't do it.

2519
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:40,820
All right.

2520
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,620
(He puts a card on his forehead.)

2521
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:43,690
Don't look at it.

2522
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:46,450
- Don't do that.
- Won't you check it?

2523
01:20:46,690 --> 01:20:48,080
Check the hidden card.

2524
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,550
Won't you check it?

2525
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:50,730
I won't check it either.

2526
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:52,120
All right. I won't check it.

2527
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,360
- Put it in front of you.
- I...

2528
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,120
I will check it.

2529
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,370
- I won't check it either.
- I won't check it.

2530
01:20:57,370 --> 01:20:58,830
- I will check it later.
- Put it down afterward.

2531
01:20:58,830 --> 01:20:59,830
All right.

2532
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,570
- Okay.
- I won't check it either.

2533
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:03,040
I won't check it. I will check it later.

2534
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,270
Put it down afterward.

2535
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:06,160
- I won't check it either.
- It just weakens your resolve.

2536
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,110
Jae Suk will bet first.

2537
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:10,150
- Jae Suk.
- Okay.

2538
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:11,300
All right.

2539
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:12,980
(Jae Suk submitted 1 caramel.)

2540
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,080
On top of that, I will go all in.

2541
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:16,040
Why would you do that?

2542
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,650
Sit back if you aren't going to go all in.

2543
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,540
What's your forehead number? Let's see.

2544
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,520
Did you check your hidden card?

2545
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,660
No, I didn't.

2546
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:24,620
- Mister, chicken out if you want.
- Yes.

2547
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:25,690
Go all in.

2548
01:21:25,690 --> 01:21:27,750
This is your last chance.

2549
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,750
- Chicken out if you want.
- Do that.

2550
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:31,830
- Why would you check that?
- You can't do that.

2551
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:33,870
- Chicken out if you want.
- Do that.

2552
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:35,130
(Taking a peek)

2553
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:36,370
You can't do that.

2554
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:37,540
That was the condition.

2555
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:38,800
- That was the condition.
- Why did you look?

2556
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,580
- You said you won't look.
- That was the condition.

2557
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:42,330
- Give me a break.
- Why did you look?

2558
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:44,040
- Give me a break. It's my choice.
- That was the condition.

2559
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,580
- That's ridiculous.
- You can't do that.

2560
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:48,150
- I won't place a bet.
- Why did you look?

2561
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:49,340
- Hey.
- I won't place a bet.

2562
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:50,840
- Think about it.
- Seriously.

2563
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:52,710
Why did you look?

2564
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:54,550
Who places a bet
without checking the card?

2565
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:56,160
- Why did you look?
- Only a fool would do that!

2566
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,950
You promised to play the game
without checking the card.

2567
01:21:57,950 --> 01:22:00,400
Don't corner him like that.

2568
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,900
You won't look cool.

2569
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,420
- I don't care about that.
- Suk Jin.

2570
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:05,230
This game involves two cards!

2571
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:06,660
I went all in because you said
you won't check the card.

2572
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,090
Just fold then.

2573
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,040
- For goodness' sake.
- All right. Take out the caramels.

2574
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,960
Is this mustache fake?

2575
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,370
What are you doing?

2576
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:15,740
For goodness' sake.

2577
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:17,340
I can't believe you.

2578
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,540
What?

2579
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:20,340
Don't check the card.
Be cool and just place a bet.

2580
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:21,980
- Why would you check the card?
- That's the real match.

2581
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:23,710
He checked the card.

2582
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:24,790
I didn't check it.

2583
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:26,380
I swear that I didn't check it.

2584
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:28,490
I will make a decision based on
their reaction to the card.

2585
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:30,580
- Okay.
- No. Show me the card.

2586
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:31,860
Come here.

2587
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,190
The two of you placed a bet, right?

2588
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:34,400
- Stay there.
- Listen.

2589
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,920
Stay there. I will show you the card.

2590
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,030
- Okay.
- You can't show anyone else.

2591
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:38,070
I bet 34 caramels.

2592
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:40,330
If you keep getting angry,
I won't play the game.

2593
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,590
Don't be ridiculous.

2594
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:43,040
You guys are the absolute worst.

2595
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,040
Mister.

2596
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,040
Listen.

2597
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,940
Mister, did you say
that you won't check the card?

2598
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:50,110
- Yes, I did.
- Then you shouldn't check the card.

2599
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:52,540
- You said it yourself.
- So I made a compromise.

2600
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:54,370
I will make a decision based on
their reaction to the card.

2601
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:55,580
- Come on.
- Mister.

2602
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:56,910
You said it yourself.

2603
01:22:56,910 --> 01:22:59,340
- I swear that I didn't check it.
- Okay.

2604
01:23:00,490 --> 01:23:01,910
Listen to me.

2605
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:04,230
- I swear that I didn't check it.
- Okay.

2606
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:07,790
(What?)

2607
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:09,450
Mister.

2608
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:11,490
- Whatever. I will place a bet.
- You said it yourself.

2609
01:23:11,490 --> 01:23:12,960
I will go all in.

2610
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,290
- I placed my bet.
- Let's go.

2611
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:15,400
I bet more caramels.

2612
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,660
Didn't you check your card?

2613
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:17,910
- I really didn't.
- Jae Suk.

2614
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,330
You saw my number, right?

2615
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:21,040
- Hold on.
- Suk Jin.

2616
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,800
Why did you show me?

2617
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,580
(He belatedly realized
that he showed everyone.)

2618
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:27,170
Why did you show everyone?

2619
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:30,340
Seriously. Why did you show everyone?

2620
01:23:30,490 --> 01:23:32,040
- Everyone saw it.
- Seriously.

2621
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:33,860
He was supposed to show us only.

2622
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:35,320
- I didn't see it.
- Everyone saw it.

2623
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,920
He was supposed to show us only.

2624
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:39,830
- You saw it, right?
- No.

2625
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:41,730
- I didn't see it.
- Everyone saw it.

2626
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,700
Why did you show me?

2627
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:45,590
I must be insane.

2628
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:48,400
I doubted my eyes.

2629
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,110
Why did you show me?

2630
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:51,270
Why did you see it, you punk?

2631
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:53,370
What kind of a question is that?
You are the one who showed me.

2632
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:54,410
Why did you see it?

2633
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:55,610
You showed me.

2634
01:23:55,610 --> 01:23:56,910
You should have closed your eyes!

2635
01:23:57,670 --> 01:23:58,780
That makes no sense.

2636
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:00,120
- We should have closed our eyes?
- Come on.

2637
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,840
- Why did you show us?
- I don't know.

2638
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:02,980
You guys shouldn't place a bet.

2639
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:05,040
I will place a bet.

2640
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,190
Will you place a bet?

2641
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,820
- Didn't you check your card?
- No.

2642
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:10,080
This is driving me crazy.

2643
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,530
- Place a bet.
- I would be strange...

2644
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:12,530
- if I don't go all in.
- That's right.

2645
01:24:12,530 --> 01:24:13,550
They are set.

2646
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:15,860
There is someone who went all in
after revealing his card.

2647
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:16,900
Seriously.

2648
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:18,030
That's impressive.

2649
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,440
I checked my hidden card.

2650
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,540
- Let's check the forehead cards.
- The forehead cards.

2651
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:24,200
The number
on your forehead card is too big.

2652
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,440
- What's mine?
- Eight?

2653
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:28,410
- My number is 8.
- Mine is 8 too. I didn't check.

2654
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:30,240
- I didn't check either.
- I didn't check.

2655
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,110
- Wait.
- Their numbers are too big.

2656
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:33,240
You are out.

2657
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,340
- Why?
- My number is eight.

2658
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:35,840
- No.
- Suk Jin, you are out.

2659
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,340
No. He doesn't know his number.

2660
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:38,790
- He doesn't know.
- He checked his card.

2661
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:41,690
No. He doesn't know yet.

2662
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:43,450
Suk Jin's total is five. Wait.

2663
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:45,190
His number is eight.

2664
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:46,580
- Jong Kook.
- We should reveal them together.

2665
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:47,620
You should go first.

2666
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:48,920
- We are in the same position.
- That's right.

2667
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,790
- That will be more fun.
- We should reveal them together.

2668
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:51,900
- One...
- Shall we reveal them together?

2669
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,590
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three. Ten!

2670
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:55,540
(Who will win and become
the Card Shark of the Year?)

2671
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:56,590
- Two, three.
- Two, three.

2672
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,960
- Ten!
- I won!

2673
01:24:59,070 --> 01:25:00,280
- It's 6.
- It's 8.

2674
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:01,830
- Two, three.
- Two, three. Ten!

2675
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,610
(Haha won.)

2676
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:04,670
- It's 6.
- It's 8.

2677
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:05,870
My total is 14.

2678
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:06,870
- It's 10.
- Your total is 13.

2679
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:08,410
That was close.

2680
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,520
That was incredible.

2681
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:11,880
(Haha had a dramatic victory.)

2682
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,690
I should have picked this card.

2683
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:14,690
Is it over?

2684
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:18,830
Haha's winning move was successful.

2685
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:19,830
He placed first.

2686
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:21,660
Haha placed first.

2687
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,730
With 1 caramel, Woo Jae placed 2nd.

2688
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,070
- What?
- Why?

2689
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:27,130
- What?
- Did he place second?

2690
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:28,330
They went all in.

2691
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:30,410
They went all in,
but you have one caramel.

2692
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,570
I can't believe it! I placed second!

2693
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:34,000
- You have one caramel.
- I will get the prize.

2694
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,130
- Right?
- I didn't want to go all in.

2695
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:37,870
I have two in my bag.

2696
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:39,950
- You said you'd go all in.
- You went all in.

2697
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:40,950
(You said you'd go all in.)

2698
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:42,540
All right. What?

2699
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:44,990
We prepared gold bars
for 1st place and 2nd place.

2700
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:45,990
(The winners get gold bars?)

2701
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:47,450
- Real gold bars?
- You guys...

2702
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:48,790
Go ahead and open the cases.

2703
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,550
You're pretty good at games.

2704
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:52,190
Gold is expensive these days.

2705
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:57,090
- My gosh.
- Darn it.

2706
01:25:57,090 --> 01:25:59,830
(Red bean jelly bars)

2707
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:01,090
- Why?
- What?

2708
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:02,790
- I really want to eat this.
- What?

2709
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:03,940
This is sweet red bean jelly.

2710
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:07,300
I will look like a real old man
if I hold this in my costume.

2711
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,110
Suk Jin likes it.

2712
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:10,110
(Yoom)

2713
01:26:10,110 --> 01:26:11,540
And Haha will...

2714
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:13,740
get to choose a member
to get a penalty today.

2715
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:15,020
All right.

2716
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:16,910
Hey.

2717
01:26:17,190 --> 01:26:18,210
Beggar.

2718
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:19,340
(Beggar!)

2719
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,790
- You.
- What?

2720
01:26:21,490 --> 01:26:23,320
- Aren't you Korean?
- Yes.

2721
01:26:23,790 --> 01:26:27,400
(The penalty is
getting hit by a wet tissue.)

2722
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,230
(He throws wet tissues
as hard as he hates Se Chan.)

2723
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:31,290
That's hard.

2724
01:26:31,290 --> 01:26:33,490
Jong Kook is serious about this.

2725
01:26:33,490 --> 01:26:35,130
(The mischievous card sharks
love stuff like this.)

2726
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:37,070
- Here I go.
- Woo Jae.

2727
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:38,070
(Next up is Pushover Joo.)

2728
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:40,170
- Okay.
- Gosh, what was that?

2729
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:42,300
You can't do anything right.

2730
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:44,700
- What is it you're good at?
- You sit there too.

2731
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,280
- I can't let this slide.
- There's nothing...

2732
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,280
- you can do.
- Sit here.

2733
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,580
- Nothing's going right for me.
- I know.

2734
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:50,950
This looks perfect for you.

2735
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:52,190
(Slapping)

2736
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:53,240
You look cute.

2737
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:54,820
He wants you to keep your mouth shut.

2738
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,920
After preying on the pushover like that,

2739
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,250
they are seeking to revive
the Card Shark Association.

2740
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:05,660
What will happen
to the Card Shark Association then?

2741
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:06,700
(What will happen
to the Card Shark Association then?)

2742
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:11,410
(They want to pat Seok Sam...)

2743
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:15,540
(as much as they love him.)

2744
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:18,650
(We can't take it anymore.)

2745
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:21,170
(A special episode
for Seok Sam to vent his spite)

2746
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:23,950
(Seok Sam's backup, M.O.M)

2747
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:27,210
(A meeting is finally made between
Running Man and "How Do You Play?")

2748
01:27:28,050 --> 01:27:30,690
(What's Suk Jin's date of birth?)

2749
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:33,230
(An unprecedented battle...)

2750
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:36,450
(to take Ji Suk Jin)

2751
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:38,770
(Is he Ji Seok Sam?)

2752
01:27:38,770 --> 01:27:40,590
(Or is he Byeollu-Ji?)

2753
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:41,940
(Of Ji Suk Jin)

2754
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,130
(By Ji Suk Jin)

2755
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:44,770
(For Ji Suk Jin)

2756
01:27:44,770 --> 01:27:46,740
Hey, our viewers might believe that.

2757
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:49,170
(As Ji Wishes)
