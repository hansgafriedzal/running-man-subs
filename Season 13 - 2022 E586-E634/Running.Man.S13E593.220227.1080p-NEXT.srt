00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,040
(A live cafe in Gangnam)

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,310
(The opening takes part
on the stage with a mirrorball.)

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,530
Hello, Suk Jin.

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,410
- Hi.
- Hello.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,600
- Gosh, So Min.
- How have you been?

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,670
Hello.

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,080
You're suffering.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,610
- I'm not suffering.
- Suffering?

9
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,520
- It breaks my heart.
- Suk Jin.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,880
- Hello.
- It's not...

11
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,740
It's not that she's suffering.
She's just injured.

12
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,310
Injured?
She's suffering from injury.

13
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,490
- Here.
- Are you okay?

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,650
Hey, don't use the foot.

15
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,220
- Be careful.
- I'm being careful.

16
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,790
She's obviously not using the foot.

17
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,790
And he made me really upset.
Should I talk about it?

18
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,790
- What?
- Why?

19
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,830
The floor level wasn't right
for So Min's wheelchair.

20
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,290
And Suk Jin was like,
"Hang on. What do I do?"

21
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,830
Then he just pretended to lift it up.

22
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,900
He's the worst.

23
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,930
Why?

24
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,710
Do you know what Suk Jin just said?

25
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,330
- What did he say?
- I just managed to sit here,

26
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,940
but he told me to move over.

27
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,910
Why would you say that?

28
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,650
So Min is back after a long time.

29
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,110
- Isn't this nice?
- She was waiting at a cafe...

30
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,760
having some coffee.

31
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,890
- She's really happy.
- She said she was happy.

32
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,720
Anyway, So Min and Ji Hyo are back.

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,130
But where's Haha?

34
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,130
Why isn't Dong Hoon here yet?

35
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,630
Haha and Se Chan.

36
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,900
- Se Chan is...
- Se Chan is in quarantine.

37
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,240
- Did you not know that?
- He's in quarantine.

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,040
- He's in quarantine.
- Is he in quarantine?

39
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,330
Do you not know what happened?

40
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,770
She has no idea.

41
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,510
He came in close contact
with Hyun Moo.

42
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,540
- That's right.
- So he's in quarantine.

43
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,010
He's in home quarantine for a week.

44
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,680
- Today...
- So Se Chan is not coming today.

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,910
- Right.
- He's not coming?

46
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,910
Hello.

47
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,320
- Haha.
- Hey.

48
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,520
- Hello.
- What? Haha.

49
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,820
- You look good today.
- Thank you.

50
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,690
- Haha.
- He shaved his head.

51
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,690
- Did you shave your head?
- What's with your hair?

52
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,930
- He's bald.
- Right.

53
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,220
- Show us your hair.
- Show us.

54
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,760
Why did you shave? What happened?

55
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,960
- Let us see.
- It's nothing.

56
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,690
- Did you shave your head?
- Why would you...

57
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,930
- Why?
- Why did you shave your head?

58
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,600
- Why would you do that?
- Why? Is it defiance?

59
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,960
- Are you heartbroken?
- For fun?

60
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,040
Can you show us? Just once.

61
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,410
- This is no big deal.
- My goodness.

62
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,540
This is no big deal.

63
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,300
(A bald kid)

64
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,100
It's a gesture of defiance.

65
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,520
(He finds it hilarious.)

66
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,910
- People say...
- You punk.

67
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,410
- Gosh, Haha.
- I look like an old baby.

68
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,110
It will be fun to tease him.

69
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,520
Don't make me angry.
I'll take off the beanie.

70
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,380
- He's a rebellious kid.
- He's a rebel.

71
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,030
We have a lot of news today.

72
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,970
First of all, Jong Kook got...

73
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,220
partial microblading.

74
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,890
- That's right.
- Really? Let me see.

75
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,340
- What?
- Here.

76
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,230
- On the empty part.
- I see.

77
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,600
- I'm getting one tomorrow.
- It looks good.

78
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,670
I got one a year ago.

79
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,010
And So Min is back.

80
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,570
It's not getting better soon, right?

81
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,510
- It's not like when you were young.
- It's so uncomfortable.

82
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,940
She had an operation.

83
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,720
You shouldn't just rest.
You should do leg exercises.

84
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,850
- He keeps saying that.
- To recover your balance...

85
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,590
Your leg will be hairy
when you get the cast off.

86
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,420
- Right. It will be very hairy.
- Is that true?

87
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,920
And it will look like a skewer.

88
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,760
It happened to me before.
Your leg becomes thin.

89
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,030
My legs have been thin since then.

90
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,890
- You've always had thin legs.
- You just have thin legs.

91
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,540
You wore a cast on one leg,
but both your legs are slim.

92
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,160
Because they've been balanced.

93
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,340
Why are your legs so slim?

94
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,810
It's just that I'm slim.

95
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,380
Suk Jin, calves are
like the second heart.

96
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,880
Your heart looks horrible.

97
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,940
Right. Those with slim calves...

98
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,010
You need to work out.

99
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,620
- That's not true.
- Calves are the second heart?

100
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,910
- I've never heard of that before.
- I'm serious.

101
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,410
- That's true.
- You just made that up.

102
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,690
- It's the legs.
- Your calves...

103
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,820
They say
calves are the second heart.

104
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,130
It's true that legs are
important for your health.

105
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,720
- Of course.
- What about you?

106
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,290
- Look at my legs.
- Your legs are like skewers.

107
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,530
I have firm legs.

108
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,220
- My legs are firm too.
- Where?

109
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,530
- They are solid.
- Can I give it a squeeze?

110
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,730
Go ahead and squeeze it.

111
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,390
- They are really firm.
- Let me see.

112
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,600
- Squeeze them.
- Darn it!

113
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,310
- They are not firm at all.
- Gosh.

114
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,540
- It shouldn't hurt when I squeeze
- He's right.

115
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,880
I work out a lot,
so it doesn't hurt.

116
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,940
Of course not.

117
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,750
Those who work out a lot
don't feel pain here.

118
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,170
- Hit me hard.
- They are firm.

119
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,410
- Hit me. It doesn't hurt.
- Hit you?

120
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,220
(Punching)

121
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,880
(A fiery fist on his skinny thigh)

122
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,380
- That was really loud.
- It doesn't hurt at all, right?

123
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,420
(A fiery fist on his skinny thighs)

124
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,260
It made a loud noise.

125
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,160
- It doesn't hurt, does it?
- Of course, it hurts when...

126
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,530
Hey.

127
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,870
I can't make a joke.

128
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,130
- Gosh.
- They are firm.

129
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,290
There's the line that
you're not supposed to overstep.

130
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,600
- I can't even make a joke now.
- They are firm.

131
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,700
I can't look at Dong Hoon.

132
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,630
- Why not?
- I don't know. You look scary.

133
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,070
- You look threatening.
- The thing is...

134
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,380
What did I do?

135
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,470
Look at that. My goodness.

136
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,940
- He looks like a thug.
- I'm scared.

137
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,070
My goodness.

138
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,120
- Oh, dear.
- It's like the movie "The Roundup."

139
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,920
He looks like a street gangster.

140
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,120
(Slapping)

141
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,010
(Awkward laughing)

142
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,730
It's good to have them back anyway.

143
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,520
He's acting strange today.

144
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,890
- Right?
- He's being awkward.

145
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,320
He pretends to be cool.

146
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,520
- Suk Jin...
- He's being pretentious.

147
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,390
I read some articles about today.

148
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,400
So I know what's going on.

149
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,900
- Is that why he's being quiet?
- I guess so.

150
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,610
He's being quiet today, right?

151
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,400
I know.

152
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,140
- He's a singer today.
- And today...

153
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,320
- He's a guest today.
- We have a lot of news today.

154
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,920
I heard you two kissed.

155
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,150
Right. I saw that.

156
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,880
- What?
- My gosh.

157
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,950
About that?

158
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,380
I have a lot to talk about.

159
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,520
It's not like that.

160
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,890
You hugged each other.

161
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,020
And Ji Hyo was like...

162
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,020
- No, Jae Suk. It's not like that.
- And she said...

163
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,760
she was having
a good appetite these days.

164
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
- A good appetite?
- A good appetite?

165
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,390
No, it's not like that.

166
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,440
She said she was hungry.

167
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,610
She meant she was just hungry.

168
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,310
Ji Hyo doesn't usually act cute, but...

169
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,440
She wasn't acting cute.
She just said she was hungry.

170
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,400
She did things like that.

171
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,270
- She was just hungry.
- "Jong Kook."

172
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,140
"Jong Kook, I have
such an appetite these days."

173
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,150
When did I say that?
"Jong Kook. Jong Kook!"

174
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,130
- I didn't sound like that.
- "I have such an appetite."

175
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,930
- Then Jong Kook...
- What was the scene about?

176
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,150
Jong Kook sounded shy. "Oh, you do?"

177
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,890
Hang on.

178
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,630
- Jae Suk, that's not true.
- What?

179
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,440
- It's not true.
- No. Listen.

180
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,530
- You did that during the shoot.
- It happened.

181
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,610
What am I supposed to say
when she says she has an appetite?

182
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,810
What should I say? It's just part...

183
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,940
of the music video.

184
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,840
But you did that
when you weren't shooting.

185
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,880
We did it when we were shooting.
There were cameras!

186
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,920
(We did it when we were shooting.
There were cameras!)

187
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,920
It was a scene
when we were a happy couple.

188
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,710
- It was part of the scene.
- It wasn't the main story.

189
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,320
It was a scene
when we were a happy couple.

190
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,820
- I guess it looked natural.
- It was natural.

191
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,280
Right.

192
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,230
- They look good together.
- That's the people's wish.

193
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,060
I hope things will work out for them.

194
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,870
- The people are busy.
- It's not like that.

195
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,760
- Right. They all are...
- They already have...

196
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,530
- a lot to care about.
- I just mean...

197
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,670
The presidential election is coming up.
Everyone's busy.

198
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,610
It's not like I asked the people
to care about it.

199
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,900
We all are going through hard times.

200
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,940
I didn't ask them to care about it.

201
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,530
You can't force people
to wish for something.

202
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,030
- Right.
- I mean they look good together.

203
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,200
Why are the three of them
sitting together?

204
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,480
You should just be grateful
for their interest and support.

205
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,210
- Now I feel bad for you.
- I know.

206
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,210
- That's not right.
- Why do you feel bad?

207
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,710
Don't pity me.

208
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,650
- You're being...
- I don't pity you.

209
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,930
Hey, Wonstein.

210
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,380
- Jae Jung.
- Hey.

211
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,150
Hello.

212
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,650
My goodness.

213
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,690
Hello.

214
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,130
They are my singers.

215
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,740
- Hey.
- My artists.

216
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

217
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,000
They're finally here.

218
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,330
Hello.

219
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,030
(Suk Jin's colleagues
from "How Do You Play?")

220
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,310
(Park Jae Jung of M.O.M)

221
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,110
(Wonstein of M.O.M)

222
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,510
(He's here as Byeollu-Ji today.)

223
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,320
(The men of Saturday are here
to unite the two universes.)

224
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,820
(They say hello
to their CEO, Yoo Yaho.)

225
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,880
Hey.

226
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,060
Onto the stage.

227
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,150
- Hello.
- Straight to the stage?

228
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,650
- Onto the stage?
- Here's the microphone.

229
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,130
- Gosh, Suk Jin.
- My goodness.

230
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,870
- I feel nervous to sing in front of you.
- My gosh.

231
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,800
Hellucca, Running Man.

232
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,440
Hello.

233
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,760
He works as a comedian now.

234
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,880
Jae Suk loves him these days.

235
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,380
- Right. KCM.
- Chang Mo.

236
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,380
Guy, I'm serious about this.

237
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,270
You're not supposed to laugh
when I sing.

238
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,320
We won't laugh.

239
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,510
- They recently released a new song.
- I know.

240
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,210
We've never
performed this song before.

241
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,210
Really?

242
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,010
This is our first performance.

243
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,010
- This is "How Do You Play?"
- Give them a big hand.

244
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,630
- Hello.
- Gosh.

245
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,130
- This is their first performance.
- I hope you will enjoy it.

246
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,230
Okay. We will listen carefully.

247
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,430
This is very meaningful.

248
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,230
It feels like I'm watching TV.

249
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,170
- Don't look at me.
- The collaboration finally happens.

250
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,440
This is the beginning.

251
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,420
This is so nice.

252
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,360
I can't watch this.

253
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,590
It sounds great.

254
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,670
Unbelievable.

255
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,080
This is so thrilling.

256
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,810
This is so nice.

257
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,630
I love it.

258
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,840
(This is amazing.)

259
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,000
It's so good.

260
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,560
- I love the song.
- Do you like it?

261
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,210
- I do.
- It makes my heart flutter.

262
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,380
My gosh.

263
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,980
Let's go.

264
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,310
Wonstein!

265
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,270
It sounds wonderful.
It's going to make me cry.

266
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,930
This is so good.

267
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,300
It's so good.

268
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,460
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

269
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,230
This is amazing.

270
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,020
You look so cool.

271
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,200
- That was great.
- Hey.

272
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,520
- I love it.
- Unbelievable.

273
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,920
- Do you really like it?
- I do.

274
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,290
It's great.

275
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,970
- Wonderful.
- Are you serious?

276
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,610
- He's making a fuss again.
- Hey.

277
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,030
- Stop it.
- My gosh.

278
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,740
Gosh, that was amazing.

279
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,210
- Do you like the song?
- I love it.

280
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,350
It's really nice.

281
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,510
- It's great.
- I think I picked good members.

282
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,450
- Gosh, Suk Jin.
- I did a great job.

283
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,180
I hated it when Suk Jin...

284
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,380
danced to the rhythm.

285
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,640
(I hated it
when Suk Jin danced to the rhythm.)

286
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,910
The bounce...

287
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,460
- How could he dance like that?
- I know.

288
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,380
Wonstein and the other guys
looked so cool,

289
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,500
- but he was like this.
- It was off the beat.

290
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,020
- You were a little...
- It was strange.

291
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,420
(Embarrassed)

292
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,130
It was like the dance from the '80s.

293
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,840
- Like a show-off.
- He was like this.

294
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,630
Why would he dance like this?

295
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,870
- It won't be shown on TV.
- You think?

296
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,840
Wonstein and Jae Jung were great.

297
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,880
- It was so cool.
- We look hip, right?

298
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,220
The live performance was impressive.

299
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,640
That was crazy.

300
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,040
I know.

301
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,510
Actually, we are grateful
to Jong Kook for this song.

302
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,910
- Right.
- The thing is...

303
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,910
- Was the song for Jong Kook?
- Actually,

304
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,280
Jong Kook and I were
supposed to sing this song.

305
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,390
- Really?
- That's what Keun Tae wanted.

306
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,330
So he sent the guide song to me.

307
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,060
You know everyone feels...

308
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,700
uncomfortable around Jong Kook.

309
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,660
Keun Tae was...

310
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,390
How many people feel
uncomfortable around him?

311
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,870
- Even Keun Tae feels uncomfortable.
- He does?

312
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,900
- Keun Tae...
- Keun Tae does?

313
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,530
Keun Tae asked me.

314
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,110
"Chang Mo, are you
close to Jong Kook?"

315
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,580
"Yes, we are close friends."

316
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,950
"I want you to send him the song."

317
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,140
"I'm afraid I can't."

318
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,720
"I don't feel
so comfortable around him."

319
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,960
He could've just sent me.

320
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,780
So the title of the demo was "KJK."

321
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,260
- Really?
- That's true.

322
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,360
- Jong Kook, this is...
- The song is perfect for my voice.

323
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,460
- It would've been really nice.
- You would've made a perfect duo.

324
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,060
Right? You can wear
matching tank tops.

325
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,240
Matching tops?

326
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,290
You could've worn matching
tank tops and arm warmers.

327
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,370
- I love the song.
- It's really nice.

328
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,240
- It's perfect for spring.
- It really is.

329
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,510
Anyway, these four are...

330
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,250
promoting their new song now.

331
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,670
And they are here
since Suk Jin is our member.

332
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,540
- I'm grateful that they're here.
- Me too.

333
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,090
It's something that wouldn't
happen on other TV shows.

334
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,550
- They wouldn't do this.
- Of course not.

335
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,650
It wouldn't happen.

336
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,920
Because the band started
on a different TV show.

337
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,890
Back in the day, they would just
perform one song and leave.

338
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,200
- This is very rare.
- And...

339
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,520
You couldn't even promote your song.

340
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,790
They wouldn't get to sing like this.

341
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,260
I know. This wouldn't happen.

342
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,210
- They wouldn't get to sing.
- But they sang the entire song.

343
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,340
Right.

344
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,300
I'd like to talk
about them one by one.

345
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,080
- First, we have KCM here.
- Yes.

346
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,250
I think KCM is...

347
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,010
- as funny as a comedian.
- He's hilarious.

348
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,620
You recently appeared on the show...

349
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,180
- I host.
- I did.

350
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,490
- With No Noo.
- Right.

351
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,810
I burst into laughter
as he showed up.

352
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,260
(Shocked)

353
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,100
(KCM showed up
in a sleeveless shirt.)

354
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,110
It's even funnier...

355
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,840
- because he put on some weight.
- I know. It was so funny.

356
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,210
The thing is,

357
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,170
KCM works out a lot.

358
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,850
But he wasn't in shape at all.

359
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,510
Seriously.

360
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,270
He wasn't in shape at all,

361
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,490
- But he sings so well.
- but he was wearing a tight shirt.

362
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,510
He looks just like...

363
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,990
a retired bodybuilder...

364
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,280
who runs a gym.

365
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,920
- Exactly.
- There are trainers like him.

366
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,060
That's how he looks.

367
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,870
I laughed a lot that day.

368
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,930
- So this is what I imagined.
- What?

369
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,130
In about 10 or 20 years,

370
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,740
Jong Kook will show up
after putting on some fat like KCM.

371
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,800
(Jong Kook will show up
after putting on some fat like KCM.)

372
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,900
I want to see that.

373
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,400
- I'm excited.
- In a sleeveless shirt...

374
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,610
There's a man

375
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,140
(Jong Kook sings "One Man"
in a sleeveless shirt.)

376
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,300
- It will be hilarious.
- That sounds humane.

377
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,220
- Like Ma Dong Seok.
- Exactly.

378
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,670
It will be hilarious.

379
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,620
- I don't think it will happen.
- It will be a nice surprise.

380
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,460
It will be so funny.

381
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,220
So Wonstein and Jae Jung are here.

382
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,620
When I was talking
to So Min on the phone,

383
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,420
she asked, "Is Wonstein..."

384
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,960
"about my age?"

385
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,760
He's very young.

386
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,000
Wonstein is like a baby.

387
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,100
No. That's not true.

388
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,340
I'm not that young.

389
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,560
- I'm 28.
- He is young.

390
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,630
- Wonstein, are you 28?
- Yes, I'm 28.

391
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,340
- Really?
- I thought you were only 24 or 25.

392
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,480
He was born in 1995.

393
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,770
Jae Jung and I are of the same age.

394
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,080
- Right. Jae Jung.
- Are you two of the same age?

395
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,580
- They are of the same age.
- What?

396
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,310
- Are you two of the same age?
- They are of the same age.

397
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,720
I thought it had been
20 years since your debut.

398
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,780
This must be a joke.

399
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,490
- I know.
- He looks experienced.

400
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,550
I look old for my age.

401
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,830
- He debuted when he was 19.
- I was only 19.

402
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,090
It's been a long time
since your debut.

403
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,050
Jae Jung looks his age.

404
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,420
- And Wonstein looks young.
- He's like a peach.

405
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,700
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

406
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,200
Do you know who they are?

407
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,530
(Do you know who they are?)

408
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,130
- On behalf of the viewers...
- She doesn't seem to know.

409
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,160
She's here as a representative
of the viewers.

410
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,210
She doesn't know.

411
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,400
She's the representative
of our viewers.

412
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,980
- I know them.
- You do?

413
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,270
- Wonsteim.
- Right.

414
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,480
He's not Wonsteim.

415
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,750
- That's not it.
- It's Wonstein.

416
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,170
- Wonstein.
- Wonsteim?

417
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,270
You know Jae Jung, right?

418
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,090
- Of course I do.
- You know him, right?

419
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,640
And you know
that we are a band, don't you?

420
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,090
Sure. I just saw you sing.

421
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,590
This isn't the first time.
We did it before.

422
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,520
Really?

423
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,020
(Cavewoman Ji Hyo's head
needs some updating.)

424
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,860
And Wonstein has a younger sister.

425
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,700
- He and his sister are...
- She must be lovely.

426
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,730
He tells her
that he loves her all the time.

427
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,840
- Really? To your sister?
- I was really surprised.

428
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,840
That's true. We are very intimate.

429
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,160
- Do you really say that?
- Jae Jung also...

430
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,560
says that to his younger brother.

431
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,170
They all are full of love.

432
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,400
But why do you not love us?

433
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,710
I love you a lot.

434
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,950
Then tell me that you love me.

435
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,450
He can't say that.

436
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,880
We send messages like that a lot,

437
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,350
but he never says that.

438
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,280
- He never answers.
- I'm just shy.

439
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,810
- But...
- I'm shy.

440
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,720
But he leaves
a lot of sweet comments...

441
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,680
- on their social media.
- Really?

442
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,260
- He says that he loves them.
- I don't say that.

443
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,500
- I never said that to them.
- But you are totally different...

444
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,830
- when you're with them.
- He changes completely.

445
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,100
Suk Jin is not
so affectionate to others.

446
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,930
He's just indifferent.

447
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,300
It's not like he's not affectionate.

448
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,300
- This is what it is.
- I just feel bad for them.

449
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,270
He doesn't say anything sweet
to his close friends.

450
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,080
But he tries to express affection
to his new friends.

451
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,120
I'm not his old friend though.

452
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,880
- It's been only 5 years.
- We've known for 5 years already.

453
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,750
- It hasn't been so long.
- I just can't say that.

454
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,410
You were mean to me
when we first met.

455
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,090
(You were mean to me
when we first met.)

456
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,990
(She reveals
that he was mean to her.)

457
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,520
That's true.

458
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,290
- You were mean to me.
- Stay quiet.

459
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,060
- My goodness.
- The viewers don't know that.

460
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,660
He's mean to newbies.

461
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,740
- This is hilarious.
- I wasn't being mean. Jong Kook.

462
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,160
- You know me.
- I do.

463
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,270
It takes time for me
to become friends with others.

464
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,300
- He looks lonely today.
- That's it.

465
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,080
By the way, this is...

466
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,640
turning into a talk show.

467
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,770
- We are today's guests.
- But...

468
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,950
- This is fun though.
- We will go home after talking.

469
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,040
- I'm having fun.
- This is really fun.

470
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,950
- It's really fun.
- I like it.

471
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,580
We will continue talking
after the song.

472
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,230
(The talking never ends.)

473
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,260
All right.

474
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,400
- Good.
- It's Jong Kook's turn...

475
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,200
- to perform a song.
- That's right.

476
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,820
Jong Kook will sing a song for us.

477
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,400
Can you sing a song for us?

478
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,500
- Why do you not release a new song?
- I'm working on it.

479
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,440
Haha and I have
improved a lot in singing.

480
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,980
We can help you
with your new song. We can rap.

481
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,030
(We can help you
with your new song. We can rap.)

482
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,180
Haha has improved.

483
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,800
- He raps really well now.
- You two?

484
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,110
I'm a vocalist now.

485
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,480
He's really good.

486
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,010
The reason I wanted you

487
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,420
(The old school rappers want to ride
on Kim Grand Award's coattails.)

488
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,250
- He's good.
- The rap from the '90s.

489
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,390
Really?

490
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,110
- We should do that sometime.
- We should.

491
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,620
- The three of you should do that.
- It will be fun.

492
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,660
It will be great.

493
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,620
Let me tell you about today's race.

494
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,730
With the members of Running Man
who are always on Suk Jin's side...

495
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,290
and the members of M.O.M
who are supportive of Suk Jin,

496
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,170
we will have As Ji Wishes Race.

497
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,170
(As Ji Wishes Race)

498
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,710
- It's perfect for Suk Jin.
- I knew it was about him.

499
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,530
- I didn't know.
- He seemed nervous.

500
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,570
Today's race will take place
with Suk Jin as the center,

501
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,040
and it will have individual games.

502
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,540
There will be
separate rules for Suk Jin,

503
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,450
and the rest of you
will compete against each other.

504
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,550
But all the episodes where
Suk Jin was the protagonist...

505
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,960
suffered low ratings.

506
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,260
(All the episodes about Suk Jin
suffered low viewer ratings.)

507
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,490
Our ratings did drop.

508
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,730
- Hey, don't say such a thing.
- True.

509
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,260
- People might think it's true.
- Why?

510
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,020
- Those episodes were boring.
- The viewers might think...

511
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,200
- that it's true.
- Why are you yelling at me?

512
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,700
- Why would you get upset?
- Think about it.

513
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,560
- If you say such a thing,
- It was a joke.

514
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,740
since you're a top show host,
people will believe you.

515
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,830
All right. I understand.

516
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,140
- Viewers, it's not true.
- Okay.

517
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,640
He was just joking. Believe me.

518
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,140
But I didn't make that up.

519
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,910
- I said it based on the data...
- It sounds real as you got upset.

520
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,980
- Exactly.
- No, it's not like that.

521
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,910
- You went overboard.
- Just laugh it off.

522
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,570
But it's not fair.
I can't just laugh it off.

523
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,780
Anyway, at the end of the race,

524
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,650
only Suk Jin will spin a roulette.

525
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,460
You'll see "Prize" and "Penalty"...

526
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,110
- written on the slots.
- Oh, I see.

527
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,730
That's the rule for Suk Jin.

528
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,290
As for the other eight members,
the person with the highest score...

529
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,760
will be the MOM,
the Man of the Match,

530
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,360
and will win a prize.

531
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,400
And the person in second place
will be exempt from the penalty.

532
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,600
One person chosen by
the winner of the race...

533
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,710
and one chosen by Suk Jin...

534
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,770
- will receive the penalty.
- Oh, gosh.

535
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,370
- Two people will get the penalty?
- Oh, boy.

536
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,600
Gosh, Suk Jin will probably...

537
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,340
However, if Suk Jin gets
the penalty, he can't choose...

538
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,370
anyone else to receive the penalty.

539
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,650
- Oh, I see.
- I'll spin the roulette.

540
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,340
Today, Suk Jin will choose
the members...

541
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,610
- to be on his team.
- Yes.

542
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,230
The members Suk Jin chooses
will be on Team Ji,

543
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,760
and the others will be
on Team Others.

544
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
- You'll be divided into two teams.
- Team Ji and Team Others.

545
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,670
- Team Others.
- We'll see how he feels about us.

546
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,670
We'll see which one of us
he cares more about.

547
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,410
And Suk Jin, if Team Ji wins,

548
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,800
one prize slot will be added
to the roulette.

549
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,440
One penalty slot will be added
if your team loses.

550
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,010
- It's time to team up.
- Okay.

551
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,300
- What is this?
- "Guess the members of Team Ji."

552
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,610
Each of you should predict
the members Suk Jin will choose.

553
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,580
(Lucky Ji Lottery, Predict
the members Suk Jin will pick!)

554
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,760
- This is easy.
- If you guess every member right,

555
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,390
- Bingo?
- you'll be exempt from the penalty.

556
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,090
(They have a chance to be exempt
from the penalty.)

557
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,290
- If I guess every member right?
- Right.

558
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,020
- I wonder if they could do that.
- It's impossible.

559
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,060
- How do we guess everyone right?
- If any one of them succeeds,

560
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,860
a penalty slot will be added
to the roulette, Suk Jin.

561
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,100
- I think I know who he'll pick.
- So try to make it hard to predict.

562
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,100
Okay.

563
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,830
- Pick at least one female member.
- I'll do that.

564
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,250
I'm pretty sure that he'll pick
Jong Kook...

565
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,950
- No, he won't make it that easy.
- Don't talk. You're confusing me.

566
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,770
- He could choose KCM.
- And...

567
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,310
He probably wants to pick So Min,
but in the end,

568
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,460
- he'll decide not to pick her.
- Please be quiet.

569
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,720
- Why?
- I don't think...

570
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,160
I don't think he'll pick me
because for him,

571
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,050
- winning is more important.
- Ji Hyo is more cooperative.

572
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,850
He must think I'm at a disadvantage
because of my leg injury.

573
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,900
- But what you just said...
- Come on. Please stop talking.

574
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,060
- must have changed his mind.
- I agree.

575
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,790
It's because Suk Jin is
an opportunist.

576
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,740
(He's the sly type.)

577
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,700
- Why would you put it like that?
- Sorry.

578
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,640
He'll definitely pick Jong Kook.
It's because...

579
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,570
- Right. He's strong.
- Quiet down, will you?

580
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,410
- No. He might...
- I think he'll pick KCM.

581
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,100
choose KCM since he's here.

582
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,650
He'll pick the ones I said
he'd pick.

583
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,180
I know him well.

584
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,610
I tried not to let what you were
saying affect my decision.

585
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,390
Shall I hand it in now?

586
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,390
- Okay.
- Oh, my.

587
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,610
I bet none of you guessed it right.

588
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,990
All right. Now, please reveal
your predictions 1 by 1.

589
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,120
We'll see the predictions first.

590
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,520
It'd be a miracle
if anyone predicted right.

591
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,780
- Ji Hyo, you go first.
- Gosh.

592
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,820
I thought he'd pick Jong Kook,

593
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,730
Wonstein, So Min, and KCM.

594
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,970
I picked exactly the same members.

595
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,090
- Really?
- Haha's prediction is the same.

596
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,140
Next up is So Min.

597
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,330
I thought he'd pick Jong Kook,
Wonstein, KCM, and Ji Hyo.

598
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,800
(So Min's prediction:
Jong Kook, Wonstein, KCM, Ji Hyo)

599
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,740
- Jae Jung, you're up.
- Okay. My prediction is Ji Hyo,

600
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,570
Jae Suk, Haha, and me.

601
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,750
KCM, Jae Jung, So Min, and me.

602
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,180
(The members reveal
their predictions 1 by 1.)

603
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,390
Jae Jung, Wonstein,

604
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,010
Ji Hyo, and me.

605
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,110
Jae Suk, Ji Hyo,

606
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,190
Wonstein, and KCM.

607
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,900
I see. Our predictions are
similar to one another.

608
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,290
All right.

609
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,700
- This must be the correct answer.
- I bet I got only one member wrong,

610
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,360
or I got every member right.

611
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,940
- I'm sure I didn't guess...
- Right.

612
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,940
- more than one member wrong.
- Of course.

613
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,640
- Jae Suk is...
- That's amazing.

614
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,570
- He definitely picked Jong Kook.
- He's amazing. Right.

615
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,870
- He knows Suk Jin so well.
- He definitely picked Jong Kook.

616
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,950
And he picked Jae Jung
and Wonstein too.

617
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,770
Because Jong Kook and KCM are
similar, he probably separated them.

618
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,950
- That's a good point.
- Yes.

619
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,110
So the question is which of Ji Hyo
and So Min he picked.

620
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,890
I bet he was going to pick So Min,
but he decided to choose Ji Hyo...

621
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,260
- for his team to win.
- He picked Ji Hyo.

622
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,490
That's why I picked these members.

623
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,320
Jong Kook, Wonstein, Ji Hyo,
and Jae Jung.

624
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,460
- I'm curious. Show us, Suk Jin.
- Me too.

625
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,850
(The long-awaited announcement)

626
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,970
- I bet I guessed almost all right.
- One of you...

627
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,730
- One of us predicted right?
- Yes.

628
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,730
(One of them predicted right.)

629
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:23,830
I was surprised.

630
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,210
- It must be Jae Suk.
- I think it's Jae Suk.

631
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,640
- Jae Suk is unbelievable.
- He guessed everyone correctly?

632
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,410
I'm impressed. How did he guess
all of them right?

633
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,980
- I'll announce my team members.
- Okay.

634
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,040
"I'll announce my team members."

635
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,150
Let's check how many we got right.

636
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,890
Check your answers.

637
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:43,920
(Predict the members
Suk Jin will pick!)

638
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,940
- Jong Kook.
- I knew it.

639
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,180
- Okay.
- There was no doubt...

640
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,250
- that he'd pick Jong Kook.
- I got one right.

641
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,820
Ji Hyo.

642
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,130
- Yes.
- Just as I expected.

643
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,890
- I failed.
- And...

644
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,130
(Suk Jin, Jong Kook, Ji Hyo)

645
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,630
- Jae Jung.
- Yes, I knew it.

646
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,130
- Oh, my. Jae Jung?
- Raise your hand...

647
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,630
if you predicted all three of them.

648
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,030
- The last one must be Wonstein.
- And...

649
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,260
- Wonstein!
- Yes!

650
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,690
- Hey, how did you know?
- My goodness.

651
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,760
- Wonstein!
- Yes!

652
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,000
(Jae Suk won.)

653
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,840
- How did you know, Jae Suk?
- That's amazing.

654
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,080
- It's not that he predicted.
- Awesome.

655
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,910
You did just as Jae Suk said.

656
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,120
You chose the members
that Jae Suk said...

657
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,180
- you would pick.
- That's not the case.

658
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,180
- Seriously.
- I didn't do that.

659
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,350
- Unbelievable.
- I...

660
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,890
- It wasn't like that. Trust me.
- Why did you do that?

661
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,210
- I didn't...
- Jong Kook, you're wrong.

662
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,450
- I didn't...
- It's obvious.

663
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,750
- Jae Suk kept talking,
- You're mistaken.

664
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,930
- and Suk Jin chose them...
- How did he do that?

665
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:25,930
As if he had hypnotized Suk Jin.

666
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,660
- How does he do that?
- This is the correct answer.

667
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,790
- He's incredible.
- How did he do that?

668
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,260
- I'm impressed.
- You're amazing.

669
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,520
- Hey.
- As a result, Jae Suk...

670
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,990
got an exemption from the penalty,
to our surprise.

671
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,990
Okay!

672
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,000
Gosh, I can't believe him.

673
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,070
I was going to pick him.

674
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,880
Suk Jin, you lost 1 prize slot
and got 1 more penalty slot.

675
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,110
- Okay.
- Gosh. What an idiot.

676
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,420
- Make your own decisions, will you?
- How would I have known?

677
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,120
- I said that wasn't the case.
- I mean...

678
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,480
- He never makes his own decisions.
- I didn't pick the people...

679
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,680
that Jae Suk said I'd pick.

680
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,590
You might end up giving him
all your assets.

681
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,180
- What?
- Right.

682
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,060
- I've been saying this for a while.
- You're incredible.

683
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,020
- If I set my mind to it,
- Yes.

684
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,370
I can make him and Yong Man
live on the streets.

685
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,190
(I can make him and Yong Man
live on the streets.)

686
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,990
I'm capable of doing that.

687
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,500
I don't doubt that.

688
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,730
- He's a scary...
- The two of them...

689
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,140
- He's a scary man.
- How does he do that?

690
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,030
- How come it happens every time?
- My gosh.

691
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,440
Shall we get going now?

692
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,440
- Yes.
- Okay.

693
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,470
- I didn't know...
- It might be too small.

694
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,540
- Haha was older than KCM.
- Here you go.

695
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,540
Of course, he's older than KCM.

696
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,850
KCM is not as old as he seems.

697
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,350
- How old are you, KCM?
- He's younger than Haha.

698
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,420
I'm 42.

699
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,590
- Sorry?
- I'm 42.

700
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,920
- You're 42?
- Yes.

701
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,720
Now that I know that Haha is
older than KCM...

702
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
- He was always like a baby.
- I may be the youngest among us,

703
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,330
but I'm older than
most entertainers.

704
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,070
- Hey, is Rain 40 years old?
- He's 41.

705
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,730
- Is he 41?
- Yes, he's 41.

706
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,400
What kind of relationship
do you have with Rain?

707
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,070
A dominant-subordinate relationship?

708
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,730
Gosh, Suk Jin.
How could you put it like that?

709
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,380
- What's your problem?
- Is it?

710
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,340
What kind of relationship
do you have with Jae Suk?

711
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,410
- Are you a subordinate?
- He's a friend in my neighborhood.

712
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,000
- A friend I like.
- Hey.

713
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,940
I think this shows what kind of
relationship they have.

714
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,240
That's not true.

715
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,540
All of our staff members are
over there.

716
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,540
Hellucca.

717
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,590
(Hellucca.)

718
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,890
What was that?

719
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,160
- Hey.
- I hated that at first.

720
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,130
- I told KCM not to do that.
- Really?

721
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,690
But I found myself
saying it unintentionally.

722
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,370
- Were you the first to say that?
- "Hellucca."

723
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,600
- Yes.
- Jong Kook hates things like that.

724
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,070
But I think it's funny
because it's you.

725
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,930
- It suits you.
- It's funny.

726
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,000
- Wonstein, you feel awkward, right?
- Yes?

727
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,470
(Wonstein still feels shy
around everyone.)

728
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,580
- Wonstein has such a cute face.
- How cute.

729
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,650
- You see, Wonstein...
- He's like a cute doll.

730
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,970
- doesn't just look cute.
- He's so cute.

731
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,620
- He has a cute personality too.
- Right.

732
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,620
(Wonstein is
the cutest hip-hop artist.)

733
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,940
- He's the best.
- Haha used to be like him.

734
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,360
- Haha was like him?
- He's the type that shares love.

735
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,480
Haha was nice
to his senior entertainers as well,

736
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,430
- but he could be defiant too.
- True.

737
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,950
- He acted up once in a while.
- Really?

738
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,330
See? Look at him.

739
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,520
- He did?
- Look at him.

740
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,870
He's loyal though.

741
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,170
I don't think he's ever acted up
in front of me.

742
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,410
- Why would I do that?
- Hey.

743
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,430
(Polite)

744
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,610
Why would I?

745
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,910
No one would dare pick a fight
with you.

746
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,940
- When I started making music,
- Right. Absolutely.

747
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,380
- I often listened to Haha's songs.
- Which ones?

748
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,350
- It could've gone wrong.
- Really?

749
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,890
- Z-KIRI.
- That was a bad choice.

750
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,820
- I knew he had great taste.
- Z-KIRI?

751
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,160
- Which song?
- That was a bad choice.

752
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,130
- "Love Song" and many other songs.
- "Love Song?"

753
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:16,020
You might've forgotten it
since he's been maintaining...

754
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,720
his funny image from variety shows
for a long time,

755
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,370
- but he's a great musician too.
- Yo, yeah

756
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,230
- Hey
- Yeah

757
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,760
- Here we go, yeah
- Hey

758
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,260
- Hey, hold on.
- All right

759
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,910
- Hold on a second.
- Yeah

760
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,880
Ah, yeah

761
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,580
- I usually agree with Jae Suk.
- That was funny.

762
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,010
- My goodness.
- But that's enough, Jae Suk.

763
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,040
- Stop it.
- Haha is talented.

764
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,240
- What do you mean?
- Talented in what?

765
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,540
He's good at it. Yeah

766
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,920
He's good at luring customers.

767
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,160
- I know that.
- Gosh. I did it only twice.

768
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,520
- He's good at running a business.
- Come on.

769
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,430
"Let's make our customers happy!"

770
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,190
- He's good at sales.
- My goodness.

771
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,690
So Min looks as if she were
tagging along with a couple.

772
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,290
Oh, right. I shouldn't have sat
between them.

773
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,700
It's not like that.
There's nothing going on between us.

774
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,110
Don't deny it.

775
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,610
You two used So Min's injury
as an excuse to meet up.

776
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,030
What?

777
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,310
"Let's eat together
since So Min got hurt."

778
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,110
"Let's eat together
since So Min got hurt." Like this.

779
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,850
I think that's what's happening.

780
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,380
(Cheeky)

781
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,850
- You're quite far away from me.
- Exactly.

782
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,680
- Hey, that's why...
- That was unexpected.

783
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,120
- That's why I can talk freely.
- I didn't see that coming.

784
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,360
- He's talking recklessly.
- Exactly.

785
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,390
- I can say whatever I want.
- He's being reckless.

786
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,660
He's talking recklessly.

787
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,520
Jae Jung, is your skin
naturally dark?

788
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,260
- The skin on my hands is dark too.
- What I'm saying is...

789
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,600
- He likes soccer.
- That's right.

790
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,990
- The K League...
- Are you good at soccer?

791
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,170
I'm not good at playing it.
I'm just a fan.

792
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,960
- He's a big fan. He also...
- Yes, I'm a big fan.

793
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,430
- Suwon Samsung Bluewings.
- He has almost all the teams'...

794
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,200
- soccer jerseys.
- It's a different team.

795
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,580
- That's how much I like soccer.
- Right.

796
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,910
- Yes, he likes it so much.
- Really?

797
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,110
I'm a big fan of the K League too.

798
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,440
- Right.
- If Jong Kook sets his eyes on you,

799
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,080
- You would be...
- just think that it's over.

800
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,150
- You would have no private life.
- That's right.

801
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,710
(The potential soccer club member
caught Jong Kook's eye.)

802
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,010
Don't worry. There are perks too.

803
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,860
- The perks are...
- No one would dare hit you.

804
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,890
- No one would.
- He'd give you his full support.

805
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:52,890
- Absolutely.
- That's a good thing.

806
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,100
No wonder why I couldn't look him
in the eyes.

807
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,990
- Once he sets his eyes on you...
- Where do you live?

808
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,370
- Well, I live...
- He got caught.

809
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,370
- Seolleung? Yeoksam?
- I live in Seocho-gu.

810
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,670
- Near Gangnam?
- Yes.

811
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,760
- You can pick him up on your way.
- I can give him a ride.

812
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,910
(I can give him a ride.)

813
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,930
- Pick him up on your way.
- We can carpool together.

814
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,910
- We can carpool together.
- This is great.

815
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,500
- Congratulations, Jae Jung.
- Congratulations.

816
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,350
Congratulations. It's very hard
to join his soccer club.

817
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,820
When a member of our club can't
attend practice,

818
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,980
he must send me photos to prove
that he has a reasonable reason.

819
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,860
(Only a certified document
can be accepted.)

820
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,950
DinDin once had to ask his mother
to call Jong Kook.

821
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,330
No, we can check up on him
by listening to his radio show.

822
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,750
- Really?
- He hosts a live show.

823
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,260
- Just know that he's so persistent.
- That's unbelievable.

824
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,960
You wouldn't be able to
get away from him.

825
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,570
I understand.

826
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,110
- Hey, I just realized something.
- Just a little bit.

827
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,840
- Haha seems cheerier than usual.
- Yes.

828
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,970
I bet it's because of those
who appeared on "How Do You Play?"

829
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,110
Hey!

830
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,270
- Enough is enough. Seriously.
- I wondered why...

831
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,440
- I see that it's true.
- Gosh. Stop it already.

832
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,620
- Shut it!
- "What's going on?"

833
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,850
Stop saying that. The fans believed
what you said and commented...

834
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,590
- during the live broadcast...
- Really?

835
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,660
we did for "How Do You Play?"

836
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,860
It's true.

837
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,750
So many people mentioned Running Man.

838
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,490
What am I supposed to do?

839
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,630
You just have to work hard here too.

840
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,930
I always do my best!

841
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,730
- He's stressed out.
- But you seem so cheery...

842
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,100
- today.
- He's doing so well.

843
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,600
- Haha.
- I like that cheery tone.

844
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,700
- Right?
- I do my best on this show too.

845
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,530
- But many of us are veterans.
- It's hard to stand out.

846
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,000
- That makes me look...
- No. That's not the reason.

847
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,880
It's all your fault! You jerk!

848
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,350
- This is funny.
- They hate me no matter what I do!

849
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,680
I want to do well too!

850
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,860
(The bald kid rebelled
for the 1st time at the age of 44.)

851
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,620
- He won awards from this show.
- Okay. I'll see.

852
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,860
- He shaved his head too.
- I'll see how he does.

853
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,990
- Gosh. He drives me crazy.
- Do your best.

854
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,250
- You...
- Hey.

855
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,260
Don't pretend you're not related.

856
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,070
- He seems indifferent.
- Look at his face.

857
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,690
- He's trying to stay out of it.
- Gosh.

858
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,790
I can tell by the look on his face.

859
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,460
As if he were saying,
"You're on your own now."

860
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,460
(Haha's Saturday coworker
became quiet for some reason.)

861
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,380
- You're on your own.
- He complimented Haha...

862
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,080
for his rap skills and everything,
but now...

863
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,940
he's trying to keep a distance
from Haha.

864
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,770
Yo, Yeah

865
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,710
- Fine. I'll figure it out.
- He won't help Haha anymore.

866
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,010
My, that was hilarious.

867
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,620
What are we going to do here?

868
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,980
- That's right.
- What?

869
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,630
Isn't that my seat?
I should be the referee.

870
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,750
- I'll help you. That's your seat.
- I should be the referee.

871
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,070
- The referee's seat... Hey, move.
- Hey.

872
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,670
So Min should be the referee.

873
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,100
That's my seat.

874
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,930
Suk Jin, why did you suddenly
help her? You didn't do that before.

875
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,870
- Because she was alone...
- I'll tell you what happened.

876
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,530
- He came...
- He hadn't helped her before.

877
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,310
- Why...
- He didn't when the camera was off.

878
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,820
(The icon of fake kindness)

879
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,740
- Here we go
- Honey

880
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,590
- Yes, honey?
- You see,

881
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,620
since she had leg surgery,

882
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,510
So Min gets excited
when others come to her.

883
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,860
- I missed talking to others.
- She seems excited, right?

884
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,950
- She gets excited to see others.
- True.

885
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,250
- She's happy to meet others.
- Yes, I am.

886
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,660
We changed our clothes.
Then why are you...

887
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,720
- still standing with them?
- Oh, I see.

888
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,570
- You should stand on this side.
- Right.

889
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,670
- Really?
- Yes.

890
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,100
- Should I move to that side?
- Yes.

891
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,070
- Suk Jin.
- We're on the same team.

892
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,570
- Hey.
- We look much stronger, right?

893
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,680
- They're five.
- I picked the right ones.

894
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,730
- Hey.
- We look much stronger, right?

895
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,540
(Looking around)

896
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,610
- Yes, you did.
- By the way, the words...

897
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,940
- They all look weak.
- "Team Others" as in "husband"...

898
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,510
- As if we were So Min's husbands.
- We're all her husbands.

899
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,540
- It sounds similar to "husband."
- Right.

900
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,780
- We're all her husbands.
- As if you were So Min's husbands.

901
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,560
It's as if all of you were
So Min's husbands.

902
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,950
- Exactly.
- So Min,

903
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,660
- what's my seniority level here?
- So Min.

904
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,250
- Answer me.
- My gosh.

905
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,220
- Hey.
- Why did you make us wear this?

906
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,430
You look happy, So Min.

907
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,790
It looks as if you were
So Min's husbands.

908
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,290
You always wanted to see guys
fighting over you.

909
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,100
- Men fighting over you.
- I like being in that situation.

910
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,140
I see that you like different types.

911
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,970
They're so different
from one another.

912
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,380
- They're all very different.
- Indeed.

913
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,840
- This is funny.
- I can tell you one thing.

914
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,270
I didn't marry them for looks.

915
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,350
- I didn't marry them for looks.
- I can see that.

916
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,680
There's no doubt.

917
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,850
- I can see that.
- You're absolutely right.

918
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,150
What's important is...

919
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,780
that we get along so well
with one another.

920
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,780
(We get along so well
with one another.)

921
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,780
(They love each other
more than they love their wife.)

922
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,450
- Right.
- Brother.

923
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,220
- There's no conflict between you.
- Never.

924
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,100
- The husbands get along well.
- Yes, we do.

925
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
Sleep over
at his house tonight, okay?

926
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,370
I'll drink some soju with Jae Suk.

927
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,790
- Okay?
- See you later, Haha.

928
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,640
- Take care of her, okay?
- Of course.

929
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,110
- Don't you worry.
- You must be happy.

930
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,840
- It's good they get along well.
- My gosh.

931
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,180
She's a modern woman.

932
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,380
This doesn't happen
even in Hollywood.

933
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,910
- It'd be really...
- Right.

934
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:07,320
- Can you see the roulette?
- Yes.

935
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,940
That's the roulette
that Suk Jin will spin at the end.

936
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,420
- There's a 50 percent chance.
- I see "Get off Work" too.

937
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,980
- What's "Get off Work?"
- Seven slots are already filled.

938
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,860
There are "Prize," "Penalty,"
and "Get off Work."

939
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,890
"Get off Work" means
you can go home right away.

940
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:18,980
- Right away?
- Really?

941
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,490
- You mean, I can go home?
- Yes.

942
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,360
Since Jae Suk succeeded in guessing
all your team members,

943
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,260
you should put this sticker
over one prize slot.

944
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,100
- I can make up for it easily.
- Right.

945
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,760
- Okay.
- Put it over a prize slot.

946
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,070
- Got it.
- Oh, over a prize slot?

947
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,460
- Over the letters like this?
- Oh, I see.

948
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,700
- Over a prize slot.
- I see.

949
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,080
- Oh, no.
- I didn't know that.

950
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,580
(The chance that Suk Jin will get
the penalty went up.)

951
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,740
In the first mission, there are
matches between the men...

952
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,680
- and a match between the women.
- Okay.

953
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,880
We'll compete separately?

954
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,480
The game that will be played
by the men is...

955
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,120
the one that became
an official sports game...

956
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,420
in the US this year.

957
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,630
- Great!
- The first official event was held.

958
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,220
- Finally.
- It's PFC,

959
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,190
Pillow Fight Championship.

960
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,190
- What's that?
- What is it?

961
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,900
Pillow fights have become
an official sports event.

962
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,670
- Oh, my.
- Really? That's ridiculous.

963
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,430
There's a league for it,
and the champion gets the prize money.

964
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,170
The organization was founded in the US.

965
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,370
(The official pillow fight match
with prize money held in the US)

966
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,770
- Pillow fight matches?
- Oh, really?

967
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,580
- That's interesting.
- But...

968
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,110
Jong Kook is on the other team.
It's not fair.

969
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,510
- You have KCM.
- Exactly.

970
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,680
He's so weak.

971
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,420
But he seems much heavier than me.

972
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,940
- He weighs more than 100kg.
- Do we lose when we cry?

973
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,750
- Yes. That's the exact rule.
- What?

974
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,780
- You have 90 seconds in each round.
- Okay.

975
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,130
There's one rule we added.

976
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,450
You must keep smiling
throughout the game.

977
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,720
- I see.
- Okay.

978
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,600
You must keep smiling
for 90 seconds.

979
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,430
If you stop smiling or get upset
during a match,

980
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,930
the referee will give you...

981
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,380
- a yellow card.
- Okay.

982
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,730
- You get disqualified for three.
- Got it.

983
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,880
- All right.
- It's a normal pillow fight.

984
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,150
After the game ends,
based on the number of warnings,

985
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:49,650
the accuracy of attacks,
and how you maintained your smile,

986
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,420
Kang Chan Hee will decide
the winner.

987
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,560
Okay.

988
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,060
- Okay.
- As for the order of players...

989
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,590
There will be 2 1-on-1 matches,
1 2-on-2, and 1 3-on-3 matches.

990
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,860
- There will be 4 rounds in total.
- The 2-on-2 match sounds fun.

991
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,870
- Let's do this.
- Just as we played...

992
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,830
- the floating mat game...
- Exactly.

993
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,370
- We need to decide wisely.
- But...

994
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,960
- This is good.
- Yes.

995
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,460
You have to win this round
no matter what. It'll work out.

996
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,810
- I wonder about their first player.
- I know.

997
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,430
- Right?
- A pillow fight can be intense.

998
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,940
Some kids put rocks in their pillows
when I was in school.

999
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,770
- You can't put anything in it.
- Stop looking at it.

1000
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,850
My gosh. He didn't even try to hide.

1001
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,040
- What are you doing?
- He startled me.

1002
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,850
- You can't do that.
- What...

1003
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,520
- Smile.
- Who are you?

1004
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,660
Well... Who are you?

1005
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,620
- I can't believe him.
- I'm on Team Others.

1006
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,250
- Why were you spying on us?
- He doesn't seem strong.

1007
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,850
- Are you guys done?
- Yes.

1008
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,850
- What?
- They already made their decision.

1009
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,100
- We already wrote the list.
- I see.

1010
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,600
- We're done.
- All right.

1011
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,270
Won't the girls play?
Only the guys play this game?

1012
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:43,160
- Only the guys play this game.
- Ask Wonstein and Jae Jung too.

1013
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,440
- I didn't see that.
- In what round do you want to play?

1014
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,660
You already finished writing the list.

1015
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,770
(You already finished writing the list.)

1016
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,830
What's the point of asking
when you've already completed the list?

1017
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,870
- He acts like this sometimes.
- Ask them what they want.

1018
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,040
- Wonstein and Jae Jung...
- We made a good plan.

1019
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,140
- The right men in the right place.
- Why didn't you ask them...

1020
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,980
What did they write?
We didn't get to see it.

1021
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,810
- Jae Jung, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1022
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,790
- It'll be fun if you don't know.
- Right.

1023
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,980
- The first round...
- I'm curious.

1024
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,480
where the two teams will fight
to get the upper hand...

1025
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,330
is Suk Jin versus Haha.

1026
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,270
- All right.
- That's good.

1027
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,600
- Nice.
- It's a big match.

1028
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,890
- It really is a big match.
- My gosh.

1029
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,270
- Suk Jin is really strong.
- We chose the right player.

1030
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,460
These pillows are too soft
to hit anyone hard.

1031
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,460
You never know.

1032
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,080
- Before the game begins,
- Give me a heavier one.

1033
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,730
you should get hit a few times
like this.

1034
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,140
You should do this
so you can get used to it.

1035
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,810
- Don't waste your energy.
- All right.

1036
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,210
Don't waste your energy.

1037
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,940
- It's good, right? That's great.
- I'm starting to feel it.

1038
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,710
- Save your energy.
- Those punks.

1039
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,540
- It's important to keep smiling.
- It's for getting used to the pain.

1040
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,690
Don't forget to keep smiling.

1041
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,960
Each round lasts exactly 90 seconds.

1042
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,080
- You've got this.
- You can do this.

1043
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,790
- You can do this.
- Go, Haha!

1044
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,620
(Go, Haha.)

1045
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,370
(Screaming)

1046
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,100
- Go, Suk Jin!
- You've got this.

1047
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,370
Go, Haha!

1048
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,310
It's over for your husband.
Say goodbye to him.

1049
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,080
You should start smiling
when the bell rings.

1050
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,410
- You must keep smiling.
- You can do this.

1051
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,750
(Ready, fight.)

1052
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,750
- Go on.
- Smile.

1053
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,540
- You should smile.
- Smile.

1054
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,250
- No punching.
- Smile.

1055
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,480
- Keep smiling.
- No punching.

1056
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,250
- Smile.
- Gosh.

1057
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,830
(Suk Jin got a warning
for an upset look.)

1058
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,350
- Smile.
- Hey.

1059
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,230
- Hey.
- Smile.

1060
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,620
(The baldy appears.)

1061
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,870
- He looks like Geun Sik.
- He looks scary.

1062
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,560
- Hey, you look like Geun Sik.
- My goodness.

1063
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,910
- He looks so scary.
- Keep smiling.

1064
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,270
He looks too scary.

1065
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,180
- Smile. Don't forget to smile.
- Hey, smile.

1066
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,580
Hey, smile.

1067
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,350
- You can do it. Keep smiling.
- Smile.

1068
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,850
- Yes, hit him.
- Keep smiling.

1069
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,020
Don't stop smiling.

1070
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,640
You should keep smiling.

1071
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,690
(Laughing loudly)

1072
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,080
(It's getting hard for him
to keep smiling.)

1073
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,250
Hey, smile. Keep smiling.

1074
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,350
Keep smiling. Smile.

1075
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,620
You have 30 seconds left.

1076
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,790
- See if there's blood on it.
- They're doing well.

1077
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,790
They're good at this.
Both of them are fast.

1078
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,770
(Hitting hard)

1079
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:58,810
Smile.

1080
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,540
Great. That was good.

1081
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,830
- Smile.
- You should keep smiling.

1082
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,980
- Good job, Haha.
- Keep smiling.

1083
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,480
Suk Jin, you should smile.

1084
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,250
- I think he's tired.
- Haha looks like a martial artist.

1085
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,980
- Keep smiling.
- He's too tired to smile.

1086
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,810
(Breathing heavily)

1087
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,160
You should keep smiling. Smile.

1088
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,830
- Keep smiling.
- You should smile.

1089
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,830
Smile!

1090
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,790
(Right on target)

1091
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,500
(Suk Jin can't see straight
after getting hit on the nose.)

1092
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,160
Is Suk Jin bleeding?

1093
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,640
(Time's up!)

1094
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,560
(The two middle-aged fighters
are rescued before they crash.)

1095
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,960
- No way.
- Ninety seconds is quite long.

1096
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,980
That was exhausting.

1097
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,100
- Good job.
- Nicely done!

1098
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,410
- Of course you're exhausted.
- You won with your expressions.

1099
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,600
Team Ji has two warnings stacked.

1100
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,440
Team Others has one.

1101
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,410
Kang Chan Hee will decide
on the winner.

1102
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,480
Okay.

1103
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,290
Kang Chan Hee,
please name the winner.

1104
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,910
(Who will the referee choose?)

1105
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,350
- Well?
- Team Ji.

1106
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,930
(Did Suk Jin win?)

1107
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,890
(Round 1 goes to Team Ji.)

1108
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,830
Let's go!

1109
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,000
Seriously?

1110
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,310
Chan Hee, are you kidding me?

1111
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,770
- But he fouled.
- Nicely done.

1112
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,810
He grabbed me from behind.

1113
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,210
Are you kidding me?

1114
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,440
- He considered all the aspects.
- Chan Hee, how could you?

1115
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,680
Suk Jin forced himself to smile.

1116
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,480
- Yes, he laughed.
- He kept his smile.

1117
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,540
Chan Hee and Suk Jin
have a connection...

1118
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,480
of some sort.

1119
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,210
- What kind of connection?
- There is one.

1120
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,930
- What do you mean?
- That's absurd.

1121
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,080
- It's true though.
- Seriously?

1122
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,020
You're barking up the wrong tree!

1123
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,690
- Suk Jin just did well.
- Not in this day and age.

1124
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,600
Anyone can tell who the winner was.

1125
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,290
He punched me with his fist.

1126
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,370
Exactly. I saw that too.

1127
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,000
Suk Jin punched him with his fist.

1128
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,040
Just a second.

1129
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,370
- Haha...
- You were as light as a feather.

1130
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,310
- Suk Jin...
- He punched Haha.

1131
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,810
He punched Haha with his fist.

1132
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:41,980
He punched him right here.

1133
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,500
I admit that there was physical contact.

1134
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,680
That can happen, you know.
It's understandable.

1135
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,250
It's an accident that can happen
in this game.

1136
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,410
What?

1137
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,910
(It's an accident that can happen
in this game.)

1138
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,910
- What?
- That's just how it is.

1139
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,850
- What did you just say?
- It happens in the US too.

1140
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,560
What is it that you just said?

1141
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,730
It's an accident that happens
in the US as well.

1142
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,850
(He gained victory
but lost his language skills.)

1143
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,000
- It's time for the next round.
- Good.

1144
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,270
The next round will be...

1145
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,660
Kim Jong Kook versus KCM.

1146
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,940
(Kim Jong Kook versus KCM)

1147
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:14,140
(The best players from each team
go head to head.)

1148
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,810
My gosh!

1149
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,680
This wasn't rigged,
so what a coincidence.

1150
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,310
- No way.
- This is incredible.

1151
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,390
Hey! Don't you know that
I always carry a smile?

1152
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,790
- This was inevitable.
- I'm famous for always smiling.

1153
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,390
(Episode 339, 2017)

1154
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,390
(Kim Jong Kook and KCM
went head to head in arm wrestling.)

1155
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,560
(The match was close.)

1156
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,890
(But KCM defeated
the protein monster.)

1157
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,830
- Is this fun for you?
- I'm having a blast.

1158
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,500
Think of this as a bullfight.

1159
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,660
A bullfight?

1160
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,540
Did you really refer
to yourselves as bulls?

1161
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:51,100
- Jong Kook.
- Hey, KCM.

1162
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,980
- Gosh, I'm trembling.
- Bring it on, KCM.

1163
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,040
- Nice.
- Warm up.

1164
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,310
What for?

1165
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,410
Get ready!

1166
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,120
- Good luck.
- Jong Kook.

1167
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,250
- Let's go.
- Don't give it too much too early.

1168
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,070
Get ready!

1169
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,950
(The two bulls get overly excited
even before the game begins.)

1170
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,070
Get ready.

1171
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,010
- This really is exhausting.
- This is nerve-wracking.

1172
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,650
- Good luck!
- Go!

1173
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,510
(The Running Man Bullfight begins.)

1174
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,280
- Go for it.
- You've got this.

1175
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,860
Nice!

1176
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,320
- Get him.
- Go for it.

1177
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,320
- Why is it in your left hand?
- You have 90 seconds.

1178
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,130
(Swish)

1179
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,470
Go for it. That's it.

1180
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,990
(The two bulls
approach with caution.)

1181
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,260
They're both being cautious.

1182
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,110
Jong Kook, smile!

1183
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,280
You need to smile.

1184
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,050
- That's it.
- Jong Kook, you must smile.

1185
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,050
- Smile!
- Smile!

1186
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,340
That's it. You're doing great.

1187
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,280
(A right hook)

1188
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,380
You're doing great.

1189
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:02,050
Look. Jong Kook's
not having it anymore.

1190
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,280
- Look at them!
- What on earth?

1191
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,530
Smile!

1192
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,030
You must smile.

1193
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,720
Look at them.

1194
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,800
What's happening?

1195
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:16,360
(It goes from a bullfight to a dogfight.)

1196
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,970
You both must smile.

1197
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,360
KCM's in tears.

1198
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,410
Should we do something?

1199
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:24,470
(The wailing bulls)

1200
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:27,910
(Giggling)

1201
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,340
That's him laughing!

1202
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,090
- You must smile or laugh.
- Smile!

1203
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,610
Please smile!

1204
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,910
- Smile!
- KCM's crying.

1205
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,160
Keep smiling.

1206
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,110
You're in tears!

1207
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,320
He's exhausted now.

1208
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,990
(Between smiling and wailing)

1209
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,470
(Nine drops of tears
that are to reach you.)

1210
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,130
- Attack!
- Just keep smiling.

1211
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,490
Smile!

1212
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,590
Oh, dear.

1213
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,070
(Chang Mo is admitting defeat.)

1214
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,340
Smile!

1215
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:58,240
(The game ends.)

1216
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,650
- Unbelievable.
- That was incredible.

1217
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,110
- Gosh.
- This game depletes your energy.

1218
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,070
- It's fun though.
- Yes, that was fun.

1219
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,680
- It was a good workout.
- A workout?

1220
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,840
How was this fun for you
when all you did was take a beating?

1221
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,050
- Did I take a beating?
- Yes, you did.

1222
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:12,660
That was enjoyable.

1223
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,130
I don't remember
the latter half of the game.

1224
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,720
- He just...
- What happened?

1225
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,400
The referee will declare a winner.

1226
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,130
Who will Kang Chan Hee choose
as the winner?

1227
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,300
- Team Ji.
- Team Ji wins!

1228
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,360
- Nice!
- Let's go!

1229
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,010
- Gosh.
- Chan Hee...

1230
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,880
That was a lot of fun.

1231
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,650
- You kept smiling.
- Exactly.

1232
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,180
- It was a good workout.
- The third match...

1233
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,180
will be between
Park Jae Jung and Wonstein...

1234
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,380
versus Yoo Jae Suk and KCM.

1235
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,450
Seriously?

1236
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,910
(Jae Jung comes out attacking
right from the start.)

1237
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,010
(However, he runs out of energy.)

1238
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:46,590
Jae Jung's out of energy now.

1239
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,530
They're all exhausted.

1240
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,950
You did great.

1241
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,700
Let's see who won the third round.

1242
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,530
- Team Others?
- Team Others wins!

1243
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,820
(Team Others wins Round 3.)

1244
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,860
That was close but well done.

1245
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,070
- Congratulations.
- Get in here.

1246
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,260
- You never know.
- It's the last round.

1247
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,740
Go, Team Others!

1248
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,840
- All right.
- Let's do this.

1249
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,070
Go, Team Others!

1250
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,510
Go, Team Ji.

1251
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:08,700
- Let's go.
- Good luck.

1252
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,820
Don't forget to smile.

1253
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,320
All right.

1254
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,740
Get ready.

1255
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,010
Speed things up a little.

1256
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,410
Rather than blocking them...

1257
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,510
(The final round begins.)

1258
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,880
Rather than blocking them...

1259
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,220
Don't forget to smile!

1260
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,450
Why are you in front of me?

1261
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:22,660
Smile, everyone!

1262
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,430
Get him!

1263
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,590
(Jae Suk takes the first strike.)

1264
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:27,970
(However, Jong Kook counterattacks.)

1265
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,070
Get over here.

1266
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,630
(Laughing)

1267
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:32,740
Look at him.

1268
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,700
(Chucky armed with pillow
attacks sporting an evil giggle.)

1269
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,240
(His pillow bursts open.)

1270
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,740
(We sense Chucky
amid the floating feathers.)

1271
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,970
His pillow burst open.

1272
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,340
- What happened?
- Get him!

1273
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,050
- This is your chance.
- A pillow...

1274
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,320
- Attack him now.
- I need a pillow.

1275
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,650
His pillow burst open.

1276
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:50,860
- Over here.
- There.

1277
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,450
This is your chance. Attack!

1278
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,180
(While Jong Kook
is out of commission,)

1279
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,660
(Team Others fight back.)

1280
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,550
- His pillow.
- He doesn't have a pillow.

1281
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,260
(Stealing pillow)

1282
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,700
Hold on a second. I'm really sorry.

1283
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:09,110
(Chucky is armed again.)

1284
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,340
(Chang Mo gets beaten again
for going after Jong Kook.)

1285
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,550
I don't have a pillow!

1286
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:16,740
Seriously?

1287
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,220
(Jae Suk is his next target.)

1288
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:24,280
(The husbands get a beating
from Jong Kook.)

1289
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,780
- Get him.
- They're all exhausted.

1290
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,430
(They still maintain their forced smiles.)

1291
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:30,800
(It takes a toll on his heart again.)

1292
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,530
(The game ends
due to them all being exhausted.)

1293
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,900
- His pillow burst open.
- That was hilarious.

1294
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:37,740
There's no way we can beat him.

1295
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,700
- Everyone's exhausted.
- That was exhausting.

1296
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:41,740
Are you all right?

1297
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:44,880
It serves as a workout.

1298
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,300
Jae Suk's in tears!

1299
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,410
You got in your cardio workout.

1300
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:49,010
This is why it's an official event.

1301
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,780
Crying makes you a loser.

1302
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,220
- I love it.
- This is the time to smile.

1303
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,090
(Smiling while in pain
proves that you are a champion.)

1304
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:56,490
That was a close game.

1305
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,780
Anyway, please show us
who won the last round.

1306
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:01,050
- We managed a lot of hits.
- I maintained my smile.

1307
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,780
- You saw us.
- We kept on attacking...

1308
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,130
with our pillows intact
and we kept smiling.

1309
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:05,860
- I hope you saw what happened.
- We kept on smiling...

1310
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,800
- I subdued all three of them.
- We...

1311
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,200
We never stopped attacking.

1312
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,070
- I kept on smiling.
- We...

1313
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,200
- Thank yucca!
- Okay.

1314
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,410
- Team Ji.
- Nice!

1315
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,410
- Nice. Good job.
- Team Ji wins.

1316
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,570
(Sighing)

1317
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,570
Chan Hee...

1318
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,200
He will side with
whatever team Suk Jin's on.

1319
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,380
That's absurd.

1320
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,470
(The men's event ends
with Jae Suk in doubt.)

1321
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:25,970
That's absurd.

1322
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,340
But the battle isn't over yet.

1323
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,950
The women's event remains.

1324
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,180
(Team Ji versus Team Others,
Women's Event)

1325
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,760
The women will play omok instead.

1326
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,820
- Omok?
- I'm the best at that.

1327
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,900
- I'm not good at it. Oh, no.
- I'm the best at it.

1328
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,490
The standard rules will be followed.

1329
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,570
However, you are allowed
to take back a move.

1330
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,590
(The standard rules apply,
but a take-back is allowed.)

1331
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:44,840
- They can take back a move?
- Only on one condition though.

1332
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:47,200
Another teammate...

1333
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,010
must paint his face
in exchange for a chance...

1334
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,010
- to take back a move.
- Sounds good.

1335
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,910
- It will be a best of three.
- Okay.

1336
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,050
We'll see who has the stronger brainpower.

1337
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,470
I'm a master at omok.

1338
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,010
Me too.
I have never lost a match before.

1339
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,260
I have been crowned a champion
in my neighborhood.

1340
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,820
- Really?
- I'm not kidding.

1341
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,380
I have never lost a game
of omok before.

1342
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,860
- Omok is fun to play.
- In my case...

1343
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,820
Do you know how to play it?
You need five in a row.

1344
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,550
Do you really think
I don't know what omok is?

1345
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:13,930
No, I...

1346
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,860
- Of course you know the game.
- Are you kidding me?

1347
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,860
- You need five in a row.
- Right.

1348
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,470
It gets risky when the opponent has
three pieces in a row.

1349
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,430
There's a rule you must follow.

1350
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:24,570
If the opponent has three pieces
in a row with both sides open,

1351
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:25,610
you must block them.

1352
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,470
When there are three pieces in a row.

1353
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,050
There's no going back for me.

1354
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:31,240
Of course I know how to play omok.

1355
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:32,650
We'll attack first.

1356
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,010
- All right. We're attacking first.
- Sounds good.

1357
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,090
If you give your player a tip,
you'll have to apply...

1358
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,610
- the ink on your face too.
- We can't give them tips?

1359
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,160
Oh, I see.

1360
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,090
Ji Hyo, think before making a move.

1361
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,360
- I'm really good at it.
- Think before making a move.

1362
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,820
- Let's play!
- My hands are shaking suddenly.

1363
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,260
But even if you think a lot,
you can't play well.

1364
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,400
I'll start. Let's begin.

1365
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,990
- You just go for it.
- Good one.

1366
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,260
No, every player has a strategy.

1367
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,990
She put it right next to So Min's.

1368
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,070
She's making the same move.

1369
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:56,840
What?

1370
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:59,200
(It looks like Ji Hyo
will focus on defense.)

1371
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,450
- That was...
- What was that?

1372
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,510
- She's a good defender.
- What?

1373
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,340
(Attacking)

1374
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,410
(Defending)

1375
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,510
That's not it. Hey.

1376
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,280
- If she plays like that from now...
- She's in trouble.

1377
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,160
Ji Hyo, yours isn't on the line.

1378
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,550
She's in trouble.

1379
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,550
Where did she place
her second piece?

1380
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:17,260
- That's...
- What?

1381
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:21,400
(Going back and forth)

1382
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,700
You should think ahead
before attacking.

1383
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,860
Slow down!

1384
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:25,840
- Think before attacking.
- You should slow down.

1385
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,610
(Super fast omok)

1386
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:32,880
- All right.
- Whatever.

1387
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:34,680
- It's your turn.
- If she keeps attacking...

1388
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:36,720
Hey.

1389
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,650
(So Min places
3 pieces in a row first.)

1390
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:39,950
- Hey.
- It's over.

1391
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:42,050
- That's it.
- It'll be over soon.

1392
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:44,490
- That's it.
- It'll be over soon.

1393
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,010
All right. So Min.

1394
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,260
(So Min still has many chances
to attack.)

1395
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,430
Wait. That's it.

1396
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:52,660
It'll be over soon.

1397
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,860
All right. So Min.

1398
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,360
- What? She blocked it?
- Why did you place it there?

1399
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,470
- All right.
- No?

1400
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,470
That's it.

1401
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:58,630
All right. So Min.

1402
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,130
(She made
a completely useless move.)

1403
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,630
- It's our chance.
- Why did you place it there?

1404
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,110
Wait! Let me undo it.

1405
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,610
Then put some ink
on one of your team members' faces.

1406
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:07,650
You can choose whoever you want.

1407
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:08,680
(She has to put ink
on one of their faces to undo it.)

1408
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,610
That's kind of cool.

1409
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:17,090
(A receding M-shaped
hairline tattoo)

1410
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:18,410
Hey.

1411
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:19,880
She made a hairline for him.

1412
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,780
- Can you fill the other parts too?
- She made a hairline for him.

1413
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,090
It's because it looks awkward.

1414
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:25,300
It looks okay.

1415
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,450
- It's cute.
- It looks nice.

1416
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:27,530
I'll play now.

1417
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,320
- I will...
- Thank yucca!

1418
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,340
(She places it again
after undoing her move.)

1419
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:32,840
Please be careful.

1420
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,360
That's good.

1421
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:36,610
Take your time to think.

1422
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,970
No, that's not it.

1423
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:42,700
Just keep going.

1424
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,180
- That's it.
- You're almost done.

1425
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,280
Don't tell her.

1426
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:48,280
She's doing well.

1427
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:49,880
It's your turn.

1428
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,510
- What?
- Why did you place it there?

1429
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:52,590
All right.

1430
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:53,880
Hey, undo it.

1431
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,050
Why did you...

1432
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,590
- Why did you place it there?
- All right.

1433
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:58,130
Hey, place it now.

1434
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,320
- Why did you...
- Place it.

1435
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,470
- All right.
- Hey, undo it.

1436
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:03,400
- Why did you place it there?
- Hey, place it now.

1437
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,860
Why did she...

1438
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,130
You shouldn't have...

1439
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:07,410
- That's it.
- You should've placed it there.

1440
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:08,430
We won.

1441
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,110
(Ji Hyo found the exact spot
where she'll form double 3 rows.)

1442
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:13,550
- We won.
- That's not it.

1443
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,840
- She got it. We won.
- We won.

1444
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,010
That's four.

1445
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:18,610
- Wait. I'll undo my move.
- That's four!

1446
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:20,220
- You can't undo it now!
- No.

1447
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,240
- You can't undo it now.
- You can't undo it now.

1448
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,860
- Double three rows aren't allowed.
- That's not it.

1449
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,380
- It's not double three rows.
- It's not double three rows.

1450
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,630
- That's not it, you guys.
- Thank you!

1451
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,950
If she places a piece here and here,
it'll be over.

1452
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,450
- Aren't you giving her tips?
- No.

1453
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,590
- Aren't you giving her tips?
- No, we're not.

1454
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:32,860
- What? We're not giving her tips.
- You got it, Ji Hyo.

1455
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,090
- You can place it. Just place it.
- You're giving her tips.

1456
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:35,720
- You can place it here.
- Isn't that...

1457
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,970
Isn't that considered giving her a tip?

1458
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:38,200
- What?
- That's not it!

1459
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,340
We're telling her to place it
where she was going to.

1460
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:43,570
The place where she put it before.

1461
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,780
But the fact that you told her
to place it wherever you want...

1462
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,010
is giving her a tip.

1463
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:48,950
- No! We just told her to...
- We said it after she placed it.

1464
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:49,970
- We can't undo it?
- Mister.

1465
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,450
- She had placed it already.
- Ji Hyo, can you undo yours once?

1466
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,510
- She had placed it already.
- No.

1467
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:55,090
- Please, just this once.
- No, I don't have to undo it.

1468
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:57,160
- She had placed it already.
- Then she'll undo it once.

1469
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,320
Look at this guy.

1470
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,490
What?

1471
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,860
- He almost...
- How dare you stop my arm?

1472
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:04,660
Did you just hit me?

1473
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:08,200
If you were to make your move,
you should've placed it here.

1474
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,470
He's giving her tips!

1475
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:11,070
- He gave her tips.
- Hey, Spotty.

1476
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:12,160
- She lost already.
- Spotty.

1477
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,760
- "Spotty?"
- Hey, Spotty.

1478
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,760
(Spotty, Has a huge mole)

1479
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,840
She lost already.

1480
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,880
- "Spotty?"
- What was that?

1481
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,470
- "Spotty?"
- Is that a spit curl?

1482
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:22,010
We didn't mention that
double three rows weren't allowed.

1483
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,110
That's right.

1484
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,220
Then can she please undo it once?

1485
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,910
- That's...
- Then put ink on the two of them.

1486
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:28,220
- That's the general rule.
- It's the basic rule.

1487
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,780
- It's the basics.
- Wait. Why don't you refute that?

1488
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,050
I think you can just tell him
that it's allowed.

1489
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,860
- Tell me what?
- A rule on double three rows.

1490
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,050
- You should say it.
- Double three rows...

1491
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,550
Don't you want to do that today?

1492
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,700
- Hey, that's...
- It looks like he does.

1493
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,630
(When the staff decided
against Team Jong Kook...)

1494
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:47,010
(This is what I want to do today,
I guess.)

1495
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,910
(He must've been holding grudges
against it since then.)

1496
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:51,630
He decides the rules.

1497
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:53,070
"This is what I want to do today,
I guess?"

1498
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,570
Doesn't he decide the rules?

1499
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:56,910
Hasn't it been a month
since that incident?

1500
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:57,950
I think so.

1501
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:59,450
- You're still holding grudges?
- Is he sulking over that?

1502
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:00,950
- I think that's what you'll say.
- He's still...

1503
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,450
Don't you feel like doing so today?

1504
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,950
- Well...
- Can you undo your move once?

1505
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:06,260
Even if you do...

1506
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,880
- You have no chance anyway.
- She'll lose for sure.

1507
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,950
- It's because...
- That's right.

1508
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:10,180
- Let's play the next round.
- Right.

1509
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,930
- All right.
- You should block hers too.

1510
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:13,030
- Okay.
- That should be your strategy.

1511
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,200
It's 1 to 0.

1512
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,260
(Team Others 0, Team Ji 1)

1513
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,700
- We won, right? Yes!
- All right.

1514
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,240
Hey, Ji Hyo won...

1515
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,700
without realizing it.

1516
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,430
- Because...
- You're so good at this game.

1517
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:22,970
- So Min...
- I didn't realize it.

1518
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:25,010
So Min placed her pieces weirdly.

1519
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,300
So Min, you can do it well.

1520
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,610
Will I be able to do well this time?

1521
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:31,220
- I missed it.
- Watch her moves as you play.

1522
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,910
- Watch her moves.
- This time, since you...

1523
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:35,180
- Mister!
- So you should attack first.

1524
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,550
- Mister!
- I'm right, aren't I?

1525
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:38,490
- Just stay still.
- How dare you call me that?

1526
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:39,990
Just stay still, mister.

1527
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:41,130
- Mister.
- Why you little...

1528
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,880
You're a funny man, aren't you?

1529
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,160
- You look like a pickle.
- You're one weird man.

1530
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,260
What did you call me?

1531
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,970
- A pickle!
- What's wrong with you guys?

1532
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:49,760
- What's with you?
- You...

1533
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:51,840
- What are you doing, greengrocer?
- Sorry.

1534
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:53,130
Let's play.

1535
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,530
- Round Two will begin.
- All right.

1536
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,840
I should win this time.

1537
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,110
- This time...
- Do I get to attack first?

1538
00:51:58,110 --> 00:51:59,180
Yes, go ahead.

1539
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,570
(This time, Ji Hyo attacks first.)

1540
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:01,700
Let's play.

1541
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,680
Wonstein, aren't you glad
that your team won?

1542
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,680
- I cheered earlier because I was.
- You did?

1543
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:08,910
Tell that guy to stay quiet.

1544
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:10,990
The two of them...
I've never seen a play like this.

1545
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,410
Make a careful move.
Think before making a move.

1546
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:15,590
Where did you place it?

1547
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,160
Don't joke around and play properly.

1548
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,700
- Good job in coming in between.
- Okay, Haha.

1549
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,700
- That's it. Good job.
- That's it.

1550
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,760
It's okay.

1551
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,900
- You must defend.
- You'll get a chance.

1552
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,840
That's right!
That's where I was thinking of placing it.

1553
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,700
- So Min.
- Just defend it well.

1554
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,240
Go over there.

1555
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,910
That's it. Good job.

1556
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,280
- "Go over there?"
- That wasn't a great move.

1557
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,450
- "Go over there?"
- "Go over there?"

1558
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:35,950
- "Go over there?"
- Wait. Take your time.

1559
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:37,220
Rather than there...

1560
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,570
What are you talking about?

1561
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:40,610
- I mean...
- What are you saying?

1562
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:42,050
- No. Stay quiet.
- Good job in coming in between.

1563
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:43,150
- Stay quiet.
- That's a warning.

1564
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,780
- I mean...
- What are you saying?

1565
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,220
- No. Stay quiet.
- Good job in coming in between.

1566
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,220
Stay quiet.

1567
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,760
- So Min, you should...
- At this rate...

1568
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,660
take a look
at the whole thing first.

1569
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:54,070
- At this rate...
- That's it. That's good!

1570
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,530
We're going to win
for sure this time.

1571
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:56,530
Right there.

1572
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:59,700
(Right there.)

1573
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,260
That's it. That's good!

1574
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,700
We're going to win
for sure this time.

1575
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:08,180
(So Min can make double three rows
which guarantees her a win.)

1576
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,340
- So Min, up there.
- Right there.

1577
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,650
- No, don't put it there!
- No!

1578
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:12,110
- Be quiet!
- No, right there.

1579
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:13,220
(So Min, up there.)

1580
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,340
(No!)

1581
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,590
- Be quiet!
- No, right there.

1582
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:16,780
- That's a bit...
- No!

1583
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,220
- Mister!
- No, not there.

1584
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:19,550
Mister.

1585
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,880
- Be quiet!
- No!

1586
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,530
- Mister!
- No, not there.

1587
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,720
- Go for it.
- Mister.

1588
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,720
- An arrow shape.
- No!

1589
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,720
(She understood it wrong.)

1590
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,930
- So Min, why did you put it there?
- An arrow shape!

1591
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:29,160
- Hold on.
- She already put it there.

1592
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,400
Undo it right now.

1593
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:31,590
That's it.

1594
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:33,070
- Let's do it.
- I wasn't supposed to put it there?

1595
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,930
- I mean...
- You should pick someone else.

1596
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:36,760
- You should put it on someone else.
- Why do it on Haha only?

1597
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,470
- This doesn't even show much!
- You should put it on someone else.

1598
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:39,510
Put it on someone else. All right.

1599
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:40,510
Put it on KCM too!

1600
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:43,550
Jae Suk, close your mouth tight.
Like this.

1601
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:48,680
Wait.

1602
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:52,380
(Mexican omok player)

1603
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:54,490
Wait.

1604
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:55,680
(The beard transplant
was a huge success.)

1605
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,820
(Bushy)

1606
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,090
- It's the best.
- Well done.

1607
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:59,130
Look at it.

1608
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:00,630
- It's so cool.
- Jae Suk.

1609
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:02,360
- Really?
- You look like a foreigner.

1610
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,700
There's a character
that looks like him.

1611
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,030
- Do I look okay?
- What was it again?

1612
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:07,160
- I've seen him in an animated film.
- There's a character.

1613
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,160
Good.

1614
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,410
- Well done.
- You should grow your beard.

1615
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,800
- It looks great.
- I want it too.

1616
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:13,610
That's...

1617
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:14,950
He looks like a Mexican man.

1618
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:16,280
So Min, make an arrow. That's it.

1619
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,320
That was good.

1620
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,550
(By undoing her move,
she made double three rows.)

1621
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:21,110
- Right?
- Good.

1622
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:22,280
She won. It's over.

1623
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,820
- It's over.
- Double three rows are allowed.

1624
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:24,910
- There!
- All right!

1625
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,660
She won. It's over.

1626
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,930
- It's over.
- Double three rows are allowed.

1627
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,030
- There!
- All right!

1628
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:30,550
(So Min wins.)

1629
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:31,990
You should undo it.

1630
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:33,660
- We can't. She won already.
- That's it.

1631
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,260
All right. It's 1 to 1.
The last round.

1632
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,530
I'm relieved.

1633
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:38,530
So Min, you should
keep watching her moves.

1634
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,430
If you keep putting yours here,
it'll be disadvantageous for you.

1635
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:42,910
- Even them out.
- I got it! I know it too!

1636
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,110
What do you know?

1637
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,510
- Do it as I say!
- I know it too!

1638
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:49,240
- Excuse me.
- Are you two brothers?

1639
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,950
- Bodhidharma.
- Use your head.

1640
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:53,910
- Sir. Where are you from?
- What is it?

1641
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,220
- What did you say?
- Where are you from?

1642
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,090
- Are you Mexican?
- Mexico.

1643
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:58,550
- Hey.
- Mexico.

1644
00:54:58,550 --> 00:54:59,990
- You two...
- Spain?

1645
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:01,180
You're good at Korean.

1646
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,430
- Barcelona.
- You're good at Korean.

1647
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:04,990
I was born in Korea.

1648
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,530
- You were?
- Yes.

1649
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,530
You have to see the whole thing.

1650
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,300
The whole thing.
Don't focus on one side only.

1651
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,800
- I've seen you from somewhere.
- Got it?

1652
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,630
How did So Min
put the ink on his face like that?

1653
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:15,530
- She's skilled.
- She's skilled.

1654
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:16,530
Let's play.

1655
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:17,800
Is there a version
where you say "sorry?"

1656
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:21,800
They're placing their pieces.

1657
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,510
- Ji Hyo, take your time to think.
- Go.

1658
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:26,470
- Ji Hyo...
- Ji Hyo does think. She's good.

1659
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,450
- It's because...
- What's with her play?

1660
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,510
It's not bad.

1661
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:30,910
Shouldn't she undo it?

1662
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,450
- You don't have to.
- What did you say?

1663
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:34,490
I just don't get it.

1664
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:36,030
What was that for?

1665
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:37,090
Wait.

1666
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:38,130
Ji Hyo is following her.

1667
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:40,260
- Why did she block it?
- That's good.

1668
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,400
What are you doing?

1669
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,400
That's it.
She lost earlier with a similar move.

1670
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,470
Don't go easy on her.

1671
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,300
So Min, make an arrow.

1672
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,340
That's a great move.

1673
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,800
- So Min, make an arrow.
- What was that?

1674
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,860
That's a great move.

1675
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,280
Are you allowed to give such a tip?

1676
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,130
- That's great!
- An arrow...

1677
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:54,550
My gosh.

1678
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:56,950
- My gosh. Just put it there.
- That was...

1679
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:58,380
- Stay quiet!
- That's it.

1680
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,380
That was great.

1681
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,720
- That's too...
- You're giving her tips openly.

1682
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,010
They're telling her tips too openly.

1683
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:04,860
We were just cheering her on.
That was great.

1684
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:06,720
There's a great spot.

1685
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,660
- But that's a bit...
- Don't tell her tips.

1686
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,160
There's a great spot.

1687
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,550
- Will you keep giving her tips?
- There's something on the board.

1688
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,320
- No, mister.
- I was just removing the dust.

1689
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:15,260
Wait. We should put the ink on him.

1690
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,930
- What?
- We should put the ink on him.

1691
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:18,570
- That was too obvious!
- He should put the ink.

1692
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:19,700
We should put the ink on him. Ji Hyo.

1693
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,700
What?

1694
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,130
I'll put it on you.
Remove your glasses.

1695
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:23,930
Wouldn't the black one be better?

1696
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:25,340
But you are on the white team.

1697
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,470
What do you think
about a white beard?

1698
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:27,840
- Okay?
- Like the blue whale.

1699
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,110
(Well...)

1700
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:36,490
(It's neither cool nor funny.)

1701
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:38,720
That's... I'm sorry.

1702
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,990
It's not so funny.

1703
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,280
This isn't funny at all.

1704
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,990
This is even funnier.

1705
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,660
This is even funnier.

1706
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,200
- I told you to use the black ink.
- I'm sorry.

1707
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,130
- I told you it wouldn't be funny.
- It's not even funny.

1708
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:51,590
- Why would you put it on like this?
- It's not funny.

1709
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:52,630
It's not funny at all.

1710
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,930
I told you to use the black ink!
I had it all panned out.

1711
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:57,010
- It was... I'm sorry.
- It doesn't even look cool.

1712
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:58,880
- It's not funny.
- It's not funny at all.

1713
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:00,510
- No.
- Wait.

1714
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:01,840
My goodness!

1715
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,240
- Undo it!
- Block it! Undo it!

1716
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,550
- Undo it!
- You can put it on me.

1717
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:06,680
We almost won though.

1718
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:09,090
- Hey, you have thicker hair now.
- Well done.

1719
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:10,180
That's it!

1720
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,220
- That's it.
- Undo it.

1721
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,360
- Undo it.
- You're undoing it again?

1722
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,320
That's not allowed.
You've undone it many times.

1723
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,450
We almost won.

1724
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:17,800
Hold on. I won.

1725
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,130
Undo it now!

1726
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:20,450
- Ji Hyo wins.
- Undo every move!

1727
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:22,030
- Ji Hyo won.
- Undo every move!

1728
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,090
- This is...
- Why?

1729
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:24,260
You should've made a row
with five pieces.

1730
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,930
Why make another row
with four pieces?

1731
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:27,800
- She had a row of five pieces.
- That's right.

1732
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,800
- We won!
- That's right!

1733
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:31,280
- That's right.
- Double four rows.

1734
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,180
- We won.
- Team Ji won.

1735
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,740
Suk Jin, there are points
from 1 to 5.

1736
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,180
Give one each to your teammates.

1737
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,240
- I can do that?
- Yes.

1738
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:42,410
- Is it good to get five points?
- Yes, five is good.

1739
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:43,650
Since you don't have to
give yourself a point,

1740
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:44,880
you can just use four.

1741
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:46,360
All right.

1742
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,530
I worked hard earlier
when we did the pillow fight.

1743
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:51,590
I should give five points to...
Jong Kook, you're sitting down.

1744
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:54,300
Well... It's not that.

1745
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:56,470
- Still...
- We've been standing, so...

1746
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:58,490
Jae Jung worked really hard earlier.

1747
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:00,590
- Suk Jin.
- Thank you.

1748
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:01,970
Jae Jung earns five points.

1749
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,360
That's so disappointing, Suk Jin.

1750
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,470
And...

1751
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,530
No wonder you're upset, Jong Kook.

1752
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:07,570
Right?

1753
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,240
- No wonder you're upset.
- I worked so hard.

1754
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,280
I saw how Wonstein
gritted his teeth and worked hard.

1755
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,450
Come on, Suk Jin.

1756
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:13,650
(What's worse is that 4 points
went to Wonstein.)

1757
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:15,050
Actually, Wonstein...

1758
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,720
- I was really surprised by him.
- Hold on.

1759
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:18,360
M.O.M... My gosh.

1760
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,220
I'm so ready to ruin their album.

1761
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,220
(I'm so ready to ruin their album.)

1762
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:23,820
- You should hurry and record a song.
- Suk Jin.

1763
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,590
You did so well in omok.

1764
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:29,090
I'm sorry. Wait.
I forgot about you, Jong Kook.

1765
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,800
- That was awkward.
- You forgot about me?

1766
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,260
- Well...
- Why did he take Jong Kook...

1767
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,740
if he was going to do this?

1768
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,070
- Well, Jong Kook is...
- He just made use of him.

1769
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:38,800
- Jong Kook is...
- You used him and threw him out.

1770
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,110
You're always number one
in our hearts.

1771
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,880
All right.
The point distribution is over,

1772
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,650
and the losing team
got a point each.

1773
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:45,740
(Team Others earned a point each.)

1774
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:47,340
You guys are really tight.

1775
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,820
M.O.M is quite tight.

1776
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:49,820
- They're tight.
- I didn't know...

1777
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,220
- they'd be this tight.
- All right.

1778
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,110
All right, then.

1779
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:55,450
Let's see where he lasts longer.
M.O.M or Running Man.

1780
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,450
You're about to do
your last mission.

1781
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,630
Like earlier, if you guess...

1782
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,590
who Suk Jin will choose
as his teammates...

1783
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:03,160
- Again?
- We're changing teams?

1784
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,160
If you guess correctly again,
it'll be disadvantageous for Suk Jin.

1785
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:09,300
He'll not stick with Jong Kook
this time for sure.

1786
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:10,470
- Stay quiet.
- That's right.

1787
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:12,070
Because he's uncomfortable
with Jong Kook.

1788
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:14,050
He knows that I won't try my best.

1789
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:18,780
Sir, can you take a look at mine?
Can you check if it's correct?

1790
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,280
Are you getting tutored?

1791
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,610
- Am I right?
- There's a high possibility.

1792
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:23,950
- Right?
- There is?

1793
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:25,610
Then I'll go ask for your advice.

1794
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:27,010
Can you please keep quiet?

1795
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,360
Sir, I'm sorry,
but can I compare mine to yours?

1796
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,950
Can you take a look at mine too?

1797
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:34,300
- It's because...
- There's only a slight difference.

1798
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,320
Mine too.

1799
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:37,070
- Are you done?
- Yes.

1800
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,930
The eight of you should open it
at the same time.

1801
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:41,340
- All right.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1802
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:42,970
Let me check them.

1803
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:46,470
Let me see if anyone
has guessed correctly.

1804
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:47,800
I'm certain...

1805
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,650
I'm certain that he picked them.

1806
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:52,050
I think he picked the members
of M.O.M...

1807
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,840
and So Min.

1808
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:55,910
The members of M.O.M and So Min.

1809
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:57,010
(Jong Kook thinks he picked
M.O.M and So Min.)

1810
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,550
I get a space for the penalty
if I overlap with one,

1811
00:59:58,550 --> 00:59:59,550
and two spaces
if I overlap with two?

1812
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:01,260
- That's right.
- That's how it works?

1813
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,050
(The more they overlap,
the more spaces he'll get.)

1814
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,720
It's so obvious.

1815
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:06,160
I guess a lot of ours
overlap with yours.

1816
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,070
So many people guessed it
correctly at a glance.

1817
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,200
- Are you all in my head?
- It's guaranteed.

1818
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,630
- Why are you so obvious?
- It's guaranteed to overlap.

1819
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:12,840
- I told you it was guaranteed.
- Please announce the result.

1820
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:13,930
It was a choice between
So Min and Ji Hyo.

1821
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,510
- Of course.
- All right.

1822
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:16,910
I'll announce the result.

1823
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,530
- Drum roll.
- If you picked the members...

1824
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:19,930
- of M.O.M, tell us.
- Right.

1825
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,910
I did include the members of M.O.M!

1826
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:22,910
All right!

1827
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:24,840
Raise your hand if you included
the members of M.O.M.

1828
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,450
Let's see. Everyone did?

1829
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:27,740
Except for you two.

1830
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,110
I just wanted to play a game
with the members of M.O.M.

1831
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:32,990
- Please...
- Please let there be So Min.

1832
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:34,430
So Min!

1833
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,530
(Jeon So Min)

1834
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:38,320
We won!

1835
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,320
So Min!

1836
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,320
- We won!
- I should've picked So Min.

1837
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,630
- We won!
- So many overlapped with mine.

1838
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,070
- I might get the penalty.
- Yes!

1839
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:47,610
- I'm exempted.
- I'm exempted.

1840
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:48,610
How many are exempted already?

1841
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:50,110
I got all the others right,
but why did you have to pick me?

1842
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:51,680
- Seriously, Suk Jin.
- He's so obvious.

1843
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:55,280
Let's move to the next spot
for the last mission.

1844
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,240
- Let's go!
- Yes!

1845
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,240
I'm exempted from the penalty!

1846
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,090
I can't wait to see
what kind of game we'll play.

1847
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:05,380
Is this the last game?
It's hard for me to come out.

1848
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:08,720
I'm having so much fun today.
Can we extend the shoot a little?

1849
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,990
Come back next week.

1850
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:11,820
I won't be here next week.

1851
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,430
- Come back next week.
- Jae Suk...

1852
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:15,800
- I won't be here next week.
- Let's have more fun next week.

1853
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,340
What do I do? I seriously...

1854
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:19,630
- I don't want it to end.
- I'll see you next week.

1855
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:21,070
- I don't want it to end.
- That's right. Let's go home now.

1856
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:22,970
- So Min, let's go home now.
- Jong Kook.

1857
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,070
We should get some rest too.

1858
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:26,840
This time,
we're all Ji Hyo's husbands.

1859
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,910
- They're my husbands.
- We're Ji Hyo's husbands.

1860
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:31,280
- Ji Hyo has many husbands now.
- Let's win.

1861
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,910
But the real husband among us...

1862
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:35,150
- There's only one, right?
- Stop it!

1863
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,240
There's only one, right?

1864
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,680
For the first time...
Can I sit next to her?

1865
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:41,530
(Giving him a 2nd warning
with his looks)

1866
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:44,400
- What's wrong with you?
- Fine!

1867
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,590
Come on, Haha. Gosh, my husbands.

1868
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,340
Suk Jin won
in the previous mission,

1869
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,700
so you'll earn three spaces for prize.

1870
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:57,130
But the three of them
guess the teammates correctly,

1871
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,740
so it's the same thing
as adding three spaces for penalty.

1872
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:01,150
Don't they cancel each other out?

1873
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,550
No, the latter ones
cover the previous ones.

1874
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,150
It's better than getting...

1875
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:06,610
- just three penalty spaces.
- I get it.

1876
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:08,380
I might get the penalty.

1877
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:09,380
(Suk Jin is getting closer
to receiving the penalty.)

1878
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,380
My gosh.

1879
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,450
The last mission...

1880
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:15,280
is advantageous
for those who love music.

1881
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,900
It's called
Do You Want to Hear the Song?

1882
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,090
(The last mission,
Do You Want to Hear the Song?)

1883
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:20,820
Do you want to hear it?

1884
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,860
All nine of you will play.

1885
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,130
Each team will be divided
into two groups.

1886
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:27,760
So for your team,
1 group will have 3 people.

1887
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:30,630
Each team will roll the die.

1888
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:33,010
If you get 1 and 2, that'll be 12.

1889
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:35,150
Then we'll let you listen
to the song at 12 seconds.

1890
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,910
You'll guess what the song is
after listening to it for a second.

1891
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,240
But if none of you
can't guess the song,

1892
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,490
then we'll play the song
at 1 minute and 12 seconds.

1893
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:44,760
- I see.
- Okay.

1894
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,360
You can't just guess it though.

1895
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:50,430
You need to shout out the answer
to the quiz we give you.

1896
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:52,820
Then you'll earn a chance
to guess the song.

1897
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,820
- We need to get the answer?
- We'll never be able to guess it.

1898
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:58,530
For instance, the question will go,
"Who invented the Korean alphabet?"

1899
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:01,360
The members of the group must
divide the answer and answer it.

1900
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:03,630
So for us, it'll be
Sejong, the, Great.

1901
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:05,110
It doesn't matter
how you divide the answer among you.

1902
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:06,630
It could go, Se, jong, the, Great.

1903
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:09,450
I'm only looking at the back
of Ji Hyo,

1904
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:11,650
but I can see her brain
working fervently.

1905
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:14,240
She's trying to sort things out.

1906
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,490
The songs we'll play...

1907
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:19,720
are the hit songs
released from 2000 to 2021.

1908
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,950
All right. We got this.

1909
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,130
We'll play a song...

1910
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:23,720
- I'm an expert in this.
- from each year.

1911
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,200
We picked a hit song from each year.

1912
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,630
Those are the exact songs...

1913
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:29,220
- He knows a lot of songs.
- I'm listening to.

1914
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,630
- Because I love music.
- Jae Suk knows a lot of songs.

1915
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:35,970
If Wonstein picks the year,
we'll play a song from that year.

1916
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:37,160
Pick one
that's advantageous for you.

1917
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,910
- I'll choose 2010.
- That's great.

1918
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:41,700
- He picked 2010?
- That's when...

1919
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,180
Wonstein was in high school.
You were a teenager.

1920
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:44,200
I was 25.

1921
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,740
That's when you listen
to music the most.

1922
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,050
You listen to music the most
in middle school and high school.

1923
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:49,180
- That's right.
- That's right.

1924
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,550
Ji Hyo's die will be the 1st digit,
and Wonstein's will be the 2nd.

1925
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:53,550
Please roll it.

1926
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:56,030
(A hit song from 2010,
The section to be played)

1927
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:57,430
- That was great.
- Next.

1928
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:58,900
The first part is better.

1929
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:00,550
- No, the latter part is better.
- Is it?

1930
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,200
That's 0 and 4.

1931
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,470
- At 4 seconds?
- At 4 seconds?

1932
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:04,470
At 4 seconds?

1933
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:07,630
We'll let you listen to the song
at four seconds for a second.

1934
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:09,010
- This will be too hard.
- It's the prelude.

1935
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:10,030
- The prelude.
- It's the prelude.

1936
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:11,840
Play the song.

1937
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,030
What are we supposed to say?

1938
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:15,450
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1939
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:16,570
What are we supposed to say?

1940
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:18,150
(Both teams called to answer
as soon as they heard the song.)

1941
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,150
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1942
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:20,820
- No, we must answer the quiz.
- Let me answer.

1943
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,110
- We must answer the quiz.
- All right.

1944
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:23,840
Here comes the question.

1945
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:26,660
She's a genius poet
from the mid-Joseon period.

1946
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,660
She's also known as the sister
of Heo Gyun who wrote...

1947
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:30,090
- "The Tale of Hong Gil Dong."
- Let me answer!

1948
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,200
Heo.

1949
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,760
- Nan Seol.
- Let me answer.

1950
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:34,700
- What?
- KCM.

1951
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,970
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1952
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,090
- What was that?
- This is driving me crazy.

1953
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:38,090
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1954
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:39,090
Heo Nan.

1955
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:41,360
- Wrong.
- Let me answer!

1956
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,660
- Heo Nan.
- What is it?

1957
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,260
- Wrong.
- Let me answer!

1958
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:45,740
- You don't know the answer?
- I don't know.

1959
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:47,530
- It's your turn.
- Let me answer.

1960
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:49,550
It's our turn. Heo Nan Seol Heon.

1961
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:50,650
No, you have to say it
with your team.

1962
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:52,550
- Let me answer!
- Darn it!

1963
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:53,650
Heo Nan Seol Heon.

1964
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:55,720
(Suk Jin revealed the answer.)

1965
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,240
- Heo Nan.
- Seol Heon.

1966
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,010
- All right.
- Miss A.

1967
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,220
- Five, four...
- "Good Girl, Bad Girl."

1968
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,630
- No, it's "Bad Girl, Good Girl."
- Let me answer!

1969
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:05,220
Let me answer!

1970
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:06,550
Heo.

1971
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:08,430
- Nan Seol.
- No! This is your group.

1972
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:09,990
- Nan Seol Heon!
- What's wrong with them?

1973
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,200
I guess this is our group.

1974
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,260
- Oh, the three of us?
- Yes.

1975
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:13,430
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1976
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:15,470
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1977
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:16,630
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1978
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:17,910
- Heo Nan.
- Seol Heon.

1979
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:20,240
- Miss A.
- Yes.

1980
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:21,570
"Bad Girl, Good Girl."

1981
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,180
- All right!
- We got it.

1982
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,340
- Well done.
- That was close.

1983
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,380
We could've gotten it.

1984
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,380
This is our group?

1985
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,180
This is... Where do I belong then?

1986
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,720
The three of us.

1987
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,050
- Oh, the three of us?
- The three of you.

1988
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:33,610
We could've stolen the answer.
What a bummer.

1989
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,680
Guys, it's time
to pick the next year.

1990
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,130
It seems like you're telling
the answer to each other...

1991
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:38,530
- because you're sitting close.
- That's right.

1992
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:40,530
The 3 of you and the 2 of you
should switch seats.

1993
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:41,530
- The 3 of you and the 2 of you.
- Us?

1994
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:43,260
- Bring it on.
- It doesn't matter.

1995
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,430
Let's switch seats.

1996
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:45,740
This will be less confusing.

1997
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:48,240
I just understood the game.
I'll get it for sure this time.

1998
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,700
Jong Kook,
which year would you like to pick?

1999
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:52,530
Pick a year when you were active.

2000
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,450
- I'll pick 2002.
- That's good.

2001
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,340
- How does 2002 sound?
- That's good.

2002
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:58,180
- I know songs from 2002.
- You know those songs, right?

2003
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:00,240
- From 2002?
- No, we can do it.

2004
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,450
Roll the dice.

2005
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:02,550
I'm not sure about 2002.

2006
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:04,860
- It's 3 and 0.
- That's 3 seconds.

2007
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,860
Right. It's three seconds.

2008
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:08,320
- Play...
- I know...

2009
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,090
- the singers from then.
- Play the song.

2010
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:11,450
(A hit song from 2002
playing at 3 seconds)

2011
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:12,550
- Wait.
- It's a ballad.

2012
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:14,990
- Wait.
- It's a ballad.

2013
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,360
I can't tell from this.

2014
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,860
- Wait.
- It's from 2002?

2015
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:19,240
There was only the piano.

2016
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:21,070
Here comes the quiz.

2017
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:25,840
Who saved France from crisis
during the Hundred Years' War...

2018
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:28,950
between the UK and France
in the 15 century...

2019
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:30,840
after hearing a voice
that told her, "Save France?"

2020
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,650
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2021
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:34,240
- Joan...
- Of Arc.

2022
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:36,110
- UP's...
- "Puyo Puyo."

2023
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:37,860
- Is it incorrect?
- Let me answer. Joan...

2024
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:39,360
- Of Arc.
- No.

2025
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,510
- Come on.
- Let me answer.

2026
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:42,050
- Joan...
- Of Arc.

2027
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:43,130
Hold on.

2028
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:44,490
Kim Gun Mo.

2029
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:46,220
- Joan of Arc.
- Let me answer. Joan...

2030
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,630
- Joan of Arc.
- Let me answer. Joan...

2031
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:49,820
- Of Arc.
- He said "Joan of Arc" already.

2032
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,400
- Joan of Arc.
- Let me answer. Joan...

2033
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,990
(He keeps saying "Joan of Arc"
with innocent eyes.)

2034
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:55,110
You blew your chance.
Everyone needs to participate.

2035
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:56,930
Of. Arc.

2036
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:57,970
(They lost their chance
to answer once more.)

2037
01:06:57,970 --> 01:06:59,130
I want to get it right.

2038
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,570
- For goodness' sake.
- What are they doing?

2039
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,800
Joan...

2040
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,880
Another team needs to go first.

2041
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,320
Music, cue.

2042
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,010
(A hit song from 2002
gets played again.)

2043
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:10,410
- I know singers from 2002.
- Hold on.

2044
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:11,990
- I was active back then.
- One more time, please.

2045
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,110
- So it was released in 2002.
- Let me answer.

2046
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,030
- It isn't that song, is it?
- Joan...

2047
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:17,380
- Of Arc.
- Okay.

2048
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,030
And the answer is...

2049
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,930
Boohwal's "Never Ending Story."

2050
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:23,360
- Okay.
- We did it.

2051
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:26,030
- We did it. We got it right.
- How did you know?

2052
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,360
- It wasn't Lee Seung Chul's song.
- How did you know?

2053
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:29,840
All right. It was Boohwal.

2054
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,410
- All right. Good job.
- Okay.

2055
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:34,110
We have no reason to fight.
We are on the same team.

2056
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:36,070
- Seriously.
- They got it right.

2057
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:37,740
I loved this song so much.

2058
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:41,720
- Someplace where I can't reach
- Someplace where I can't reach

2059
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:42,880
That's right.

2060
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,450
- Was it released in 2002?
- All right. It's okay.

2061
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:46,180
Can I choose the year once?

2062
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:48,030
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

2063
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:49,450
We should take turns.

2064
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:50,820
In the 80s...

2065
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:52,090
Please start from the 2000s.

2066
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:53,550
(Please start from the 2000s.)

2067
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,200
- The 2000s.
- I am sorry, but...

2068
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,660
- the three of them...
- Never mind then.

2069
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,740
- still don't understand this game.
- Seriously.

2070
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,570
I understood it perfectly.

2071
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:01,660
There is no need.

2072
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,700
- Then...
- Listen to Wonstein.

2073
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,070
- Wonstein.
- Wonstein.

2074
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:07,130
- Go with the year he knows well.
- We believe in you, Wonstein.

2075
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:08,800
- That's right.
- How about 2021?

2076
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,610
Let's go with 2019.

2077
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:11,880
- That's a good one.
- All right. 2019.

2078
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,910
I was going to decide on 2019.

2079
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:16,240
Hold on. That was 3 years ago.

2080
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,160
All right. Music...

2081
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,180
(A hit song from 2019
playing at 47 seconds)

2082
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,180
Cue.

2083
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,450
(A hit song from 2019
playing at 47 seconds)

2084
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:23,590
I knew it!

2085
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,300
- I knew it!
- I knew it!

2086
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,900
- I knew it!
- It's from 2019.

2087
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:27,930
Let me answer!

2088
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:29,720
- No.
- The quiz comes first.

2089
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,240
Who was
the British political economist...

2090
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,030
who first came up with the term,
invisible hand,

2091
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:35,700
- to describe the power...
- Let me answer.

2092
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:37,070
- that moves the market?
- Let me answer.

2093
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:38,180
Adam...

2094
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:39,740
What's the answer?

2095
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,200
- Let me answer.
- You can't tell her the answer. Haha.

2096
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,410
Eden...

2097
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,450
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2098
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:45,780
- Adam...
- Smith.

2099
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,580
Okay. Please guess the song.

2100
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:49,540
ITZY's "Dalla."

2101
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:50,920
(ITZY's "Dalla")

2102
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:52,180
- I knew it!
- What's the answer?

2103
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:54,210
- Keep listening. I knew it!
- I knew it!

2104
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:55,830
- It must be a famous song.
- I knew it!

2105
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,030
- I have no idea.
- Let us hear a different part.

2106
01:08:58,030 --> 01:08:59,830
- I will jump to a minute later.
- Okay.

2107
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,160
Cue.

2108
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,200
(Playing the song
at 1 minute and 47 seconds)

2109
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,460
I got the hang of it.

2110
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,090
- Hold on. It's rap.
- It's rap.

2111
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,670
- Hey.
- Isn't it a song by Simon Dominic?

2112
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:07,790
It's someone else.

2113
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:09,500
- Adam...
- Smith.

2114
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:11,240
ZICO's "Any Song."

2115
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:12,430
(Incorrect)

2116
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:13,710
It isn't "Any Song."

2117
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,800
- Shall I jump to a minute later?
- Yes.

2118
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,710
Now playing the song
at 2 minutes and 47 seconds.

2119
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:20,210
(Playing the song
at 2 minutes and 47 seconds)

2120
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:21,820
- Is it a female singer?
- I don't know.

2121
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,040
- I am going.
- Is it a mixed-gender group?

2122
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,180
- I am going.
- I am going.

2123
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,680
- I am going.
- Is it a mixed-gender group?

2124
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,120
- It's a mixed-gender group.
- I am going.

2125
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,120
- I am going.
- Is it a song we know?

2126
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,250
Is it a famous song?

2127
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:32,620
I am going.

2128
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,590
I am going. That's how it goes.

2129
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,030
I am going.

2130
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:37,570
Right?

2131
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:38,790
- That's right.
- I am going.

2132
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:40,290
- Is it a collaboration?
- I am going.

2133
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:41,740
Please play it one more time.

2134
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:42,930
Cue.

2135
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:45,280
(A longer snippet is played
for the clueless members.)

2136
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,710
I am going.

2137
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:48,540
He is making it even more confusing.

2138
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:51,470
- Seriously.
- Be quiet.

2139
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:52,650
He is so loud.

2140
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:54,840
- You know that I
- You know that I

2141
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,820
(You know that I)

2142
01:09:58,620 --> 01:09:59,790
I am so confused.

2143
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:01,290
- It's impossible to guess with him.
- You know

2144
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,720
You know

2145
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,120
- I fly
- Hold on. Isn't it a song by BTS?

2146
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,290
That's right.

2147
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:07,660
(Is it a song by BTS?)

2148
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:10,090
- You know, I fly
- Hold on. Isn't it a song by BTS?

2149
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:11,170
Hold on. BTS...

2150
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,930
- You know, I fly
- What was the title? Hold on.

2151
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:16,170
I am so confused because of him.

2152
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:18,300
He makes...

2153
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,470
every song sound like
it's from the early 2000s.

2154
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:21,710
I can't think.

2155
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,000
He is too much.

2156
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,040
I got the exact melody.

2157
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,080
He makes every song sound like
it's from the early 2000s.

2158
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:30,450
- I will play a longer snippet.
- Please do that.

2159
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:32,250
- This is frustrating.
- Cue.

2160
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:34,580
(A longer snippet is played.)

2161
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,420
Let me answer.

2162
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:37,530
- Hold on. BTS.
- Right?

2163
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:38,830
- Adam...
- You know

2164
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,160
- I fly
- Adam Smith.

2165
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,460
- Hold on. BTS'...
- Five,

2166
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:42,620
- four, three,
- What was the title?

2167
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:43,720
- two,
- BTS'...

2168
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,290
"Man with..."

2169
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:46,540
No.

2170
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,430
"Man with..."

2171
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,000
- No.
- No?

2172
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,580
- Let me answer. Adam...
- Smith.

2173
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:54,280
(Both teams figured it out!)

2174
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,370
BTS'...

2175
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:58,780
"Blood Sweat Tears..."

2176
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:01,280
- "and a Spoonful of Passion."
- Hey, we know that song.

2177
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,450
- Oh, let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2178
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:04,820
- A...
- Dam...

2179
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:05,920
- Smith.
- Okay.

2180
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,160
- Go ahead.
- "Boy..."

2181
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,250
BTS' "Boy with Luv."

2182
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:12,030
("Boy with Luv" by BTS
was released in April 2019.)

2183
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:14,290
You know, I fly

2184
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:15,790
- You know
- You know

2185
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:16,870
("Boy with Luv" by BTS
was released in April 2019.)

2186
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:17,920
(Jae Suk and Ji Hyo
gave away the answer.)

2187
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,900
- I messed up the song title.
- I couldn't remember.

2188
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,040
This song is about you
so you should have known.

2189
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:25,110
There is a younger boy, okay?

2190
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:28,500
The song title is "Boy with Luv."

2191
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,110
It's a song for boys like us.

2192
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:31,920
BTS' "Boy with Luv."

2193
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,870
Team Ji got a question right.

2194
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:35,540
- We finally got a question right.
- Finally.

2195
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:37,120
Jae Jung, choose the year this time.

2196
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:38,510
I will go with 2013.

2197
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:39,680
- That's a good one.
- Did you say 2013?

2198
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,180
That year is my specialty.

2199
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,330
- The year is 2013.
- The year is 2013.

2200
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:45,620
Music, cue.

2201
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:47,830
(A hit song from 2013
playing at 7 seconds)

2202
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:48,920
Chung dung tak!

2203
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:49,960
(Chung dung tak!)

2204
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,790
Stop it.

2205
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:53,930
Stop it already.

2206
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:54,960
(Chang Mo's surround sound
began once more.)

2207
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,330
Seriously. Please.

2208
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:58,830
- What is up with you?
- I can't think of anything.

2209
01:11:58,930 --> 01:12:01,130
I am sorry.
I just heard, "Chung dung tak!"

2210
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:03,000
- This is so confusing.
- Seriously.

2211
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:04,670
I will give you the quiz first.

2212
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:08,290
He was an Italian sculptor and painter...

2213
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,380
who left works
such as "Pieta," "David,"

2214
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,510
and "The Last Judgment."

2215
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:13,920
Let me answer.

2216
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:15,460
- Michelan...
- Gelo.

2217
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:16,680
Okay.

2218
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:17,990
Oh, I don't know the song yet.

2219
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,330
For goodness' sake.

2220
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:21,420
(He just wanted to show off
his knowledge.)

2221
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,530
The year is 2013.

2222
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:23,590
Yes, it is.

2223
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:25,070
- Isn't that it?
- Michelan...

2224
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:26,130
Gelo.

2225
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:27,330
- Girls' Generation's "Gee."
- Girls' Generation's "Gee."

2226
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:28,960
- It's incorrect.
- It wasn't released in 2013.

2227
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:29,960
- It was released before that.
- Right.

2228
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,300
- Really?
- It was released in 2008 or 2007.

2229
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,430
- Shall I jump to a minute later?
- Yes.

2230
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:35,450
Now playing the song
at 1 minute and 7 seconds.

2231
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:37,500
(A hit song from 2013
playing at 1 minute and 7 seconds)

2232
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,580
I heard "Inside."

2233
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:40,840
- Hey!
- Inside

2234
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:41,840
Let me answer.

2235
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:43,650
(Will Team Ji score again?)

2236
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:44,790
Michelan...

2237
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:46,680
- Ge...
- Lo.

2238
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,420
- Inside
- Inside

2239
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:50,490
Let me have you

2240
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:51,700
Guess the song title.

2241
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:53,830
Let me have you

2242
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:54,960
Guess the song title.

2243
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:56,620
Guess the song title.

2244
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:58,830
He makes it sound like
a song by S.E.S.

2245
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:01,430
(You can't escape Chang Mo's magic.)

2246
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:04,110
Let me have you

2247
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:05,780
I think that's the song.

2248
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:08,370
- Now, 2 minutes and 7 seconds.
- Okay.

2249
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:10,840
(A hit song from 2013
playing at 2 minutes and 7 seconds)

2250
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:11,950
Han ne gang!

2251
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,010
- Gosh.
- Which song is it?

2252
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:14,920
- What was that?
- You are right.

2253
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,040
Let me answer.

2254
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,290
(Did Jae Suk figure it out
despite Chang Mo's sound?)

2255
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:18,460
- Let me answer.
- Yes.

2256
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:19,990
- Michelan...
- Gelo.

2257
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:21,250
Apink's "Nonono."

2258
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:22,830
Okay.

2259
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:24,030
("Nonono" by Apink
was released in July 2013.)

2260
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,030
Okay.

2261
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,460
- Good job.
- Good job.

2262
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:28,290
- No no no
- No no no

2263
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,460
- No no no
- No no no

2264
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:34,460
I can't recognize any songs.
This is bad.

2265
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:36,960
I see that everyone is
an old fossil.

2266
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:39,830
- I don't know other songs.
- Every single one.

2267
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:41,970
- Let's go with 2020.
- That's a good one.

2268
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,840
Music,

2269
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:45,750
cue.

2270
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:48,150
- Let me answer.
- This is...

2271
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:49,620
- Here comes the quiz.
- It's that song.

2272
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,750
- I know this song.
- Yes.

2273
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:52,860
Its literal meaning is,
"Lying on an uncomfortable bed..."

2274
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:55,460
"and chewing on a gallbladder."

2275
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:57,790
What's the four-character idiom
which means,

2276
01:13:57,790 --> 01:14:00,090
- "Persevering for revenge?"
- Let me answer.

2278
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:03,920

- That's incredible.
- Correct.

2283
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:11,430
Let me answer. Jang Beom June's...

2284
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:13,240
Gosh, what was the song title?

2285
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,370
My dear...

2286
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,870

01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:19,320
"Your Shampoo Scent in the Flowers."

2289
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,620
- What?
- His pronunciation was off.

2290
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:22,650

2291
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:23,920

"Your Scent..."

2296
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:33,900
"in the Flowers."

(was released in August 2020.)

2315
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,160
- I totally knew the answer.
- Seriously.

2316
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:08,420
I knew it too.

2317
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,170
I was so close.

2318
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:11,830

("Traffic Light" by Lee Mu Jin

2336
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:46,760
All right.

He knows so many songs.

2339

I don't know any songs.

2340

a lot of four-character idioms.

- What happened?
- You are incredible.

2343
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:00,080
Did you look down on me?

2344
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:02,150
- The two of them...
- Tosagupaeng.

2345
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:04,040
- We have good teamwork today.
- We are doing well, right?

2346
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:05,160
You are doing so well.

2347
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,660
When he says the 1st half,
she figures out the 2nd half.

2348
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:09,460
Currently, the score is tied.

2349
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:11,680
We need to beat them.
We need to get this one right.

2350
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,160
- This is the final round.
- Okay.

2351
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,400
We need to do well.

2352
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,670
- We got this.
- Let's get it right.

2353
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:16,830
We will get it right.

2354
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:18,670
Let me answer.

2355
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:19,870
Nangong...

2356
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:20,870
- Bul...
- Rak.

2357
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,460
Zion.T's "Yanghwa BRDG."

2358
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:25,430
(Team Ji wins the mission
with their perfect teamwork!)

2359
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:26,610
Yanghwa Bridge

2360
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:29,470
(Team Ji's victory was unexpected
as they didn't know the rules.)

2361
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:31,170
I thought it sounded familiar.

2362
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:32,280
Yes. We listened to it many times.

2363
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:36,380
Thus, Team Ji won.

2364
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:37,880
Please distribute the points.

2365
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,790
- Okay.
- It's too bad.

2366
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,290
- So Min.
- What has gotten into you?

2367
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:44,030
We need to survive as a team.

2368
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:45,290
- Thank you.
- And...

2369
01:16:45,290 --> 01:16:46,360
Two points.

2370
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,500
Okay.

2371
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:49,260
We can add more prizes.

2372
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,290
(Team Ji adds 3 prizes.)

2373
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:51,960
- That's good.
- All right, everyone.

2374
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:54,400
To fill the three remaining slots,

2375
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,430
I will give you two questions
for the Ji Suk Jin Quiz.

2376
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,780
Since Suk Jin's favorite people are here,

2377
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:03,000
I will give you questions about him.

2378
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,040
That's good.

2379
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:08,080
If more than half of the people
get any one of the questions right,

2380
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:11,180
the remaining slots
will become prize slots.

2381
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:12,460
I see.

2382
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:14,860
We will be tested
on our knowledge of Suk Jin.

2383
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:16,750
We know a lot about him.

2384
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:18,290
All right. Here comes the question.

2385
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:22,670
What's the exact title
of the radio show...

2386
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:26,240
Suk Jin hosted for 4 years
from 2016 to 2019?

2387
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,630
(What's the exact title
of the radio show...)

2388
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:31,040
(Suk Jin hosted for 4 years
from 2016 to 2019?)

2389
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,330
I don't know this one.

2390
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:33,410
I am sure everyone...

2391
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:34,610
- You should know it.
- How do you not know it?

2392
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:35,610
Don't give any hints.

2393
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:37,450
You were on the show.

2394
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:38,510
- Don't give any hints.
- I don't remember.

2395
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:39,920
- You should know it.
- Hey.

2396
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,320
- So Min was on the show.
- Don't give any hints.

2397
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:43,990
- I mean...
- Jae Suk was on it too.

2398
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:45,920
- Jong Kook and Haha too.
- That's right.

2399
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,660
- I was on the show.
- I know the title.

2400
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,080
All right. One.

2401
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,120
You should know it.

2402
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,120
Two.

2403
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,290
- You should know it.
- Five people or more.

2404
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:53,290
Show your answer.

2405
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:54,460
We will succeed.

2406
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:55,760
- Five people or more.
- Show your answer.

2407
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,170
("Ji Suk Jin's 2 p.m. Date")

2408
01:17:58,290 --> 01:17:59,590
All right. "Ji Suk Jin's..."

2409
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:01,960
"Dawn of the Dead?"

2410
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:05,430
Why would a radio show title be
"Dawn of the Dead?"

2411
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:07,930
It isn't a zombie movie.

2412
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:10,650
So Min, how could you write
"Power FM?"

2413
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:13,170
- Hey.
- "Ji Suk Jin's Power FM?"

2414
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:14,750
I had no idea.

2415
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:17,340
- I couldn't remember.
- That's an SBS radio show.

2416
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,960
I got it right. "2 p.m. Date."

2417
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:20,420
For goodness' sake.

2418
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,030
- I have "2 p.m. Date."
- You have "2 p.m. Date."

2419
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,460
You have "2 p.m. Date."

2420
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:24,790
- Okay.
- We did well, right?

2421
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,530
- We succeeded.
- What's the title?

2422
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,330
It's "2 p.m. Date."

2423
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:29,570
I know the title, okay?

2424
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:31,420
- What?
- What?

2425
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:32,430
It's "2 p.m. Date..."

2426
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:33,740
- What?
- What?

2427
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:35,670
It's "2 p.m. Date by Ji Suk Jin."

2428
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:37,130
Come on!

2429
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:39,470
- Are you kidding me?
- What are you talking about?

2430
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:41,210
Are you kidding me?

2431
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:42,780
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey.

2432
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,870
- "2 p.m. Date by Ji Suk Jin?"
- It's "2 p.m. Date."

2433
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:47,280
That's what it says
on the official website.

2434
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,990
I had no idea...

2435
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,990
that was the full title.

2436
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:53,880
("2 p.m. Date by Ji Suk Jin")

2437
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:57,750
It's "2 p.m. Date by Ji Suk Jin."

2438
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:58,830
("2 p.m. Date by Ji Suk Jin")

2439
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:01,030
Is "2 p.m. Date by Ji Suk Jin"
the full title?

2440
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:03,000
It's the full title on the website.

2441
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,760
- I am disappointed in you.
- Suk Jin.

2442
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:07,130
I thought it was
"Ji Suk Jin's 2 p.m. Date."

2443
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:08,260
- I can't believe you.
- It's no wonder...

2444
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:09,260
- he got fired.
- We will get the next one.

2445
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:10,710
- All right.
- We will get the next one.

2446
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:11,760
Now comes the last question.

2447
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,500
If you are a fan of Suk Jin,
you will be able to get it right.

2448
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,950
What's Suk Jin's birth date?

2449
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:18,000
Okay.

2450
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:19,170
You know it, right?

2451
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:20,210
What's Suk Jin's birth date?

2452
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:22,120
- Okay. You know it, right?
- This is bad. I don't know.

2453
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,320
What should I do?

2454
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:27,120
Gosh, hold on.

2455
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,460
(His friends of 12 years
write down the answer.)

2456
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:30,620
You know it.

2457
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,090
You know you do.

2458
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:33,750
Isn't this the answer?

2459
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:35,720
Earlier today,

2460
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:39,040
a coffee truck came
to celebrate my upcoming birthday.

2461
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,400
I don't know.

2462
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:44,070
If you wrote down the answer,
show it to the camera.

2463
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,970
Can I check it one at a time?
I am so curious.

2464
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:47,170
You can do that
after the answers are revealed.

2465
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:48,280
- Okay. To be honest,
- Please reveal the answers.

2466
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,870
Wonstein, Jae Jung, and KCM
might not know it.

2467
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,580
- I am not sure.
- Please reveal the answers.

2468
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:54,170
I don't know. Is this the answer?

2469
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:56,010
I really think you guys should know.

2470
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:57,210
All right.

2471
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:58,380
Let's see the answers.

2472
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:00,660
(Seok Sam was born one day in 1966.)

2473
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:02,330
One day in 1966.

2474
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:03,960
- April 1968.
- Hey.

2475
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,530
So Min, did you write down
Valentine's Day?

2476
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:07,700
- I didn't know.
- February 14th.

2477
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:09,260
A holiday.

2478
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:10,700
February 14th.

2479
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,630
Did you write 1954?

2480
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,930
My mother-in-law was born in 1954.

2481
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:17,540
Seriously.

2482
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:18,830
- My mother-in-law was born in 1954.
- He wrote 1954.

2483
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:20,240
He wrote 1954.

2484
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:21,240
I wasn't born in 1954.

2485
01:20:21,370 --> 01:20:22,800
February 13th.

2486
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,170
I don't think
two people got it right.

2487
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:25,780
Jae Suk, you should get it right.

2488
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:27,950
- I am not sure.
- I know your birth date.

2489
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:30,340
He wrote 1702.

2490
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:31,950
(Born in 1702)

2491
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:33,320
He wrote 1702.

2492
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:35,160
(Ji Seok Sam, born in 1702,
mid-Joseon Dynasty)

2493
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,250
Hey.

2494
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:38,960
Do you think I am a zombie?

2495
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,530
(No one got
Suk Jin's birth date right.)

2496
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:41,960
How did no one get it right?

2497
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,260
When in February is it?

2498
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:45,400
- Isn't it next week?
- I know it's in February.

2499
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:46,630
Tenth.

2500
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:48,070
- Tenth.
- Tenth.

2501
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:49,240
- Thirteenth?
- Tenth?

2502
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:50,370
- Tenth.
- Tenth.

2503
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:51,870
- It's the tenth.
- Tenth.

2504
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:54,780
- It's 10th.
- I knew it. February 10th.

2505
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,150
I won't forget it again.

2506
01:20:56,910 --> 01:20:58,210
- Suk Jin.
- I know it now.

2507
01:20:58,670 --> 01:20:59,820
I won't forget it again.

2508
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:01,340
- Suk Jin. February tenth.
- I won't forget it again.

2509
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:02,510
You don't know my birth date.

2510
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:05,290
You were born in 1984. August...

2511
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:06,680
- August 14th.
- Forget it.

2512
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:07,960
August 15th.

2513
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,460
August 24th.

2514
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:10,580
It's 20th.

2515
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,420
We aren't that close.

2516
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:13,420
All right.

2517
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:14,700
- What's the point of knowing it?
- April 25th.

2518
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:17,090
- Right?
- Yes.

2519
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:18,290
Who else?

2520
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:20,500
Never mind.

2521
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,130
(Giving up)

2522
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:30,710
- Never mind.
- I am surprised he knows mine.

2523
01:21:30,710 --> 01:21:33,320
In any case, the roulette will get
three penalty slots...

2524
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:34,970
- since your friends didn't succeed.
- I am sorry.

2525
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,180
For goodness' sake.

2526
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:37,180
That was so funny.

2527
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:39,290
We are bound to get a penalty.

2528
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:41,460
- Five prize slots.
- All the penalty slots are here.

2529
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:42,790
(10 penalty slots 5 prize slots,
and 1 Get off Work slot)

2530
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:45,660
- Counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- There are 5.

2531
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:47,000
Getting off work would be nice too.

2532
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,500
- I will announce the rankings.
- Okay.

2533
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:54,330
The first place will win a prize
and be exempt from the penalty.

2534
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:56,670
The second place will be exempt
from the penalty as well.

2535
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,630
Everyone else except for those
with the exemption card...

2536
01:21:58,630 --> 01:22:00,430
has a chance of receiving
the penalty.

2537
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:01,470
Okay.

2538
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:02,470
I am jealous.

2539
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:04,300
- All right.
- Will the first place be exempt?

2540
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,370
- In the first place is...
- Not many people will remain.

2541
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:08,120
(1st place winner of today's race)

2542
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:09,380
Wonstein.

2543
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:11,320
(Wonstein)

2544
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:13,320
- Congratulations.
- Wonstein.

2545
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,620
- Congratulations.
- He did well...

2546
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:16,080
- earlier.
- Hey, Wonstein.

2547
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:17,420
I didn't see it coming.

2548
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:18,860
In the second place is Jae Jung.

2549
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:20,330
(2nd place winner, Park Jae Jung)

2550
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:22,530
- All right.
- How did this happen?

2551
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,830
Suk Jin
must have looked after them.

2552
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,910
- Seriously.
- I worked hard today.

2553
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:31,960
- I got all the questions right...
- He helped them get exempt.

2554
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,710
and did my best
with the pillow fight.

2555
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:35,750
- In the third place is...
- Thank you.

2556
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,650
So Min. In the fourth place are
Ji Hyo and KCM.

2557
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:40,010
In the sixth place is Jong Kook...

2558
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:41,780
and in the seventh place are
Jae Suk and Haha.

2559
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:42,880
(Jae Suk and Haha placed last.)

2560
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,250
Suk Jin, please spin the roulette.

2561
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:47,960
Hold on. Will the top two be
exempt from the penalty?

2562
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:50,080
- That's right.
- The two of them will be exempt.

2563
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,720
- So the remaining ones are...
- I am exempt.

2564
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,720
Four of them have the exemption card.

2565
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,960
So Ji Hyo and So Min left.

2566
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,370
- Yes.
- I will spin the roulette.

2567
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:59,570
- "Ji Hyo and So Min left?"
- What does that mean?

2568
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:01,930
- Gosh.
- Hold on.

2569
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:03,260
Are you going to ignore it?

2570
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:05,540
- Listen.
- He can't talk properly.

2571
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:06,930
Are you going to ignore it?

2572
01:23:06,930 --> 01:23:10,000
It's because he was alive
when the Korean language was invented.

2573
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:12,320
Hold on a second.

2574
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,650
"So Ji Hyo and So Min left."

2575
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:16,650
- It makes no sense.
- It's because...

2576
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:18,180
- he was born in the past.
- You understood.

2577
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:19,420
That's right. I understood.

2578
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:21,160
What happens if I get a penalty slot?

2579
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,160
In that case,
you will receive the penalty.

2580
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,050
- One of them...
- And Wonstein will pick...

2581
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:27,000
either So Min or Ji Hyo
to receive the penalty.

2582
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,570
If you get a prize slot,
they will receive the penalty.

2583
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:30,870
- Okay.
- You can do it, Suk Jin.

2584
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:32,400
- How does it work?
- I will go at once.

2585
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,540
- I didn't hear him.
- Let's go.

2586
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,330
Please explain it one more time.

2587
01:23:35,330 --> 01:23:36,410
There is no need.
It has nothing to do with you.

2588
01:23:36,410 --> 01:23:37,630
If he gets a penalty slot...

2589
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,800
- Suk Jin wants to go home.
- Why are you so irritated?

2590
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,080
- Seriously.
- Why are you so irritated?

2591
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,840
- It isn't important.
- Ji Hyo asked a question.

2592
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,580
- Why are you so irritated?
- Seriously.

2593
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:48,990
You should have listened
to the explanation the first time.

2594
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:51,250
- It might not be related to you.
- If he gets a prize slot,

2595
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:54,080
the two female members
will receive the penalty.

2596
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,360
(He spins the roulette!)

2597
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,420
If I get a prize slot,
they will receive the penalty.

2598
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:00,700
I am 100 percent sure
you will get a prize slot.

2599
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:02,370
- Can I take a look?
- A penalty slot.

2600
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,790
A prize slot.

2601
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:06,170
(Will he beat the odds of 31 percent
and avoid the penalty?)

2602
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:07,540
It's a prize slot.

2603
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,910
- It's a prize slot.
- A prize slot.

2604
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:11,240
It's a prize slot.

2605
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:12,330
- It's a prize slot.
- That's insane.

2606
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:16,750
(Suk Jin got a prize slot.)

2607
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:19,580
Suk Jin and Wonstein
will receive the prize.

2608
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:22,320
So Min and Ji Hyo
will receive the penalty.

2609
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,420
That makes no sense.

2610
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:24,510
(So Min and Ji Hyo
will receive the penalty.)

2611
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:25,710
That makes no sense.

2612
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:27,080
There were only a few prize slots.

2613
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,180
(Suk Jin got a prize slot
against all odds.)

2614
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:29,490
- That's incredible.
- Seriously.

2615
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:31,290
- Here comes the prize.
- I shouldn't use up my luck.

2616
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:32,360
(Screaming)

2617
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,590
- What is it?
- I am jealous.

2618
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:35,030
It's meat.

2619
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,590
- That's...
- Meat.

2620
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:38,960
We prepared lamb,
which is Suk Jin's favorite.

2621
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,870
- Lamb? I love it.
- Lamb.

2622
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:42,870
French rack is the best.

2623
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:43,910
It's so nice.

2624
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:45,800
- You will give it to your juniors.
- That's right.

2625
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:48,210
I will really give it to them.

2626
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:50,580
- The penalty of the day is...
- What is it?

2627
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:54,120
making the nose
that is bigger than Suk Jin's.

2628
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:57,510
- The nose?
- Other people won't participate.

2629
01:24:57,990 --> 01:24:59,210
You will flick each other's noses.

2630
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:00,250
That isn't too bad.

2631
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:01,580
It's my first time doing it.

2632
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:02,860
- Go ahead.
- Here I go.

2633
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:05,080
- Be careful.
- I know that it's really annoying.

2634
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:06,400
Seriously.

2635
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,590
How do I do it?

2636
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:09,900
- Do I use the middle finger?
- Yes.

2637
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,400
The two of them...

2638
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:13,540
That was too weak.

2639
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:14,930
- I don't know how it's done.
- Hold on.

2640
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:16,500
- What was that?
- Shall I flick Suk Jin's nose?

2641
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,570
Give them a demonstration.

2642
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:18,760
- Give us a demonstration.
- Would it be okay?

2643
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,110
- I am curious.
- Then I will flick your nose too.

2644
01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:21,930
- We will flick each other's noses.
- That's right.

2645
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:23,210
You should do that.

2646
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:24,780
- I will flick your nose too.
- That's right.

2647
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:26,650
- Go ahead.
- Let's flick each other's nose.

2648
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:27,670
That's a good idea, right?

2649
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:28,750
(No one asked them
to give a demonstration.)

2650
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:29,750
Why are you doing this?

2651
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,320
- Please show us.
- It's because...

2652
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:32,420
- they need to see it.
- I see.

2653
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:34,050
- I want to know how it's done.
- The nose...

2654
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:35,920
should shake like this.

2655
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:37,750
That's right.

2656
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:39,860
- Okay?
- Get it on the high-speed camera.

2657
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:40,860
The high-speed camera.

2658
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:42,370
- It should shake like this.
- Yes.

2659
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:48,070
(Flicking)

2660
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:49,240
It shook.

2661
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:51,110
(The demonstration was on another level.)

2662
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:52,130
- That's right.
- That's how you do it.

2663
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:53,170
The nose needs to shake.

2664
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:54,630
My eyes teared up.

2665
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:56,150
It wasn't that bad.

2666
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:57,870
- Can you pull up your glasses?
- Okay.

2667
01:25:58,110 --> 01:25:59,280
All right.

2668
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:01,280
- I will flick hard.
- Okay.

2669
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,790
- It will shake.
- Flick the tip of his nose.

2670
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:05,180
Flick the tip of his nose,
not his nose bridge.

2671
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:06,710
(Flicking)

2672
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:08,860
Flick the tip of his nose,
not his nose bridge.

2673
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:13,360
All right.

2674
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:17,220
(He destroyed Jae Suk's nose.)

2675
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:18,870
- All right.
- That was too much.

2676
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:20,330
