1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,460
Hello, everyone.
Aren't we starting the shoot yet?

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,750
(So Min always comes
before anyone else and says hi.)

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,330
Hello. Let me show you
something interesting.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,300
All right.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,070
(So Min wants to show something
even before the cameras are set.)

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,530
I can walk.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,030
I'm walking.

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,730
(Jeon So Min walks
with her two feet again.)

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,940
It's a miracle.

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,530
I'm recovering quite quickly, right?

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,800
Don't you think so?

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,140
I'm glad to hear that.

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,070
I know who today's guest is.

14
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,070
(I know who today's guest is.)

15
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,280
(She looks depressed
talking about the guest.)

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,780
I'm very upset.

17
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,390
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

18
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,130
I've been on TV shows for 20 years,
but I still feel nervous.

19
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,100
- This is crazy.
- Really?

20
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,500
- I'm always nervous.
- You don't seem that way.

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,960
Why is he the only guest?
Is Sae Ho that popular?

22
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,000
This is what Jae Suk did.

23
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,100
Sae Ho was in home quarantine,

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,530
and I've been staying at home
because of my leg.

25
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,340
Jae Suk wanted us to be friends,

26
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,100
so he gave me Sae Ho's number.

27
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,920
So I contacted him
with no hesitation.

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,390
Jae Suk is our mutual friend.

29
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,180
So I kept...

30
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,980
talking to him with no pressure.

31
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,390
But Sae Ho called me one day.

32
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,260
"So Min, Jae Suk is making
things awkward for us."

33
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,090
"I know you are
a nice and lovely person."

34
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,700
He kept saying that
when I didn't say anything.

35
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,000
What does that mean?

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,340
It felt like I lost.

37
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,680
I have high standards.

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,840
You got rejected.

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,870
- I do have high standards.
- You lost.

40
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,840
When can I dance again?
I'm really worried.

41
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,950
(Street Dancer So Min
wants to dance again.)

42
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,210
Hello.

43
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,920
- Are we starting right away?
- Haha.

44
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,480
Hey, it's been a while.

45
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,650
- Haha.
- Hey, So Min.

46
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,120
It's been a long time.

47
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,500
Se Chan, we haven't seen
each other for a month.

48
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,950
- Really?
- Yes. We were...

49
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,670
You've become
a lot prettier in a month.

50
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,370
(You've become
a lot prettier in a month.)

51
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,930
What was that?

52
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,900
I'm just saying that to be nice.

53
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,170
- Should I leave you two alone?
- No.

54
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,340
Stop it already, Haha.

55
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,370
- Are you two...
- Hello.

56
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,370
Where's everyone?

57
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,480
- Jong Kook.
- Have a seat, So Min.

58
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,250
I saw them only on the screen.

59
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,650
(The members of Running Man
had video calls all week.)

60
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,380
- Haha.
- It's been so long.

61
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,990
- Se Chan, long time no see.
- Jong Kook.

62
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,560
Hey, you can walk.

63
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,180
All right.

64
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,750
You can walk now.

65
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,960
- Se Chan.
- It's good to see you again.

66
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,330
Let's sit.

67
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,900
- My gosh.
- We are of one mind!

68
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,160
We are one!

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,160
So Min, you didn't catch
COVID-19 though.

70
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
So you can't be one of us.

71
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,110
We have our own chat room. I'm sorry.

72
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,060
- Without her...
- A chat room without me?

73
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,310
- Yes.
- Sure.

74
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,430
- We beat the disease.
- Hello.

75
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,430
How are you feeling?

76
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,680
- I'm fine.
- Hello.

77
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,580
- Jae Suk.
- We're all gathered.

78
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,580
- Hey.
- Your leg.

79
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,910
Ji Hyo.

80
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,090
So Min can walk.

81
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,310
- Good for you.
- Suk Jin.

82
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,380
You're walking.

83
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,960
- Hey, you're here.
- Hey.

84
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,750
- We're finally here.
- Mr. Ji.

85
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,220
(Hugging)

86
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,590
We're here.

87
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,590
We've overcome the disease.

88
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,900
- Yes!
- We got over it!

89
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,530
We've overcome the disease.

90
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,190
We got over the epidemic.

91
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,840
It's Ji Hyo who beat the epidemic.

92
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,060
She's amazing.

93
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,160
She's the strongest one.

94
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,110
It's Ji Hyo and So Min
who beat the disease.

95
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,080
I'm glad that So Min
got her cast off.

96
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,550
- Me too.
- I'm trying to toddle.

97
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,780
I know.

98
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,970
Is it okay to walk?

99
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,090
- Of course.
- That's great.

100
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,550
- Don't walk though.
- Stop it.

101
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,750
But I'm not sure
when I can dance again.

102
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,150
- Why would you dance?
- I want to dance.

103
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,330
She's...

104
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,060
- You're not a singer.
- Hey.

105
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,380
You can dance sitting down.

106
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,830
- Let's sit.
- You can dance while sitting down.

107
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,060
- This is really nice.
- I know.

108
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,620
She should get us water since
she's the last in the hierarchy.

109
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,460
- But she hurt her leg.
- I can do the clapper.

110
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,400
- No.
- He brings just one.

111
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,930
He's the worst.

112
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,130
People never change.

113
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,630
- He's unbelievable.
- He never changes.

114
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,740
He's the worst.

115
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,840
He wants you to bring it yourself.

116
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,970
I didn't know you were thirsty.

117
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,110
You don't drink water
only when you're thirsty.

118
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,520
- You should keep yourself hydrated.
- Sure.

119
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,310
- That's good for COVID-19.
- You know what?

120
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,840
This is really funny.

121
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,090
When I caught COVID-19,
this is what Jong Kook said.

122
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,720
"I actually..."

123
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,620
"talked to someone with the virus
for an hour, but I'm totally fine."

124
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,830
(I talked to someone with
the virus, but I'm totally fine.)

125
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,900
"I don't get sick."

126
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,190
- "I've survived."
- It's not like that.

127
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,630
- So I said,
- I was wearing a mask.

128
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,370
"Anyone can catch COVID-19."

129
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,840
And he said this the next day.

130
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,930
"I feel great after a workout."

131
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,050
Then he suddenly said this
on the third day.

132
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,310
"I don't smell anything."

133
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,810
(I don't smell anything.)

134
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,010
You know what it is.

135
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,810
My nose was stuffy.

136
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,350
I hated that feeling.

137
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,510
So I worked out really hard.

138
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,750
I sweated a lot.

139
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,120
And my nose was all cleared up.

140
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,750
And my sense of smell was gone.

141
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,100
- They were gone all together.
- You know...

142
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,370
I kept calling all of you.

143
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,430
And you guys had
one thing in common.

144
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,200
- You all pretended to be fine.
- Jae Suk.

145
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,040
- "Hello?"
- We didn't know.

146
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,930
"Hello? It's me."

147
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,410
"Yes. I'm fine."

148
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,350
- "Hello, Jae Suk."
- Suk Jin was hilarious.

149
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,200
"What a relief."

150
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,720
"I don't have any symptoms."

151
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,070
And the next day,
"Are you all right?"

152
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,120
"Yes, I'm fine."

153
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,920
(Yes... I'm fine...)

154
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,380
(He denied the reality
with a hoarse voice.)

155
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,680
He sounded horrible.

156
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,880
He showed more symptoms over time,

157
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,250
but he kept saying he was okay.

158
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,060
"My throat hurts a little,
but I'm fine."

159
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,450
It wasn't serious though.

160
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,060
- I know.
- I just had a sore throat.

161
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,870
- And you had a slight cough.
- Right.

162
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,430
I lost the sense of smell,
but I had a good appetite.

163
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,060
- Really?
- I had a really good appetite.

164
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,970
- You've gained weight.
- I ordered delivery food.

165
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,500
I checked the delivery app
on my phone after ten days.

166
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,770
I spent over 700 dollars.

167
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,810
I spent over 700 dollars
on delivery food.

168
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,420
- You spent a lot of money.
- I ate a lot.

169
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,440
You should eat well though.

170
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,750
- You live alone.
- I live alone.

171
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,810
Actually, I always
order the same menu.

172
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,990
But I had
nothing else to do at home.

173
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,860
- So I read the menu carefully.
- Exactly.

174
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,620
And I tried many dishes.

175
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,320
You finally understand
what I went through.

176
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,020
- That's true. I agree.
- You spent two weeks.

177
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,190
- How could you put up with it?
- For 14 days.

178
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,500
I can't do that for 14 days.

179
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,240
And those you live alone
can use your whole place.

180
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,370
- But I had to stay in my room.
- That's what I did.

181
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,540
Like the movie, "Oldboy."

182
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,740
It wasn't so bad though.
I liked being alone.

183
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,410
You said you were
having a hard time.

184
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,500
- What?
- Why are you saying that?

185
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,270
I really liked it.
I enjoyed being in quarantine.

186
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,250
- Really?
- You wanted to be with your wife,

187
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,850
so you said you'd kiss her.

188
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,940
(You told me
that you'd kiss your wife.)

189
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,080
Why are you lying?

190
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,420
Why are you lying to us?

191
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,860
Did he say he'd kiss her?

192
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,750
- Why would you do that?
- Why?

193
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,750
- Why are you lying to us?
- What's with him?

194
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,160
Why would you do that?

195
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,060
And when we first
had our group video call,

196
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,600
So Min called the five of us.

197
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,130
- I guess he didn't know about that.
- Why?

198
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,000
- He wasn't wearing a top.
- Right. He wasn't wearing anything.

199
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,500
(Suk Jin didn't recognize
the camera angle.)

200
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,250
- He was naked.
- There was So Min,

201
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,440
but he was talking to us like that.

202
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,770
- My gosh.
- It only showed my face.

203
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,880
- Do you know what's funny?
- "What are you doing?"

204
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,920
I was so hot.

205
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,290
We couldn't reach Ji Hyo...

206
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,450
when it was confirmed
that you caught COVID-19.

207
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,360
And Ji Hyo called me back
in the late afternoon that day.

208
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
"Jae Suk, why did you call me?"

209
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,730
"I'm sorry. I was out,
so I missed your call."

210
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,100
"Is something wrong?"

211
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,320
"Do you not know?"

212
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,630
(Do you not know?)

213
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,100
She had no idea.

214
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,870
- "Did something happen?"
- She didn't know.

215
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,060
"Jong Kook caught COVID-19."

216
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,000
"Did Jong Kook catch COVID-19?"

217
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,770
(Shocked)

218
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,440
- "Hey! Did you not know?"
- She had no idea.

219
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,810
- "No, I didn't know."
- She didn't know.

220
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,120
I got a call from her
after five days.

221
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,880
She called me
the day I was released.

222
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,180
"Are you all right?"

223
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,750
(Ji Hyo is a little late,
but she is warm-hearted.)

224
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,060
Because of Jong Kook,

225
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,290
two of us got infected.

226
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,560
- Hang on.
- What?

227
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,860
On "How Do You Play?"...

228
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,760
(It's finally happening.)

229
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,870
- They blamed us.
- That's right.

230
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,130
Bong Sun said she would kill us.

231
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,970
Speaking of which,
our shoot has been...

232
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,110
delayed two times
because of Running Man.

233
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,550
I won't let Running Man
get away with this.

234
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,270
Running Man!

235
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,550
Bring it on!

236
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,720
("How Do You Play?" was
furious at Running Man.)

237
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,440
I can't believe this.

238
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,640
Hang on.

239
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,080
- I heard...
- Unbelievable.

240
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,490
- the team producer is from Anyang.
- Yes, he is.

241
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,450
- How old is he?
- "How old is he?"

242
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,360
I was going to teach them a lesson.

243
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,500
Jun Ha and Bong Sun want to kill us.

244
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,000
Say something.

245
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,970
Producer Park Chang Hoon wants...

246
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,190
to fight with Bo Pil sometime.

247
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,330
(Producer Park Chang Hoon wants...
to fight with Bo Pil sometime.)

248
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,310
(No one's going to get hurt
in the battle though.)

249
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,110
We have to talk about this.
Haha did a shoot by himself.

250
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,440
- What?
- For "How Do You Play?"

251
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,550
You...

252
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,920
(During the quarantine period,
he made a home video himself.)

253
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,750
Goodbye, COVID-19.

254
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,620
(His love for MBS gives them
a good excuse to nitpick at him.)

255
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,310
Hey, you know what?

256
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,560
- We have to talk about this.
- There you go again.

257
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,080
- Did you do it alone?
- Listen.

258
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,120
He filmed "How Do You Play?"
even in his quarantine.

259
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,390
- You didn't do it for Running Man.
- Listen to me.

260
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,620
Running Man is...

261
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,920
Gosh, look at your faces.

262
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,290
- Do they pay you more?
- You punk.

263
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,340
Do they pay you better money?

264
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,240
Did you get an extra 50 dollars?
What is it?

265
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,660
- He filmed a video?
- They had...

266
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,840
nothing to air at all.

267
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,530
But we had a new episode here.

268
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,870
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

269
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,750
- They didn't have anything to air.
- An episode with you?

270
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,580
That's why they were mad.

271
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,540
That's why...
They are just ridiculous.

272
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,640
(That's why...
They are just ridiculous.)

273
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,280
(He shifts his position to survive.)

274
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,360
Listen.

275
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,510
You should think
about it, Jong Kook.

276
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,920
- About what?
- I'm not trying to side with them.

277
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
- They just...
- You're siding with them.

278
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,330
- What?
- You're on their side.

279
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,160
- What are you doing?
- You're taking their side.

280
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,790
Do you not realize
where you are now?

281
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,700
The members of Running Man
got criticized for no reason.

282
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,260
All right. They don't want me there,
and you don't want me here.

283
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,740
What about me?

284
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,210
Last week, a producer
of "How Do You Play?"...

285
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,450
- joined our soccer club.
- Really?

286
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,140
And he kept tripping and falling.

287
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,320
How hard is he working?

288
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,860
Anyway, I'd like to say this again.

289
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,620
The thing is,

290
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,250
they say Omicron causes
only mild symptoms,

291
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,890
- but it's still COVID-19.
- Right.

292
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,200
I was sick.

293
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,520
- We should be careful.
- Exactly.

294
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,790
Anyway, we've finally gotten back
all together after five episodes.

295
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,530
That's right. We had a few episodes
without some of the members.

296
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,300
- It's been a really long time.
- I've missed you.

297
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,480
We weren't even sure
if we could get together...

298
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,710
- Right.
- because things change every day.

299
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,910
So we invited a guest just in case.

300
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,250
- Who?
- A guest?

301
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,320
- Is he the only guest?
- Yes. I asked him a month ago.

302
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,620
- Is he the only guest?
- Yes.

303
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,380
- He must be someone famous.
- I think so.

304
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,830
Is Park Bo Gum discharged? Is he?

305
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,050
- Woo Do Hwan is discharged too.
- Really?

306
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,700
- Is it Zo In Sung?
- I guess he is discharged.

307
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,000
Is ZICO discharged?

308
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,920
(They talk about popular stars
to undermine today's guest.)

309
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,530
That means he's quite popular.

310
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,630
- But...
- There he is.

311
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,740
What?

312
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,160
- What?
- Hey.

313
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,240
Sae Ho.

314
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,030
- What...
- My gosh.

315
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,750
- Are you here to watch our show?
- What?

316
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,750
- Are you stopping by?
- What do you think?

317
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,320
He's...

318
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,370
(Without getting up to greet him,)

319
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,510
(they just stare at him sharply.)

320
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,140
- Do you want me to leave?
- By the way,

321
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,490
what's with the atmosphere here?

322
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,990
- Who are you bringing?
- I don't mind.

323
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,330
- I'm just...
- What's with the atmosphere?

324
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,460
I'll just...

325
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,150
- go to the terrace.
- Hey.

326
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,830
- Yes, Jae Suk.
- What's with you?

327
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,120
- I didn't see this coming.
- Hello.

328
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,620
He's got a lot of wrinkles.

329
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,970
I mean, what's with...

330
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,130
Did you suffer from COVID-19...

331
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,700
- with your face?
- What?

332
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,370
- Did you catch it with your face?
- I'll talk more over time.

333
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,480
- Let's sit.
- Do you have to be so...

334
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,440
Is he today's guest?

335
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,500
Aren't you...

336
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,870
supposed to give a hand
to your guest during the opening?

337
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,670
- You should greet me.
- Is he a wingman?

338
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,820
- Did you bring a guest?
- Your face is a lot funnier now.

339
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,720
Your face is interesting.

340
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,120
- Hello.
- Sit in the middle.

341
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,650
- Okay.
- Sit.

342
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,520
This is uncomfortable though.

343
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,860
- Have a seat.
- Sit.

344
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,860
- Sit here. I'll sit here.
- Sit.

345
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,100
Just sit there.

346
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,570
- Sit here?
- Yes.

347
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,260
So Sae Ho is...

348
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,200
Do we have to ask
what's new about him?

349
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,390
It's not like that.

350
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,610
- Gosh, Sae Ho.
- We know him so well.

351
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,210
- What perfume are you wearing?
- Gosh, that's strong.

352
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,500
- My gosh.
- That's really strong.

353
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,580
Jong Kook, can't you smell it?

354
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,080
I've lost my sense of smell,
but I can smell his perfume.

355
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,170
I'm here to help you.

356
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,620
Gosh, what's this?

357
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,850
- Is this a kind of training?
- It's hard to put up with it.

358
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,640
I put it on
because this is a big show.

359
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,620
Are you wearing expensive shoes?

360
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,120
Yes. They are Chanel.

361
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,190
- He's wearing Chanel.
- Right.

362
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,490
- I wear them for this show.
- Are these...

363
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,960
- They are Chanel.
- By the way,

364
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,360
- Chanel?
- is the rumor true?

365
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,160
- What rumor?
- That Chanel warned you.

366
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,390
Warning?

367
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,500
There's a rumor,
but that's not true.

368
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,660
Actually, there's
something upsetting.

369
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,340
- It's about Jae Suk.
- What about him?

370
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,000
- It was 11 p.m. last night.
- Was it last night?

371
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,240
It was 11 p.m. last night.

372
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,540
I was doing lower-body bathing,
and he made a video call.

373
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,110
- I was sweating a lot.
- He's always naked.

374
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,640
So I answered.

375
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,780
"I heard from Bo Pil."

376
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,450
"You're joining
Running Man tomorrow."

377
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,450
So I said, "Yes, I am."

378
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,690
"I don't want you to come."

379
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,380
Just one day before.

380
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,460
It wasn't like a week.

381
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,790
- Keep talking.
- With only a few hours left,

382
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,390
I'd been working out
for three days to come here.

383
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,940
"It's a little late, but you should
call Bo Pil and tell him..."

384
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,530
"that you can't make it tomorrow."

385
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,610
"Is that your decision?"

386
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,840
"Tell him that it's your decision."

387
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,250
I told him not to talk about me.

388
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,300
Don't talk about me.

389
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,040
"Don't talk about me. I'm just
saying this to help you."

390
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,220
Sae Ho, if you didn't
catch COVID-19,

391
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,720
weren't you supposed to go
on a date with So Min?

392
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,090
- No, it's not a date.
- It's not a date.

393
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,250
Were you going
to make a video together?

394
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,920
- With Jae Suk...
- Let me explain.

395
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,050
I tried to set them up
together three years ago.

396
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,660
- But they didn't like each other.
- Right.

397
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,160
So it just ended like that.

398
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,240
- To be honest...
- Why do you not like her?

399
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,900
It's not that I didn't like her.
You asked what I thought of her.

400
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,470
And I said, "I think she's nice."

401
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,270
"Why don't you go
on a date with her then?"

402
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,870
"Maybe there's
someone better for her."

403
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,130
Really?

404
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,250
I said...

405
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,980
Please don't get me wrong.

406
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,950
I have my position.

407
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,750
And I have my own standards, you know.

408
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,120
- You have your own standards?
- What...

409
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
- Nonsense.
- What are you...

410
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,860
- Hold on a second.
- He's talking nonsense.

411
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,380
- He's ridiculous.
- Your own standards?

412
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,960
- I mean, I have my own preference.
- Maybe that's because...

413
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,730
there are many beautiful women
around Sae Ho,

414
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,150
- and he knows many of them.
- I guess he's quite popular.

415
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,790
- But he never dated any of them.
- It's understandable.

416
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,890
- True. He didn't date any of them.
- Why...

417
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,260
What makes you think
I never dated any of them?

418
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,030
I've seen
Sae Ho's girlfriend before.

419
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,700
- How did she look?
- Sae Ho's girlfriend?

420
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,160
- You've seen his girlfriend?
- Rumor has it...

421
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,870
that Sae Ho always lies that he has
a girlfriend when he doesn't.

422
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,000
But I've actually eaten
with his girlfriend.

423
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,610
- Really?
- When I met her,

424
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,950
I couldn't understand why she was
dating Sae Ho.

425
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,190
- Really? Was she pretty?
- She was incredibly gorgeous.

426
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,780
He tends to spend a lot of money
on his girlfriend.

427
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,910
My goodness.

428
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,380
(He tends to spend a lot of money
on his girlfriend.)

429
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,020
- Let me explain.
- I get it. Okay.

430
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,150
- True. I do spend a lot of money.
- I see now.

431
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,830
- The mystery has been solved.
- It's beyond your imagination.

432
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,500
- He spends so much money on a girl.
- I know that.

433
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,660
- I know.
- No wonder why he can't save money.

434
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,300
- He's a generous man.
- Indeed.

435
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,710
- Exactly.
- Yes.

436
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,400
Now, I'll tell you about
today's race...

437
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,770
with the sole guest Cho Sae Ho.

438
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,080
The presidential election will be
held later this week.

439
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,250
- Really?
- Yes.

440
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,250
Oh, really?

441
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,720
Sae Ho, who will you vote for?

442
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,450
The ruling party or one of
the opposition parties? Tell us.

443
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,910
- I can't believe...
- Answer me.

444
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,550
- Must I reveal that right here?
- We all shared it at the opening.

445
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,230
- Just make a hand signal.
- We all revealed our thoughts.

446
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,490
- I'm sorry to disappoint you,
- A hand signal.

447
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,290
but I don't even know what
the ruling and opposition parties mean.

448
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,070
- He avoided the question smoothly.
- That was cool.

449
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,500
With the presidential election
right around the corner,

450
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,790
we're going to choose the captain
of Running Man through an election.

451
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,870
What? We'll have an election?

452
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,840
(There will be an election to choose
the captain of Running Man.)

453
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,440
- Running Man Presidential Race.
- I see.

454
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,980
It's an individual competition.

455
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,980
All of you are the candidates
for the captain.

456
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,640
The winner of the election will
lead the team...

457
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,720
- as the captain for the next month.
- Really?

458
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,860
- For one month?
- That's amazing.

459
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,050
- I know, right?
- For one month?

460
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,120
The captain will get various
benefits during his or her term.

461
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,790
The captain's name will be added
to the logo that appears...

462
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,230
in the top left corner of the screen
like "captain's name's Running Man."

463
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,390
- That sounds great.
- That's tempting.

464
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,440
- That's amazing.
- Nice.

465
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,340
(The 1st benefit will improve
the captain's reputation.)

466
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,440
Also, only the captain's photo will
appear on the screen...

467
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,630
with the TV rating
right before the show begins.

468
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,870
For the next month, we'll prepare
any food that the captain wants...

469
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,580
- for lunch.
- That's great.

470
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,640
(Benefit 3: Choosing the menu
for lunch regardless of the price)

471
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,120
- I really like this one.
- We'll provide the captain...

472
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,220
with E water during a shoot.

473
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,780
- Really?
- Oh, my. That's so nice.

474
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,420
The captain will get a pay raise
during his or her term as well.

475
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,860
However, the increased amount
will be paid in R money.

476
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,000
- R money?
- Yes.

477
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,020
We'll give the captain extra R money
before every race.

478
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,660
- That's good.
- It's a great benefit.

479
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,760
However, this kind of glory always
comes with great responsibility.

480
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,630
Since the captain will represent
this show,

481
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,500
during his or her term,
with a sense of responsibility,

482
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,850
the captain must attend
the staff meeting...

483
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,170
- more than once a week.
- Gosh. I don't want that title now.

484
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,270
(The captain's duty: Attending
the staff meeting of Running Man)

485
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,320
- I don't want to be the captain.
- I won't do it.

486
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,950
- The captain must offer ideas too.
- That's a penalty.

487
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,410
- That's a penalty, not a benefit.
- That's a penalty.

488
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,880
- I'll never be the captain.
- The staff meeting? Gosh.

489
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,220
- That's ridiculous.
- The captain must...

490
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,280
- I'll just do as I want.
- come by our office in Mok-dong,

491
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,120
give your approval of our plans,
and offer some ideas.

492
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,600
All of us said we didn't want to be
the captain except for Sae Ho.

493
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,470
- Does all of it apply to me too?
- Yes.

494
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,500
- Of course.
- Really?

495
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,800
- How does it work?
- The same rules will apply to him,

496
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,240
but he won't be on the show.

497
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,080
- Does that mean...
- Should he attend the meetings too?

498
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,950
That's good.

499
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,170
Cho Sae Ho's Running Man...

500
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,870
- without Cho Sae Ho?
- I support Cho Sae Ho!

501
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,320
- I'd go to the meeting once a week?
- That's a hassle.

502
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,510
- Actually, it's a good opportunity.
- It's a hassle.

503
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,380
- Your ideas will be used.
- Exactly.

504
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,280
The title will be Cho Sae Ho's
Running Man for a month. It's good.

505
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,720
- That would be great.
- If Sae Ho wins the election,

506
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,360
wouldn't people talk badly
about him?

507
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,090
- Even so, I would...
- What do you think?

508
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,230
The footage of the meeting...

509
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,790
- will be included in the show.
- It'd help you get some attention.

510
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,600
- The footage of the meeting?
- That sounds great.

511
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,660
That means you'll get paid too.

512
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,260
That'd be nice, but it'd be
meaningful to be part of the show.

513
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,290
That's right.

514
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,000
You will fight with one another
for this glorious title.

515
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,900
- I don't like it. It's a penalty.
- It's a harsh penalty.

516
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,600
- Gosh. And it lasts for a month.
- I don't like it either.

517
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,180
- It sounds like a hassle.
- I don't want to do it.

518
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,150
- I hate it the most.
- It's the worst.

519
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,810
- So Min, you should be the captain.
- But the meetings...

520
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,810
The meetings...

521
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,840
So Min, your eyes are sparkling.

522
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,610
No. You're all mistaken.

523
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,890
So Min seems quite ambitious.

524
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,960
No, I'm not, Jong Kook.

525
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,630
Ji Hyo, what do you think?
Do you want to be the captain?

526
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,020
It'll be Song Ji Hyo's Running Man.

527
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,630
Well, I'm a little indifferent,
to be honest.

528
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,360
That's an honest answer.

529
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,560
Obviously, getting as many ballots
as possible is very important.

530
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,970
- We should get as many as we can.
- I'll explain the rule to you.

531
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,030
Absolutely.

532
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,070
We'll give each of you a map...

533
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,040
- divided into electoral districts.
- Yes.

534
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,510
Divide ten ballots you'll be given,
and place them in any region.

535
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,070
For example, you can put
four ballots in Gyeonggi Province...

536
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,310
- and two in Jeolla Province.
- I see.

537
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,490
The winner of each mission will pick
a region and obtain the ballots.

538
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,250
(The winner picks a region
on someone else's map,)

539
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,430
(and obtains the number of ballots
allotted in the region.)

540
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,750
The remaining ballots after the race
will be yours.

541
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,250
- I shouldn't let the others know?
- Correct.

542
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,970
- Don't show your map to the others.
- Yes. Don't let them know.

543
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,020
My gosh.

544
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,740
- Make it advantageous to yourself.
- Okay. I understand.

545
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,760
- First off...
- This is...

546
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,260
- just like real-life politics.
- We need to be ambitious.

547
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,910
- Just like real-life politics.
- Should I just...

548
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,380
Should I put all in the same region?
What should I do?

549
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,600
- My, this is not easy.
- I have no idea.

550
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,510
- Should I put all in one place?
- There are six regions.

551
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,510
(Each candidate plans a strategy
to win the fierce competition.)

552
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,150
If you want to reduce the chance of
losing ballots,

553
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,040
- putting all in one area isn't bad.
- You're right.

554
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,750
- It's difficult.
- Then picking the right area...

555
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,750
can be an advantage, right?

556
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,280
- Sae Ho, can you quiet down?
- Pardon?

557
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,130
- That was the only thing I said.
- Sae Ho.

558
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,700
- You should be quiet now.
- Oh, I see.

559
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,360
Chungcheong Province...

560
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,000
Oh, I get it.

561
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,600
Se Chan must've put some
in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.

562
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
- Why are you saying that suddenly?
- I just saw you take the area off.

563
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,180
You have to take off every sticker,
so you can put them on your map.

564
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,980
I'm going to take off Jeju Island.

565
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,270
- Suk Jin...
- He doesn't understand the rule.

566
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,070
- He doesn't know the rules.
- What's wrong with him?

567
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,750
- You have to put them on your map.
- Don't let the others see your map.

568
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,480
- Make sure no one sees it.
- Right. Be careful.

569
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,890
It'd be funny if Sae Ho wins, right?

570
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,650
Yes. It'd be nice if he wins.

571
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,050
- We have three missions today.
- Don't worry.

572
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,320
- Those who place from 1st to 4th...
- I didn't see it.

573
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,000
will get to pick two regions
on someone else's map.

574
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,020
(After each mission, the top 4 will
pick 2 regions of another member.)

575
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,400
The person in 1st place can choose
2 regions of 1 of the 7 others.

576
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,400
So can the one in second place.
And they get the ballots.

577
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,170
- The remaining ballots are yours.
- Okay.

578
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,210
All of you finished
dividing your ballots.

579
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,840
- Now, please change your clothes.
- Okay.

580
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,950
Look at the view. It's beautiful.

581
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,950
(The 1st mission will be held
in a place with a great river view.)

582
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,720
What an amazing view.

583
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,660
- Oh, my.
- This place is so nice.

584
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,720
We can see the Han River from here.

585
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,780
- Sit down.
- Right.

586
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,460
- That was smooth.
- Can I sit?

587
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,050
- Yes, please.
- All right.

588
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,230
"Can I sit?"

589
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,730
- I must say, I can't stop laughing.
- What was that?

590
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,430
I'm surrounded by
Se Chan and Sae Ho.

591
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,000
- What do you mean by that?
- Don't make it a love triangle.

592
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,090
(She tried to make it
a love triangle.)

593
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,900
- You see, that's So Min's problem.
- The three of us?

594
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,360
- This is what they call...
- That's right.

595
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,740
- You guys are already here.
- You see...

596
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,140
(You guys are already here.)

597
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,740
- Sorry. Please don't interrupt.
- I'm sorry.

598
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,300
- How come you all came so early?
- Please don't interrupt.

599
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,840
- She wants to create romance.
- That's right.

600
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,610
- She keeps sending mixed signals.
- Exactly.

601
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,490
- She tries to create her own story.
- In fact...

602
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,110
I want you to act like that
only when your feelings are genuine.

603
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,490
That's exactly my point.

604
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,160
- Then you might have a chance.
- Yes.

605
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,050
- So Min seems...
- I know, but you keep...

606
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,580
- So Min looks...
- Right.

607
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,630
- As if she had feelings...
- She looks disappointed.

608
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,560
You know how So Min approaches a man
when he keeps a distance from her.

609
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,790
- Yes. She feels disappointed.
- So Min tends to do that.

610
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,530
- Is it because you're sad?
- I just want...

611
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,530
a certain level of intimacy.

612
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,260
- I see. Can you elaborate?
- What do you mean by that?

613
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,740
- Then...
- I want us to be close friends.

614
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,740
Would you not mind
if I drove you home after the shoot?

615
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,140
I don't want you to do that.

616
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,100
Would you not mind
if I drove you home after the shoot?

617
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,150
I don't want you to do that.

618
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,250
That's ridiculous.

619
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,010
- I mean...
- That's just weird.

620
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,490
- Gosh, I hate it.
- That's so weird.

621
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,610
- He's so bad at dating.
- That's the worst.

622
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,460
- That's disgusting.
- I hate it so much.

623
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,890
- What's wrong with it?
- But So Min...

624
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,400
- She seems excited.
- Yes.

625
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,790
- I'd prepare flowers for you.
- She's finally smiling.

626
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,500
- He knows how to make her smile.
- I'd put the flowers in my car.

627
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,230
- So Min likes things like this.
- Yes, she does.

628
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,440
- She likes it.
- "This is for you."

629
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,590
- And then I'd drive you home.
- "This is for you."

630
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,640
So Min, you're smiling
in a flirty way unlike usual.

631
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,380
- I just like comments like this.
- She likes such comments.

632
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,770
- It makes your heart flutter.
- Yes.

633
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,500
- She sure likes such comments.
- Say something like that too.

634
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,650
- Right.
- But I don't have a car.

635
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,680
(Chuckling)

636
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,750
You know that he has a car, right?
I can't believe he told such a lie.

637
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,390
He didn't tell me
that he had moved either.

638
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,660
I'll tell you
about the first mission.

639
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,160
The first mission...

640
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,020
where the candidates' weaknesses
may be revealed is...

641
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,820
- Okay.
- Say Yes! Variety Show Hearing.

642
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,560
- We've played this game before.
- Right. You must say, "I admit it."

643
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,630
- Is it a hearing?
- It was fun.

644
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,030
In Episode 574 where we had
the Elegant Western Road race,

645
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,860
you played this game with some hard
comments for you to admit...

646
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,300
- that the viewers sent to us.
- That's right.

647
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,680
(They could score points
only when they raised "Admit.")

648
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,980
(Everyone was confident.)

649
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,510
(I admit all of my body secrets
often mentioned on TV shows.)

650
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,310
(I've actually dated a guest
on a variety show.)

651
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,350
(I'm actually 168cm tall.)

652
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,500
(I'm 171.5cm tall. Gosh.)

653
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,930
Based on what I've seen
for the past four years,

654
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,700
(I don't understand why Jae Suk is
called the best MC in Korea.)

655
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,030
(They have to admit
such harsh comments.)

656
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,740
It was so much fun. I remember that.

657
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,800
- It was really fun.
- She wasn't there?

658
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,980
- At the donut place, right?
- Yes.

659
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,180
- That's right.
- Yes.

660
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,880
So Min couldn't be there
as she was a close contact.

661
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,950
(So Min missed the shoot
as she was a close contact.)

662
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,890
Sae Ho wasn't there either
as the icon of absence.

663
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,310
- Why didn't you come?
- Why didn't you come?

664
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,510
- I wasn't even invited.
- You should've come anyway.

665
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,850
- You should've come.
- We had a shoot in Gangnam.

666
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,580
- You should've come.
- You should've come.

667
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,430
- I'm disappointed.
- Why didn't you come?

668
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,350
- I apologize.
- Don't ever do that again.

669
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,930
- I was wrong.
- Yes.

670
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,930
- You were wrong.
- You should stay focused.

671
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,590
- I'll check the schedule.
- We were at Apgujeong.

672
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,640
- I won't let it happen again.
- Apgujeong Rodeo Street.

673
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,260
Since the two of them didn't get
a chance to play this game,

674
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,260
- we prepared it again.
- That's good.

675
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,500
Each of you will
listen to a question.

676
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,530
It's not difficult.

677
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,500
If you admit it,
your team wins one point.

678
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,510
- Okay.
- It's that easy, Sae Ho.

679
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,150
- All you have to do is admit.
- That's right.

680
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,890
- So this is...
- There may be weird questions.

681
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,510
- That's good.
- But I can score a point...

682
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,920
- if I admit.
- That's correct.

683
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,430
- You have to explain why as well.
- Okay.

684
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,520
You will be divided into two teams.

685
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,230
- Team So Min and Team Sae Ho.
- Yes.

686
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,970
So Min and Sae Ho will be given
five questions each.

687
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,000
- The others will be given only one.
- Okay.

688
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,030
- Okay.
- It must be a hard one.

689
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,200
- It'll still be hard.
- All right.

690
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,710
- We also picked the team members.
- Yes.

691
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,560
You'll be with the same members
as the last time.

692
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,770
Jong Kook, Suk Jin, Haha,
and So Min are on the same team.

693
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,940
(Team So Min)

694
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,500
- We're on the same team.
- And...

695
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,150
- Se Chan, Ji Hyo, Jae Suk...
- Great.

696
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,300
You see, after playing this game,

697
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,380
a lot of news articles about us
came out.

698
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,570
- True.
- That's the thing about this game.

699
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,340
- If you admit something...
- It made the headlines.

700
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,340
- Of course.
- That's true.

701
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,420
- You just have to overcome it.
- But they wouldn't pick easy ones.

702
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,420
- All right.
- Just admit whatever you hear.

703
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,990
- First up is So Min.
- Make sure to admit everything.

704
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,630
- Admit everything.
- Don't worry. It's not hard.

705
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,090
I bet So Min will deny
the comments so easily.

706
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,230
- Don't lose your temper.
- She's quite sensitive.

707
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,820
- It's not hard.
- Indeed.

708
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,170
Here's the first question.

709
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,090
- Stay calm.
- "To be honest,"

710
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,500
"I'm afraid to ask Se Chan out
because he might reject me."

711
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,310
(Question: I'm afraid to ask
Se Chan out...)

712
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,100
(because he might reject me.)

713
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,370
You've told me that before.
You remember that, right?

714
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,870
- Hey.
- You were afraid.

715
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,310
Be honest. You're afraid.

716
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,050
- Really? Hey, So Min.
- That's not true.

717
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,780
"What? No. I don't like you."

718
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,940
- Do you think I'd say that?
- That's not true.

719
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,410
- "I don't find you attractive."
- It's not like that.

720
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,680
- Just admit it.
- You were afraid.

721
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
- That's not the reason...
- It's not that hard.

722
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,210
It wouldn't feel great
if he rejected you.

723
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,990
- Is it because it's harder...
- If you thought that way...

724
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,530
- to make him fall for you?
- Is it not the reason?

725
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,800
Then deny it.

726
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,230
- Listen.
- Deny it.

727
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,830
Listen to me. Even if there's...

728
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,360
- a one percent chance, admit it.
- So Min, deny it.

729
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,100
That's not why I won't ask him out.

730
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,000
- Deny it first, and then explain.
- Why are you getting upset?

731
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,400
- Stay calm.
- Then what's the reason?

732
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,100
- Why won't you ask him out?
- Is there a particular reason?

733
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,100
- Tell us.
- She's tearing up.

734
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,310
It's because I'm not into him...

735
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,600
- Deny it first, and then explain.
- Deny it.

736
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,100
- Deny it first.
- You can explain after denying it.

737
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,940
- Just deny it.
- Say that you deny it.

738
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,610
- So Min, listen to me.
- You should say it.

739
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,110
- Come on.
- I guess I'm irresistible. Tell us.

740
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,850
- Admit it. Don't get upset.
- So Min, say you deny it.

741
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,610
- You won't ask him out... Good.
- Okay. She admitted it.

742
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,610
- She admitted it?
- Asking him out...

743
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,620
- Do you think I'd reject you?
- doesn't necessarily mean...

744
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,530
- Do you? Explain yourself.
- she's head over heels for him.

745
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,620
- Exactly.
- Right. Go ahead.

746
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,030
- I'll explain.
- Why do you think I'd reject you?

747
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,500
I think he'd reject me...

748
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,190
because he wouldn't believe...

749
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,500
that I really like him.

750
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,200
That's why I think he'd reject me
if I asked him out.

751
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
- So I admit it.
- Okay.

752
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,400
- That's not true.
- No way.

753
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,480
- That's not what the comment means.
- You should deny it.

754
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,740
- She practically denied it.
- Good job.

755
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,780
- This is what it means.
- Yes.

756
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,980
"I like him so much,"

757
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,210
"but I'm afraid he might reject me."

758
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,780
- No!
- She just denied it.

759
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,320
(No!)

760
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
- Hey, stay calm.
- She denied it.

761
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
- I told you, it's not like that.
- This is just a game.

762
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,760
- It's just a game.
- Let's say you have a crush on me.

763
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,590
- You ask me out, but I reject you.
- No one would believe it.

764
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,590
- I'll be honest.
- No one would think that way.

765
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,120
- It's true that she liked you.
- It's just a game.

766
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,260
Some of us knew that,
but we kept it a secret.

767
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,190
- When did I like him?
- There's nothing wrong with it.

768
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,500
- Haha, don't say anything.
- I didn't like him that way.

769
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
- Tell us, So Min.
- She practically denied it.

770
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,740
- Are you afraid I might reject you?
- Just admit it.

771
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,840
- No.
- She'll deny it.

772
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,900
- You won't admit it?
- I deny it.

773
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,810
- She denied it.
- Okay.

774
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,780
- Really?
- I knew it.

775
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,310
- Se Chan...
- It's okay. We can make up for it.

776
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,020
Maybe he gained weight
during the quarantine.

777
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,020
Yes, I did. You can see that, right?

778
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,380
Honestly, I could never admit it
because he looked like that.

779
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,750
- Exactly.
- It would've hurt my pride.

780
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,590
- He looks unusually ugly today.
- Exactly.

781
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,330
Sae Ho looks handsome
because of Se Chan.

782
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,680
- It's great. You should thank me.
- Things are going well for you.

783
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,150
- Sae Ho, don't cross your legs.
- Pardon? I shouldn't cross my legs?

784
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,030
He just told me
not to cross my legs.

785
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,390
Earlier, I left to change my mic,
and he scolded me...

786
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,570
for leaving during the shoot.

787
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,660
Where did you go?

788
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,040
- Right. You shouldn't do that.
- You shouldn't.

789
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,130
- Don't leave during a shoot.
- You shouldn't leave the set.

790
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,570
Sae Ho, your right nostril is
running.

791
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,670
Oh, thanks for telling me.
I admit it.

792
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,510
- I admit it.
- Why is your nose running?

793
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,050
- Are you okay, Sae Ho?
- I'm fine. I admit it.

794
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,320
- It's because...
- Instead of tears...

795
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,410
He has a runny nose
instead of crying tears.

796
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,020
- But this is...
- She denied it.

797
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,490
- She denied it.
- It was nothing to be upset about.

798
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,490
We can make up for it
if we admit ours.

799
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,110
But we already know the truth.

800
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,230
"I have called
one of the male guests..."

801
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,000
"who appeared on Running Man
for a personal reason."

802
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,030
- You have. Admit it.
- You'll admit it, right?

803
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,190
(I've called 1 of the male guests
for a personal reason.)

804
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,740
(You'll admit it, right?)

805
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,240
- She'll admit it.
- Be honest with us. Admit it.

806
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
- You have done it before.
- I know it's true.

807
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,600
- I know that.
- You should admit this.

808
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,810
It must be easy for her to admit it.

809
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,700
- You'll admit it, right?
- This one is easy.

810
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,310
If she admits it,
she has to tell us whom she called.

811
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,400
- I bet she'll admit it.
- She has to reveal the guests.

812
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,210
- Or say you deny it.
- That's not fair.

813
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,520
- Why must she reveal their names?
- Should she?

814
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,850
- She doesn't have to do that.
- She has to.

815
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,820
- What are you talking about?
- She doesn't have to do that.

816
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,380
(My head hurts.)

817
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,210
- She doesn't have to do that.
- Why must she?

818
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,530
- Or she can say she denies it.
- Answer me.

819
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,830
She doesn't have to do that.

820
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,390
- Why must she?
- She should tell us who they were.

821
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,830
- Why?
- Or she can say she denies it.

822
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,190
- Then...
- She doesn't have to reveal it.

823
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,960
- She should if she admits it.
- Or just deny it.

824
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,190
- Just deny it.
- You don't have to do that.

825
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,240
- There's nothing wrong with it.
- She can deny it.

826
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,360
Just deny it.

827
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,930
- It's not a bad thing.
- Just deny it, So Min.

828
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,570
I've called some of the guests too.

829
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,570
Just deny it.

830
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,600
- Suk Jin, it's not the same thing.
- Why?

831
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
It's the same thing.

832
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,700
- It's different.
- Nonsense.

833
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,100
I've called some of the guests too.

834
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,480
- It's okay.
- Admit it.

835
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,210
- She denied it.
- Why would you deny it?

836
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,250
(So Min denied it.)

837
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,610
Why did you tell her that
to make her deny it?

838
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,610
- Nice.
- It's not like that.

839
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,020
- You chose to protect your image.
- Nice.

840
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,410
That's not why I denied it.

841
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,030
I have never gotten the phone number
of any guest.

842
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,420
- I'm so disappointed.
- Okay. So Min denied it.

843
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,030
- We won't ask you any questions.
- I'm so disappointed.

844
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,620
- We'll pretend we don't know.
- So Min.

845
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,620
Let's move on.

846
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,770
"If Jong Kook were younger than me,
I would've taught him a lesson."

847
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,770
- Hey.
- So Min.

848
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,930
- You should admit this.
- That's true.

849
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:45,960
You should admit it.

850
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,570
(She admitted it so quickly.)

851
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,400
Hey, you admitted it too quickly.

852
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,250
- Hey.
- Of course, she admitted it.

853
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,020
Look at you wearing pants
that look like tiles on a bathroom floor.

854
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,110
She admitted it. Why?

855
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,020
- Of course, she admitted it.
- Just like bathroom floor tiles.

856
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,050
Of course, she admitted it.

857
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,750
Tell us why you admitted it.

858
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,320
If he were younger than me...

859
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,730
I only refrain myself out of respect
since he's older than me.

860
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,030
But if not, I would've taught him
a lesson with harsh words.

861
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,600
- With harsh words?
- He's so much stronger than me.

862
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
(Is that so?)

863
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,830
I'm no match for him.

864
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,730
He'd be intimidating
even if he were younger than me.

865
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,920
Right. He would still be
intimidating.

866
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,740
- That's true. You see...
- If that could work,

867
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,390
Suk Jin would've already
taught him a lesson.

868
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,010
- He's younger than me, but...
- He would've done it a while ago.

869
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,240
He's younger than me,
but it's not easy.

870
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,980
- But Suk Jin... Still...
- He's very fond of me.

871
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,600
- But still, Jong Kook...
- We get along well together.

872
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Yes, we do.

873
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,370
That's because Jong Kook...

874
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,210
would never treat older people...

875
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,850
- with disrespect.
- I would never do that.

876
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,750
They get along well
because Suk Jin is...

877
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,910
- always nice to Jong Kook too.
- Exactly.

878
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,950
He bends over backwards
for Jong Kook.

879
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,110
We get along well together.

880
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,230
- He's very polite to me.
- Of course.

881
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,680
- We take care of each other.
- He bends over backwards for him.

882
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,150
While Jong Kook was in quarantine
at home,

883
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,000
- Suk Jin was...
- Suk Jin is so nice to him.

884
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,300
- so worried about his health.
- That's true.

885
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,730
- He was worried about Jong Kook...
- Of course.

886
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,420
- while coughing badly.
- He asked if Jong Kook was okay.

887
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,130
He asked, "How are you feeling?"

888
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,130
- He was coughing...
- I'm the best, right?

889
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,860
- You're the best.
- Of course.

890
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,170
- And he's cute too.
- That's right.

891
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,980
- He acts cute in front of him.
- Indeed.

892
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,100
- He's cute.
- He's a cutie.

893
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,280
Here goes the last one.

894
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,320
"To be honest,"

895
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,610
"I'm dumber than Se Chan."

896
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,710
- If you admit this...
- Why are you doing this to me?

897
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,410
- It's not a hard one.
- Explain why you think you are.

898
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,230
- It's not a hard one.
- For example, you think...

899
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,620
- you lack general knowledge...
- You can just admit it.

900
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,690
- Honestly, Se Chan...
- Just admit it.

901
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,230
uses more sophisticated words
than you do.

902
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,600
What are you talking about?

903
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,860
- He does seem smarter than you.
- You should admit it.

904
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,770
- I mean, I think Se Chan is...
- He knows a lot of English words.

905
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,810
- a little bit smarter than she is.
- Se Chan is smarter than her.

906
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,310
- In fact...
- But...

907
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,250
- I admit it.
- Good.

908
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,980
- Explain why you think that way.
- I have something to say.

909
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,610
- Why do you think you're dumber?
- I mean...

910
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,250
I believe there's a wide range of
factors to determine...

911
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,880
- Then you should've denied it.
- No.

912
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,590
- I admit that he's smarter than me.
- Are you more empty-headed than me?

913
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,990
What? You little...

914
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,990
(Are you more empty-headed than me?)

915
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,350
(The empty head's attack)

916
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,990
- It's a better way of putting it.
- That's funny.

917
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,000
"Empty-headed?"

918
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,760
- Is your head completely empty?
- "Empty-headed?"

919
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,120
(Is your head completely empty?)

920
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,930
- You have no brain in there?
- That's hilarious.

921
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,860
It's completely empty.
There's no brain in there.

922
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,310
- That's right.
- A part of your skull fell apart?

923
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,600
So you have to walk around
looking like this?

924
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,840
- Tell me.
- How does she walk around again?

925
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,200
Like this. With no brain
in her head.

926
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,250
- You admitted it.
- Do you want to deny it?

927
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,320
You're more empty-headed than me.

928
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,880
- You're completely empty-headed.
- She's bad at multiplication.

929
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,910
- She's bad at it.
- There must be a little difference.

930
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,910
- A little difference.
- It's not embarrassing.

931
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,410
- Just admit it.
- No. Way dumber than him.

932
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,530
- He said, "way dumber."
- Admit you're way dumber than him.

933
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,990
- You can do this.
- He didn't say, "way dumber."

934
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,760
- It's okay.
- Admit you have no brain.

935
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,530
- Se Chan knows...
- Just admit it.

936
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:27,190
He knows more about
social and cultural trends...

937
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,570
- Just say if you admit it or not.
- Be honest.

938
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,510
Yes, I'm completely empty-headed.

939
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,240
(Yes, I'm completely empty-headed.)

940
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,930
There's no brain in here.

941
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:38,980
(She admits she's an empty head.)

942
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,900
- Happy now?
- Stop it. What's your problem?

943
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,210
- You just can't stay calm.
- Right. Hey.

944
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,520
- And...
- I admit it.

945
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,520
- You still admit it?
- You know more about sports...

946
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,590
- than he does.
- She already admitted it.

947
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,850
- Okay.
- I admit it.

948
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,020
- She's so dumb.
- That's okay.

949
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,380
- I'm smarter than her.
- But she's a better referee.

950
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,530
- She's much better than you.
- Okay. She's dumber than me.

951
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,060
- I'm done, right?
- Yes, you're done.

952
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,800
- Good.
- We still have a chance to lose.

953
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
- It's easy. Just admit everything.
- There will be five questions.

954
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,300
- For the team's sake.
- Okay.

955
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,360
Here's your question.

956
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,460
"I have talked about Jae Suk
behind his back in real life,"

957
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,100
"not for a TV show."

958
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,400
- It's true.
- I admit it.

959
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,600
- Okay.
- It's easy.

960
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,870
(I've talked about Jae Suk
behind his back in real life.)

961
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,750
(He admitted it right away.)

962
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,480
- I heard about it from others.
- It's true.

963
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,050
- It wasn't for a TV show.
- You heard about it?

964
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,320
I actually said that I was
uncomfortable around Jae Suk...

965
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,680
Where? To whom?

966
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,020
I was chatting with Lee Kwang Soo
at the gym.

967
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,350
- Okay. That's good enough.
- "He calls me too often."

968
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,920
- I said that to him.
- That's understandable.

969
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,030
- It's a true story.
- That's understandable.

970
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,800
The trainer at the gym told me
that story.

971
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,260
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

972
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,000
- There's nothing wrong with it.
- Yes.

973
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,690
Although I like him so much,
I don't like some things about him.

974
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:36,930
- That's natural.
- Yes.

975
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,100
- There's nothing wrong with it.
- That's cool.

976
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,240
- Good.
- Let's move on.

977
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,130
"Neither So Min nor Ji Hyo is
good enough for me."

978
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,740
I admit it.

979
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,510
(He admits it?)

980
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,210
(Hitting)

981
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,370
- I'm being honest.
- He admitted it.

982
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,520
(Sae Ho's answer will anger
all Koreans.)

983
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,490
It was an honest answer.
I have my own standards.

984
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,750
- Right. Okay.
- Hey.

985
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,610
- He does have high standards.
- This makes me upset.

986
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,260
- They're not good enough for him?
- He has high standards.

987
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,330
- They may not be his type.
- Who do you think you are?

988
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:04,030
- They're not good enough for you?
- How dare you say that about them?

989
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,000
Don't you dare say mean things
about them.

990
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,890
I have no choice but to talk about
you behind your back.

991
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,000
- You're leaving me no choice.
- He's right.

992
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,100
- But how could you say that...
- Try to think in my shoes.

993
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,810
- about the members I care about?
- Listen.

994
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,510
- Don't even think of dating him.
- I know...

995
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,740
- Don't even think of dating him.
- that you care about them.

996
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,810
- But...
- That's right.

997
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,670
Who's to say
that I'll go after them?

998
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,370
That's different from them
not being good enough for you.

999
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,990
- To be honest...
- They're not good enough?

1000
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:28,490
If So Min told me
that she was dating you,

1001
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,020
I would throw a fit.

1002
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,450
- We'd be against it.
- I won't let it slide.

1003
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,560
Why is that?

1004
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,760
It just can't be you.

1005
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,260
You're just pushing it
for no reason.

1006
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,450
That's a lot of vigor.

1007
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,850
- Just admit it.
- I admit it.

1008
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:39,960
I'm sorry to say this,

1009
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,300
- but they're not good enough.
- They're not your type.

1010
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,600
Him saying that is motivating her.

1011
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,690
- She seems desperate.
- Of course not.

1012
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,510
I could treat So Min to a meal
if that's what she wants.

1013
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,010
- Well, of course.
- Beef?

1014
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,780
- It can be anything.
- Even Japanese omakase?

1015
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,010
Japanese omakase?

1016
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,280
Wait. I guess that's too expensive.

1017
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,350
- Not that?
- Korean beef or omakase...

1018
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,050
- will cost you 500 dollars each.
- For how many people?

1019
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,670
- Four. Including her friends.
- Four?

1020
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,290
Four people, 500 dollars each?

1021
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,380
Make it six people
since that's the limit these days.

1022
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,590
- Six?
- Yes, six.

1023
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,260
You can easily spend
3,000 dollars, right?

1024
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,380
- That's 3,000 dollars.
- I'll think about it.

1025
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,450
Really?

1026
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,150
- And Japanese omakase.
- As long as there are no drinks.

1027
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,150
- Sounds good.
- No drinks.

1028
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,920
- Okay.
- I love how he admits everything.

1029
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,960
- Question number three.
- He admits everything.

1030
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,160
I hesitated before
when coming onto Running Man...

1031
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,430
because Jong Kook is an eyesore.

1032
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,510
(I hesitated before
when coming onto Running Man...)

1033
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,580
(because Jong Kook is an eyesore.)

1034
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,700
I admit to that.

1035
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,750
(He admits to it
at the speed of light.)

1036
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,350
- I...
- Why is he an eyesore?

1037
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,580
- Well...
- Why?

1038
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,640
He calls me out for losing my touch.

1039
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,290
"Sae Ho, why aren't you
funny anymore?"

1040
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,610
Not even encouragement
can help me sometimes.

1041
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,490
- So you hate his demeanor.
- He tears me down from the start.

1042
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,600
That's his way of being nice to you.

1043
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,690
- Exactly.
- That's him showing love.

1044
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,360
One's encouragement
should sit right with me.

1045
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,740
No matter how good...

1046
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,130
Just look at Suk Jin.
He doesn't do anything to fight it.

1047
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,810
I'm just saying that...

1048
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:57,510
Jong Kook must be hurt
to hear you say that about him.

1049
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,370
He finds you suffocating.

1050
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,480
- But...
- You know,

1051
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,050
you should seem more reluctant...

1052
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:05,780
and only hold it up
because you have no other choice.

1053
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:08,910
- But I...
- You're being too serious.

1054
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,260
But I'm present, aren't I?

1055
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,680
I may have hesitated, but I'm here.

1056
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,620
Which floor do you live on?

1057
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,620
Me? The 17th floor.

1058
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,800
Check out the window
from time to time.

1059
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,460
You'll see someone
looking up at you.

1060
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,600
The 17th floor? Which neighborhood?

1061
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,790
- Mapo.
- Mapo? Got it.

1062
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,040
(Information received)

1063
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,230
Jong Kook will find you.

1064
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,560
- You admitted to it.
- He'll be there.

1065
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,730
Sae Ho admitted to it.

1066
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,400
- You should seem more reluctant.
- Go ahead.

1067
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,540
I may have
more experience in the business,

1068
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,770
but Se Chan is better...

1069
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,850
at hosting variety shows
and improvising.

1070
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,580
(Se Chan is better at...)

1071
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,350
(hosting variety shows
and improvising.)

1072
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,560
Just admit to it.

1073
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,210
- Well...
- These days...

1074
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,520
Yes, of course.

1075
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,560
- These days...
- Absolutely.

1076
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,520
(You're not immediately agreeing?)

1077
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,920
- What...
- But why?

1078
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,670
Sae Ho meant
every word he said so far!

1079
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,600
- He meant every word.
- He was being serious.

1080
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,670
You've been telling
the truth so far.

1081
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,210
- You need to think about this?
- Shouldn't I?

1082
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,960
This is what you need
to think about?

1083
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,110
Were you serious about
me making you uncomfortable?

1084
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,080
- This I need to think about.
- It's what he believes.

1085
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,480
- I'm younger, so...
- Hear me out, guys.

1086
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,710
If you can't admit to it,

1087
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,750
it means that
you're serious about Jong Kook.

1088
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,420
- Let me think for a second.
- Sure.

1089
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,150
You told us to just admit to it.

1090
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,980
Se Chan's been on a roll these days.

1091
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,150
He's hilarious these days.
He's been killing it.

1092
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,420
You see...

1093
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,690
(Se Chan is better at hosting
variety shows and improvising.)

1094
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,190
- He's pondering.
- I admit to it.

1095
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,330
- Really?
- Because...

1096
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,860
- You agree with this?
- You see,

1097
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,690
I've been learning a lot from him.

1098
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,830
(I've been learning a lot from him.)

1099
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,290
I admire
the spirit and confidence...

1100
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,960
- he displays in comedy shows.
- His spirit?

1101
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,670
I'm sorry to tell you this,

1102
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,110
but he's way better
at comedy sketches.

1103
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,670
Yes, exactly.
Starting from his days...

1104
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,310
playing Big Eyes' father.

1105
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,400
You can't possibly
compare yourself with him.

1106
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,520
We'll comfortably say
what's on our minds now.

1107
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,420
- Se Chan's way better.
- Yes, of course.

1108
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,790
I couldn't be honest with you
because he's your junior.

1109
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,980
So you see...

1110
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,880
This is the side of you
that I hate the most.

1111
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,600
(What an eyesore!)

1112
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,360
The way you talk.

1113
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,730
- This tone?
- Yes.

1114
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,600
- Is this the one?
- I get it.

1115
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,860
That I agree.

1116
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,540
He's been telling
nothing but the truth.

1117
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,770
- He meant everything he said.
- He wasn't lying.

1118
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,630
This wasn't just for fun.

1119
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,500
Here's your last question.

1120
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,480
Suk Jin is my idol and role model.

1121
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,310
(Suk Jin is my idol
and role model.)

1122
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,420
- Must you think about this?
- What?

1123
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,080
- He's thinking about it.
- What's there to think about?

1124
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,150
During quarantine,

1125
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,420
you called and said you admired me.

1126
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,690
Don't you agree with this?

1127
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,960
How can you...

1128
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,130
- You said you admired me.
- Your role model?

1129
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,830
- He's your hero!
- Unbelievable.

1130
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,130
Calling him my hero...

1131
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,190
He's a great man, that's all.

1132
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,600
Do I have to be able
to wear your face on my arm?

1133
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,920
- Of course.
- Absolutely!

1134
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,520
- Suk Jin's face.
- Right here.

1135
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,230
You need to be able to have
a photo of his big nose on your arm.

1136
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,630
Just like people have photos
of Charlie Chaplin, right?

1137
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,810
People do that, you know.

1138
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,540
- I'll go with this for starters.
- Really?

1139
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,480
(He admits to it for starters.)

1140
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,580
- Look at Suk Jin.
- He...

1141
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,920
- You must keep your word.
- You must.

1142
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,920
- Are you insane?
- Back when I was young,

1143
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,110
you were the reason
why I wanted to become a comedian.

1144
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,810
- Really?
- Yes.

1145
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,380
Don't you lie.
Jeon Yoo Seong was your mentor.

1146
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,980
He wasn't active
when you were an aspiring comedian.

1147
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,060
- You looked up to Nam Hee Suk.
- Wasn't he?

1148
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,330
No, he wasn't.

1149
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,230
How can I put this, then? He...

1150
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,360
(Eyes quivering)

1151
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,230
Even at this age,

1152
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,290
- he shows vigor and...
- He's now telling lies.

1153
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,500
Anyone can tell.

1154
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,500
You don't sound like yourself.

1155
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,130
This isn't how you seemed
when you said I was an eyesore.

1156
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,330
It's like you don't want
to agree to this.

1157
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,940
- But honestly...
- It's nice to hear this though.

1158
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,980
I search my name online
every morning.

1159
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,380
- What about Suk Jin's?
- And then Suk Jin's.

1160
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,020
What came up
when you looked up his name?

1161
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,520
That it's another
cheerful day for him.

1162
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,920
- That's a lie.
- He's lying.

1163
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,360
- Are you lying or not?
- I'm not.

1164
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,900
What's the name of his son?

1165
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,600
I couldn't possibly
say his noble name out loud.

1166
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,770
What's his name?

1167
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:41,830
Is it Ji Seok Sam?

1168
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,040
You...

1169
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,830
- That was nicely improvised.
- I'm sorry.

1170
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,310
- Wasn't it great?
- Seok Sam?

1171
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,400
- Seok Sam?
- Ji Seok Sam?

1172
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,650
- Do you know his wife's name?
- What's her name?

1173
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,380
Mrs. Ji, you mean?

1174
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,580
- Mrs. Ji?
- Yes, Mrs. Ji.

1175
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,650
- My gosh.
- My hero.

1176
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,750
- Thank you, Sae Ho.
- Okay, fine.

1177
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,690
- You'll get a tattoo.
- Next week,

1178
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,480
Sae Ho will get himself a tattoo.

1179
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,980
- Of course.
- A henna at least.

1180
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,080
- Yes, a henna at least.
- At least.

1181
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,520
- Right.
- He's your hero after all.

1182
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,520
Get a henna tattoo of my face...

1183
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,670
- and post it on social media.
- That's right.

1184
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,690
(On social media?)

1185
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,170
He's your hero, isn't he?

1186
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,330
With your best Tom Hardy impression.

1187
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,500
Right.

1188
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,830
- If you don't...
- Post it on social media.

1189
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,400
- Exactly.
- With a Tom Hardy impression.

1190
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,670
- On social media.
- Rather than a henna,

1191
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,540
I'll go with a realistic drawing.

1192
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,650
- There are artists who can do that.
- Right.

1193
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,290
- I'll get myself a drawing.
- And?

1194
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,480
- With a Tom Hardy impression.
- Post it on social media.

1195
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,790
- With a Tom Hardy impression.
- Show us.

1196
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,250
My hero.

1197
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,980
- That's what I'll do.
- And post it on social media?

1198
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,520
- Yes.
- Then you'll pass.

1199
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,520
I'm not kidding.

1200
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,690
This is my first...

1201
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,690
(He ended up keeping his word.)

1202
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,690
This is my first tattoo.

1203
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,170
(He ended up keeping his word.)

1204
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,920
My role model.

1205
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,100
I'm excited to get a tattoo
of my role model.

1206
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,630
This is why you should
watch your words.

1207
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,400
Aren't I the first in Korea
to get a drawing of Suk Jin...

1208
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,670
on a body part?

1209
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,610
I'll be the first and last.

1210
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:06,150
(My role model Ji Suk Jin)

1211
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,850
He admitted to all the questions.

1212
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,560
You receive five points.

1213
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,610
- No way.
- Good job.

1214
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,290
We'll only be asked once,
so admit to them all.

1215
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,560
- You have to.
- Let's make a pact.

1216
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,100
- Let's promise each other.
- Of course.

1217
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,730
- You have to.
- Let's admit to them all.

1218
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,420
- We need to do so too.
- All of us.

1219
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,600
- We must.
- There's no reason not to.

1220
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,130
We'll start with Jong Kook.

1221
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,190
- Sure.
- Why me?

1222
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,310
You'll only be asked
one question each.

1223
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,360
Admit to whatever he says.

1224
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,940
- Just admit to it.
- That's all you have to do.

1225
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,270
- It's not that hard.
- Just admit to it.

1226
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,440
Bring it on.

1227
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,400
I'm the worst at soccer.

1228
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,880
(I'm the worst at soccer.)

1229
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,170
- Say it.
- Admit to it.

1230
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,150
I'm the worst at soccer.

1231
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,480
This...

1232
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,710
- Admit to it.
- Just say it.

1233
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,960
- You must admit to it.
- I admit to it.

1234
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,020
- Jong Kook.
- You see,

1235
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,460
although he loves the sport...

1236
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,880
If anyone's going to admit to this,

1237
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,980
it'll be me!

1238
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,190
- Wait.
- Who are you to answer for me?

1239
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,400
But...

1240
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,500
Why are you angry at me?

1241
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,400
It's my question to answer.

1242
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,440
- Why are you worked up?
- Who are you to answer for me?

1243
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,830
- Why are you worked up?
- Keep at it!

1244
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,770
- Why are you angry?
- How dare you.

1245
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,170
Even if this is wrong,

1246
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,380
- for the team...
- This is a sensitive topic.

1247
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,940
You could admit to it for the team.

1248
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,080
For someone who loves
soccer so much...

1249
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,750
Shut it!

1250
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:12,480
Shut it
and let me answer his question.

1251
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,880
He's not as good as he says he is.

1252
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,980
The worst at soccer?

1253
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,980
- The worst at soccer.
- He does miss his kick at times.

1254
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,980
He's not that good
of a soccer player...

1255
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,250
for someone who's in a club
and plays every week.

1256
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,230
(Roaring)

1257
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,790
He frequently makes mistakes.

1258
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,460
Don't you love
how cheeky Jae Suk is?

1259
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,790
- He...
- He'd rather...

1260
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,630
hear people say he's a bad singer.

1261
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,110
- That's all right.
- Say he's a bad singer instead.

1262
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,610
But Jong Kook's a great singer.

1263
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,310
It's not like you even
played a game with me before.

1264
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,330
Join us for next week's game.

1265
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,670
Join us next week.

1266
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,080
I don't have soccer cleats.

1267
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,580
I'll lend you mine,
so just be there.

1268
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:45,040
- They won't fit.
- They will. You wear 275mm.

1269
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,080
No, I wear 270mm.

1270
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:49,190
(The newbie-to-be
talks back to the team owner.)

1271
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,650
- He's dead serious.
- Just admit to it.

1272
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,980
- Anyway...
- Right.

1273
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,420
- I see this isn't easy.
- Of course not.

1274
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,790
- It's not easy at all.
- It isn't.

1275
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,420
- It hurts his pride.
- It's a matter of pride.

1276
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,420
- He is the owner of the team.
- Of course.

1277
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,960
- It's for the team.
- Right.

1278
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,400
I'll admit to this.

1279
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,690
Okay, nice!

1280
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,600
- Why though?
- You're the worst at soccer.

1281
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,630
Can I tell others
that you're the worst at soccer?

1282
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,770
- Of course.
- Of course.

1283
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:07,770
He said so himself.

1284
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,900
Do you start trembling
when the ball comes near you?

1285
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,080
When the ball rolls close,
do you say...

1286
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,940
"Don't pass it to me.
I'm the worst at soccer!"

1287
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,270
"Don't pass it to me!"

1288
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,850
He must say that
for this to be true.

1289
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,080
Don't you run a soccer team?

1290
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,920
- Do you feel the pressure?
- Se Chan's being mean today.

1291
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,380
You haven't been to practice lately.

1292
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,150
- If you admit to it...
- Do you...

1293
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,810
- admit to it?
- Yes, I do.

1294
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,110
I'm fine with it.

1295
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,980
Can it not be remedied
with hard work?

1296
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,150
- Aren't you on my team?
- Sure, of course.

1297
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,100
We're on the same team, darn it.

1298
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,060
- We're on the same team.
- I'm sorry.

1299
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,830
You should be more careful.

1300
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,500
Jong Kook, I'm sorry to ask,
but do you know...

1301
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,040
how many players
are on a soccer team?

1302
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,060
(Do you know how many players
are on a soccer team?)

1303
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,730
Why you...

1304
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,170
Are you teasing him?

1305
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,540
- Of course I know.
- I was just checking.

1306
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,880
Explain why you're
the worst at soccer.

1307
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,480
- Why are you the worst at it?
- Well...

1308
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,940
What makes you a bad player?

1309
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,980
What do you lack as a player?

1310
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,770
- Everything, but...
- Well...

1311
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,440
He could be better at dribbling.

1312
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,540
You!

1313
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,650
It's true.

1314
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,960
It's me who's admitting to this,

1315
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,330
- so who are you to butt in?
- Have you seen him play?

1316
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,460
Yes, of course.

1317
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,020
- It's not like that.
- He's Jong Kook's spokesperson.

1318
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,100
Well...

1319
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,560
- It's...
- He hates this situation.

1320
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,860
Don't admit to it, then.
Change your mind.

1321
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,000
- We wouldn't ask.
- Don't admit to it.

1322
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I...

1323
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,060
Yes, I feel like dying
every time someone passes the ball.

1324
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,380
- When the ball comes near me...
- Can't you dribble it?

1325
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,670
- I can't.
- Of course not.

1326
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,670
But it's not like you shoot well.

1327
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,940
Right, his shots aren't good.

1328
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,810
We're on the same team.

1329
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,420
Jong Kook is the worst at soccer.

1330
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,880
- It's so...
- He admitted it.

1331
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,790
All right.
Jong Kook is the worst at soccer.

1332
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,150
Jae Suk, it's your turn.

1333
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,230
- It's my turn?
- Yes.

1334
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,420
- I'll admit it no matter what.
- Jae Suk.

1335
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,420
- Jae Suk, everyone admits it.
- Let's do it.

1336
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,600
What's there not to admit?

1337
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,520
It'd be strange not to.

1338
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,600
Right. You should just admit it.

1339
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
He's the most generous man.

1340
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,400
- I'll hold it before hearing it.
- All right.

1341
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,540
"I..."

1342
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,310
"have a lot of money."

1343
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,310
That's true.

1344
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,460
- That's true.
- That's true.

1345
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,110
- This is...
- Of course I admit it.

1346
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,310
You have a lot of money.

1347
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,770
You must tell us how much you have.

1348
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,080
- He must reveal all his assets?
- Yes, he must.

1349
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,170
I must reveal my assets?

1350
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,810
- All the real estate.
- Tell us.

1351
00:42:58,810 --> 00:42:59,980
- Tell us.
- The list of your real estate.

1352
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,110
- You must tell us.
- Starting with your real estate.

1353
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,710
- Tell us the exact amount.
- Tell us everything.

1354
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,080
- I'm certain...
- It could be over 100 million.

1355
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,380
That's a given.

1356
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,920
- I must reveal my assets?
- You should.

1357
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,020
Reveal your assets.

1358
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,860
I'm certain he has as much as
the prize money from "Squid Game."

1359
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,360
You mean 45.6 million dollars?

1360
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,690
- What are you doing?
- It's just that...

1361
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,790
What do you think you're doing?

1362
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,400
Don't you have that much?

1363
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,960
- He has about 45.6 million dollars.
- I mean...

1364
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,810
- Is it higher or lower than that?
- I need to reveal that too?

1365
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:24,540
- You can use comparison.
- We must know a certain amount.

1366
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,130
- So we can accept it.
- Or you can deny it.

1367
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:28,750
- Then deny it.
- Then I'd be lying.

1368
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,850
- You have a lot of money.
- So tell us how much you have.

1369
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:32,210
He must tell us.

1370
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,690
There are many people
who lie about their assets.

1371
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,880
Then can you buy an imported car
right away if you want to?

1372
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,610
- Of course!
- That goes without saying!

1373
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,690
Why would you ask that?

1374
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,420
You're talking about my assets.

1375
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,520
I know that.
So tell us how much you have!

1376
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,730
- Just tell us roughly.
- Set the boundary and tell us.

1377
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,670
- Or you can deny it.
- Deny it?

1378
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,040
- I can't deny it.
- Jae Suk.

1379
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,400
Let's say you went shopping,

1380
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,210
and you loved all the items.

1381
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,060
"Give me everything
from here to there."

1382
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,310
- I can't do that.
- But...

1383
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,730
- Why not?
- Yes, you're capable of doing that.

1384
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:59,270
"Give me everything
from here to there?"

1385
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,480
- "Give me everything."
- That's right. The luxury goods.

1386
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,080
It's because
he doesn't lavish his money.

1387
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,380
- I don't think it's necessary...
- He's capable of that.

1388
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,650
- He does have that much money.
- He's capable.

1389
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:09,980
You can buy a rack of Chanel goods.

1390
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,810
- Of course. He can do that.
- "Give me all these bags."

1391
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,630
- Jong Kook, it's my assets.
- Yes?

1392
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,150
You can do it, can't you?

1393
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,460
- Then say that you deny it.
- Why are you so upset?

1394
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,650
Then say that you deny it.

1395
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,790
I roughly calculated,
and you have enough money for that.

1396
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,270
Let's say you're at a supercar shop.

1397
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,360
"Give me everything
from here to there."

1398
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,440
- Can you say that or not?
- He can!

1399
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,210
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

1400
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,230
- You have that much money.
- I don't.

1401
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:30,400
- Why can't you do it?
- Then deny it.

1402
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,630
Then say it like this.

1403
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,810
Just tell us how much you got
for your down payment and end it.

1404
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,080
Just tell us how much you got
for your down payment and end it.

1405
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,440
Don't even ask him
how much he has in all.

1406
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,020
- Hey.
- How much did you receive?

1407
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,610
- He can do it.
- If you don't want to say it...

1408
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,190
Then just say you deny it!

1409
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,790
- Say you deny it!
- You should admit it.

1410
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:46,290
- But seriously,
- Say you deny it!

1411
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:47,420
he's really amazing.

1412
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,130
A few days ago,
we went to an electronics store.

1413
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,400
He got a tablet PC
with the best specifications.

1414
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,420
He paid for it in a lump sum.

1415
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,940
- I can buy that much, you punk.
- Sae Ho, that's...

1416
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,000
- Even I can buy that much.
- Hey!

1417
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,540
- Even I can buy that much.
- Anyone can buy that much.

1418
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,540
- You can?
- Sae Ho.

1419
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,860
- Even we can buy that.
- Are you kidding me?

1420
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,580
What about getting a new one
when you already have one?

1421
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,580
Of course I can buy it.

1422
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,610
- I can buy that much too.
- Really?

1423
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,150
- Even I can do that.
- You can?

1424
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:08,310
If you're not going to...

1425
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,750
- tell us the rough amount,
- I mean...

1426
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,110
- don't admit it.
- What are you telling me to admit?

1427
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,380
Admit that you can buy
30 supercars...

1428
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,110
at once.

1429
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:18,210
I told you. I am rich!

1430
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,560
Can you buy that much?

1431
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,730
I am rich!

1432
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:21,830
So can you buy...

1433
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,190
If I say I'm not rich...

1434
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,360
- Can you buy 30 supercars?
- He's rich.

1435
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,900
They'll criticize me!

1436
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,290
So can you buy 30 supercars or not?

1437
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,860
I don't need 30 supercars!

1438
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,270
How much did you get
for your down payment?

1439
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,290
Can you buy them or not?

1440
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,900
- Can you buy them or not?
- Can you buy them or not?

1441
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,560
- "Give me all the supercars here."
- Tell us if you can or not.

1442
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,730
My goodness.

1443
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,480
Why can't you say it? I even said...

1444
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,540
(I said I shake like this
when a ball comes to me.)

1445
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,540
I shake like this
when a ball comes to me.

1446
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,250
(He strongly admitted
that he's terrible at soccer.)

1447
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:46,610
Jae Suk, So Min admitted
she's empty-headed.

1448
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,040
- I even said I shake like this!
- I'm empty-headed!

1449
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,380
- This is driving me crazy.
- You can't share that?

1450
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,360
- You can buy that much.
- Deny it if you can't.

1451
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,560
- Right. Deny it.
- No, you must admit it.

1452
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,330
- Deny it.
- You can spend that much.

1453
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,560
- You can buy that much.
- There are many rich people.

1454
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,460
Imagine giving the supercar
to each one of us.

1455
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,360
- Deny it.
- One for each one of us.

1456
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,360
That's...

1457
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,540
I can't give them to all of you.

1458
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,770
- Why not?
- Why must I buy supercars...

1459
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:06,900
for some of you?

1460
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,000
Don't lie!

1461
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,610
- That's how much money...
- I can't give them to all of you.

1462
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:11,210
you have.

1463
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,730
- You have that much.
- We're talking about your assets.

1464
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:13,810
So do you have...

1465
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,000
- enough money or not?
- Listen.

1466
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,710
You're capable of buying that much.

1467
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,270
Are you capable or not?

1468
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:19,710
- Then tell us this much.
- What?

1469
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,380
What's the first digit
of your bank account?

1470
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,980
- That's not important!
- That's not important!

1471
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,750
The number of digits
is more important.

1472
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,650
- I mean, we can ask...
- You should take a break.

1473
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,520
- Remove his mic.
- Go rest there.

1474
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,520
Come here.

1475
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,630
- He's talking nonsense.
- So what I'm saying is...

1476
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:34,900
It's because he likes you.

1477
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,270
- He's giving you time to think.
- I admit that I'm rich.

1478
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:38,330
I know that you admit it,

1479
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:40,040
- but you should share us...
- I admit I'm rich.

1480
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,170
how much you have to admit it.

1481
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,810
- So...
- So...

1482
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,080
- Tell us...
- Did you just push me?

1483
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,630
- You pushed me?
- How much do you have?

1484
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:48,310
- Hey.
- I'm also curious.

1485
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:51,580
(Candidate Yoo's hearing
ended up leaking his privacy.)

1486
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,150
(They're all saying
groundless rumors.)

1487
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,810
- So how rich are you?
- How much do you have?

1488
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:58,020
I'm also curious.

1489
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,860
- So...
- How should he tell us?

1490
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,520
- He should...
- I deny it.

1491
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,400
- We did it.
- He denied it. We did it.

1492
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,400
- He's poor.
- We did it.

1493
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,520
Seriously...

1494
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,790
- He's penniless.
- How could you...

1495
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:08,920
- What?
- You're penniless.

1496
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,920
- Hey.
- What did you call me?

1497
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,000
Jae Suk is penniless.

1498
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,600
My car is better than yours!

1499
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,130
- He has no money. He's penniless.
- Sit down.

1500
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:16,400
- He denied it. All right.
- My gosh.

1501
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:20,250
How much do we need to have
to be called rich?

1502
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,880
Do we have to go this far?

1503
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,940
You should've admitted it.

1504
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,750
- Isn't this too much?
- Jae Suk,

1505
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,270
call me if you're struggling.

1506
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,420
I can lend you some money.

1507
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,080
I can treat you to a meal.

1508
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,690
My goodness.

1509
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:33,750
Jae Suk denied it.
What does that make us?

1510
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,290
That means we're poor.

1511
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,830
- It's Suk Jin's turn.
- All right.

1512
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,500
- "I..."
- I can just admit it.

1513
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,500
- Just take it easy.
- I'll admit it.

1514
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,520
- You must admit it.
- That way, we can win.

1515
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,130
- "I..."
- They added a twist.

1516
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,130
Right.

1517
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,670
"I want to quit YouTube,"

1518
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,730
- "but I missed the timing."
- That's it.

1519
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,500
- You must admit this.
- I can tell.

1520
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,080
- You must admit this.
- You should admit it.

1521
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,770
- He's...
- You haven't been uploading.

1522
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,440
It seems like
he's not been uploading.

1523
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,980
It's because he's not getting
that many views.

1524
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,210
Isn't this too easy? Thank you.

1525
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,690
- You must admit it.
- Thank you.

1526
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,420
- You're not getting many views.
- Hey.

1527
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,690
- He's not getting that many.
- You're not.

1528
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,830
I have more than
500,000 subscribers. How can I...

1529
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:11,100
Suk Jin, even if you admit it,

1530
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,460
- nothing will happen.
- That's right.

1531
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,630
- No.
- That's true.

1532
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,770
- If you talk about it here...
- Something will happen.

1533
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:17,860
more strategically,

1534
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:18,960
- That's true.
- you'd have more subscribers.

1535
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,460
- You'd have more by now.
- That's true.

1536
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,130
- Then you should admit it.
- But in a way,

1537
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,810
- Let me remind you.
- that's not what he's saying.

1538
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,710
- Once you admit it, you must tell.
- Tell what?

1539
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:28,080
When you started
thinking of quitting it.

1540
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,770
- It's just how you felt.
- You knew about this.

1541
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,920
- You must tell us why.
- This is driving me crazy.

1542
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,150
Then you should deny it.

1543
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:36,860
If you admit it, you must tell us
when you thought of it...

1544
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:40,420
- and upload an apology video.
- You just don't like it.

1545
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,060
- How can I upload that?
- You should.

1546
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,230
- You should wear a suit and do it.
- I can't.

1547
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,400
- You must upload it.
- You must upload it.

1548
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,060
- Because you admitted it.
- How can I...

1549
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,190
upload an apology video?

1550
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,500
- He should wear a suit.
- You should wear a suit too.

1551
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,540
- You should do that.
- You should wear a suit too.

1552
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,790
- On a black background,
- To be honest...

1553
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:53,230
you should say,
"I'm sorry for everything."

1554
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:55,110
- That's right.
- I'll watch that for sure.

1555
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:56,110
- The top of your head should show.
- That's right.

1556
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:57,730
You can just say it.

1557
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,270
- Actually...
- That's right.

1558
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,580
See for me how it looks.

1559
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,540
Hello. I'm here to apologize...

1560
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,710
You should either admit it
or deny it.

1561
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,420
- Let me try it first.
- No, you can't.

1562
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,920
Actually, it's been over two years
since I started my channel.

1563
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,960
But I've been wanting to quit.

1564
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,790
- That's it.
- "I knew it! What a jerk!"

1565
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,520
"I knew he'd quit!"

1566
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,150
- "Ji Suk Jin, that..."
- What did you say?

1567
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:20,170
This could happen.

1568
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:21,830
- It's because he's not educated.
- This could happen.

1569
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:23,170
I deny it! I can't admit it.

1570
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:25,040
All right. He denied it.

1571
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,330
It's Ji Hyo's turn.

1572
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,830
"Just like I said in the past,"

1573
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:32,710
"I can seduce every man here
with a flick of my finger."

1574
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:33,880
You should admit it.

1575
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,080
You should admit it.

1576
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,270
- I admit it.
- All right!

1577
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,350
- Try it.
- Show it to us.

1578
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,580
It makes no sense.

1579
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,040
Why would you be mad, Suk Jin?

1580
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,020
- It's not that I'm mad.
- Don't be mad.

1581
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,210
That's it!

1582
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,210
(With a flick of her finger,)

1583
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,480
(he smiles from ear to ear.)

1584
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,790
- He smiled.
- Don't be mad.

1585
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:51,130
- He smiled.
- He smiled.

1586
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,420
Don't be mad.

1587
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,420
- "Don't be mad."
- But...

1588
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,460
Ji Hyo.

1589
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,600
It's Haha's turn.

1590
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,540
It's your turn.
You must admit it no matter what.

1591
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,100
- What could it be?
- Admit it no matter what.

1592
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,330
"If you want, I can measure
my height here."

1593
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:03,330
Come again?

1594
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:04,940
"If you want, I can measure
my height here."

1595
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,480
- Of course he can.
- Didn't he say he was 173cm?

1596
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,170
- Just do it.
- Haha.

1597
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,310
- Haha.
- Let's measure it.

1598
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:10,940
He's over 170cm.

1599
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,480
- Didn't you say you were 173cm?
- Hey.

1600
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,380
- You're over 170cm.
- He even shaved his hair.

1601
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,650
(Height: 168cm)

1602
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:19,380
(Who wrote that? I'm 171.5cm tall!)

1603
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,330
(When I'm in good condition,
I'm 172.5cm tall!)

1604
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,730
(There's a 4cm difference
depending on his condition?)

1605
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,860
(Curious Stories R,
A man affected by gravity)

1606
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,330
He's over 170cm.

1607
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:28,630
- Didn't you say you were 173cm?
- Hey.

1608
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,400
- You're over 170cm.
- He even shaved his hair.

1609
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,440
- I'm 171.5cm.
- He can't be that tall now.

1610
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,670
- Because you cut your hair...
- You don't have hair right now.

1611
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:35,960
- You can do it.
- He's shorter than 170cm.

1612
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,610
When I measured my height
on "Infinite Challenge,"

1613
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,710
- That's five years ago.
- I was 172cm,

1614
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:42,400
- so they pushed me down.
- But you don't have hair now.

1615
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,400
If you measure it now,

1616
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,540
- you must take off your socks.
- Just show it to them.

1617
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,290
"Infinite Challenge"...

1618
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:48,690
- The thing is...
- is over ten years ago.

1619
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:51,380
I'm in bad condition.
The Omicron variant...

1620
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,060
- Hey!
- It damages your sense of smell,

1621
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,650
- but it also shortens your spine.
- Haha.

1622
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:55,750
- I mean it.
- Just deny it.

1623
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,790
- It's better to deny it.
- Let's measure your height.

1624
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:59,190
- He should deny it.
- You can do it, Haha.

1625
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:00,960
- It's nothing.
- I'm not that short.

1626
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,330
- Just measure it with no excuses.
- I'm over 170cm.

1627
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:05,790
You see, I contracted
the Omicron variant.

1628
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:08,210
- So I'm in bad condition.
- So what if you're not over 170cm?

1629
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:09,860
- So what if you're not over 170cm?
- Because I was in bed...

1630
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,270
- Then deny it.
- Deny it.

1631
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:12,670
No, I can't deny it.

1632
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:13,900
Deny it.

1633
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,270
- Seriously.
- I'm over 170cm.

1634
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:16,350
- Then admit it.
- I bet it'd be positive...

1635
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:17,380
if I got tested again.

1636
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,440
- Should I bring it?
- Just deny it.

1637
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,350
- I'm still sick.
- Just deny it.

1638
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,190
Don't bring it.
I'm going to kill you.

1639
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,420
I'm in really bad condition.

1640
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,750
- Just measure it!
- I'll go bring it.

1641
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,230
- I'm in bad condition.
- Deny it.

1642
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:29,150
- Seriously...
- I'd measure it with no trouble.

1643
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:30,920
- What are you trying to do?
- Okay, let's do it.

1644
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,190
- I'm obviously over 170cm. Look.
- Just deny it.

1645
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,770
- Gosh, this is...
- No.

1646
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:36,130
- Just deny it.
- You guys are so mean.

1647
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:38,460
Is my mic okay?

1648
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,900
Suk Jin,
do you want to measure your height?

1649
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,940
- Suk Jin.
- Me?

1650
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,500
- You should measure it.
- Of course I can.

1651
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,630
Try it, Suk Jin.

1652
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,480
- Suk Jin is tall.
- You should take off your shoes.

1653
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,440
- I can do it. It's nothing hard.
- How tall are you?

1654
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,540
- I'm 177cm tall.
- He's 177cm.

1655
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,610
- He's 177cm?
- He is?

1656
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:50,940
I don't think you are.

1657
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,350
Stand straight.

1658
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,310
(Hitting)

1659
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:57,020
(Darn it.)

1660
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,190
Wait.

1661
00:51:58,190 --> 00:51:59,650
- You punk.
- Jae Suk.

1662
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:00,730
You just wanted to do this.

1663
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:03,130
- Jae Suk...
- It was 153cm.

1664
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:04,360
- It was 153cm.
- You just hit his head.

1665
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,330
- You wanted to do this.
- Please smile.

1666
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:07,400
- Please smile.
- What?

1667
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,460
I can't smile.

1668
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,520
He must be less than 170cm.

1669
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,860
- No, I am.
- You can just...

1670
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,130
- You're 165cm, right?
- That's not true.

1671
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,210
- I'm over 170cm.
- Just deny it quickly.

1672
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:15,900
- Deny it.
- Okay. It's because I'm sick.

1673
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,400
- Okay, he denied it.
- You denied it?

1674
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,440
I'm really sick.

1675
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,610
- I'm serious.
- If you were 171cm before,

1676
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:20,770
you can't be taller than that now.

1677
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,540
- I'm really sick today.
- I'm 171cm.

1678
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,880
- Se Chan, you're the last one.
- Me?

1679
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,110
I'll admit it no matter what.

1680
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:29,940
"There's a young woman
who frequents..."

1681
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,610
"the new place
I recently moved into."

1682
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:34,020
Why that...

1683
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,020
- Just admit it!
- What did he say?

1684
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,230
Just admit it!

1685
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,230
(During their new year
fortune reading,)

1686
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:43,000
(Se Chan's type of woman
was revealed.)

1687
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,770
- Stop it.
- There is.

1688
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:46,900
There is!

1689
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,330
- He told me so.
- Hey.

1690
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,710
- You said there is.
- Sae Ho.

1691
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,330
Tell them what you told me.

1692
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:52,710
Tell us about it.

1693
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,710
- Gosh, I'm getting goosebumps.
- Well...

1694
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:55,880
The question itself
got me goosebumps.

1695
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,770
Why would you add
the description, "young?"

1696
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,350
- Young woman?
- Admit it.

1697
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:01,710
A woman can visit your place.

1698
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:03,610
Tell me the limit of age
to call her young.

1699
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:05,210
As long as she's younger than you.

1700
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:06,360
Think about it.

1701
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,730
If she's younger by a year,
that means she's young.

1702
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:08,980
- That's right.
- She's younger than you.

1703
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:11,790
After Se Chan moved
into the new place,

1704
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:13,520
- I video called him.
- Right.

1705
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,770
He wouldn't show me
the master bedroom.

1706
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:16,020
- That's right.
- I asked him to show me his house.

1707
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,600
But he didn't show me
the master bedroom.

1708
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,290
You think there was a woman in there?
That's nonsense.

1709
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:21,170
Who knows?

1710
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:24,710
When we asked him
to show us his house,

1711
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:28,150
he turned around,
and I saw that his place has a terrace.

1712
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:29,270
- I saw...
- That's right.

1713
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,150
someone hanging there.

1714
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:33,350
- My gosh.
- Oh, come on.

1715
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,420
- Hey.
- You're so...

1716
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,690
- Because of him...
- I'm right.

1717
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:37,920
- You saw it, right?
- Nothing works out because of him.

1718
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,190
- The fingers?
- Her arms were shaking.

1719
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:40,630
Those were a woman's fingernails.

1720
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,020
So we said,
"Your terrace is really pretty."

1721
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,130
- Your face is so red now.
- There's nothing to explain.

1722
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:44,460
- Deny it, then.
- This part is very red.

1723
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,290
- I deny it.
- Because he denied it,

1724
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,520
- I deny it.
- it makes me want to know more.

1725
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,690
- He has a girlfriend.
- He does.

1726
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,330
- It's so funny.
- He could admit it if there wasn't.

1727
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,330
That's right. He has a girlfriend.

1728
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:53,440
- He could admit it if there wasn't.
- So you had a girlfriend.

1729
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,360
All right.

1730
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,860
That was really intense.

1731
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,610
Team Sae Ho wins seven points.

1732
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,810
It's not easy to admit it.

1733
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,670
Team So Min wins four points.

1734
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:03,270
- Team Sae Ho wins.
- All right!

1735
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:05,710
So Min should've admitted hers
in the beginning.

1736
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,310
I would have admitted mine too if...

1737
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:09,810
- They're the winning team.
- We are?

1738
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:12,110
Decide 1st to 4th place
through rock-paper-scissors.

1739
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:14,190
- All right. Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

1740
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:15,980
- Yes!
- Rock-paper-scissors

1741
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,750
- Rock-paper-scissors
- He won again.

1742
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:19,190
- All right.
- I...

1743
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:23,190
Starting with Sae Ho,
you get to steal two slots...

1744
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,860
from their maps.

1745
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,540
Two slots from their maps?

1746
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,230
You can take two slots
from any one of them.

1747
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:30,270
You can take one from your teammate.

1748
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,670
- It's an individual match, right?
- It is.

1749
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,900
- I want to take Haha's.
- Go ahead.

1750
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,040
Take them right away.

1751
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,880
If you look over there,
he removed Gangwon Province...

1752
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,080
and Jeju Island. That means
he contemplated between the two.

1753
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,360
I think it'd be fun...

1754
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,420
- to take Suk Jin's.
- You should.

1755
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,650
Take Haha's.

1756
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,330
Take one from the guy
who is shorter than you.

1757
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:50,690
I think it's either
Gangwon Province or Jeju Island.

1758
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,860
Can't I do it on my own?

1759
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,290
- He's a better host than you.
- He's better than you.

1760
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:57,270
- He's a better host.
- Oh, right.

1761
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,100
- You should listen to me.
- My apologies.

1762
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,770
- You should listen to him.
- All right, then. I pick...

1763
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:02,130
- Suk Jin's.
- Which one?

1764
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,610
I'll take Jeongseon
of Gangwon Province.

1765
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,170
- Jeongseon.
- Come on.

1766
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:06,400
Okay.

1767
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,540
Jeongseon? I wouldn't put it there
since it's my hometown.

1768
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,810
- I think you did.
- Let me give you another chance.

1769
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:12,250
I pick Jeongseon, Gangwon Province.

1770
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,290
- Can I take it?
- I'll give you another chance.

1771
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,290
- Another one?
- All right.

1772
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:17,150
Then I'll take Jeongseon
of Gangwon Province.

1773
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,980
Gangwon Province? Okay.
I gave you so many chances though.

1774
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,250
All right. I'll take it now.

1775
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,130
That's my hometown. Think about it.

1776
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,230
- I got 8 ballots.
- There were 8 ballots?

1777
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:25,690
(Sae Ho steals 8 ballots
from Suk Jin at once.)

1778
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,290
That was so obvious.

1779
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,290
I got eight ballots.

1780
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,460
- That's amazing.
- You got eight ballots?

1781
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,060
- Sae Ho takes eight ballots.
- All right.

1782
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,270
- He took eight ballots?
- I thought otherwise.

1783
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:36,310
- Why didn't you twist it?
- I didn't think you'd pick it.

1784
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:38,310
- Suk Jin didn't add a twist.
- Next.

1785
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,170
- You should pick one more.
- Then I'll lightly take...

1786
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,270
- So Min's.
- All right. So Min's.

1787
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,350
(Jeon So Min)

1788
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,920
- You want to steal her heart?
- So Min.

1789
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,020
- You live in Ilsan?
- Sae Ho, don't use this to...

1790
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:49,790
So Min's parents live in Ilsan.

1791
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:51,110
Ilsan. Gyeonggi Province.

1792
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,310
I'll just pick it.
Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.

1793
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:54,580
Please think again.

1794
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,420
- Is there something behind this?
- No.

1795
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,520
I pick Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.

1796
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,290
- The way people think...
- All right.

1797
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,170
I pick Seoul and Gyeonggi Province
above Chungcheong Province.

1798
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,130
(Sae Ho doesn't get swayed and picks
Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.)

1799
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,540
Did she put a lot here?

1800
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:07,710
(10 ballots!)

1801
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,440
(He steals all of So Min's ballots.)

1802
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,230
- What was that?
- What was that?

1803
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:13,040
- What was that?
- I'm sorry.

1804
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,170
It's already
Cho Sae Ho's Running Man.

1805
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:17,710
- Gosh, what is this?
- You took almost all the ballots.

1806
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:20,250
- I...
- He already has 18 ballots.

1807
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,690
This makes it no fun.

1808
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:23,040
That's why I told you
to think again.

1809
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,060
Sae Ho earned her ballots.

1810
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,810
- What do we do?
- It's Cho Sae Ho's Running Man.

1811
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:27,830
He took all my ballots.

1812
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:29,290
I might be disliked by many.

1813
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,360
(Sae Ho quickly becomes
unlikable by sweeping all ballots.)

1814
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,920
How did he choose this?

1815
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,790
- Who was in second place?
- Me.

1816
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,230
- I'll take Jong Kook's.
- Okay.

1817
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,230
Go for it.

1818
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,230
- I'll take Gyeongsang Province.
- His hometown.

1819
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:41,710
- His hometown.
- Jong Kook's hometown.

1820
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:43,270
His hometown is Hapcheon.

1821
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,900
Rip it! I bet he divided
his ballots into different slots.

1822
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,750
- There's none.
- There's none.

1823
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:50,500
I wouldn't put them in my hometown.

1824
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:52,440
But Suk Jin did.

1825
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,610
- What?
- I put them in my hometown too.

1826
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,020
- I know.
- Haha.

1827
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,020
Go for Jeju Island.

1828
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,980
- Jeju Island.
- Jeju Island.

1829
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,560
- I think Haha put it there.
- He must've put it there.

1830
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,560
Because he likes Jeju Island.

1831
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,190
He left it open
for the others to rip it.

1832
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:05,190
- I knew it.
- That's quite a lot.

1833
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,730
(She manages to steal 5 ballots.)

1834
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:08,060
- She took 5 ballots.
- She took 5 ballots.

1835
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,900
- She took 5 ballots?
- Ji Hyo took 5 ballots.

1836
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,960
- Who is in third place?
- Me!

1837
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,130
- Can I pick one too?
- Yes.

1838
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,860
- Okay.
- Hold on.

1839
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,210
This is fun.

1840
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:17,310
(Jae Suk's target is Sae Ho
who earned many ballots.)

1841
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:19,000
- I'll pick Chungcheong Province.
- Chungcheong Province? Okay.

1842
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I have a good feeling about it.

1843
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,270
- There's none.
- There's none.

1844
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,310
I'm sorry.

1845
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,420
(Sneaky Sae Ho avoided
getting his ballots taken.)

1846
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,580
- Why are you...
- Let me take another one of his.

1847
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,750
- I should take Sae Ho's too.
- Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.

1848
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:30,790
- Three.
- Three.

1849
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:32,290
- You divided them like this?
- Yes.

1850
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:33,560
That's still a lot, Jae Suk.

1851
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,230
- It is.
- That's a lot.

1852
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:36,480
I bet Jae Suk...

1853
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,600
- Eighteen ballots are a little...
- put all ten ballots together.

1854
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,230
You should check his face
as you test each slot.

1855
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:44,600
Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.
It's in Gyeonggi Province?

1856
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:46,040
Gangwon Province.

1857
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,290
Chungcheong Province?

1858
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,710
Your tone got a little lower.

1859
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:49,860
Gyeongsang Province.

1860
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,110
Jeolla Province.

1861
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,440
Jeju Island.

1862
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,150
I see. It's in Gyeongsang Province.

1863
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:55,210
- Is it Gyeongsang Province?
- It is.

1864
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:57,440
Then I should pick Chungcheong.
Can I pick it now?

1865
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,540
- Yes.
- Is it Chungcheong Province?

1866
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,440
Should I pick Chungcheong Province?

1867
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,790
- I think it's there.
- It must be Chungcheong Province.

1868
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:03,880
- Se Chan is good.
- I'll pick Chungcheong Province.

1869
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,880
Oh, no.

1870
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,710
- You earned one though.
- Jae Suk divided them.

1871
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:07,830
Then...

1872
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:09,420
That's so unlike Jae Suk.

1873
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,830
- This time...
- He divided them.

1874
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:12,420
It looks like he divided them.

1875
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,020
- It could be Seoul and Gyeonggi.
- Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.

1876
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,670
- Seoul and Gyeonggi Province?
- It could be Jeju Island.

1877
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,500
- It could be Jeju Island.
- I don't think so.

1878
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,270
- You like Jeju Island?
- Of course he does.

1879
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:20,270
I love Jeju Island.

1880
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:22,060
Then I'll pick Jeju Island.

1881
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,080
- They're clenching their fists.
- It is Jeju Island.

1882
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,400
I'll pick Jeju Island.

1883
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,810
In 1, 2, 3.

1884
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,880
- Four ballots!
- I told you.

1885
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,150
- That's a lot.
- That's a lot.

1886
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,190
- He put a lot of them there.
- I placed four ballots there.

1887
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,190
All right.

1888
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:37,150
All of you earned extra ballots.

1889
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:38,610
He got 18 ballots.

1890
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:40,420
Let's move for the next mission.

1891
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,730
- Okay.
- Okay.

1892
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:44,520
Gosh, what is this?
Are we doing a race?

1893
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,900
Here's the second mission.

1894
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,330
It's called King of the Race.

1895
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,670
You'll be divided into teams of two.

1896
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:51,460
You'll assemble the mini cars
we used to play with...

1897
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,500
when we were young.

1898
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,170
- Mini cars are fun.
- I'm really good at it.

1899
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:56,610
You'll race and decide the ranking.

1900
00:58:56,610 --> 00:59:00,500
You'll need to race two rounds,
and in the order of arrival,

1901
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,900
we'll give you
40, 30, 20, and 10 points.

1902
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,920
- That sounds fun.
- After racing two rounds,

1903
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,440
you get to overhaul
for exactly two minutes.

1904
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,080
Then you'll have a second round
and earn points.

1905
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,190
- We get to overhaul too?
- We'll probably change batteries.

1906
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:12,560
Right. Because if they race far...

1907
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,880
It's like F1.

1908
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,880
Depending on that,
the speed changes.

1909
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,020
The full marks are 40 points
in each round.

1910
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:21,170
We'll give you 40 points
for the designs.

1911
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,770
- Designs?
- Designs?

1912
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:25,790
Depending on how well
you decorate your mini car...

1913
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:27,130
There are stickers too.

1914
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,400
Those details...

1915
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,770
The directors who used to play with
mini cars when they were young...

1916
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,270
will give you points.

1917
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:33,130
Starting with this mission,

1918
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:35,310
the winner gets a special benefit.

1919
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,810
You can either resign
or unify candidacies.

1920
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:39,250
- Unify candidacies?
- Can we do that?

1921
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,250
We can unify candidacies?

1922
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,190
The winner of the race...

1923
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,110
may force the candidate
of your choice...

1924
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:45,690
to unify their candidacy with yours.

1925
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:48,420
That person will only earn
extra ballots...

1926
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,150
and be exempted from candidacy.

1927
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:51,900
- That's a good thing, then.
- It is.

1928
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,360
It's supporting other candidates.

1929
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,790
- That's great.
- We should support others.

1930
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:57,000
Do you not want to be the captain?

1931
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,230
- It's because...
- Of course not.

1932
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:00,190
- we need to attend meetings.
- It's troublesome.

1933
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:01,900
Actually,
it'll be meaningful for you.

1934
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:02,900
It'll be Cho Sae Ho's Running Man.

1935
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:06,880
I know that, but I'm not
a regular on Running Man.

1936
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,500
That way, you can become
a familiar guest.

1937
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,420
- Hey, there's an open spot.
- Through this?

1938
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,350
- We have an open spot.
- Oh, really?

1939
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,810
- He likes it.
- We have an open spot.

1940
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:17,350
You came to the show
without knowing that?

1941
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:19,060
- Gosh.
- We have an open spot.

1942
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:20,830
The fact that I'm here
as the sole guest...

1943
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,190
- That's right!
- My gosh.

1944
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:24,520
You must make your own path.

1945
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,830
No, that's not the case.

1946
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,520
- No, Sae Ho.
- He's saying no.

1947
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,230
- That's not the case?
- He's in bad condition.

1948
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:31,600
So you want to become the captain.

1949
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,600
- What did you say?
- From Gangnam to Mok-dong.

1950
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,900
Once a week.

1951
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,000
- Despite your busy schedule,
- Hey.

1952
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,670
- you'll attend the meeting?
- I don't get a day off.

1953
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:40,440
- I'll help you become one.
- I don't get a day off.

1954
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,170
- I don't get a single day off.
- You should take good care of him.

1955
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,900
- Take care of Jae Suk.
- He should become the captain.

1956
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,610
- Stop it.
- I'll make sure...

1957
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:47,310
From lunch to a meeting.

1958
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,190
- That'll be great.
- I'm too busy for that.

1959
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:50,690
Sae Ho can make him the captain.

1960
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:52,920
Before the mission starts,
we need to decide one thing.

1961
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,190
The inner lane is more advantageous.

1962
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:58,190
So we'll play Pirate Roulette
to decide who takes the inner lane.

1963
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,520
The inner lane is more advantageous.

1964
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,920
- It's a lot more advantageous.
- For sure.

1965
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,400
But if you make your mini car well,
it can turn the corner well.

1966
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,170
- Is that so?
- The motor matters a lot too.

1967
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:05,790
The wheels matter too.

1968
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,100
We divided you into teams
in advance.

1969
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,400
The first team
is Jae Suk and Se Chan.

1970
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,330
- We'll win for sure.
- That's not fair.

1971
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:14,040
- Protruding mouth brothers.
- All right.

1972
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,900
The second team
is Jong Kook and Haha.

1973
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,440
Do you know how to make it?

1974
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,440
They're like brothers.

1975
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,440
I've made it before.

1976
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,610
The third team
is Suk Jin and Ji Hyo.

1977
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:24,040
- What about me? What?
- It's okay.

1978
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,080
What about me?

1979
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,360
- What?
- The fourth team...

1980
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,520
(Automatically,
So Min and Sae Ho form a team.)

1981
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,730
- Hold her hands!
- I don't want him!

1982
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:30,920
What is this?

1983
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,830
- Is this a date?
- Take her home after this.

1984
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:35,060
- Drive the mini car home.
- Why? What is this?

1985
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,690
- What is this?
- Take her home.

1986
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:38,400
What is this though?

1987
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,190
- What is this?
- We're at a disadvantage.

1988
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:41,310
Sae Ho likes it.

1989
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:42,540
What's this?

1990
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,060
Did you tell them to?

1991
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:47,000
Why would I do that?
We're at a disadvantage.

1992
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,770
Let's play the game
to determine your lanes.

1993
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:50,770
Okay.

1994
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:51,810
It'll pop out.

1995
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:53,920
- Yes! You see?
- He killed it.

1996
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,610
(The faster the pirate pops out,
the further their lanes will be.)

1997
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:58,420
- We got this.
- Okay. Second lane is good enough.

1998
01:01:58,420 --> 01:01:59,810
It's good for us.

1999
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,420
Gosh, they look so fancy.

2000
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:03,630
We're supposed to assemble these?
I don't think we can.

2001
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:06,150
Guys, we'll give you 30 minutes.

2002
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,770
If you feel lost
while assembling them,

2003
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:11,040
you can use one of your ballots
to ask for help.

2004
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,960
- And we'll help you for a minute.
- Is that so?

2005
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,060
Please sit separately
and start assembling.

2006
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,540
- Get ready.
- We're in trouble.

2007
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:17,810
You've never played with these, have you?

2008
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:19,170
We will make it in no time.

2009
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,270
Is it possible
to make it in 30 minutes?

2010
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,940
I make it these days
because of Ji Ho.

2011
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,350
My goodness.

2012
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,940
Let's finish it in 20 minutes.

2013
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,980
- I will work on the wheels.
- That's right.

2014
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:30,750
I haven't seen a motor in a while.

2015
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,610
We should be thorough
and make the ends smooth...

2016
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:35,150
because any parts that stick out
create wind resistance.

2017
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:36,380
Gosh.

2018
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,650
I am sorry,
but do you have reading glasses?

2019
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:40,860
- I will work on the wheels.
- What am I supposed to do?

2020
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,130
(The instructions
make him complain.)

2021
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:43,270
We need to work on the motor too.

2022
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:45,270
- This is so much work.
- Seriously.

2023
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,290
When I messed it up in my childhood,

2024
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:50,460
- I broke everything and cried.
- I did the same.

2025
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:52,540
I didn't cry, but I got annoyed.

2026
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,310
Are you good at something like this?

2027
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,380
Do men seem charming
if they can do something like this?

2028
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,520
Of course.

2029
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:00,650
Men who can assemble furniture
are charming.

2030
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,290
Let's do this.

2031
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:05,380
- You guys look affectionate.
- That's right.

2032
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:06,860
- Hey, Sae Ho.
- They are so mischievous.

2033
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:09,520
- Yes, Haha?
- Women find this trait charming.

2034
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,250
- They are so mischievous.
- I will do my best.

2035
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,100
They like it
when men build things with ease.

2036
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,360
You will hurt your hands.
Don't do anything.

2037
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,040
- Don't do anything.
- What are you guys doing?

2038
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:20,170
"You will hurt your hands."
He is such a good actor.

2039
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:22,000
(Giggling)

2040
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,210
He has no interest in her.

2041
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:25,130
He is ugly.

2042
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,210
(They badmouth him
in a childish way.)

2043
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:30,540
- We are so one-dimensional.
- He is ugly.

2044
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,850
He was much cuter
when he was chubby.

2045
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:35,250
I completed the wheels.

2046
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,420
- Did you complete them already?
- You didn't complete them.

2047
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,610
- Gosh.
- I am making them nervous.

2048
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:43,020
I completed the wheels already.

2049
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:44,750
Did you complete them already?

2050
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,250
I completed the wheels.

2051
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,730
We are putting in the motor now.

2052
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:52,860
- Stop it.
- You are lying.

2053
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:54,860
- What are you playing at?
- Why would we lie?

2054
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,460
- For goodness' sake.
- Hey.

2055
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,880
Unlike you guys, we are experts.

2056
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,730
Here comes the motor.

2057
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,170
- Ji Hyo, you are good.
- We need A8.

2058
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:07,080
Why would you talk about every process?
For goodness' sake.

2059
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,540
All right. The front wheels.

2060
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:10,420
The rear wheels are ready.

2061
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,750
(He assembles the parts
after the announcement.)

2062
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:15,750
- Will you boast every time?
- Okay.

2063
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:17,250
Gosh, we are doing well.

2064
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,920
We are about to start the car.

2065
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,690
- We get it. You are good at it.
- Vroom.

2066
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,770
They are so loud.

2067
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:25,940
- Seriously.
- Why would you brag so much?

2068
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,360
You will place last anyway.

2069
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,440
- All right.
- The car is ready to go.

2070
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:31,380
We are fastening our seatbelts.

2071
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,830
It's ready to go.

2072
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:36,210
- Vroom.
- Don't be ridiculous.

2073
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,210
I need what's behind you.

2074
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:39,150
- All right.
- This is good.

2075
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:40,310
- We need A4.
- Jae Suk.

2076
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,580
- Did you say A4?
- It's incredible. Look at it.

2077
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:42,690
It looks amazing.

2078
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:43,750
It's for the points.

2079
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,290
- It's incredible.
- Does it go?

2080
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,460
Does it go?

2081
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:48,580
- Put it down.
- Which one should we use?

2082
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,480
- There it goes.
- Okay. This is great.

2083
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:52,060
- Did you make it already?
- Sae Ho, be careful.

2084
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,830
- You made it well.
- Be careful not to crash it.

2085
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,190
When did you make it?

2086
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:56,690
- It's so pretty.
- It is, right?

2087
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:58,290
(A car by So Min, the designer,
and Sae Ho, the engineer)

2088
01:04:58,290 --> 01:04:59,540
We need to paint it.

2089
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,210
It works.

2090
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:03,610
Please change the wheels.

2091
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:04,730
(Many of them switch the wheels
after putting in the motor.)

2092
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:06,330
- They spin.
- Shall we switch the wheels?

2093
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:07,540
(Many of them switch the wheels
after putting in the motor.)

2094
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:08,710
Let's do that.

2095
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,440
(They tune the mini car
for design points.)

2096
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,880
Yes. A pink car.

2097
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,150
Please wrap it up.

2098
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:18,060
- Hold on. We need to add this.
- I didn't know.

2099
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:20,480
Jae Suk,
the new wheels we put in...

2100
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,150
don't spin.

2101
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,100
- What?
- Jae Suk, these wheels don't spin.

2102
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,560
What do you mean?

2103
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,020
- Can't we use them?
- It must be because we used...

2104
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,500
homemade wheels.

2105
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,500
(The homemade wheels
have a crucial problem.)

2106
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:32,560
They don't spin.

2107
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:34,000
- Spin them like this.
- Let's ditch it.

2108
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,440
- Okay.
- Let's ditch the top.

2109
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,710
(They decide to ditch the top.)

2110
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:38,210
- Jae Suk.
- We just need to be fast, right?

2111
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:40,400
Jae Suk, let's put flowers...

2112
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:41,900
on the top.

2113
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:44,270
That's good. Okay.

2114
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:46,670
- It's not very pretty.
- Simple is the best.

2115
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:48,080
- Good.
- It's white.

2116
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:49,250
This is our car.

2117
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:51,380
Team Suk Jin and Ji Hyo
in Lane One,

2118
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,810
please introduce the car.

2119
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:54,730
The design...

2120
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,650
represents Ji Hyo's car.

2121
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:59,500
Ji Hyo is a pink princess,

2122
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,830
so we made a pink car.

2123
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,790
It's a very pretty pink car.
These wings have a function.

2124
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:05,000
Please listen.

2125
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,600
- Hey, listen.
- Okay.

2126
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:08,330
These wings have a function.

2127
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:10,830
They divide the wind
and set direction.

2128
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:13,230
That way,
they make the car go faster.

2129
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,480
The wings play a big role
in the Pink Car.

2130
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:18,040
Yo!

2131
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,190
This car is way above those cars.

2132
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,980
Our car has various colors
and gold wheels.

2133
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,360
These are 24K gold.

2134
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,460
The name of this car is...

2135
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:31,060
- Rainbow 401.
- Rainbow 401.

2136
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:32,500
(Rainbow 401)

2137
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,230
Rainbow 401.

2138
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:35,460
Why did you add "401?"

2139
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,900
It has various flavors.

2140
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,000
We added 401...

2141
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:40,500
- because 4 wheels will become 1.
- Okay.

2142
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,040
- They will become 1 forever.
- They will become 1 forever.

2143
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:43,940
- Sae Ho.
- Okay.

2144
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:47,630
So Min came up
with the overall design.

2145
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:49,110
We focused on the design.

2146
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:50,250
It looks like a festival...

2147
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:52,710
because it will bring us
a private festival.

2148
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:53,810
The name is...

2149
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:55,080
Love...

2150
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:56,850
In the Lane.

2151
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:58,690
- Love in the Lane.
- Sae Ho suggested the name.

2152
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:00,360
Yes. It's like
"Singin' in the Rain."

2153
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:01,460
If you look here,

2154
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:02,880
there are Sae Ho and me.

2155
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,460
(94 percent for parts
and 98 percent for nuisance)

2156
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:05,500
Are you guys dating?

2157
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,060
Wouldn't the car be too heavy?

2158
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:08,920
So Min, isn't the car too heavy?

2159
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,460
It isn't heavy. Trust me.

2160
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:13,060
- Jae Suk.
- Our car is...

2161
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:14,900
- Jae Suk.
- Simple Is the Best.

2162
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,210
- Vroom.
- Show us.

2163
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,730
They want to see it.

2164
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,500
It isn't simple at all.
It's so crude-looking.

2165
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,810
- It's so crude-looking.
- We focused on speed.

2166
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:25,520
I am sorry, but isn't that a jegi?

2167
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,580
- We focused on speed.
- Vroom.

2168
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:29,440
We switched the wheels...

2169
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,080
and decided to focus on speed.

2170
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,080
Simple Is the Best.

2171
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,630
You removed the top.

2172
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:37,060
In Round 1,
the cars will make 2 laps.

2173
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:40,250
Start the car
and hold it over your lane.

2174
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:41,420
- Standby.
- I think it will get caught.

2175
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:42,900
- Start the car.
- Start the car.

2176
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:45,330
- Here we go.
- Start the car.

2177
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:46,400
Here we go.

2178
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,540
Get ready.

2179
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:49,060
(Lane 1: Suk Jin and Ji Hyo
Lane 2: Jong Kook and Haha)

2180
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,770
(Lane 3: So Min and Sae Ho
Lane 4: Jae Suk and Se Chan)

2181
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:52,500
- Get ready.
- Get ready.

2182
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,940
Jae Suk, your car
went over the starting line.

2183
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,670
- Set,
- It went over the starting line.

2184
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:58,310
- go.
- All right.

2185
01:07:58,810 --> 01:07:59,880
(The race begins.)

2186
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,020
- Oh, no.
- That's good.

2187
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:03,650
- Oh, yes. They are out.
- My goodness.

2188
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:05,020
- Go.
- All right.

2189
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:06,190
- Oh, no.
- That's good.

2190
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:08,690
(Pink Car stops
as soon as the race begins.)

2191
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,230
- Gosh.
- It stopped.

2192
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:11,790
- Oh, no.
- That's good.

2193
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:13,690
Oh, yes. They are out.

2194
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:18,400
(Simple Is the Best
flies out while cornering.)

2195
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,630
- Look at that.
- What happened?

2196
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,460
(Se Chan puts the car
back on the lane.)

2197
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:24,040
That's good.

2198
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,710
Oh, yes. They are out.

2199
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,500
- Let's go.
- It's so fast.

2200
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:30,670
Our car is so fast.

2201
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:31,850
- It's so fast.
- Okay.

2202
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:34,480
- Our car is so fast.
- Look at that.

2203
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:35,780
- It's so fast.
- Okay.

2204
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,150
(Completing the 1st lap)

2205
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:41,530
(The engineers become excited.)

2206
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:43,190
- It's on another level.
- It's so fast.

2207
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:44,280
(Pink Car is still moving slowly.)

2208
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,450
- Look at this.
- What happened?

2209
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:46,900
- It's so fast.
- Okay.

2210
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:47,950
- It's on another level.
- It's so fast.

2211
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,620
- It's so fast.
- Okay.

2212
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:51,330
(The leading car is ahead
by one lap.)

2213
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:53,160
(3rd place, 1st place)

2214
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:54,910
- We are ahead by one lap.
- Why is their car so fast?

2215
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:57,160
- Hey.
- The motor is malfunctioning.

2216
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:00,570
(The race continues.)

2217
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:02,610
- We are ahead by one lap.
- Why is their car so fast?

2218
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:04,040
- It's so fast.
- Look at our car.

2219
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,370
- We are ahead by 1 lap.
- We are on our 3rd lap.

2220
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:07,850
- We are in 2nd place.
- We completed the 2 laps.

2221
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:09,710
- We are ahead by 1 lap.
- We are on our 3rd lap.

2222
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,490
- We are in 2nd place.
- We completed the 2 laps.

2223
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,280
What happened?
Why did our car fly out?

2224
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:18,250
(1st place, Rainbow 401)

2225
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,490
(2nd place, Love in the Lane)

2226
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:21,120
- No?
- Simple Is the Best.

2227
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,490
I will announce
the result of Round One.

2228
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:25,870
- Team Jong Kook placed first.
- Okay. That's us.

2229
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:28,130
Team So Min placed 2nd
and Team Jae Suk placed 3rd.

2230
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:30,000
I mean...

2231
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:31,610
What are you looking at?

2232
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:33,070
I wasn't looking at you.

2233
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:34,780
You will have two minutes
to make repairs.

2234
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:35,910
- Let's go.
- What should we do?

2235
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:38,210
- That was incredible.
- Let's add something big.

2236
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:40,240
We need to remove the bottom.
Let's hurry up.

2237
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:42,490
- Let's hurry up.
- This is...

2238
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:45,250
- Our car is really fast.
- Our car is really fast.

2239
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:47,120
(Laughing)

2240
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,120
It's on another level.

2241
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,360
- Rainbow 401.
- Rainbow 401.

2242
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:52,730
Throw it on the track.
Let's try it one more time.

2243
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,790
(Team Jae Suk has a test drive
instead of making repairs.)

2244
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:58,790
- It flew off here, right?
- That was incredible.

2245
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,870
(It completes a lap this time.)

2246
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,660
What?

2247
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:06,370
It flew off here. This is good.

2248
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:08,200
This is so much fun.

2249
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:10,480
- It's so fast.
- All right.

2250
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,070
It's Lane Four.

2251
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,540
Why did you put your hand
on Lane Three?

2252
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,710
Ji Hyo, let's use
the homemade parts.

2253
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:18,490
- So those are homemade parts.
- Yes.

2254
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,580
That's right.

2255
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,030
Move out of the way, So Min.

2256
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:24,900
Hold it like this.

2257
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,600
(Se Chan steals batteries.)

2258
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,990
Our car is incredible.

2259
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,490
I brought all the batteries.

2260
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:31,870
What are you doing?

2261
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,960
Why are you changing batteries
after each lap?

2262
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:35,940
Simple Is...

2263
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,460
- What was the name?
- Simple Is the Best.

2264
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,780
Simple Is the Best or Vroom...

2265
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:41,540
will teach you a lesson.
Jae Suk, let's go.

2266
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:42,570
- Hey.
- Let's do this.

2267
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:44,610
- Love in the Lane is good too.
- Love in the Lane.

2268
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:46,370
- Yes. I am serious.
- I agree. It's a formidable car.

2269
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:48,070
This time, you will make three laps.

2270
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:49,210
- Three laps.
- Three laps.

2271
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,750
Jae Suk, don't we need to change
the batteries?

2272
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,210
- Let's change the batteries.
- Hey.

2273
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,490
It won't do if the car sways.

2274
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,990
- It's okay.
- It can't stand the Mach speed.

2275
01:10:58,450 --> 01:10:59,750
Best of... This car can't...

2276
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:01,730
- Simple of the Best.
- Simple of the Best.

2277
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:02,990
- Get ready.
- "Simple of the Best?"

2278
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:04,120
All right. Let's go.

2279
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,660
- What are you saying?
- I don't know the name.

2280
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,600
- Let's go.
- Excuse me.

2281
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:09,200
- Get ready.
- Please hold on.

2282
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,330
Get ready.

2283
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:11,570
Let's go.

2284
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:13,130
- Set...
- Your hand is shaking.

2285
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:14,530
(Lane 1: Suk Jin and Ji Hyo
Lane 2: Jong Kook and Haha)

2286
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:15,670
Go.

2287
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,240
It's going well.

2288
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,520
Go.

2289
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,040
- Okay.
- It's going well.

2290
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,040
(The cars are off to a good start.)

2291
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:23,850
- Okay.
- It's going well.

2292
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:26,210
- That's it.
- Our car is fast, Jae Suk.

2293
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:27,280
- Our car is fast.
- That's it.

2294
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,320
It's going well.

2295
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,080
- That's it.
- Our car is fast, Jae Suk.

2296
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,230
- Our car is fast.
- That's it.

2297
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,990
- It's okay.
- That's good.

2298
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:35,100
- It's okay.
- Our car is leading.

2299
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:37,160
(Pink Car comes to a halt
once more.)

2300
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,160
What's wrong with it?

2301
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,290
- Our car is fast.
- That's it.

2302
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:40,370
- It's okay.
- That's good.

2303
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:42,410
- It's okay.
- Our car is leading.

2304
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:44,070
- That's good.
- Our car is leading.

2305
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:45,870
- Simple Is the Best. Okay.
- Simple Is the Best.

2306
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,200
- That's good.
- It's okay.

2307
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:48,950
- That's good.
- Our car is leading.

2308
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:50,280
- That's good.
- It's okay.

2309
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,780
- That's good.
- Our car is leading.

2310
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:53,120
Simple Is the Best. Okay.

2311
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,080
(Rainbow 401 and Simple Is the Best
are competing.)

2312
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,120
- Our car is leading.
- It's okay.

2313
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,520
Simple Is the Best. Okay.

2314
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,280
- What was that?
- No!

2315
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,360
(At that moment)

2316
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:02,690
- Simple Is the Best. Okay.
- Simple Is the Best.

2317
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:04,250
- What was that?
- No!

2318
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:05,320
- What?
- Simple Is the Best.

2319
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:06,530
(A crash follows an overturn.)

2320
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:10,400
(Rainbow 401 crashes
into Love in the Lane.)

2321
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:13,030
It entered a different lane.

2322
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:15,310
(Team Jae Suk seizes the chance.)

2323
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:17,240
- Simple Is the Best. Okay.
- Simple Is the Best.

2324
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,310
(Racing)

2325
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:19,980
- Simple Is the Best.
- That's good.

2326
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,410
- Okay.
- Okay.

2327
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:25,210
(1st place, Simple Is the Best
2nd place, Love in the Lane)

2328
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:26,620
It entered a different lane.

2329
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:27,980
Why is it so weak?

2330
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,880
(Pink Car is dead.)

2331
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,120
Why is it so weak?

2332
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,750
(3rd place, Rainbow 401
4th place, Pink Car)

2333
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:34,490
Team Jae Suk placed first.

2334
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:35,660
Okay.

2335
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:36,820
What happened?

2336
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:37,990
The car flipped over.

2337
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:41,900
(Simple Is the Best finishes!)

2338
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,200
Team Sae Ho placed second.

2339
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,530
- We placed 2nd.
- Team Haha placed 3rd.

2340
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:45,570
- We placed first, right?
- Yes.

2341
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:46,630
(1st place, Simple Is the Best)

2342
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:48,370
(2nd place, Love in the Lane)

2343
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:50,330
(3rd place, Rainbow 401)

2344
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:52,070
Simple Is the Best.

2345
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:53,670
Okay.

2346
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:54,780
We placed second.

2347
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:56,950
The batteries keep falling off.

2348
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:58,540
You should have built it
to withstand the Mach speed.

2349
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:00,410
Do you want some batteries?

2350
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:02,990
Why do the batteries fall off
during the race?

2351
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:04,850
Gosh, Rainbow 401.

2352
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,280
Why did you go easy on them,
you fool?

2353
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:09,620
The result is out.

2354
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:11,250
You combine the points, right?

2355
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:12,420
- Yes.
- That's good.

2356
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:13,600
That's too bad.

2357
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,660
In first place are
So Min and Sae Ho.

2358
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:16,770
(1st place, So Min and Sae Ho)

2359
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:17,920
In second place are
Jong Kook and Haha.

2360
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,900
- Okay. Good job.
- Good job, Rainbow 401.

2361
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:21,700
Rainbow 401, good job.

2362
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,460
As you did before,

2363
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:26,910
you will steal ballots
from someone else's slots.

2364
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:30,500
Like I said before,
one member of the winning team can resign.

2365
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,570
Play rock-paper-scissors.

2366
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:32,570
- Resign?
- Yes.

2367
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:33,620
(One member can resign.)

2368
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:35,280
It's bad news for Sae Ho.

2369
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,950
- Do you want to be one?
- It's bad news to you.

2370
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:39,360
If you resign
and choose someone to support,

2371
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,620
that member will receive votes.

2372
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:42,950
(That member
will begin with 3 votes.)

2373
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:44,560
You have a lot of ballots,
so I will resign.

2374
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,700
You have 18 ballots.

2375
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:47,200
I do, but you...

2376
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,570
- I will resign.
- No.

2377
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:49,990
Play rock-paper-scissors.

2378
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:51,160
That's right.

2379
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,290
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Yes.

2380
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:54,440
The winner will resign.

2381
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,160
- The winner will resign.
- Yes.

2382
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,070
I might not want to resign.

2383
01:13:58,130 --> 01:13:59,480
I want to resign.

2384
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:04,310
(Candidate Jeon wants to resign,
but Candidate Cho doesn't want to.)

2385
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:05,670
Do what you want then.

2386
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:07,350
I will play rock.

2387
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,190
- Here we go.
- Okay.

2388
01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:12,860
(The winner will resign right away.)

2389
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:14,060
Rock-paper-scissors

2390
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,190
(Why did So Min lose?)

2391
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:17,580
Okay! Wait, I messed up.

2392
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:18,620
I messed up.

2393
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,620
Rock-paper-scissors

2394
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:22,400
(Okay! Wait, I messed up.)

2395
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,920
- Candidate Cho resigned.
- No.

2396
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,130
- No.
- Are you a fool?

2397
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:26,700
- What are you doing?
- It wasn't like that.

2398
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,070
Wasn't I supposed to lose?

2399
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:29,370
You should have played paper.

2400
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:30,740
- All right, So Min.
- Wasn't I supposed to lose?

2401
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:32,780
Sae Ho resigned.

2402
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,240
- What?
- It was an unwanted resignation.

2403
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,040
I know.
You really wanted to do it, right?

2404
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,170
Sae Ho resigned.

2405
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:41,150
You can vote,

2406
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:42,910
but other people can't vote for you.

2407
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,280
The candidate you support...

2408
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:47,560
will begin with three votes.

2409
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,160
In that case,
I can still have some fun.

2410
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,750
Some members
wouldn't welcome the unification.

2411
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:56,490
I am reminded of those
who didn't welcome me warmly...

2412
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:59,100
when I came here as a guest.

2413
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,200
- It's understandable.
- I welcomed you.

2414
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,870
Through meetings,
he or she can build solidify.

2415
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:05,500
- You mean "Solidarity."
- Solidarity.

2416
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:07,170
- You said "Solidify."
- "Solidify?"

2417
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:08,650
- "Solidify?"
- Hold on.

2418
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:09,650
- He said "Solidify."
- That's a bit...

2419
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:10,950
- You are laughing.
- Seriously.

2420
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:12,350
It seems like
you are looking down on me.

2421
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,820
- Support him.
- Are you looking down on me?

2422
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:16,580
- I just found it funny.
- That's the undertone.

2423
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,560
- I will support one member.
- Okay.

2424
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,990
I was displeased last night...

2425
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:22,280
- because...
- Last night?

2426
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,360
Yes.

2427
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:25,120
I couldn't help but be displeased.

2428
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:29,730
I wanted to sleep well
for the shoot.

2429
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:31,490
"You are joining the shoot
tomorrow."

2430
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:33,370
- "I don't want you to come."
- My goodness.

2431
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:35,770
What kind of a man says that?

2432
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:38,160
So I will support Yoo Jae Suk.

2433
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,630
(So I will support Yoo Jae Suk.)

2434
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:41,910
Congratulations.

2435
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:43,170
It's a good reason.

2436
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:45,520
The first promise
of unifying candidacies surfaced.

2437
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,540
(Candidate Cho Sae Ho resigns.)

2438
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:49,350
- It's a good reason.
- He always tells me,

2439
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:51,350
"You need to have affection
for the show you are on."

2440
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:54,490
By joining the meeting once a week,

2441
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:57,860
he can aim to bring
the second heyday to the show.

2442
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,290
Jae Suk and Sae Ho
unified candidacies.

2443
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:05,070
Jae Suk, you will begin
with three votes.

2444
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:06,100
(Candidate Yoo secured 3 votes.)

2445
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,940
- Gangwon Province?
- Jeju Island?

2446
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:09,110
Gyeonggi Province.

2447
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:10,530
(Team So Min and Team Jong Kook
acquire ballots in others' slots.)

2448
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:14,170
Since Ji Hyo placed first,

2449
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:15,570
she can unify candidacies.

2450
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,450
Which candidate will you support
before you resign?

2451
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,040
You can resign.

2452
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,850
I will support Haha.

2453
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,850
(Candidate Song supports
Candidate Haha.)

2454
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,820
- You will support Haha.
- Yes.

2455
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:27,320
- Good job.
- Yes.

2456
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,190
- Good job, Ji Hyo.
- It could be Haha's Running Man.

2457
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:30,360
- Good job, Ji Hyo.
- Nice.

2458
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:33,160
It's your last chance
to steal the ballots.

2459
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:35,230
Please hold it up.

2460
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:37,320
- Not many ballots remain.
- I have five ballots left.

2461
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:40,070
- Five ballots.
- Ji Hyo has many ballots left.

2462
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:41,530
Does she have many ballots left?

2463
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,200
(Ji Hyo still has 10 ballots.)

2464
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,480
Ji Hyo isn't the type to think much.

2465
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:46,870
She is simple.

2466
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:48,130
She probably chose
the places she lives in.

2467
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:49,570
- Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.
- Ilsan and Seoul.

2468
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,950
It's not like that.

2469
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:53,520
I will take
Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.

2470
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,950
- Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.
- Okay.

2471
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:57,080
(Seoul and Gyeonggi Province)

2472
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,240
(9 ballots)

2473
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,580
Jae Suk is a genius.

2474
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,250
He is really good.

2475
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:02,880
He stole nine ballots.

2476
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,450
Where is the remaining ballot?

2477
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:06,320
He knows Ji Hyo so well.

2478
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:08,360
- All right.
- You put them in one place.

2479
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,730
Third place, Jong Kook.

2480
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:10,990
Sae Ho, hold up the map.

2481
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:12,030
- Okay.
- Do it nicely.

2482
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:13,290
- Here you go.
- Okay.

2483
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:14,490
Hold it up nicely.

2484
01:17:14,490 --> 01:17:16,240
There you go.

2485
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:18,530
Someone took
Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.

2486
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:21,530
Many people around you
are from Gyeongsang Province.

2487
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:22,670
What?

2488
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:24,780
(Slapping)

2489
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,980
- What?
- What was that?

2490
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:28,370
Many people around you
are from Gyeongsang Province.

2491
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:30,410
- What?
- What was that?

2492
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:32,020
- Hey.
- So Min.

2493
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:34,320
- So Min.
- What was that?

2494
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:35,750
- Hey.
- What was that?

2495
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:37,420
- She slapped his head.
- Why did you laugh so loud?

2496
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:38,790
- What was that?
- I...

2497
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:40,660
That came out of nowhere.

2498
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:42,070
- What was that?
- What was that?

2499
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:43,120
Seriously.

2500
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,160
Why did you do that?

2501
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,570
I think she likes him.

2502
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:46,830
Doesn't she like him?

2503
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:48,330
- Right?
- It was so strange.

2504
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,000
There must be a reason.

2505
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,670
Seriously. Are you a lunatic?

2506
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:55,200
- Sae Ho is happy.
- What was that?

2507
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,500
- Doesn't she like him?
- That came out of nowhere.

2508
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,350
- You know,
- She likes him. She slapped hard.

2509
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:00,670
she made my heart flutter a bit.

2510
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,190
- She made my heart flutter a bit.
- Right.

2511
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:05,660
Do you know what So Min said to me?

2512
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,750
She said, "Jae Suk, look."

2513
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:10,420
"Isn't the back of his head
perfect for slapping?"

2514
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:12,860
I didn't think much of it,
but she suddenly slapped him.

2515
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:13,860
Why did you do that?

2516
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:15,270
I was going to act like you did it,

2517
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:17,030
but I failed because you laughed.

2518
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:18,770
It would have been impossible
for me to slap him.

2519
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:21,200
I don't feel bad about it,
so there is no problem.

2520
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,610
I get that,
but I think she likes you.

2521
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:25,160
It felt like she was trying
to get me more screen time.

2522
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,740
It made my heart flutter.

2523
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:30,150
Did you take off Gangwon Province...

2524
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:31,500
and Seoul and Gyeonggi Province?

2525
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,520
- Of course I didn't.
- I see.

2526
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,170
- You have friends on Jeju Island.
- It's such a funny incident.

2527
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:37,490
- I have friends on Jeju Island.
- Why did she slap him?

2528
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:39,080
It's so funny
that she couldn't hold back.

2529
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:40,410
It's a bit strange.

2530
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:41,860
Okay. There we go.

2531
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:43,660
There were five ballots
in Gyeongsang Province. Okay.

2532
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,230
- Fourth place comes next.
- Me.

2533
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,060
Jae Suk is
the only one who is left.

2534
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:48,870
- That's right.
- Look him in the eye.

2535
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:50,370
His wife is
from Jeolla Province, right?

2536
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:51,820
- I will take Jeolla Province.
- Jeolla Province.

2537
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:53,030
- Yes.
- Will there be ballots?

2538
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:54,830
One ballot.

2539
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,270
- That's too bad.
- They are in other provinces.

2540
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:57,960
- He used...
- He spread out the ballots.

2541
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,310
- a cheeky method.
- I wanted four ballots.

2542
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:01,950
Thus, the ballot distribution is over.

2543
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:02,980
I will reveal how many ballots
each member has.

2544
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:05,780
If So Min becomes the captain,
the producer won't be happy.

2545
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:07,210
- It will be tiring.
- She will be a lot of work.

2546
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:08,990
Jae Suk has 16 ballots.

2547
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:10,540
Suk Jin has two ballots.

2548
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:12,690
Jong Kook has ten ballots.

2549
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:13,860
Haha has two ballots.

2550
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,360
Ji Hyo has five ballots.

2551
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,820
- Don't I have more than 10 ballots?
- Se Chan has 5 ballots.

2552
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:17,860
- I used them earlier.
- Yes.

2553
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:20,400
Sae Ho has 22 ballots.

2554
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,900
So Min has zero ballots.

2555
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,120
Sae Ho.

2556
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,120
Does So Min have zero ballots?

2557
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,940
Please talk among yourselves
to create a consensus.

2558
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:29,570
So Min suits the position the most.

2559
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:30,660
- She does.
- She likes doing such things.

2560
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:32,630
- Please listen.
- She likes coming up with plans.

2561
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:34,480
I don't need to be the captain.

2562
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,350
And think about the votes
the members have.

2563
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:38,450
Haha and Jae Suk already have
three votes each.

2564
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:42,350
So Min is the closest
to the staff members.

2565
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:44,690
If So Min becomes the captain,

2566
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:46,820
- things could get a bit annoying.
- That's right.

2567
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:48,920
So Min would contribute
her various ideas.

2568
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,750
When I watch the show,
I sometimes think about...

2569
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:54,250
how Se Chan's Running Man would be.

2570
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:55,320
That's a good idea.

2571
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,370
Se Chan suits the position.

2572
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:58,830
He would like it.

2573
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:00,130
- If I become the captain...
- He would do well.

2574
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,110
- He is a good worker.
- Things will become very annoying.

2575
01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:03,530
- If he becomes the captain,
- I will make sure it happens.

2576
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:04,830
the penalties will be intense.

2577
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:07,170
- I will make them intense.
- He has good ideas.

2578
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:09,170
We have a former host
of "Star Golden Bell."

2579
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:10,810
- Let's go retro.
- I recommend Suk Jin.

2580
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:12,350
- Me too.
- Me too.

2581
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:15,150
- As the oldest member,
- But I...

2582
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:18,190
he persevered without a complaint
for 12 years.

2583
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:20,320
Did you forget about how he tried
to quit in the beginning?

2584
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,950
- Thus...
- My love for the show...

2585
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:23,560
isn't that great.

2586
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,860
How could you say that
when the fans are watching?

2587
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:28,990
It's just that your love
for the show is much greater.

2588
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:31,660
What is this? Are you still waiting
for a chance to quit?

2589
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:34,770
- Here is the thing.
- I am not qualified...

2590
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:36,030
to be the captain.

2591
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:38,630
If it weren't for the requirement
to attend the weekly meeting,

2592
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:40,830
Suk Jin would have really wanted
to be the captain.

2593
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:43,200
- I am not qualified.
- Suk Jin has good ideas.

2594
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,450
I don't have any ideas.

2595
01:20:44,450 --> 01:20:47,020
- Also, Suk Jin is a gourmet.
- That's right.

2596
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:48,240
- He is picky.
- Yes.

2597
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,880
How about this?

2598
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,360
Haha could show us
which show he likes better...

2599
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,710
between "How Do You Play?"
and Running Man...

2600
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:56,160
- by becoming the captain.
- I gave my answer already.

2601
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,060
- He should become the captain.
- I said...

2602
01:20:58,060 --> 01:20:59,790
that I like Running Man better.

2603
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:00,820
- Really?
- Why don't you show us?

2604
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:03,820
I want to see him pour his love
into Running Man.

2605
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:05,630
- Haha's Running Man sounds nice.
- No.

2606
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:07,070
I am a lacking man.

2607
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:08,940
I personally think...

2608
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,960
it would be nice to make Jae Suk
attend the meetings.

2609
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:14,000
- That isn't a bad idea.
- That isn't a bad idea.

2610
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,240
Yoo Jae Suk's Running Man
sounds the most appropriate.

2611
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:19,170
If Jae Suk goes to Mok-dong
every week,

2612
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:21,070
people at the TV station
will be energized.

2613
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:22,740
I am disappointed in you guys.

2614
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:24,710
Why is no one bringing up Jong Kook?

2615
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:26,520
- Come on.
- There is a reason.

2616
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,990
I am afraid he will throw a fit
during the meetings.

2617
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:31,950
- I would definitely do that.
- Right?

2618
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:32,990
(The political thug
threatens to throw a fit.)

2619
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:34,420
So you don't want people
to vote for you.

2620
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:36,460
To be honest,

2621
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:39,530
seeing the members
brainstorm ideas...

2622
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:40,830
makes me a bit jealous.

2623
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:42,660
- Why? We do it together.
- You...

2624
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:44,130
Yes. You brainstorm ideas together.

2625
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:45,700
- When you are together...
- We are like a family.

2626
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,310
- Yes. It's so nice.
- Thank you for coming today,

2627
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:50,650
but I feel uncomfortable
that you keep saying such things.

2628
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,540
- What did I do?
- My goodness.

2629
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:56,280
It's not like I asked you
to let me join the show.

2630
01:21:56,950 --> 01:22:00,580
I am well aware of my position.

2631
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:04,080
- I feel a bit uncomfortable.
- Can't I gather up my courage?

2632
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,730
I will hand out your ballots.
You know where to go, right?

2633
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:08,200
- Yes.
- Are we voting right now?

2634
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,420
So Min.

2635
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:10,990
Who should be the captain?

2636
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:12,770
- Who should it be?
- Please make a wise decision.

2637
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:14,740
- Can I ask?
- When it comes to meetings...

2638
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,830
- It's an actual vote.
- So Min doesn't want to do it.

2639
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:17,870
Of course not.

2640
01:22:17,870 --> 01:22:19,700
- That's surprising.
- The captain is...

2641
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:21,170
- This is really hard.
- That's too much pressure.

2642
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:22,850
The captain from Yongsan
who's the last in the Hierarchy.

2643
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,740
- That sounds so cool.
- Jeon So Min.

2644
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:26,280
- Gosh, So Min.
- Move out of the way.

2645
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,820
- That's beautiful.
- I'm the captain.

2646
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,740
- I don't want to attend meetings.
- But...

2647
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:32,380
I hurt my leg, so I can't go around.

2648
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:33,950
If I become the captain,

2649
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:36,230
I'll send someone
who voted for me to the meeting instead.

2650
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:37,690
- Because I'm the captain.
- Can he do that?

2651
01:22:37,690 --> 01:22:38,730
No, you can't do that.

2652
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:41,420
I'll vote for Suk Jin.
That's not the attitude...

2653
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:43,730
- No, I mean...
- You can't do that.

2654
01:22:43,730 --> 01:22:44,920
You can't become the captain
with that attitude.

2655
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,900
Who should I vote for?

2656
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:48,830
I have no idea.

2657
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:51,700
- I bet I'll get a lot of votes.
- Darn it.

2658
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:54,130
Seriously, I can't do this.

2659
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,870
- Hey, I have no time.
- I don't like being a leader.

2660
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:58,910
I don't have a day off.

2661
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:00,450
- Suk Jin sounds upset.
- Why are you upset?

2662
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:02,490
- Suk Jin is...
- You guys are framing me.

2663
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:03,740
My gosh.

2664
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:05,560
He says he never gets upset,
but why...

2665
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,210
"I don't have a day off."

2666
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,080
He's sulky.

2667
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:10,920
Go ahead and vote for me.

2668
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:12,360
- Here.
- All right.

2669
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,420
- We don't know who will win.
- We don't know.

2670
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,620
Let me count the votes.

2671
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:19,330
The winner will be...

2672
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:21,440
the captain for the next four weeks.

2673
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,130
- That sounds amazing.
- He gets to decide what to eat.

2674
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:24,240
And he should attend meetings.

2675
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,170
- Attend meetings.
- Four times.

2676
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:27,570
(The captain should attend
meetings of the production crew.)

2677
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:29,110
Let me start counting the votes.

2678
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:32,950
Two for Jong Kook, two for Haha,
two for Se Chan,

2679
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:34,540
and ten for So Min.

2680
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:36,450
So Min got ten votes?

2681
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:37,740
(Jae Suk gave
his 10 votes to Candidate Jeon.)

2682
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:41,380
Three for Suk Jin,
and two for Haha.

2683
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:44,360
(Ji Hyo voted
for Haha and Suk Jin.)

2684
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,450
I bet it was Se Chan.

2685
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:47,820
- No, it's not me.
- Three and two.

2686
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:48,920
(Pretending to be innocent)

2687
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,620
- You had five votes.
- No. You'll see.

2688
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,400
One for Jae Suk, Suk Jin,
Jong Kook, Haha, and So Min.

2689
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,530
(Se Chan gave one vote
to each except himself.)

2690
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:56,870
One for each.

2691
01:23:57,310 --> 01:23:59,110
- We don't know the result yet.
- Right.

2692
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:00,670
- This is so thrilling.
- I'm so nervous.

2693
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:01,740
(The votes counted are 41.9 percent,
but they have no idea who will win.)

2694
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:03,850
Ten votes for Haha.

2695
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:04,910
- What?
- Okay.

2696
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:07,040
(10 votes for Haha)

2697
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:08,710
What's that?

2698
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:11,490
- It must be Jong Kook.
- What?

2699
01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:13,250
- It's Jong Kook.
- No.

2700
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:14,820
Two votes for Haha.

2701
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:16,750
- Haha got...
- What?

2702
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:18,030
Haha has won...

2703
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:19,120
Are you counting the votes?

2704
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,750
Haha's Running Man?

2705
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:22,770
One for Suk Jin and one for So Min.

2706
01:24:23,370 --> 01:24:24,730
We don't know who will win.

2707
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:26,240
Haha might win.

2708
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,460
Has Haha gotten the most votes?

2709
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:29,530
It's up to Sae Ho after all.

2710
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:31,200
This is Sae Ho's decision.

2711
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,980
One for Jae Suk,
one for Jong Kook, one for Haha,

2712
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:36,410
one for Se Chan, one for So Min,

2713
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:37,910
and 17 for Suk Jin.

2714
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:40,210
One for Se Chan, one for So Min,

2715
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:43,910
(17 votes for Ji Suk Jin)

2716
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:45,950
(What?)

2717
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:48,820
(Cho Sae Ho)

2718
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:51,060
I just like him so much.

2719
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,400
- I mean...
- It's nice.

2720
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,030
It's settled.

2721
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:55,870
- Well done.
- I like him a lot.

2722
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:57,030
It can't be helped.

2723
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:58,400
I just like Suk Jin a lot.

2724
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,130
- This week...
- This is a penalty.

2725
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:01,290
I'll get a henna tattoo this week.

2726
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:02,630
- You...
- This is a penalty.

2727
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:04,830
No, it's not a penalty. You are...

2728
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:06,410
- my captain forever.
- Sure.

2729
01:25:06,410 --> 01:25:08,530
He just did it for Suk Jin.

2730
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:09,950
- Okay.
- Good.

2731
01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:11,350
- Please accept my heart.
- Okay.

2732
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:12,740
All right.

2733
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:15,910
You also got the three votes
during the unification.

2734
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:18,280
(The 3 votes
from the unification are left.)

2735
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,990
- Right. There are more votes.
- That's right.

2736
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:21,880
- Haha won.
- It must be Haha.

2737
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:24,280
Haha got three votes,

2738
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,160
- and Jae Suk got another 3 votes.
- Right, 3 votes.

2739
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,290
- Three votes each.
- And there were...

2740
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:29,230
- I had ten votes.
- ten votes.

2741
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,660
- Because of them...
- We don't know it yet.

2742
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:33,330
We have no idea.

2743
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:35,440
The winner was decided
by only one vote.

2744
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,270
- What?
- It must be Haha.

2745
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:39,170
- It should be Haha.
- What do I do?

2746
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:41,280
- One vote?
- One got 22 votes...

2747
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,370
while the other got 21 votes.

2748
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:44,410
- Who is it?
- Are they 21 and 22 votes?

2749
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:46,320
I don't think it's Suk Jin.

2750
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,320
The captain...

2751
01:25:48,410 --> 01:25:51,580
who won 22 votes is...

2752
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:52,580
(The captain who will lead
Running Man for 4 weeks is...)

2753
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:54,060
Congratulations.

2754
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:03,680
Ji Suk Jin.

2755
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,090
(Ji Suk Jin is elected
with 22 votes.)

2756
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,960
Why did you make me anticipate it?

2757
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:11,760
Haha got 21 votes.

2758
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,520
All right. Captain Ji.

2759
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:14,860
We should toss him into the air.

2760
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:17,230
If you gave me only 15 votes...

2761
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:18,670
Why did you do that?

2762
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:21,100
- I told you.
- You're the captain of Running Man.

2763
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:23,140
- Suk Jin.
- This is obviously a penalty.

2764
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:25,230
Why is it a penalty?
I just like you so much.

2765
01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:27,180
Ji Suk Jin's Running Man.

2766
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,380
You know what?

2767
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:30,750
I'll tell you about
a few good restaurants.

2768
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:32,010
Pick our lunch from there.

2769
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:34,510
(Eye contact)

2770
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:36,980
- Well... Today.
- You're a great man.

2771
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:38,680
- Suk Jin is my role model.
- This is crazy.

2772
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,980
Just take off the microphone
and run away.

2773
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:44,260
With Captain Ji,
we will work hard for the next four weeks.

2774
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:46,560
Congratulations. Don't stop.

2775
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,230
- Captain Ji!
- Ji Suk Jin's Running Man!

2776
01:26:49,230 --> 01:26:50,260
Ji Suk Jin's...

2777
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:52,860
- Running Man!
- Running Man!

2778
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:55,760
- Thank you.
- I should enjoy this.

2779
01:26:56,430 --> 01:26:59,550
(It is like a movie.)

2780
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:02,470
(The two youths meet again.)

2781
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:04,580
(Jin Ji Hee and Cha Jun Hwan)

2782
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:05,580
(Hello.)

2783
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:07,720
(They have to be the captains...)

2784
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,760
(and lead the old team members.)

2785
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,460
(Blind and deaf)

2786
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,180
(The old fossils are
throwing tantrums.)

2787
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:14,390
(Embarrassed)

2788
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:16,550
(Someone shows up at the moment.)

2789
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:18,500
(The ultimate boss)

2790
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,560
(How dare you talk back to me?)

2791
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:26,430
(Spending some time
with the members of Running Man...)

2792
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:28,930
(they learn the bitters of life
from experience.)

2793
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:32,040
This is how life is.
You are learning about life here.

2794
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:33,750
(Do you know who he is?)

2795
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,440
(He's figure skater Cha Jun Hwan.)

2796
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,140
(Sorry.)

2797
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:40,440
(Whoever wants to be a captain...)

2798
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,310
(must endure the weight
of old fossils.)

2799
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:45,050
- I'm here.
- Are you here?

2800
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:47,020
(Because This Is
My First Time to Be a Captain)
