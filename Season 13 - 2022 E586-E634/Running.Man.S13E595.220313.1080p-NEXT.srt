1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,630
Hello.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,000
- Let's go in.
- Haha.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,770
- Hello.
- You look cute today.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,860
Are you wearing modern hanbok?

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,740
So Min, you came early.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,410
- You've been waiting.
- Hello.

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,840
Hello, Buddhist monk.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,750
- Welcome.
- Hello, Buddhist monk.

9
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,280
(Buddhist Monk Dong Hoon
at Running Temple)

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,870
- Hello.
- Welcome.

11
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,980
Your mind is water,
and water is your mind.

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,180
What does that mean?

13
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,480
- May you attain Buddhahood.
- Nice to meet you.

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,910
You've come a long way.

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,890
- Yes.
- All right.

16
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,120
Can we have some tea?

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,620
What is she doing?

18
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,200
(So Min makes a deep bow all of a sudden.)

19
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,000
(She even turns her palm up.)

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,130
Is this what you're supposed to do?

21
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,570
(She came to the temple
to treat her craziness.)

22
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,500
- So Min is good.
- Hello.

23
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,110
- I guess you're new here.
- Hello.

24
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,970
- You're here.
- Yes.

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,110
Hello, Yoo Jae Suk.

26
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,280
You are back after your ascetic practice.

27
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,450
Yes.

28
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,780
Do you even know what ascetic practice is?

29
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,280
I have no idea.

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,510
I'm Christian.

31
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,420
(I'm Christian.)

32
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,820
(A surprising twist
about Buddhist Monk Ha)

33
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,250
- Your mother is a minister.
- Right.

34
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,720
He is Christian.

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,400
I'm sorry, but I'm a deacon.

36
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,820
I'm a deacon.

37
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,820
(He practices religion somewhere else.)

38
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,120
I see.

39
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,760
Suk Jin has good news.

40
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,760
- That's right.
- It's the music charts.

41
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,900
He topped the music charts.

42
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,370
- I love the song.
- As soon as he arrived...

43
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,540
- He's the producer.
- As soon as he got here,

44
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,110
when the assistant
directors didn't even ask,

45
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,780
"I topped the music charts."

46
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,750
"I topped the music charts."

47
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,480
No one asked.

48
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,810
"We topped the charts."

49
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,680
- He called me at 10 p.m. yesterday.
- No one even asked.

50
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,920
- At 10 p.m.
- Really?

51
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,760
He sounded quite serious.

52
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,120
- "Jae Suk."
- Did he sound urgent?

53
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,790
"Yes?"

54
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
"Did you check the charts?"

55
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,290
(Suk Jin last night:
"Did you check the charts?")

56
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,060
- When you didn't even ask?
- Did he say that?

57
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,420
Hey.

58
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,170
- Why would you bring that up?
- Seriously?

59
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,000
- At 10 p.m.
- Was it that urgent?

60
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,140
I was going to the gym
after checking the charts.

61
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,140
- My gosh.
- I'm so happy for you.

62
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,040
- Congratulations, Suk Jin.
- This is great.

63
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,230
When you were on "How Do You Play?"
you got to show the process...

64
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,610
- of making the song.
- Right. It was a good promotion.

65
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,650
But this wasn't the case. You
promoted the song only on our show.

66
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,290
- That's right.
- We hardly promoted the song.

67
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,420
- Running Man made it popular.
- That's amazing.

68
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,260
- Is it because of Running Man?
- But...

69
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,310
the YouTube channel of
"How Do You Play?" introduced the song.

70
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,160
- It did?
- Yes.

71
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,260
We introduced it a little.

72
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,550
You're an investment genius.

73
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,390
- That's not true.
- Hang on.

74
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,730
- You made a profit.
- Hang on.

75
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,170
You keep trying to give
"How Do You Play?" credit for that.

76
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,540
You keep saying that.

77
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,970
You should step up.

78
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,330
- You're right.
- What can I say?

79
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,610
Running Man did the same thing.

80
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,380
- I mean...
- I'm grateful to Running Man.

81
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,640
I was trying to give
Running Man credit for that.

82
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,110
I thought Running Man
made the song popular.

83
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,770
But he suddenly said that
"How Do You Play?" helped too.

84
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,450
- But it's my opinion that counts.
- Of course.

85
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,260
- I'm more grateful to Running Man.
- Exactly.

86
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,360
I'm serious.

87
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,050
- Nice.
- I'm thankful to Running Man.

88
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,390
You played the entire song
during the opening.

89
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,660
Seriously, I even called
Bo Pil to thank him.

90
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,550
- You can't say that.
- Let's not pick sides.

91
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,790
Your new song was released at 6 p.m.

92
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,920
And our YouTube channel posted it...

93
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,990
- at 6 p.m. as well.
- Hang on.

94
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,440
Stop talking about it.

95
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,260
- Can't we just talk about our show?
- Let's just go with this.

96
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,010
Why do you keep talking about it
when no one knows?

97
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,540
Let me tell you one thing.

98
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,670
Let's fight.

99
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,170
The 2 of us are being criticized
on the 2 shows every week.

100
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,220
- I don't know what to do.
- You should just...

101
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,640
- stay quiet.
- Okay.

102
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,260
Jong Kook, Producer Park Chang Hoon
was born in 1977.

103
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,050
Really? He is a year younger than me.

104
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,190
(Really? He is a year younger than me.)

105
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,760
He should be aware of my power.

106
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,860
He does sound polite
when he talks about you.

107
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,320
He should know about me.

108
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,230
- He's from Anyang.
- We have another news.

109
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,260
Our captain attended the staff meeting.

110
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,640
- Congratulations.
- You're the captain.

111
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,170
That's right.

112
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,540
- He is the captain.
- Let me tell you...

113
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,910
how I felt at the meeting.

114
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,240
- There was nothing special.
- What did you do?

115
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,010
They just let me sit in the center.

116
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,290
(February 24, 2:00 p.m.,
SBS Running Man Meeting Room)

117
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,720
(Running Man's captain, Ji Suk Jin)

118
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,290
Gosh, this is...

119
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,390
Hello.

120
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,230
(Captain Ji enters.)

121
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,890
It says captain here.

122
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,890
- Who drew this?
- Yeon Ju did.

123
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,570
Yeon Ju, you're very talented.

124
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,920
Do you know who Yeon Ju is?

125
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,390
Hey, Yeon Ju... She's our writer.

126
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,730
(Writer Lee Yeon Ju has been
working on Running Man for 3 years.)

127
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,730
She must be our writer.

128
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,910
Thank you, Yeon Ju.

129
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,830
I feel really uncomfortable in this seat.

130
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,740
Next week, we will have...

131
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,110
Cha Jun Hwan.

132
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,110
- Is Cha Jun Hwan joining us?
- Yes.

133
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,880
- That's great.
- And Jin Ji Hee.

134
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,140
Jin Ji Hee?

135
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,790
What are they going to do?

136
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,020
(The first meeting is
off to a rocky start.)

137
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,830
You know what?

138
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,980
I thought about this meeting last night.

139
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,600
I gave serious thought
to the future of Running Man.

140
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,690
It's been 12 years. So I had this thought.

141
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,990
Whatever Running Man does
is what Running Man is.

142
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,730
Everything we do is Running Man.
I thought about it.

143
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,470
(That's how the captain started
talking about his philosophy.)

144
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,800
Here's what I thought.

145
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,540
We should find
what we don't have on Running Man.

146
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,350
What is it we don't have?
What do you think?

147
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,740
Yeon Ju, what do you think we don't have?

148
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,220
The writers of Running Man
need to take a break.

149
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,650
Everything we do is like a joke.

150
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,880
Right? It's just like a joke.

151
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,480
You should let us take care of it.

152
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,660
You don't have to come up
with new games every time.

153
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,960
Don't you think so?

154
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,750
We don't have to...

155
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,790
- play games every time.
- Right.

156
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,490
- Then what do we do?
- Like what?

157
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,690
We should think about it now.

158
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,790
(We should think about it now.)

159
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,170
(The meaningless meeting will be
revealed on our YouTube channel.)

160
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,930
So did you give your opinion?

161
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,130
Of course I did.

162
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,500
- What do we have for lunch today?
- Did you come up with a new idea?

163
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,840
What are we having for lunch?

164
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,410
- Lunch?
- Are we having lamb?

165
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
Well...

166
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,280
- You can look forward to it.
- You will be surprised.

167
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,920
- You can look forward to it.
- Really?

168
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,080
- What is it?
- Do we get our own lunch?

169
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,370
You should look forward to it.

170
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,720
Is it tteokbokki?

171
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,920
- It can't be sashimi.
- It will be nice.

172
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,380
It's nothing bad.
It should be really delicious.

173
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,250
For your information, it is
my mom's favorite dish.

174
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,550
- Is it a box lunch?
- A box lunch?

175
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,530
- It is a box lunch.
- A box lunch by your mother-in-law?

176
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,750
I bring this when I visit my mom.
This is her favorite.

177
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,970
- Really?
- It's eel.

178
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,230
My gosh.

179
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,620
- What is it?
- It's eel.

180
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,040
My gosh.

181
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,430
- It's eel, right?
- Per serving...

182
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,970
(It's eel, right?)

183
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,110
Per serving...

184
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,930
He's 100 percent sure.

185
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,170
- I just...
- How did you know?

186
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,580
- I just know him so well.
- He knows a lot about Suk Jin.

187
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,580
I know everything about him.

188
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,910
- He knows everything.
- You are just like Suk Jin.

189
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,810
Does he study me or what?

190
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,940
Do you tell him everything about you?

191
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,180
- I like eels.
- How much do you tell him?

192
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,310
- I know everything.
- I like the menu.

193
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,610
- Where?
- He's really good at this.

194
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,660
There are only a limited number
of dishes Suk Jin can come up with.

195
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,960
- And it's an eel in most cases.
- That's his favorite.

196
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,790
- It's an eel.
- Is it that Jae Suk is good...

197
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,460
or that Suk Jin is simple?

198
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,190
- How did you know?
- How did he know that?

199
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,920
We will begin today's race then.

200
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,100
We have guests today.

201
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,430
I know.

202
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,540
I know. I read articles about it.

203
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,930
Here are today's guests.

204
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,430
Is Jun Hwan coming?

205
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,980
Jun Hwan and Ji Hee.

206
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,300
- He's the prince.
- I know.

207
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,080
I'm nervous.

208
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,240
(I'm nervous.)

209
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,610
- I'm nervous.
- Were you nervous in the Olympics?

210
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,740
It wasn't this bad.

211
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,180
(It wasn't this bad.)

212
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,220
(And...)

213
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,520
My female friends called me
when they heard he would come.

214
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
He turned out so well.

215
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,420
At the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics,

216
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,990
he made new history
in men's figure skating.

217
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,100
He was amazing.

218
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,490
He's the figure prince, Cha Jun Hwan.

219
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,490
(Figure Prince Cha Jun Hwan)

220
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,130
- He's so cool.
- He's over there.

221
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,130
Where?

222
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,130
(He's over there.)

223
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,540
- Cha Jun Hwan.
- Jun Hwan.

224
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,300
(National figure skater, Cha Jun Hwan)

225
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,350
Welcome.

226
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,480
(The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics)

227
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,050
(The figure prince flew up beautifully.)

228
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,530
(The best score in the Korean
history of men's figure skating)

229
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,400
- That was perfect.
- He did it so well.

230
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,620
He did it. I knew he would make it.

231
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,000
(Korea's national figure skater,
Cha Jun Hwan)

232
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,110
(The figure prince is on Running Man.)

233
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,280
He's grown a lot.

234
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,650
Hello.

235
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,150
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

236
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,080
Suk Jin really bothers me.

237
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,780
- He hugs him right away.
- My gosh.

238
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,110
He's the prince.

239
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,920
Hello.

240
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,480
(The figure prince gets a warm reception.)

241
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,090
Hello.

242
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,360
He's the prince.

243
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,660
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hello.

244
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,290
- He really bothers me.
- Look over there.

245
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,460
Let's take a photo together.

246
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,620
- Hang on.
- What?

247
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,030
When Jun Hwan came in...

248
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,170
Suk Jin.

249
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,990
- Look over here.
- When Jun Hwan came in...

250
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,290
- Do you know what he did?
- What did he do?

251
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,340
He was like...

252
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
What are you talking about?

253
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,910
I did that because
he reminds me of my son.

254
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,170
- He's not your son.
- He's not your son.

255
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,210
He is a year older than my son.

256
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,580
My son was born in 2002.

257
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,740
- You were born in 2001, right?
- Yes.

258
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,410
You're just like my son.

259
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,980
- Your son?
- What?

260
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,040
I just adore him.

261
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,520
- Your son?
- Did you say your son?

262
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,720
- Don't say that.
- I just adore him.

263
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,550
- He's a national hero.
- You shouldn't talk too casually.

264
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,480
- You just want to be with him.
- You don't hug...

265
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,860
even your own son like that.

266
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,250
You're not his dad.

267
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,660
He's the worst.

268
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,670
- You don't even hug Hyun Woo.
- That's true.

269
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,190
- I knew it.
- It's fake.

270
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,430
He's the figure prince.

271
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,790
We have Cha Jun Hwan here.

272
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,230
(Figure Prince Cha Jun Hwan)

273
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,500
(He shows a lousy jump
to imitate Jun Hwan.)

274
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,240
- That's not right.
- I just can't do it.

275
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,550
This is what Jun Hwan does.

276
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,350
- Ina Bauer.
- You just look like Yoo Hyeok.

277
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,380
Jun Hwan, please say hello to our viewers.

278
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,750
Hello. I'm Cha Jun Hwan, a figure skater.

279
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,330
- This is crazy.
- He's so cool.

280
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,430
He looks like a painting.

281
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,520
- This is nice.
- He's very tall in the flesh.

282
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,990
- I know.
- He's really handsome.

283
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,200
- So...
- He turned out so well.

284
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,760
Jun Hwan looked like
a young boy until just recently.

285
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,260
He still has the innocent charm,

286
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,860
- but now he looks like a grown man.
- I agree.

287
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,030
- He looks mature.
- He's like a cartoon character.

288
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,710
- He's like a cartoon character.
- He is so cute.

289
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,030
How old are you?

290
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,450
I'm 22.

291
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,710
(He's 22 this year.)

292
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,110
- He's so young.
- I know.

293
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,050
- He's mature now.
- It's a beautiful age.

294
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,220
What is the age difference
between Suk Jin and him?

295
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,010
Is it like 40 years? No?

296
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,110
Hey.

297
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,650
- Isn't it 40 years?
- He's like his son.

298
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,750
Ji Hyo just said,

299
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,980
"He's 20 years younger than me."

300
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,230
It's not that bad.

301
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,060
- It's not 30 years.
- I agree.

302
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,260
I'm not sure if Ji Hyo remembers.

303
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,300
I met Jun Hwan...

304
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,360
- at an awards ceremony.
- I remember that too.

305
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,490
He said his ideal type was...

306
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,160
- Ji Hyo.
- He said Ji Hyo. Right.

307
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,000
Jun Hwan, I hear
your ideal type is right here.

308
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,210
- It's Ji Hyo sitting over there.
- Over there?

309
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,310
Ji Hyo?

310
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,410
(Jun Hwan confessed
that he was a big fan of Ji Hyo.)

311
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,550
Jun Hwan, I wish you were a little older.

312
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,220
I'll see you later.

313
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,090
Why is that?

314
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,190
The thing is,

315
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,150
I watch Running Man a lot.

316
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,090
She has her unexpected charms.

317
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,360
- I see.
- She does.

318
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,730
We should let Ji Hyo
kick him in the buttocks.

319
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,620
He should spend some time with her.

320
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,490
- Or she should throw him down.
- Or his hair.

321
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,860
- She should grab him by the hair.
- Exactly.

322
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,070
- That's her unexpected charm.
- By the way,

323
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,340
I heard you were glad
when you were invited to our show.

324
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,370
Yes, I was.

325
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,480
I've always wanted to join Running Man.

326
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,550
I loved this show as a kid.

327
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,720
This is what we often hear...

328
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,610
- from our guests these days.
- What?

329
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,720
They don't say,
"I enjoy watching this show."

330
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,930
"I used to watch this show
when I was little."

331
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:34,930
That's true.

332
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,490
That means
we've done this for a long time.

333
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,620
- It's been so long.
- It must feel surreal to you.

334
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,070
Why would you talk to him like that?

335
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,200
What's wrong with you?

336
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,760
- Don't be ridiculous.
- What's with you?

337
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
- Hey.
- My gosh.

338
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,860
He's unbelievable.

339
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,340
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry, Jun Hwan.

340
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,340
- He watched our show as a kid.
- Even I don't talk down to him.

341
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,480
He's a hero.

342
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,640
- He's a Running Man kid.
- Stop it.

343
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,370
- This is embarrassing.
- I'm ashamed.

344
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,610
Just because he's a Running Man kid
doesn't mean he likes you.

345
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,270
- You should know that.
- I'm not that old.

346
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,590
- He's like an embarrassing uncle.
- What's your problem?

347
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,910
- I was just so excited.
- Who was your favorite member?

348
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,110
She was my favorite.

349
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,280
- I guess he liked only Ji Hyo.
- Who else?

350
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,880
- Who was your favorite male member?
- You didn't like Suk Jin, right?

351
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,650
- Of course not.
- Who was your favorite male member?

352
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,230
- I liked Jae Suk.
- I knew it.

353
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,890
- I loved the Yoo-mes Bond special.
- He called you by your name.

354
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,360
- There were two episodes.
- Yes.

355
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,600
He called you by your name
like a big brother.

356
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,130
- I'm jealous.
- Of course. We've met before.

357
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,900
Jun Hwan and I know each other.

358
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,340
- Well, he calls me by my name too.
- He didn't mention Suk Jin.

359
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,080
- What was Suk Jin's ranking?
- I'm curious about it too.

360
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,630
He's like your uncle, right?

361
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,770
- You don't have to answer that.
- He's like my father.

362
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,770
Right. He's like your father.

363
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,680
- That's true. I'm like his dad.
- His father?

364
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,350
It's okay. You can treat us all
like big brothers.

365
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,370
(I'm like his dad.)

366
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,380
It's okay. You can treat us all
like big brothers on a TV show.

367
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,280
- Treat us all like big brothers.
- Why are you so disappointed?

368
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,460
- He seems so disappointed.
- Look at his face.

369
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,220
He couldn't hide his feelings.

370
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,380
(He couldn't hide
his disappointment at all.)

371
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,480
Aren't you the one...

372
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,590
- who acted so confident earlier?
- I'm okay.

373
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,700
- "Hey, come over here."
- It's just the beginning.

374
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,730
I'm fine.

375
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,800
(The captain of Running Man's
popularity rating is quite low.)

376
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,390
- He pushed himself too hard.
- He can't hide his feelings.

377
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,200
All right. We've met our guest Jun Hwan.

378
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,570
- I believe we have another guest.
- That's right.

379
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,260
The other guest has met Jun Hwan before.

380
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,680
- Let's watch the video first.
- Haven't they kept in touch?

381
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,110
- Let's watch.
- I watched this.

382
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,110
Hello. I'm Cha Jun Hwan,
and I'm 11 years old.

383
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,110
- My, how adorable.
- Hello.

384
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,690
- I'm Bbangkku Ttongkku Jin Ji Hee.
- She's so cute.

385
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,110
It's nice to meet you all.

386
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,460
(Jun Hwan and Ji Hee appeared in
a figure skating variety show...)

387
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,460
(11 years ago.)

388
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,460
- He's so cute.
- Oh, my.

389
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,780
(The 2 of them appeared on
the same show 11 years ago.)

390
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,800
- She's so cute.
- She's really cute.

391
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,300
- How adorable.
- Do you remember this, Jun Hwan?

392
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,730
- Do you?
- Yes, I do.

393
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,470
Did you know that I was Bbangkku Ttongkku?

394
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,940
No.

395
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,260
She's so cute. Look at Ji Hee.

396
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,570
That's weird.

397
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,260
Those who live in Korea,
but don't know my character are all pies.

398
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,400
She said, "pies".

399
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,270
- "Pies"?
- What are you talking about?

400
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,480
- You mean, "spies", right?
- Right. That's what I meant to say.

401
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,480
- Pies are delicious.
- Do you remember that?

402
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,740
This is fun to watch.

403
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,010
They're so cute.

404
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,450
Jun Hwan, do you remember that?

405
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,980
Yes, I remember that vaguely.

406
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,360
He looks just as he did then.

407
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,380
That's interesting.

408
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,590
Oh, no. Wait.

409
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,480
Ji Hee was leading the team
as she was older than him.

410
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,960
Oh, my. They're so cute.

411
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,100
- Gosh. Did she twist her leg?
- Oh, no.

412
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,930
Are you okay? Do you think
you can walk just a few steps?

413
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,390
- I can't.
- Try to stand up.

414
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,470
Let's take a break over there.

415
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,100
He's taking care of her.

416
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,340
I twisted my ankle.

417
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,730
(Jun Hwan was Ji Hee's teacher
as she hadn't tried figure skating.)

418
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,210
Are you okay? Can you continue practicing?

419
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,270
- They're so cute.
- Indeed.

420
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,310
(Lifting him up)

421
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,310
They're really cute.

422
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,110
(The koala lift,
a contrarian figure skating move)

423
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,110
They're so cute.

424
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,010
(Laughing)

425
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,280
- They're so cute.
- Indeed.

426
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,780
That was cute.

427
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,060
They're so cute. My goodness.

428
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,150
(The 2 of them were loved so much
by the viewers.)

429
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,800
- They're both so adorable.
- They're really cute.

430
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,430
- They both grew well.
- Right?

431
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,800
- You haven't changed at all.
- Indeed.

432
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,970
They haven't changed at all.

433
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,120
- They haven't...
- I'm jealous.

434
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,760
- Now, Ji Hee, please come out.
- She's coming out.

435
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,660
- What's going on?
- Where is Ji Hee?

436
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,360
- Now, Ji Hee, please come out.
- What's going on?

437
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,400
(They haven't seen each other
for the past 11 years since then.)

438
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,740
- Ji Hee.
- She's coming down the stairs.

439
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,140
Hello.

440
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,210
(Jin Ji Hee, age 13, actress)

441
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,110
(She was a cheerful child back then.)

442
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,780
(They will meet each other again
after 11 years.)

443
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,060
- She looks so pretty.
- What's this?

444
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,320
- She hasn't changed either.
- Hi, Ji Hee.

445
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,750
What's this?

446
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,960
(Rome-hee Jin Ji Hee
and Jun-liet Cha Jun Hwan)

447
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,480
What's this?

448
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,490
(They met each other again as adults.)

449
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,700
- Ji Hee.
- Oh, my. What is this?

450
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,890
- Hello, everyone.
- Ji Hee.

451
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,760
- We met her four months ago.
- Right.

452
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,300
But she looks very different today.

453
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,130
- I'm back.
- She's all dressed up today.

454
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,210
- You look so pretty today.
- Can you do that pose for us?

455
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,400
- Ji Hee.
- I just watched that video too.

456
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,710
- Oh, that's why.
- Yes.

457
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,850
- As if she'd popped out of there.
- Exactly.

458
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,320
She's so cute.

459
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,740
(I can show, yo)

460
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,220
I can show, yo

461
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,590
(The old man got excited
and started singing.)

462
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,230
- I can show, yo
- What are you doing?

463
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,620
- That was funny. I liked it.
- Right?

464
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,020
- It was good.
- I can show, yo

465
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,470
- I mean, the two of them...
- Exactly.

466
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,840
- still look just the same...
- They look so lovely.

467
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,890
- I'm embarrassed.
- They look so lovely.

468
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,100
It's as if they have popped out of
the screen.

469
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,760
- Exactly.
- Please strike this pose again.

470
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,130
- But...
- Please do it for us.

471
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,230
- They're very young.
- Yes.

472
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,900
But... We met for the first time
in many years.

473
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

474
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,350
(But... We met for the first time
in many years. Hello.)

475
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,270
(They bowed politely.)

476
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,740
- What was that?
- Why did they bow to each other?

477
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,180
- "Hello."
- Why did they bow to each other?

478
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,480
(The members are taken aback
as they greet each other awkwardly.)

479
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,720
- Let's shake hands.
- Okay.

480
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,560
- Haven't they met in a while?
- Hey...

481
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,190
When you two were eating together
in the video,

482
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,060
- You two looked so close.
- you looked like best friends.

483
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,490
- They joked around with each other.
- Right.

484
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,020
- What happened?
- Haven't you met in a long time?

485
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,700
- We haven't met in 11 years.
- Really?

486
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,700
- You didn't keep in touch either?
- No.

487
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,100
Why didn't you stay in touch
with each other?

488
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,860
- You lost touch with each other.
- We don't have each other's number.

489
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,360
- I see.
- That's understandable, but...

490
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,180
- Since they were little kids then,
- It's understandable.

491
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,710
they could've exchanged numbers
without worrying about others.

492
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,270
- I'm here to get his number today.
- Really?

493
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,550
- They're awkward around each other.
- By the way,

494
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,480
- They're awkward around each other.
- as we talked about it earlier,

495
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,780
- Ji Hee came here four months ago.
- Yes, she did.

496
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,610
- But she looks different today.
- Indeed.

497
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,060
- She looks very different.
- She looks calm and graceful.

498
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,730
- Last time, she dressed casually.
- Right.

499
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,750
Today, she dressed so nicely.

500
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,200
- She's all dressed up.
- Yes.

501
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,100
- She looks a bit different today.
- She looks different.

502
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,600
- She paid extra attention.
- Yes.

503
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,070
- I tried to look stylish.
- I see.

504
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,890
- I can tell.
- They're awkward around each other.

505
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,340
- But...
- Don't you remember it, Ji Hee?

506
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,400
Of course, I do. The video clips
from the show went viral,

507
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,680
so I've been watching them.
They brought back old memories.

508
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,980
How much older is Ji Hee than Jun Hwan?

509
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,180
May I ask how old you are?

510
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,080
Oh, my. She's awkward around him.

511
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,550
(They use honorifics
when talking to each other now.)

512
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,480
- What's going on?
- This isn't what I expected.

513
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,610
Jun Hwan is 22.

514
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,590
- I thought they'd hug excitedly.
- Exactly.

515
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,780
I was excited to see them reunite,
but that wasn't what I expected.

516
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,120
- "How have you been?" Like this.
- You see,

517
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,360
- you need to understand them...
- Yes.

518
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,020
because they haven't seen each other
for the past 11 years since then.

519
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,760
- Right. It must be awkward.
- Yes. Of course.

520
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,300
- It's natural.
- It's because So Min usually...

521
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,070
hugs a guest so excitedly
even when he's just an acquaintance.

522
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,110
- She hugs him and spins around.
- So Min...

523
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,940
So Min wouldn't just walk toward him.

524
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,480
"Hey."

525
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,980
She would hold him tightly
and spin around.

526
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,770
She would hop
as if she were on a Pogo stick.

527
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,820
She would be so excited.

528
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,510
She always does that.

529
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,690
While watching TV, I go like,
"Gosh. What's with her?"

530
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,190
- It happened many times.
- That's how I show my affection.

531
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,060
I would be even more excited
if I ran into Jong Kook.

532
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,060
- Really?
- Of course.

533
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,280
She'd definitely do that
if she ran into you in real life.

534
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,690
- Of course.
- Oh, I see.

535
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,020
In fact, they told us how they felt.

536
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,990
But they talked to each other
only when they greeted.

537
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,200
They won't even make eye contact.

538
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,390
They're still awkward around each other.

539
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,990
- They feel awkward.
- But it's understandable.

540
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,840
We saw you two in the video. Ji Hee,

541
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,130
- what was Jun Hwan like back then?
- Yes.

542
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,680
He was a strict teacher.

543
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,050
- But he was kind at the same time.
- I see.

544
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,510
He was so strict when he taught me...

545
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,550
- I see.
- while we were practicing.

546
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,240
They met each other after many years
like in a drama.

547
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,590
Personally, I wish...

548
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,180
- they could be...
- You met Eunhyuk again here.

549
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,210
- But...
- Forget about it.

550
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,590
- Isn't this just like in a drama?
- Why didn't you get excited...

551
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,720
- when Eunhyuk came on the show?
- That was totally different.

552
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,260
- You two went to the same school.
- Exactly.

553
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,890
But their situation is more dramatic.

554
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,500
Actually, when it was reported
that I was going to be on this show,

555
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,430
- all my female friends called me.
- Of course.

556
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,740
- Yes.
- What did they say?

557
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,670
They told me how jealous they were,

558
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,700
and asked me to tell Jun Hwan
that they were his fans.

559
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,140
- Relay their messages?
- Yes.

560
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,870
- I see.
- He has a lot of fans.

561
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,640
- Both of you...
- They grew up well.

562
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,550
- Exactly.
- I'm not sure how this may sound,

563
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,610
- but you two grew up so well.
- I agree.

564
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,820
- Yes.
- They grew up to be decent people.

565
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,090
Their parents must be so happy.

566
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,150
Some of us don't look
as handsome as we were as kids.

567
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,150
- Don't say who they are.
- Okay.

568
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,150
- Some of us did.
- Okay. We'll keep it a secret.

569
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,890
- I looked better when I was a kid.
- That's not true.

570
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,270
- I looked so cute as a kid.
- You...

571
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,270
You look so much better than before.

572
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,340
- I mean, when I was a little kid...
- We all looked cute as a kid.

573
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,000
Take a look at everyone's old photo.
We all looked cute as a kid.

574
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,340
- Really? I've never seen yours.
- Yes.

575
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,110
- Jong Kook also...
- I was really cute as a little boy.

576
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,630
- Really?
- He looked like a prankster.

577
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,010
Se Chan became more handsome
as he grew up.

578
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,870
You looked so cute
in your old photo though.

579
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,750
When I was a little boy,
my mouth stuck out more.

580
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,110
I'm relieved that I had it fixed.

581
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,470
- Is that true?
- It stuck out this much.

582
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,590
Were you a bird?

583
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,790
Exactly. Just like a beak.

584
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,290
- You had a beak?
- It looked like a beak.

585
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,110
There are couches here
for us to sit down, right?

586
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,490
- Shall we sit down?
- Shall we?

587
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,880
Oh, I see.

588
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,330
- We should've sat down earlier.
- Please sit.

589
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,330
- Let's all sit down.
- You can sit here.

590
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,760
There might not be enough room
for all of us.

591
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,330
- Good.
- Oh, my.

592
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,000
- Right.
- I'll tell you about the rules.

593
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,070
Okay.

594
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,740
Before the race begins,
each member will...

595
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,630
- receive 100 dollars.
- That's a lot.

596
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,840
And Suk Jin will receive
extra 100 dollars on top of it.

597
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,670
- It's good to be the captain.
- Captain Ji.

598
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,670
- That's great.
- Oh, my.

599
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,110
- Only for the captain.
- I wish I were the captain.

600
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,670
- You're lying.
- What a shame.

601
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,710
The person who has the most money
left at the end will win the race.

602
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,090
I'll definitely win the race.

603
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,360
Out of the money you'll be given,

604
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,790
write down the amount you want to
give to Jun Hwan and Ji Hee...

605
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,690
as an allowance, and we'll give them
without revealing the amount.

606
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,830
- Well... I'm afraid...
- They won't know the amount?

607
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,690
- Correct.
- they will be disappointed in us.

608
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,840
I'm pretty sure we won't get
a lot of money.

609
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,070
- We should give them enough money.
- How much will we receive?

610
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,400
You'll receive 100 dollars,
and you can give down to 1 dollar.

611
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,240
- I see.
- We can give down to one dollar?

612
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,970
- I have 200 dollars, right?
- That's correct.

613
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,850
- You see,
- Can I split a dollar?

614
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,350
we just have to make sure they have
as much money as we have.

615
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,210
- Since they're our guests,
- You mean, the total amount?

616
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,490
we should be generous.

617
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,020
- If each gives ten dollars to him,
- Ten dollars from each of us.

618
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,260
- he'll get 70 dollars.
- It should be at least 10 dollars.

619
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,030
Hold on. Ten dollars from each...

620
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,720
This is the first round.
It's just the beginning.

621
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,030
- We shouldn't be too stingy...
- He'll give them only ten cents.

622
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,890
We can't split one dollar.

623
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,420
- Listen to me.
- Can you use it wisely?

624
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,570
- Of course. I'm thrifty.
- You're wrong about that.

625
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,570
I'll give each of them
more than ten dollars.

626
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,630
- Really?
- Yes, I will.

627
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,170
How much do you want
as an allowance, Jun Hwan?

628
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,700
- Tell me.
- Two hundred dollars.

629
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,010
Two hundred dollars?

630
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,670
Hey, don't be too greedy.

631
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,710
That's all I have.

632
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,250
I think this is a reasonable amount.

633
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,210
- Hand it in if you're done.
- Jong Kook...

634
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,680
Jong Kook looks like a PE teacher.

635
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,090
- Me? I see.
- He really looks like a PE teacher.

636
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,450
He looks like a coach.

637
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,560
- I think he can coach me.
- I look like a coach, right?

638
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,260
He totally looks like a coach.

639
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,220
- Okay.
- I wrote a reasonable amount.

640
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,500
- Give me a second.
- Right.

641
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,770
- You should be generous.
- Gosh. I gave them...

642
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,770
- They're our guests.
- I...

643
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,810
- Ji Hee and Jun Hwan are here.
- Exactly.

644
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,040
Don't be so stingy.

645
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,840
It's not even real money. It's R money.

646
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,080
Gosh, he's such a weakling.
He's still contemplating.

647
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
(Captain Ji who has 200 dollars
has made up his mind as well.)

648
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,850
We've tallied the amount
that each member gave away.

649
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,820
The two guests will begin the race...

650
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,440
- with the money they gave them.
- I bet you'll get a lot of money.

651
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,790
- Isn't this your first time?
- I think so.

652
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,260
We prepared today's race
for Jun Hwan and Ji Hee...

653
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,880
who met again after 11 years
as all Koreans hoped.

654
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,800
It's Because This Is
My First Time to Be a Captain.

655
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,860
- I see.
- Are they team captains?

656
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,390
As you could assume,
Jun Hwan and Ji Hee will be...

657
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,620
the captain of each team.

658
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,930
(They'll be the captains of each of
the team of 5 and the team of 4.)

659
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,930
The members will be divided into
2 teams of 4 and 5 members.

660
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,840
Starting with the captain
with a smaller amount of allowance,

661
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,080
- they will recruit members 1 by 1.
- Okay.

662
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,470
The one with less money will go first?

663
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,610
Before that,

664
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,710
We'll reveal the seven numbers
for each guest.

665
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,550
- What?
- What do you mean by that?

666
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,750
(The members are taken aback
as the amounts will be revealed.)

667
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,910
- We won't reveal your names.
- Really?

668
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,260
- Yes.
- Of course.

669
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,420
(Only the amount of money given by
the 7 members will be revealed.)

670
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,650
- Show me.
- This is for you, Ji Hee.

671
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,890
- Thank you.
- Oh, gosh.

672
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,720
- Thirty dollars, one dollar...
- Who gave away only one dollar?

673
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,920
- Who gave him 2 dollars?
- Only 1 dollar? I can't believe it.

674
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,480
(Ji Hee's allowance:
lowest 1 dollar, highest 20 dollars)

675
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,980
Only one dollar? That's so mean.

676
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,590
- Who gave him 2 dollars?
- Only 1 dollar? I can't believe it.

677
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,960
- Who did that?
- Only two dollars?

678
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,260
- That's so mean.
- I can't believe it.

679
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,140
- Two people gave me one dollar.
- My gosh.

680
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,640
- Gosh, 1 dollar? And 2 dollars?
- Seriously.

681
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,970
(Jun Hwan's allowance, which is also
shocking, has been revealed too.)

682
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,380
(Jun Hwan's allowance:
lowest 1 dollar, highest 30 dollars)

683
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,110
(Even Captain Cha who participated
in the Olympics didn't get much.)

684
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,800
- Only one dollar? Are you serious?
- Seriously.

685
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,340
Those who gave away only one dollar...

686
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,650
- should be isolated.
- I agree.

687
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,080
- That's not right.
- Hey, guys.

688
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,580
- Don't even speak to them.
- Exactly.

689
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,580
- Unbelievable.
- Indeed. I can't believe them.

690
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,660
- It's embarrassing.
- Gosh, seriously.

691
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,050
- Who gave away only 1 dollar?
- Gosh, only 1 dollar?

692
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,520
Based on the different amounts,

693
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,560
you can guess who gave you more
and recruit that person.

694
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,370
Ji Hee who received less money will
go first.

695
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,560
Choose one person you want on your team.

696
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,180
I wonder who gave me 20 dollars.

697
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,710
Oh, 20 dollars?

698
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,220
(She's trying to figure out who gave
her the largest amount.)

699
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,980
(I did.)

700
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,280
Hello, Buddhist monk.

701
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,390
(The little Buddhist monk claims
that he donated 20 dollars.)

702
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,580
- Buddhist monk, hello.
- Your mind is water.

703
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,360
- And water is your mind.
- Please stay seated.

704
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,930
I'll tell you honestly.
I gave you ten dollars.

705
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,970
- It's true.
- I like your honesty.

706
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,230
I gave you 20 dollars.

707
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,230
- That's a lie.
- I gave her ten dollars.

708
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,290
I gave you 20 dollars.

709
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,260
Think about it. I had 200 dollars.

710
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,870
- Ji Hee, please choose a member.
- Okay. I'll choose one.

711
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,910
I choose...

712
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,440
(Captain Jin Ji Hee will choose
her 1st team member.)

713
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
I choose...

714
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,480
(Who will Ji Hee choose?)

715
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,880
I choose Ji Hyo.

716
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,980
- What?
- Oh, I see.

717
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,890
- Ji Hyo.
- What?

718
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,460
- Why did you choose her?
- Did you see Jun Hwan's face?

719
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,390
- He looked upset for a moment.
- "That's a shame."

720
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,780
- But Ji Hee...
- I guess you don't know about them.

721
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,700
Ji Hee, why would you create...

722
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,230
- a situation like this?
- You can't do that.

723
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,990
People become more affectionate
when they're separated.

724
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,790
- Even so...
- That's harsh.

725
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,590
(If Ji Hyo is on Ji Hee's team,
I'll probably...)

726
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,370
Look how happy So Min is. That's so funny.

727
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,370
Look how happy So Min is.

728
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,270
- No, it's not like that.
- Look at her.

729
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,610
If Jun Hwan doesn't pick...

730
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,800
- So Min either...
- I hope so.

731
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,180
That's the best-case scenario.

732
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,720
He'll never pick So Min.

733
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,920
- "Let's destroy it."
- Jun Hwan won't...

734
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,150
- Jun Hwan, I gave you 20 dollars.
- Jun Hwan won't pick her.

735
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,420
- Jun Hwan...
- You just pointed two dollars.

736
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,420
No.

737
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,580
- This is me, I'm telling you.
- I bet she gave him one dollar.

738
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,690
Next, Jun Hwan, it's your turn.

739
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,900
I wonder who he will choose.

740
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,820
- I lost her.
- You feel pressured, right?

741
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,590
(What could be Captain Cha's choice?)

742
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,490
- Well...
- You know who gave you 30 dollars.

743
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,900
One of them gave you thirty dollars,
and one of them gave you one dollar.

744
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,110
- I gave him 10 dollars.
- Only 1 dollar.

745
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,610
- I wonder...
- I really gave you 20 dollars.

746
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,410
- I gave you 10 dollars.
- I wonder who gave me 30 dollars.

747
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,910
- He gave you ten dollars.
- Isn't that obvious, Jun Hwan?

748
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,240
Who else could it be?

749
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,300
Then I'll choose...

750
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:09,220
(Jun Hwan's fans are nervous.)

751
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,620
- Jae Suk.
- Of course.

752
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,460
- I knew it. Mister, move.
- You shouldn't have picked him.

753
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,320
(They feel bitter.)

754
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,250
- Mister, move.
- You shouldn't have picked him.

755
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,630
- Come on. Mister, move.
- Hey, Jun Hwan.

756
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,230
I gave you a big hug when you came in.

757
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,590
- I welcomed you so affectionately.
- I knew he'd pick me.

758
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,970
- I can pick more members.
- I knew it.

759
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,090
He's not the only member on my team.

760
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,230
- Oh, my. Because you can pick more?
- He could've...

761
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,800
He could've picked So Min,
but he picked me.

762
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
So Min is...

763
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,000
- He chose him over me.
- I feel bad for you.

764
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,800
- I hope Ji Hee will pick So Min.
- I mean...

765
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,980
- He picked...
- Ji Hee, it's your turn.

766
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,380
He picked Jae Suk without
considering the gender ratio.

767
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,810
- Well...
- Ji Hee...

768
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,540
Because I like honest people,

769
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,220
- I'll pick Jong Kook.
- Okay.

770
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,780
Good. That's great. Nice.

771
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,780
(It's not hard to see which members
the captains avoid recruiting.)

772
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,780
Why do they...

773
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,520
- I think...
- Hey, seriously.

774
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,790
Can you two still not see?

775
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,130
- Pardon?
- Who do you think gave you...

776
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,490
more than ten dollars?

777
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,990
I had 200 dollars, you know.

778
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,900
- Try to think rationally, Jun Hwan.
- Oh, he had more money than we did.

779
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,200
- He's looking at Suk Jin now.
- He had more money than we did.

780
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,110
- Be honest with me. How much?
- Twenty dollars isn't a lot.

781
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,140
- Me?
- Yes.

782
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,830
Thirty dollars.

783
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,710
- I honestly gave you 20 dollars.
- I gave you 30 dollars.

784
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,940
- It's true.
- It's not a lie.

785
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,910
- I...
- He's still very young.

786
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:12,010
"I..." Captain Cha seems to have
made up his mind.

787
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,920
- Okay.
- He'll announce his decision.

788
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,240
(Captain Ji said he had given him
30 dollars.)

789
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,250
(So Min said she had given him
20 dollars.)

790
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,890
Then I will pick...

791
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,730
Se Chan.

792
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,790
Oh, my. I'm impressed.

793
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,170
Thank you.

794
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,400
(He picked Se Chan.)

795
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
(Jun Hwan is so good at creating a twist.)

796
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,330
- What a twist.
- That was good.

797
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,800
- Jun Hwan.
- This is great.

798
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,500
- Hey, come with me.
- What a twist.

799
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
- Good job.
- Come over here.

800
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,000
- While looking in this direction...
- I gave him 20 dollars.

801
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,480
- You know how to make a show funny.
- I gave him 20 dollars.

802
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,620
- While looking that way,
- Hold on.

803
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,120
- But he chose me.
- he said, "I'll choose Se Chan."

804
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,480
- Can I...
- He must've watched the show often.

805
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,120
- get my money back?
- Whoever gave you more money...

806
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,980
- Can I get my money back?
- because he or she felt bad.

807
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,390
- No.
- So Min...

808
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,080
- Ji Hee.
- I mean, I gave him 20 dollars...

809
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,460
- How could he...
- That was so unexpected.

810
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,460
I can't believe you.

811
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,990
- Look at So Min.
- Hey.

812
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,090
Look at her.

813
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,170
- What are you doing?
- Don't pick So Min.

814
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:02,990
So Min...

815
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,470
Next up is Captain Jin.

816
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,140
- It's my turn now, right?
- Yes.

817
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,500
- She wrote, "It was me."
- Right.

818
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,000
- We have no choice.
- Hey, Ji Hee.

819
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,110
What's the largest amount?

820
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,410
- Twenty dollars.
- But...

821
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,410
- That's me.
- Honestly...

822
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,740
- Did you really give me 20 dollars?
- Yes.

823
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,310
- Why not?
- Then I've made up my mind.

824
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,720
(Then I've made up my mind.)

825
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,510
- Who?
- I'll choose Haha.

826
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,750
Thank you.

827
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,730
- I'll do my best.
- That was good.

828
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,320
- Okay.
- That's great.

829
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,790
- That was funny.
- Good job.

830
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,860
- It was good.
- They grew up well.

831
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,230
- They're talented.
- Thank you for growing up well.

832
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,260
- Jun Hwan, you're really talented.
- Thank you.

833
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,440
The members who haven't been picked
are So Min and...

834
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,000
Just the two of us.

835
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,440
- I'm impressed.
- I mean...

836
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,330
How did I end up like this? I regret
giving him 20 dollars.

837
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,730
What happens to the last person remaining?

838
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,340
- That person will join that team.
- Automatically?

839
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,740
Oh, that member will be on the other team.

840
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,240
- Her team has five members.
- I see.

841
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,980
- Oh, and we have four members?
- Jun Hwan, just do as you want.

842
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,080
- Right. Just do as you want.
- I'll choose...

843
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,980
(The last member to join
Jun Hwan's team is...)

844
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,860
(I choose So Min.)

845
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,250
I choose So Min.

846
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,990
(Laughing)

847
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,490
Oh, my. Aren't you adorable?

848
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,870
He looks happy.

849
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,990
- He's happy.
- He's just adorable.

850
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,990
- Suk Jin...
- Then Suk Jin,

851
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,910
- you'll be the weak link.
- He's a weak link?

852
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,330
- He's a weak link?
- Isn't he our captain?

853
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,480
Am I the captain or the weak link?

854
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,480
- The captain is the weak link.
- This is ridiculous.

855
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,800
- I mean, I'm the captain.
- Will you be a weak captain?

856
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,010
Oh, we're eight people without him.

857
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,270
Suk Jin, aren't you the captain
of Running Man?

858
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,270
A weak captain.

859
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,220
I'm the captain and the weak link
at the same time.

860
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,980
We'll give you your allowances now.

861
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,980
We'll let you check the names.
Please take it off.

862
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,480
- What? Is it written underneath?
- They'll know...

863
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,730
- They'll check the names?
- They'll know... Oh, no.

864
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,430
- I guess they'll see.
- Are their names written here?

865
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,790
- I really gave you 20 dollars.
- That hurts my feelings.

866
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,870
Exactly.

867
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,870
- I wasn't lying.
- No.

868
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,700
- Hold on.
- I gave you 20 dollars.

869
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,730
I knew it was Se Chan
who had given her one dollar.

870
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,210
- Right.
- Suk Jin wasn't lying.

871
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,910
- Oh, I see.
- See?

872
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,540
(The weak link really gave her
20 dollars.)

873
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,710
- That's right.
- See?

874
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,220
So Min gave him 20 dollars.

875
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,510
She really gave him 20 dollars.

876
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,220
I really gave him 20 dollars.

877
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,690
- She really gave him 20 dollars.
- Exactly.

878
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,780
- This is unexpected.
- Suk Jin gave him 30 dollars.

879
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,080
- Yes, I gave him 30 dollars.
- Oh, man.

880
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,220
(Se Chan was the one
who gave Captain Cha 1 dollar.)

881
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,250
- That's what we do...
- Hey, Se Chan.

882
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,390
- I'm disappointed.
- at the beginning of the show.

883
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,790
- I can't believe him.
- That's how it works, Jun Hwan.

884
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,790
(Embarrassed)

885
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,900
Gosh. Se Chan, how could you
give her only one dollar? It's...

886
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,090
- Se Chan.
- Hey.

887
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,370
Se Chan, how could you give her
only one dollar?

888
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,790
- Come on, Ji Hyo.
- Se Chan, how could you...

889
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,970
- give her only...
- Ji Hyo, Se Chan came over here.

890
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,230
- I'm on this side now.
- Right. I'm sorry.

891
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,270
- You do know Haha's name, right?
- I'm here, Ji Hyo.

892
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,500
Haha, how could you...

893
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,910
- give her only 1 dollar?
- Yes, I gave her 1 dollar.

894
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,810
Monk Ha, shouldn't you try to
let go of attachment?

895
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,390
- Well... Life is...
- This is unexpected.

896
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,510
- It hurts.
- Ji Hee, see how it turns out.

897
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,080
As always, we got an offer
for a product placement...

898
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,890
that will help us get more money
for making the show.

899
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,320
It's a fried chicken brand.

900
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,730
- Oh, I see.
- Really?

901
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,790
Please have it for breakfast...

902
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,900
Fried chicken is the best food
for breakfast.

903
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,400
while I'm explaining the rules.

904
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,990
- But Haha is modeling for...
- Yes.

905
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,640
Exactly. It was hard for us
to decide what to do about it.

906
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,230
Haha is the face of
another fried chicken brand.

907
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,000
- I made the decision.
- But Suk Jin gave us...

908
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,710
a wise solution like King Solomon.

909
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,070
- What was the solution?
- That's right.

910
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,740
Suk Jin, we'll do
a product placement that day.

911
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,410
- What kind of product is it?
- It's a fried chicken brand.

912
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,120
- I see.
- But we have a problem.

913
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,450
We get the most offers from
fried chicken brands, but Haha...

914
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,740
We don't know how to make it
look natural without Haha.

915
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,220
How should we exclude Haha?

916
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,860
Won't he exclude himself
of his own accord?

917
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,460
Right? He'll exclude himself
of his own accord.

918
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,630
I mean...

919
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,200
- Was that your idea?
- It was...

920
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,760
- It was the captain's idea.
- It was your idea?

921
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,060
- It was Captain Ji's idea.
- I see.

922
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,590
- You see...
- He should exclude himself.

923
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,970
- That's right.
- He's modeling for another brand.

924
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,290
- Anyway...
- Don't worry about me.

925
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,730
I started eating only raw grains
and vegetables.

926
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,530
(Monk Ha would quit eating meat
for money.)

927
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,910
I don't eat boiled food anymore.

928
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,980
- Maybe I should shave my head too.
- I don't eat deep-fried food.

929
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,720
- That makes him look so funny.
- Indeed. He looks so funny.

930
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,220
Haha, please step out for a while.

931
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,690
- Haha, you should go.
- Exclude yourself.

932
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,580
Watch us from afar.

933
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,890
You can watch us, right?

934
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,780
- My, it smells so good.
- Oh, my.

935
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,730
- Look at that.
- My, it looks so delicious.

936
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,630
- Oh, my.
- The pros are gathering.

937
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,900
- It looks so good.
- My goodness.

938
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,370
- It smells incredibly good.
- What's this?

939
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,060
- Is it fried chicken?
- Let's eat.

940
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,170
- This looks incredible.
- Thank you.

941
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,440
So this is how they do
fried chicken these days.

942
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,790
Are you letting us eat right off the bat?

943
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,000
(The sight of protein
excites Trainer Kook.)

944
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,300
- Is it good?
- This...

945
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,180
- If I may say so...
- This one's too cold.

946
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,270
(The youngsters aren't familiar
with product placement.)

947
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,380
It writes history
in the fried chicken industry.

948
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,010
- They look delicious.
- Is it good?

949
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,390
How can you say that
without tasting any of them?

950
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,310
They look incredible.

951
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,780
(They look delicious.)

952
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,250
- This looks amazing.
- Can I have a drumstick?

953
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,580
Fried chicken.

954
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,790
You must be on the fence
about ordering some right about now.

955
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,900
What?

956
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,400
Let us try some for you.

957
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,730
The client wanted Jae Suk
and Jong Kook to enjoy it.

958
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,970
My goodness!

959
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,470
All right. Dig in, everyone.

960
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,910
- Fried chicken.
- My gosh.

961
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,110
If you're going to have dinner,

962
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,210
I urge you to choose fried chicken
that is full of protein.

963
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,340
Please don't overdo it.

964
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,980
Don't overdo it?

965
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,920
- You'll be reprimanded.
- Was I on YouTube mode?

966
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,620
- But this...
- My gosh.

967
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,650
- Goodness.
- This is baked, not fried.

968
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,810
- Is it baked chicken?
- Yes.

969
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:50,950
- Baked chicken.
- Baked is better.

970
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,620
The chicken is baked
and the sauce is delicious.

971
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,730
- Isn't it spicy?
- My gosh.

972
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,660
- No.
- This is baked, not fried.

973
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,790
(The youngsters easily slip
into a comfortable conversation.)

974
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,790
- This is nice.
- The chicken is baked...

975
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,870
and the sauce is delicious.

976
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,560
But...

977
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,070
Please listen to the rules while you eat.

978
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,380
After each game,
you will be given prize money...

979
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,210
depending on how well your team did.

980
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,340
The captains will distribute it
as they please.

981
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,450
- Really?
- Yes.

982
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,010
- But...
- What did he say?

983
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,810
What are the rules?

984
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,860
(Monk Ha listens from behind the cameras.)

985
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,480
Haha, we'll fill you in later.

986
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,280
The team members are at a disadvantage...

987
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,520
if they are only allowed
to receive what they're given.

988
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,590
Of course.

989
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,940
If you think that your captain
has given you the lowest amount,

990
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,370
you may challenge him or her
by taking a stance.

991
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,640
You will swap amounts
with your captain if you are right.

992
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,640
(Swap amounts with the captain
if the challenge is reasonable.)

993
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,830
What if we were wrong
to challenge the captain?

994
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,410
You will lose the money given to you.

995
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,540
(Your money will be cut in half.)

996
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,810
It's up to you to make the right call.

997
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,240
- I believe in my captain.
- Sure.

998
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,270
This is good.

999
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,220
The weak link of the team of five
is Suk Jin.

1000
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,220
After every game,

1001
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,660
the captain of that team...

1002
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,080
can send one person to the other team.

1003
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,090
Then the other team will have
that choice after the next round.

1004
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,250
You can get rid of the weak link.

1005
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:10,370
After each game,
kick out the most useless member.

1006
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,230
That person will lose ten dollars.

1007
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,670
(The weak link
will automatically lose 10 dollars.)

1008
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,560
You'll change and gather at the location.

1009
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,610
- Sure.
- Got it.

1010
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,270
(The one with the most money
will win the race.)

1011
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,340
Isn't it hilarious to see them
be awkward around each other?

1012
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,610
- What's your blood type?
- Me? Type AB.

1013
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,150
- Type AB? What about you?
- I'm Type O.

1014
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,620
- Type O?
- I get along well with that type.

1015
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,650
- Really?
- Yes.

1016
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,450
Who asks blood type these days?
Ask about their MBTI instead.

1017
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,690
What's your MBTI?

1018
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,980
I'm an ISFJ.

1019
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,520
- What about you?
- I'm an ENTJ.

1020
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,190
- Really?
- Look at So Min.

1021
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,200
Her age showed
when she asked them their blood type.

1022
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,360
I'm an INFP.

1023
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,730
An INFP? I get along with that type too.

1024
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,200
- I'm an INFP.
- I get along with INFPs too.

1025
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,370
(- Yes!
- All right!)

1026
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,970
(She forced a bond between them.)

1027
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,030
As if that really matters.

1028
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,610
Well, I'm an ENFP.

1029
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,230
Look at the youngsters
easily become friends again.

1030
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,770
Yes, we're talking casually now.

1031
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,570
Do you call her "noona?"

1032
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,950
- Ji Hee, I mean.
- Yes, I do.

1033
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,840
- Of course.
- Of course he does.

1034
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
Mr. Weak Link.

1035
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,340
- Mr. Weak Link?
- Don't you think he's...

1036
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,860
Captain Weak Link!

1037
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,660
Shouldn't he be standing at the far end?

1038
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,780
Did you watch me film
the opening for Running Man?

1039
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,590
- I did.
- Dowdy, wasn't it?

1040
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,020
What is the concept anyway?

1041
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,230
Will it be played during the show?

1042
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,630
- Like this.
- It's hilarious. Ji Suk Jin's...

1043
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,990
- Running Man.
- That just gave me the creeps.

1044
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,500
We were by his side when he filmed that,

1045
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,910
but he asked if we saw it.

1046
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,980
(During the break)

1047
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,030
Ji Suk Jin's...

1048
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,450
- Running...
- Ju Eun!

1049
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,950
Seriously?

1050
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,220
Can't you see
I'm filming something important?

1051
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,840
- Really? I didn't know.
- Move over!

1052
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,890
I apologize.

1053
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,220
- Really?
- Let me try that again.

1054
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,920
And cue!

1055
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,050
Ji Suk Jin's Running...

1056
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,750
(Here's your fried chicken!)

1057
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,130
- Unbelievable.
- He wants us to acknowledge it.

1058
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,250
(Captain Ji still asked
if they saw him film the opening.)

1059
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,750
You're being told to resume the show.

1060
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,060
- Ji Suk Jin's Running Man?
- Bo Pil...

1061
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,760
- What is it?
- He's saying that...

1062
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,530
Jun Hwan agreed to dance
during the opening today.

1063
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,170
- Really?
- Why didn't you do it?

1064
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,570
We requested something, you see.

1065
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,540
- Let's see it then.
- I can't wait!

1066
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,180
Jun Hwan, let's do this.

1067
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,150
- Let's see you dance.
- Go ahead.

1068
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,120
Dancing is all that
Running Man has to offer.

1069
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,080
- I can't wait.
- I thought he had forgotten.

1070
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,890
Good luck.

1071
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,860
He starts swaying to the rhythm.

1072
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,750
- Go, Jun Hwan.
- Here he goes.

1073
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,070
- Nicely done!
- Seriously, Jun Hwan?

1074
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:32,030
(His healthy joints
fuel his powerful dance moves.)

1075
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,510
Seriously, Jun Hwan?

1076
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,110
He's adorable.

1077
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,340
- He's adorable.
- Never did I expect this.

1078
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,170
- He's not like any other dancer.
- You look adorable.

1079
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:40,170
- Isn't he adorable?
- How cute is that?

1080
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,210
Look at him go.

1081
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,990
(He ends the show with a sweet body roll.)

1082
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,510
- That was adorable.
- Yes, adorable.

1083
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,320
The TikTok Geezer loves it.

1084
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,880
That is tailor-made for social media.

1085
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,960
- Exactly.
- Hold on.

1086
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,360
It's not like how he dances
when he's on the ice.

1087
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,730
- It was adorable.
- I found him adorable.

1088
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,570
- That was great though.
- His moves are big.

1089
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,090
- That was adorable.
- Big moves.

1090
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,130
- Like this.
- Wasn't that adorable?

1091
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,070
Ji Hee, what about you?

1092
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,130
- You can dance as well.
- Let's do this, Ji Hee.

1093
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,780
What should I dance to?

1094
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,170
- Go for it.
- I...

1095
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,110
- You should dance to...
- Can I check my phone first?

1096
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,670
- What for?
- Sure. Go ahead.

1097
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,980
- She came prepared.
- Just a second!

1098
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,650
Let's do this. Ji Hee, come on!

1099
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,190
- All right.
- Let's dance!

1100
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,050
How does it go again?

1101
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,420
- Like this.
- This?

1102
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,710
Nice.

1103
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,920
- What is it?
- What is it this time?

1104
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
- I was being enthusiastic.
- What's wrong?

1105
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,300
I was only looking.

1106
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,230
- Nice!
- You must've...

1107
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,800
gotten on his nerves.

1108
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,240
(Dancing)

1109
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,840
What do I always tell you?

1110
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,070
Haha goes crazy
over anything that seems hip.

1111
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,940
He'll even taste dung
if someone says it's hip.

1112
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,570
You're absolutely right.

1113
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,050
That's exactly how he's like.

1114
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,050
- Gosh. He is...
- He has an incurable disease.

1115
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,820
He goes crazy over anything young.

1116
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,920
- Sorry about that.
- He loves to show off.

1117
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,710
I'm back.

1118
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,110
- She's back.
- Here.

1119
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,690
He'll do anything that seems hip.

1120
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,150
Haha's hilarious.

1121
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,990
Ji Hee's back!

1122
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,590
She's actually a good dancer.

1123
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,860
- She is.
- Ji Hee, show us.

1124
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,300
- Good luck.
- Here I go.

1125
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,570
Cue, music.

1126
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,800
- This.
- I'm stuck on that as well.

1127
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,800
- I can't hear the music.
- Hold on.

1128
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,260
- Over there...
- That's what you're dancing to?

1129
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,710
Yes. Let me try this.

1130
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,670
- Hold on.
- But the tempo...

1131
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,800
Are you sure about this?

1132
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,570
- When it comes to dancing...
- It's like dancing to no music.

1133
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,110
- Are you sure, Ji Hee?
- Yes.

1134
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,990
- Then I respect that.
- She's bold, isn't she?

1135
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,880
(Bouncing)

1136
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,550
(She begins with gentle body rolls.)

1137
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,260
She couldn't care less
about the others around her.

1138
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,150
She's bold, isn't she?

1139
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,900
- This is more my style.
- We should keep it down.

1140
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,400
(The members can't really hear the music.)

1141
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,820
(She begins to dance.)

1142
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,940
This isn't the response I was hoping for.

1143
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,130
You're quite good.

1144
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,670
Nice!

1145
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,340
- Aren't you an actor?
- Are you taking classes?

1146
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,400
Of course.

1147
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,570
Your instructor taught you well.

1148
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,110
Ji Hee, are you taking dance classes?

1149
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,240
She's quite good though.

1150
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,820
She definitely took some classes for it.

1151
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,740
(The dance machine wraps up
her promotional dance.)

1152
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,420
- She definitely learned this.
- I saw this move a lot.

1153
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,010
Yes, I practiced my body rolls.

1154
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,260
It was the same as dancing to no music.

1155
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,420
Ji Hee, are you interested
in being on variety shows?

1156
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,860
Yes, I want to do well.

1157
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,130
- Nice!
- Treat me as poorly as you want.

1158
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,630
- I love that attitude.
- Go, Ji Hee!

1159
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,590
- Can we treat you poorly?
- Yes, go ahead.

1160
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,360
- Then I'll kick you in the butt!
- Sure.

1161
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,110
(Out of nowhere)

1162
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,780
(Once)

1163
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,010
(Twice)

1164
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,070
(Two kicks came flying out of nowhere.)

1165
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,210
(She got what she asked for.)

1166
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,920
I love it. Bring it on!

1167
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,320
Nicely done, guys.

1168
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,760
- Nice.
- Do it again if you want.

1169
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,960
Ji Hee's ecstatic.

1170
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,880
So Min smacked Sae Ho
on the back of his head last week.

1171
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,530
She no longer has any boundaries.

1172
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,050
What's gotten into you these days?

1173
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,630
(Take that!)

1174
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,130
- You're on a roll.
- Nice.

1175
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,690
She has been staying at home for too long.

1176
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,300
She's looking for a fight.

1177
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,440
Let's begin the first game.

1178
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,240
The first game...

1179
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,940
not only depends on your memory...

1180
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,880
but the power of
your opponent's memory too.

1181
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,570
This is Darn Your Memory.

1182
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,980
- Right.
- We all have a good memory.

1183
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,780
One from each team will compete.

1184
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,920
You must remember the words
that appear in front of you.

1185
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,230
The words?

1186
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,730
I have good short-term memory.

1187
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,260
While memorizing the words in order,

1188
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:14,960
if you feel like your opponent
has lost track,

1189
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,420
you may attack by pressing the buzzer.

1190
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,690
Once the buzzer is pressed,

1191
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,940
the opponent must list the words.

1192
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,110
If your opponent guesses correctly,

1193
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,400
he or she will win a point.

1194
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,630
If the opponent gets it wrong,
you will win a point instead.

1195
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,840
- I see.
- Right.

1196
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,380
Boldly press the buzzer...

1197
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,550
if you think your opponent has lost track.

1198
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,570
The later the better, right?

1199
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,990
Your opponent might force you
to list the words though.

1200
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,650
- Okay.
- It's time for the first round.

1201
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,960
- Who'll go first?
- For our team,

1202
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,380
- it'll be Jeonsobari.
- Good!

1203
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,630
- Then...
- The captain will decide.

1204
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,780
- Really?
- The captain should decide.

1205
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,920
Captain Cha.

1206
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,690
- How about Jeonsobari?
- Jeonsobari?

1207
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,230
Why are you controlling him?

1208
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,670
- That's not the case.
- Jun Hwan, seriously?

1209
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,840
Let Jun Hwan decide.

1210
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,110
You'd call this a regency.

1211
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,900
Right.

1212
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,900
- The King is young.
- Yes, he is.

1213
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,240
When the King is too young,

1214
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,050
- someone acts as regent.
- Who's up for our team?

1215
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,440
- Anyone will do.
- How about the weak link?

1216
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,740
Yes, the weak link.

1217
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,550
- The weak link.
- Go ahead.

1218
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,110
- It's the weak link.
- Here I go.

1219
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,710
(Round 1: Suk Jin versus So Min)

1220
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,820
The weak link is out!

1221
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,090
Are you good at memorizing things?

1222
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,420
- I can't say I'm bad at it.
- Really?

1223
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,820
For the first round,

1224
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,190
you will see the names
of our staff members.

1225
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,630
- What?
- This is a hard one.

1226
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,630
- This is a tricky one.
- This won't be easy.

1227
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,570
This isn't something
Suk Jin is strong at.

1228
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,800
- I'll probably lose.
- So Min will definitely win.

1229
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,860
She at least knows half the names.

1230
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,210
This isn't difficult at all.

1231
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,980
- You can do this.
- Okay, let's do this!

1232
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,570
I'll crush Jeonsobari.

1233
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,940
Here comes the first member of the staff.

1234
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,710
Cue.

1235
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,320
It should be someone they both don't know.

1236
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,380
- They know who that is.
- Of course, they know.

1237
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,820
(Choi Hyung In)

1238
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,150
(First word: Choi Hyung In)

1239
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,860
Of course, I know her.

1240
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,320
Hyung In, where are you off to?

1241
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,420
- Wait.
- That was a weird walk.

1242
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,920
- Of course, they know her name.
- She's on TV a lot these days.

1243
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,590
- They know her too for sure!
- We know her.

1244
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,440
(They're familiar with
the producer's name.)

1245
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,010
She's on TV a lot these days.

1246
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,510
(He says it a little too late.)

1247
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,740
(Eyes fixated on her)

1248
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,400
Of course we know Choi Seon Myung.
We must mention the surname, right?

1249
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,030
Isn't she Namkoong Seon Myung?

1250
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,110
- Of course we know Choi Seon Myung.
- Namkoong Seon Myung.

1251
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,340
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Hey!

1252
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,820
- What do you think you're doing?
- You are Gong Yoo?

1253
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,880
(Gong Yoo)

1254
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,340
(A director comes out with
a name tag that says Gong Yoo)

1255
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,650
Hey, Nam Joong.

1256
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,820
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Nam Joong.

1257
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,880
Choi Hyung In, Yoo Seon Myung...

1258
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,530
That was brazen of him.

1259
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,650
- What?
- Kwak Cheol Yong?

1260
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,920
Who is he?
Is your name really Kwak Cheol Yong?

1261
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,460
No, it's not. You're not Cheol Yong.

1262
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,260
We have to memorize the names
from their name tags?

1263
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,210
- What?
- Lionel Messi.

1264
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,710
Lionel Messi.

1265
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,710
I can't remember.

1266
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,880
All right. Suk Jin.

1267
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,920
(Suk Jin has to name
the staff members in order.)

1268
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,240
- Of course he knows.
- Of course.

1269
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,420
Choi Hyung In,

1270
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,940
- Of course he knows.
- Yoo Seon Myung,

1271
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,760
Gong Yoo,

1272
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,260
Kwak Cheol Yong,

1273
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,710
Lionel Messi.

1274
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,860
That's it.

1275
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,190
- Why can't she memorize this?
- Why can't she?

1276
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,800
Didn't he say Kwak Cheol Young?

1277
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,670
- No, he said it correctly.
- Kwak Cheol Young?

1278
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,820
You pressed the buzzer really fast.

1279
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,530
- It's 1 to 0.
- All right! That was great.

1280
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,990
(Suk Jin: 1, So Min: 0)

1281
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,300
- Yes!
- You're doing great, weak link.

1282
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,740
- You couldn't beat a weak link.
- Our weak link is good.

1283
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,800
(Laughing)

1284
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,400
- She couldn't beat a weak link.
- Our weak link is good.

1285
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,240
All right. Here's the second round.

1286
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,110
(Round 2 starts.)

1287
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,210
Start.

1288
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,550
(Lee Myung Jae)

1289
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,710
He is Myung Jae.

1290
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,740
Is he?

1291
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,990
- He's Myung Jae.
- I see.

1292
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,550
- Lee Myung Jae.
- Next.

1293
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,610
(Second word: Na Dong Geun)

1294
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,550
- It's Dong Geun.
- When did you become Dong Geun?

1295
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,320
- But these guys...
- Dong Geun's surname was Na?

1296
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,690
- You didn't know?
- No.

1297
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,360
Lee Myung Jae, Na Dong Geun...

1298
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,800
- What's with you?
- Darn you.

1299
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,490
- You are V now?
- You call yourself V?

1300
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,530
(Former Gong Yoo came out as V.)

1301
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:43,110
(They all complain.)

1302
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,630
- You'll be in big trouble.
- You call yourself V?

1303
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,010
Next.

1304
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,880
(Yoon Eun Hye)

1305
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,050
(Yoon Eun Hye?)

1306
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,170
Eun Hye!

1307
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,320
(Eun Hye!)

1308
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,710
Eun Hye!

1309
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,420
- Where are you going, Eun Hye?
- I'll call you.

1310
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,760
I'll call you, Eun Hye!

1311
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,860
"I'll call you?"

1312
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,960
(Gang Dong Won)

1313
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,030
(Gang Dong Won
appears from behind the curtain.)

1314
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,260
- Director Yoon.
- What?

1315
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,990
- Seriously...
- Director of Jimmy Jib.

1316
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,690
Director of Jimmy Jib.

1317
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,990
- Mr. Jimmy Jib. Come on.
- Mr. Jimmy Jib?

1318
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,110
- Mr. Jimmy Jib?
- He has a figure of Ho Dong.

1319
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,110
- Next.
- I forgot their names.

1320
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,240
- What?
- Go Chul Bong?

1321
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,630
(Sixth word: Go Chul Bong)

1322
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,070
- Go Chul Bong?
- I've never heard of her.

1323
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,710
(Buzzing)

1324
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,740
Go for it.

1325
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,420
(Suk Jin attacks So Min.)

1326
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,110
- All right. So Min.
- Go for it.

1327
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,420
I couldn't memorize them
because they talked at the back.

1328
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,360
(He was the loudest one.)

1329
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,920
Lee Myung Jae, Na Dong Geun,

1330
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,190
V,

1331
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,360
Yoon Eun Hye,

1332
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,400
(Lee Myung Jae, Na Dong Geun,
V, Yoon Eun Hye...)

1333
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,630
Go Chul Bong.

1334
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,630
- It's wrong.
- There was one more.

1335
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,400
- There was one more person.
- There was one more.

1336
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,130
Gang Dong Won.

1337
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,860
(Suk Jin succeeds in attacking So Min.)

1338
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,630
- You did it!
- There was one more.

1339
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,530
So Min's gotten dull.

1340
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,530
- So Min, you've become...
- Hey.

1341
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,710
(Suk Jin wins Round 1
after earning 2 points first.)

1342
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,710
Knock, knock. Are you there?

1343
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,570
(Empty Head was completely defeated
by the weak link.)

1344
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:02,190
I was so confused because you guys
talked at the back.

1345
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:04,550
- They made it so confusing.
- For Round Two,

1346
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,110
the Olympic athletes will enter
in the order of their countries.

1347
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,150
- Memorize the countries in order.
- I'll do it.

1348
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,300
- Destroy them.
- I'll play later.

1349
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,730
- Destroy them.
- But this is...

1350
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,960
- Jae Suk knows many countries.
- Destroy them.

1351
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,190
He does.

1352
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,260
I feel reassured.

1353
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,360
The Olympic athletes are entering.

1354
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,070
- Memorize the words in order.
- All right.

1355
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,260
- This one will be hard too.
- Athletes, please enter.

1356
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,800
Jong Kook memorizes names well.

1357
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,670
- Oh, my.
- The Republic of Korea.

1358
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:28,740
(First word: The Republic of Korea)

1359
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,110
- The Republic of Korea.
- Okay.

1360
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,210
The Republic of Korea.

1361
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,740
(Ethiopia)

1362
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,980
Ethiopia.

1363
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,920
I've never heard of such a country.

1364
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,380
Next.

1365
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,880
(San Marino)

1366
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,820
San Marino.

1367
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,530
- There's such a country?
- San Marino.

1368
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:45,590
Next.

1369
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,320
- The Bahamas.
- The Bahamas.

1370
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,690
Was it Santiago?

1371
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,030
It's already confusing.

1372
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,740
(Ghana)

1373
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,460
Ghana.

1374
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,900
It was Ashley and Santarama.

1375
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,940
- It was Ashley and Santarama.
- Santarama?

1376
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,940
- Venezuela.
- Venezuela.

1377
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,300
I think I forgot one.

1378
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,440
The third one.

1379
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,920
- Next.
- Venezuela.

1380
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,190
- Mauritius.
- Go for it.

1381
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,210
Go for it, Jong Kook.

1382
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,440
Attack him.

1383
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,510
Darn it.

1384
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,650
Press it! You got it.

1385
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:15,690
(Jae Suk presses the buzzer first.)

1386
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:16,730
Jong Kook.

1387
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,260
There was a country called Suction too.

1388
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,490
- The Republic of Korea.
- Okay.

1389
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:21,650
Ethiopia.

1390
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:23,170
- San...
- San...

1391
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:24,420
- You can't tell him.
- The Bahamas.

1392
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,840
- The Bahamas.
- The Bahamas.

1393
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,190
(Bursting into laughter)

1394
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,800
- He's done for!
- The Republic of Korea.

1395
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,170
- He's done.
- No!

1396
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,880
- Ethiopia.
- Espresso.

1397
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,480
- San Marino.
- Espresso.

1398
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,210
(The Republic of Korea, Ethiopia,
San Marino...)

1399
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:36,380
- Ghana.
- It's wrong.

1400
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,440
- It's wrong.
- No, it comes out later.

1401
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,820
- All right!
- Yes!

1402
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,170
- It was tough.
- It was the Bahamas.

1403
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,210
Wasn't it Ghana?

1404
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,650
It was tough.

1405
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:43,690
(So Min goes over to the other team
to tease them.)

1406
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:44,920
It was the Bahamas.

1407
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,650
- The Bahamas
- The Bahamas

1408
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:49,190
(Singing out the Bahamas to celebrate)

1409
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:51,050
It's 1 to 0.

1410
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:52,820
All right. This is hard.

1411
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,860
It's hard to memorize
the names of countries.

1412
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,400
- It's hard.
- He can't remember more than five.

1413
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,030
Next athletes, please enter.

1414
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,070
- All right.
- Go.

1415
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,760
- Luxembourg.
- Luxembourg.

1416
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,740
- Luxembourg
- Luxembourg

1417
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,940
- Luxembourg
- Luxembourg, Argentina

1418
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,740
- Ecuador.
- Ecuador.

1419
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,380
- Ecuador! Luxembourg, Ecuador.
- The thing is,

1420
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,110
if the names are hard,
it's hard to remember them.

1421
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,440
- Next.
- Luxembourg.

1422
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,110
- This is hard.
- Liechtenstein.

1423
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:18,440
Einstein.

1424
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,190
(Even his team member is confused.)

1425
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,760
Liechtenstein.

1426
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,130
- Uruguay.
- Uruguay.

1427
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:27,820
- Come at us!
- Come!

1428
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,090
Uruguay.

1429
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,860
Gosh, seriously!

1430
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,190
Press the buzzer
when the next person comes out.

1431
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,260
(The scaredy-cat Jae Suk
presses the buzzer first.)

1432
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,530
There are only four.

1433
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:36,530
- We won!
- There are only four.

1434
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:37,860
- There are only four.
- Don't tell him.

1435
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,900
You have to keep quiet.

1436
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,740
We can't tell him
because we can't remember.

1437
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,840
- Well done.
- All right.

1438
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,480
Jae Suk pressed the buzzer...

1439
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,010
when he couldn't remember anymore.

1440
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,010
He was like, "Darn it!"

1441
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,210
When he couldn't remember it,

1442
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:49,550
- he just pressed it.
- This is hard!

1443
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,440
- It is hard.
- It's Jae Suk's attack.

1444
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,820
The Republic of Korea, Santiago.

1445
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,510
- Laminate.
- Come on.

1446
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:55,550
Americano.

1447
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:56,590
Wait.

1448
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:57,860
- Luxembourg.
- Okay.

1449
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,190
- Let's see.
- Einstein.

1450
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,320
- Three, two...
- Wonstein.

1451
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,360
(Luxembourg)

1452
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,760
One.

1453
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,190
(Jong Kook runs out of time.)

1454
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:08,460
Liechtenstein.

1455
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,260
Liechtenstein!

1456
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,840
Einstein.

1457
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,380
You didn't even memorize anything.

1458
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,240
It was Ecuador.

1459
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,480
- What?
- Ecuador.

1460
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,570
- It was?
- Yes.

1461
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,510
- Jae Suk, it was Ecuador.
- Ecuador.

1462
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,480
I asked you if it was correct.

1463
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,940
It was something that began with E.

1464
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,110
(So Min provokes them again.)

1465
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,240
I thought he was going to
press the buzzer.

1466
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,280
I couldn't remember the second country.

1467
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:29,190
- Do you want to play, Ji Hee?
- I'll give it a try.

1468
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,530
We need to take the lead again.

1469
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:33,400
Jae Suk didn't memorize anything.

1470
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,860
- He didn't memorize anything.
- You want to play with me?

1471
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,400
- Next is Jun Hwan.
- Jun Hwan.

1472
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,070
Let's go, Jun Hwan.

1473
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,110
- Ji Hee and Jun Hwan.
- Should I give it a try?

1474
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:44,940
It's just our suggestion,
but can Se Chan go first?

1475
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,070
Do we have to listen to you?

1476
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:50,550
He's looking down on me for sure.

1477
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,780
I'll listen to him.

1478
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,940
- What?
- Are you looking down on Se Chan?

1479
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,050
- Ji Hyo should play.
- Go for it, Ji Hyo.

1480
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,150
Se Chan versus Ji Hyo.

1481
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,490
I'm good at memorizing.

1482
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:59,920
Press the buzzer
if you think you can't memorize them.

1483
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,190
Se Chan, you can do it.

1484
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:02,320
It's hard.

1485
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,460
Start.

1486
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,590
(Revealing the question)

1487
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:05,900
- What?
- Who is it?

1488
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,690
- John Navarre.
- John Navarre?

1489
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:08,860
- Who is it?
- John Navarre?

1490
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,170
(John Navarre?)

1491
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,460
- John Navarre?
- John Navarre?

1492
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,130
- What is this?
- John Navarre?

1493
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,570
- The staff's name is John Navarre?
- Are we allowed to say this?

1494
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,030
It's an actual person's name.

1495
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:18,170
It's a football player's name.

1496
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,440
- John Navarre?
- Is it okay to say this?

1497
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,880
- What do you think you're doing?
- It's a football player's name.

1498
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,150
- It's a football player's name?
- John Navarre.

1499
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:24,300
- Next.
- There's such a player?

1500
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,300
Oh, he's a football player?

1501
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,980
- Park Gyeok Po.
- Park Gyeok Po.

1502
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,050
This is easy.

1503
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,740
- John Navarre, Park Gyeok Po.
- John Navarre.

1504
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,990
John Navarre, Park Gyeok Po.

1505
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:32,460
Yeo Si Yeon.

1506
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:33,610
Is that her real name?

1507
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:34,880
- Yeo Si Yeon.
- Yeo Si Yeon?

1508
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,920
- Yeo Si Yeon.
- Yeo Si Yeon?

1509
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,530
- It's hard.
- Mark Zucker...

1510
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,150
- Oh, it's Mark Zuckerberg.
- We know Mark Zuckerberg.

1511
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,630
- Of course he knows.
- Mark Zuckerberg? Okay, got it.

1512
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:45,090
- Next.
- What was after John Navarre?

1513
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:46,190
What was after John Navarre?

1514
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:47,360
- Who is it? I can't see it. Yoon...
- John Navarre.

1515
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:48,860
- What does it say? Yoon...
- Yoon Jong Seo.

1516
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,360
- It's Jong Seo.
- It's confusing.

1517
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,030
- All right.
- It's Jong Seo.

1518
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,130
It's confusing.

1519
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:54,530
She pressed it.

1520
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:55,670
Se Chan, say the names.

1521
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:56,900
John Navarre.

1522
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,170
(John Navarre)

1523
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,880
- Park Gyeok Po.
- All right.

1524
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,210
(John Navarre, Park Gyeok Po)

1525
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,190
- Yeo Si Yeon.
- There you go.

1526
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:05,190
(John Navarre, Park Gyeok Po, Yeo Si Yeon)

1527
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,780
- It's a foreigner's name.
- He can't remember it.

1528
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,780
- It's hard.
- He doesn't know the name?

1529
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,490
- He doesn't know.
- You don't know him, do you?

1530
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:13,030
Mark...

1531
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,230
That's it.

1532
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:15,760
He doesn't know.

1533
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:18,420
- Mark...
- He doesn't know.

1534
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,590
Zuckburger?

1535
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:20,860
(Wrong)

1536
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,710
(Mark Zuckburger?)

1537
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:24,960
How can you call him that?

1538
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,110
What is he, a burger?

1539
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:28,570
- What is he, a burger?
- Zip up?

1540
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,240
What do you mean by Mark Zuckburger?

1541
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,840
What's his name again?

1542
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,710
- It's Zuckerberg.
- Oh, right. It's Zuckerberg.

1543
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,280
Gosh, darn it!

1544
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,550
I'm sorry, Jae Suk.

1545
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,380
What do you mean by Mark Zuckburger?

1546
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,010
- Zuckburger?
- We can beat them.

1547
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:42,260
- Mark Zuckburger.
- This is great.

1548
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,730
We're doing well!

1549
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,800
- Se Chan, remember this.
- Okay.

1550
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,360
When you're confused,
she'll be confused too.

1551
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,530
- Okay.
- Got it?

1552
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,960
- When I'm confused,
- Press the buzzer then.

1553
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,170
Ji Hyo is confused too.

1554
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,570
- As if!
- All right.

1555
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,960
- As if!
- Just press the buzzer well.

1556
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,990
Let's see how well he does.

1557
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:56,440
- You'll win if you press it well.
- Here's the second question.

1558
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,010
You don't have to memorize them
as long as you press it well.

1559
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:59,570
- It'll be the names of countries.
- All right!

1560
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:00,800
- It's countries?
- Countries.

1561
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,340
- It's hard.
- I'm confident.

1562
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,340
- Okay.
- The names of countries are hard, no?

1563
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,480
I just need to press the buzzer well.

1564
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,440
Athletes, please enter. The first athlete.

1565
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,980
What could they be?

1566
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:12,690
- Mauritius.
- Mauritius.

1567
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:15,530
- You can't forget Mauritius.
- Mauritius.

1568
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:17,090
- Haiti.
- Oh, I know that one.

1569
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:18,190
M and H.

1570
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,800
- Haiti of Africa.
- M and H.

1571
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,530
- Mauritius and Haiti.
- Haiti.

1572
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:22,920
- Next.
- It's Mauritius.

1573
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,300
Uruguay.

1574
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:27,800
- Uruguay is an easy one.
- Mauritius, Haiti, Uruguay.

1575
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,800
- Mauritius, Haiti, Uruguay.
- Mauritius, Haiti, Uruguay.

1576
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,110
- Next.
- Mauritius, Haiti, Uruguay.

1577
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,880
- What's next?
- Australia.

1578
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,440
- Haiti...
- It's Australia.

1579
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,050
Australia.

1580
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,570
It's Australia.

1581
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:39,940
- Next.
- Australia.

1582
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,990
- Mozambique.
- M, H...

1583
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:44,440
Mauritius, Haiti...

1584
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:46,420
- You should press it.
- Because of Mozambique?

1585
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,650
(Ji Hyo presses the buzzer first.)

1586
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,960
(Se Chan fails to press
the buzzer first again.)

1587
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,320
Why did you... Seriously!

1588
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,550
He can't remember after Uruguay.

1589
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:55,300
At some point,
he didn't even look at the names.

1590
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,990
He only stared at Ji Hyo.

1591
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,800
What was the last one?

1592
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,570
- It was perfect timing.
- You can do it.

1593
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,260
- Show us!
- The last one was confusing.

1594
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,840
- It was Argentina.
- He doesn't know?

1595
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,210
- I don't think so.
- We won.

1596
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,940
You must remember the answers.
You can remember them.

1597
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,480
- You can't remember them?
- This one is easy.

1598
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,980
- He's indeed Empty Head.
- He can't remember the first one.

1599
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,010
- Show us!
- The last one was confusing.

1600
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,280
Moritius.

1601
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,920
- That's not it!
- Hey!

1602
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,920
(Moritius?)

1603
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:20,880
- What was that?
- Moritius?

1604
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,780
It's Mauritius!

1605
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,190
- He said Moritius.
- He didn't know that!

1606
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,550
- What on earth is Moritius?
- He didn't know that!

1607
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,260
- It's not Moritius?
- It's wrong!

1608
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,900
- I couldn't remember.
- It's Mauritius.

1609
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:31,590
Hey, even I memorized them.

1610
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:34,460
Mauritius, Haiti, Uruguay,
Australia, Mozam...

1611
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,400
- What's the last one?
- What's the last one?

1612
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,210
- We won! Ji Hyo is good!
- That was great!

1613
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:39,740
- We won.
- Well done!

1614
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,780
Next players.

1615
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,840
- Let's go.
- Jun Hwan!

1616
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,570
- It's between captains.
- All right!

1617
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,480
- Yes!
- It's Jun Hwan!

1618
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,380
- It's between captains.
- Let's go!

1619
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,280
- It was so hard.
- Ji Hee is playing?

1620
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,740
- Yes.
- We'll win for sure.

1621
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,880
Jun Hwan is playing for our team.

1622
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,360
- Jun Hwan is playing.
- We'll take this round.

1623
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,360
What do you mean he'll win?

1624
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,190
- I'll play relaxedly.
- Relaxedly.

1625
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:57,260
Just beat them.

1626
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,260
Take it easy.

1627
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:03,070
The game you're playing next
is in a different category.

1628
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:05,670
We invited special helpers
for the next game.

1629
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:06,740
Who are they?

1630
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,940
Special guests, please come in.

1631
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,440
- We have special guests?
- We have more guests?

1632
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,070
- Is it Hyung In?
- No way.

1633
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,210
- Who are they?
- Who could they be?

1634
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:13,710
- We have more guests?
- Who are they?

1635
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,570
- They're coming. I heard something.
- There can't be more guests.

1636
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,440
- They're coming down.
- What's going on?

1637
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,760
(The special guests
slowly reveal themselves.)

1638
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,430
- It's Ms. Yeom. It's been so long.
- What?

1639
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:31,970
(Wait, she is...)

1640
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,340
What?

1641
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:39,610
You must do whatever I tell you
as though your life depends on it.

1642
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:40,700
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

1643
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,030
(It's Granny aerobics instructor
who taught the members...)

1644
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:45,340
(of "Infinite Challenge" harshly
14 years ago.)

1645
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,450
It's only the beginning! Get up!

1646
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:48,840
(It's only the beginning! Get up!)

1647
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:52,450
(The maestro in the aerobics world,
Director Yeom Jung In)

1648
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,760
- How have you been?
- Ms. Yeom.

1649
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,220
(What is Ms. Yeom doing here?)

1650
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,590
Hello.

1651
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:59,860
(The music starts to play out of nowhere.)

1652
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,220
- Hello.
- What? What do we do?

1653
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,360
(She skips greetings and
gets ready to do the aerobic moves.)

1654
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,470
Ms. Yeom.

1655
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:05,470
(She skips greetings and
gets ready to do the aerobic moves.)

1656
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:08,370
Gosh. What's this?

1657
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:09,590
You're still working with her.

1658
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,300
- What's this?
- She's still working with her.

1659
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,760
- My gosh.
- Oh, it's aerobics?

1660
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,470
Three, four.

1661
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,780
Three, four.

1662
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,340
Follow along! What are you doing?

1663
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,240
- Okay.
- Four.

1664
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,450
- Three.
- Wait.

1665
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:25,320
- I don't think she knows the moves.
- I think she's doing it wrong.

1666
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,550
She's not that good.

1667
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,220
- Follow me!
- Follow her.

1668
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:29,490
What are you doing?

1669
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,720
How can we follow you
when you got all the moves wrong?

1670
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,530
- Just do it!
- How?

1671
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:35,300
- She startled me.
- Ms. Yeom.

1672
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,050
She sounds like Kwang Hee.

1673
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:40,320
Follow me!

1674
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,030
(Shouting out of nowhere)

1675
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,260
- We must memorize the moves.
- Follow me.

1676
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:48,870
This way.

1677
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,340
One, two.

1678
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,950
- It's easy.
- Three, four.

1679
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,720
Three, four.

1680
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,450
- Three, four.
- Three, four.

1681
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:59,450
One more time. Three, four.

1682
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:01,720
- Three, four.
- Your mic.

1683
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,220
(Ms. Yeom's assistant
steps out to put on the mic again.)

1684
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,260
What's going on?

1685
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,090
(What's going on?)

1686
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:09,860
- Ms. Yeom doesn't know the moves.
- Ms. Yeom doesn't know the moves.

1687
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:12,090
- Ms. Yeom!
- Ms. Yeom doesn't know the moves.

1688
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:14,640
Ms. Yeom doesn't know the moves.

1689
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,990
Follow me!

1690
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,510
- All right.
- What are we supposed to follow?

1691
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,800
Ms. Yeom, you don't know the moves.

1692
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:24,950
She's going freestyle!

1693
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:26,950
Okay.

1694
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,510
(The assistant is back.)

1695
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:30,740
It's going great!

1696
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,780
(They end up learning the moves
from the assistant.)

1697
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,260
Oh, gosh.

1698
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,860
- Why is she yelling at me?
- Isn't this the move?

1699
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,890
Let's go!

1700
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:42,760
Look at me.

1701
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,260
We're all looking at her, not at Ms. Yeom.

1702
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,260
Ms. Yeom went freestyle.

1703
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,030
- No one looked at her.
- What are we supposed to memorize?

1704
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:51,300
Ms. Yeom, how have you been?

1705
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,530
Thanks to "Infinite Challenge,"
I've been doing well.

1706
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,930
But it's been so long
since "Infinite Challenge" ended.

1707
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:59,870
Since I made a living thanks to
"Infinite Challenge,"

1708
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:01,320
- now, I'll do the same...
- Through "Running Man?"

1709
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,740
for 30 more years through "Running Man."

1710
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,780
Ms. Yeom.
Your eyeliners are higher than before.

1711
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,010
They got stronger, right?

1712
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,590
It looks like
you don't know the moves well.

1713
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:14,890
It's not that I don't know them.
I was overly excited.

1714
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:17,820
It's so funny. She told us to follow her,

1715
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,570
- but she didn't know the moves.
- You could just...

1716
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,870
"Follow me!"

1717
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:21,930
(Her words don't match her actions.)

1718
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,030
"Is this the move?"

1719
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:26,910
I could do it well,
but I couldn't do it earlier.

1720
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,240
- "Follow me!"
- Okay.

1721
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,840
Can you show us one more time?

1722
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,240
Ms. Yeom was anxious.

1723
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,370
- When the assistant...
- Why are you so dispirited?

1724
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,220
Why do you look dispirited
when you worked hard?

1725
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,240
Gosh, it's so funny.

1726
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,660
All right. For the fourth question,

1727
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,360
the maestro of aerobics world, Ms. Yeom,

1728
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,090
will give out the question.

1729
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:47,360
(The fourth round
will be joined by Ms. Yeom.)

1730
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,090
Ms. Yeom will show you the moves in order.

1731
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:52,800
- Oh, we're starting now?
- You can attack your opponent...

1732
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,430
while memorizing the moves.

1733
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:56,200
Okay, I got it.

1734
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,970
- You got it, right?
- While memorizing the moves.

1735
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:59,240
He can memorize moves well.

1736
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,180
- Be on your toes.
- Okay.

1737
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,430
If you get it too easily...

1738
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,700
If you dance better than me,
then I'll deduct your points.

1739
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,450
- Even if we do better?
- We shouldn't do too well.

1740
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:08,640
If you dance better than me,

1741
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,950
- then I'll deduct your points.
- We shouldn't do too well.

1742
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:11,680
But if you don't do well,
your points will be deducted also.

1743
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,680
Don't try too hard
to dance better than me.

1744
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,860
- Okay.
- Got it.

1745
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,450
She's scolding me so hard.

1746
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:20,360
Jun Hwan and Ji Hee,
you'll do the moves...

1747
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,090
- to the music.
- Okay.

1748
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,260
I'm bad at memorizing moves.

1749
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,870
What's the first move? Okay.

1750
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,490
Give us the music.

1751
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,200
Three, four!

1752
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,870
(1st move)

1753
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,110
- Two.
- Three, four.

1754
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,030
Three, two!

1755
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,640
- Four, two.
- Let's go!

1756
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,550
One, two,

1757
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,510
- three...
- Jun Hwan is indeed good.

1758
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:46,510
Let's go. Five, six, seven, eight.

1759
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,590
One, two.

1760
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:48,680
(3rd move)

1761
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,360
- Three, four.
- This is hard.

1762
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,450
- It's hard!
- I love it!

1763
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:54,050
- It's hard.
- I love this one.

1764
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,050
- Five, four.
- You know,

1765
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:57,320
everyone is looking at her.

1766
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:00,120
- No one is looking at Ms. Yeom.
- It's that move.

1767
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,140
- Four, three.
- You got this.

1768
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,340
Jun Hwan, just press the buzzer.

1769
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,700
- Press the buzzer.
- Press it!

1770
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,760
(Seeing Jun Hwan press the buzzer,)

1771
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,610
(Ji Hee presses it right away.)

1772
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,800
- He pressed it!
- All right.

1773
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,970
- You should just press the buzzer.
- What do we do?

1774
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,050
- What was the first move?
- He pressed the buzzer.

1775
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,010
She can't remember the first move.

1776
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:18,780
- The first one was...
- What was the first move?

1777
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:21,450
Now, Ji Hee will show the moves.

1778
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,530
Ms. Yeom, please watch her
and see if she got the moves wrong.

1779
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:25,950
- It's so hard.
- It's this, right?

1780
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,660
- It goes like this, right?
- Yes, that's it.

1781
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,390
That was the move.

1782
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:33,620
(1st move)

1783
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:37,610
(2nd move)

1784
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:41,680
(3rd move)

1785
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,970
(4th move)

1786
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,780
Please watch Ji Hee
and see if she gets the moves wrong.

1787
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:49,840
- Give us the music.
- I need to dance to the music?

1788
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,840
Music, cue.

1789
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:55,950
What's the next move?

1790
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,760
What's the next move?

1791
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,680
(She pulls off the first move.)

1792
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,990
- She's good!
- That's it.

1793
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:03,450
- It's exactly the same.
- Isn't this the move?

1794
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:04,990
Two, three, four.

1795
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,120
It's exactly the same.

1796
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,930
It was something like this.

1797
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,010
She's so good at it.

1798
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,760
(She pulls off the second move as well.)

1799
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:16,640
That's it.

1800
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:18,280
What's next?

1801
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,680
This one.

1802
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,240
(She only needs to pull off
the last move.)

1803
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,240
(The last move)

1804
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,160
(Will she be able to pull off
the last move as well?)

1805
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,890
(Whatever!)

1806
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,160
- Yes!
- She failed.

1807
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,530
- All right!
- It's too hard.

1808
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:38,530
- Well done.
- It's hard.

1809
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:39,760
You did well.

1810
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,840
- Jun Hwan earns a point.
- All right!

1811
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,510
She can't remember more than three moves.

1812
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:46,430
All right. Here comes the second question.

1813
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:48,910
- Wait. What's next?
- It's "El Dorado."

1814
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:50,200
- What?
- We're dancing to "El Dorado."

1815
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,800
We're dancing to "El Dorado?"
No, we're not.

1816
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,640
- Yes, we are.
- We're dancing to "El Dorado?"

1817
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,140
- Really?
- You don't even know.

1818
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,410
It looks like she has no clue.

1819
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:59,050
No, I wanted to finish dancing
with the previous song.

1820
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,340
- Oh, with the previous song?
- It's "El Dorado."

1821
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:01,550
- It's "El Dorado".
- Okay.

1822
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:03,160
- I'll do it.
- Just follow the one on the right.

1823
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,430
- Get ready.
- We need the music.

1824
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:05,450
Music, cue.

1825
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:07,800
- We'll start with the first one.
- Okay.

1826
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,550
It's "El Dorado."

1827
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:11,530
Here we go!

1828
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,470
- Let's go!
- Three, four.

1829
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,930
This one is easy.

1830
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:16,260
Two.

1831
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,530
- Three, two.
- This is really easy.

1832
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:20,240
- Let's move on.
- It's covering the face move.

1833
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,930
- Covering face.
- It's the next move.

1834
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:23,700
- Six, two.
- Three, four.

1835
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,340
- Three, two.
- Stretch out your right arm.

1836
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,180
- Three, four.
- Covering face and stretching arm.

1837
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,050
Two.

1838
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,450
- Shaking your hips.
- This one is easy.

1839
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:33,640
- Shaking your hips.
- Three, four.

1840
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,410
Covering face and stretching arm.
Shaking your hips.

1841
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,780
Stretching your arms.

1842
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,390
Ji Hee, let's press the buzzer this time.

1843
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,820
All right.

1844
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,160
Press the buzzer, Jun Hwan.

1845
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,890
- Ji Hee.
- Press the buzzer.

1846
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:46,090
- Press it.
- Press the buzzer.

1847
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,430
- Press it.
- Press the buzzer, Jun Hwan.

1848
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,390
(Will she be able to press it this time?)

1849
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,510
- Jun Hwan, press the buzzer.
- Press it.

1850
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:54,340
(Jun Hwan was faster this time as well.)

1851
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,370
You see?

1852
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,610
- Yes!
- I knew he would press it.

1853
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:01,470
- She pressed the buzzer first.
- She didn't press it properly.

1854
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:03,470
- I pressed the buzzer first.
- I know you did.

1855
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:04,820
You should have pressed it properly.

1856
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:06,910
This is unfair
because she pressed it first.

1857
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,160
- To be honest...
- Ji Hee.

1858
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,760
Tell us right away
if she gets the moves wrong.

1859
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,530
- Ji Hee, do you remember this?
- This is the first move.

1860
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:15,360
- Ji Hee, look at this.
- This is the first move.

1861
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,590
- Ji Hee.
- Ji Hee.

1862
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:17,660
Don't look in that direction.

1863
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,660
(The other team
continues to distract her.)

1864
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:20,820
Music, cue.

1865
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:21,930
Then comes the hip move.

1866
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:22,990
That's right.

1867
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:25,570
- All right.
- Music.

1868
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,800
Move to the rhythm.

1869
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,910
Ji Hee.

1870
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:31,070
Do the Dog Leg Dance.

1871
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:33,050
One, two, three, four.

1872
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,280
- Not yet!
- "Not yet!"

1873
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,570
Two, three, four.

1874
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:38,390
- One, two, three, four.
- It begins here.

1875
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:40,180
- Okay.
- Open your hands.

1876
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,890
- That's good.
- One, two, three, four.

1877
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:43,550
- The next move.
- The right arm.

1878
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,390
The right arm. That's good.

1879
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:47,050
- You are doing well.
- You are doing well.

1880
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,720
- You are doing well.
- That's good.

1881
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,300
Then comes the hip move.

1882
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,820
- Yes.
- The hip move.

1883
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,120
- That's good.
- The hip move.

1884
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,800
- No.
- That's correct.

1885
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,930
- Out.
- That's correct.

1886
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:57,930
You shake your hips.

1887
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:00,430
(Ji Hee failed.)

1888
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,570
- Show us.
- You shake your hips.

1889
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:02,840
- We will give it a try.
- We will give it a try.

1890
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,550
- You shake your hips.
- We will give it a try.

1891
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:05,700
Music, cue.

1892
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:07,570
- Go easy on me.
- Listen up.

1893
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:09,070
There are criteria.

1894
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:12,390
Your fingers need to be
in the correct position.

1895
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,050
- I did this.
- Ms. Yeom.

1896
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:15,260
- Ms. Yeom.
- You are so strict.

1897
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,450
You didn't do that earlier.

1898
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:17,950
You did this earlier.

1899
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:20,120
That's different.

1900
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,200
- You danced haphazardly.
- How dare you talk back to me?

1901
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:26,660
(She yells at them when she is cornered.)

1902
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,760
I mean...

1903
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,240
I am the law.

1904
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,240
- You didn't do this earlier.
- You got the move wrong.

1905
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,410
- I got the move wrong?
- Ms. Yeom, you did this earlier.

1906
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:37,780
(Blatant cheating)

1907
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,220
- All right.
- Let's see it.

1908
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,070
If Jun Hwan succeeds, give him two points.

1909
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,950
- Okay.
- Music, cue.

1910
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:47,340
- All right. Do the moves cleanly.
- Jun Hwan, good luck.

1911
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:49,990
Let's get it.

1912
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:51,120
Have fun.

1913
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,280
- Have fun.
- Okay.

1914
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:56,160
Oh, yes. Let's go.

1915
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:58,390
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1916
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:00,120
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

1917
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,470
- That's good.
- He is doing the move cleanly.

1918
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:04,030
- Spread your legs.
- The textbook example.

1919
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:05,340
That's good.

1920
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:06,870
- Okay.
- All right.

1921
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,840
- Oh, yes.
- That's good.

1922
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,610
- He is on another level.
- Let's go.

1923
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:12,340
- Heave-ho.
- He is good.

1924
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:13,950
- Heave-ho.
- Heave-ho.

1925
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,120
- Is that correct?
- Is that correct?

1926
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,280
- That's correct.
- Out.

1927
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,090
(Out)

1928
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:23,780
- That's correct.
- No, it isn't.

1929
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:25,360
- Then what's the correct move?
- Isn't this it?

1930
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:28,200
- This is it.
- This is the correct move.

1931
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:30,360
This is it, right?

1932
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,160
- Isn't this it?
- No.

1933
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,590
Isn't this it?

1934
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:37,430
- No.
- Ms. Yeom, isn't this it?

1935
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,800
(It turns into a comical dance.)

1936
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,010
- You might be right.
- Isn't this it?

1937
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:43,430
If I remember correctly...

1938
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:45,070
(Ms. Yeom begins to get confused.)

1939
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,910
What he did was close.

1940
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,720
Would you show us the moves?

1941
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:50,050
Can you redo them?

1942
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,550
- Can you redo them?
- Of course.

1943
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:53,450
- Please show us the moves.
- Show us.

1944
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:54,590
Please show us the moves.

1945
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:55,720
Shall I do it without music?

1946
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:57,450
- No.
- Please do it by yourself.

1947
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:58,550
All right.

1948
01:01:58,550 --> 01:01:59,780
Ms. Yeom, this is the third move.

1949
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:01,620
- No. Hold on.
- This is the third move.

1950
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,660
- Ms. Yeom, this is it.
- What was it?

1951
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,390
(She asks her assistant for help.)

1952
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:07,220
- Don't look.
- Don't look.

1953
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,590
- Don't look.
- We need to cover her.

1954
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:09,660
- Cover her.
- We need to cover her.

1955
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:10,930
We need to cover her.

1956
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:12,740
(Grandmaestro is on her own now.)

1957
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:13,840
Let's go.

1958
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,610
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

1959
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:16,640
Is this it?

1960
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:18,470
Keep going.

1961
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:20,050
- All right.
- Let's go.

1962
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,470
- She doesn't know.
- She keeps stealing glances.

1963
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:22,720
The next move.

1964
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,780
(She begins the 2nd move.)

1965
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,320
It looks strange.

1966
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,780
- It looks strange.
- Let's go.

1967
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:35,450
(She begins to do a silly dance.)

1968
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:37,360
- That's wrong.
- Ms. Yeom.

1969
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,890
You don't know the moves.

1970
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:41,840
How are you supposed to judge
when you don't know the moves?

1971
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:44,570
Where did this move come from?

1972
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:46,740
- I was on "Infinite Challenge."
- Where did this move come from?

1973
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,410
I was on "Infinite Challenge."

1974
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:51,110
That was insane.

1975
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:52,370
That was unbelievable.

1976
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:55,280
What was the move? What was it?

1977
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:56,870
- That was so funny.
- Was that the move?

1978
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:58,120
Ji Hee was close.

1979
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,120
- I was close.
- Seriously.

1980
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,390
- Ji Hee was close.
- I was close.

1981
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:02,390
Ji Hee was close.

1982
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:04,780
I am sorry. All right.

1983
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,160
Three points to them.

1984
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,820
Three points to them.

1985
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:09,930
She was correct.

1986
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:11,050
Really?

1987
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:12,700
This is the move.

1988
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,220
- She was correct.
- Let's move on.

1989
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,570
- She was correct.
- She was correct.

1990
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:16,640
I was correct, right?

1991
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,010
- She did well.
- I was correct.

1992
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:19,740
She was correct.

1993
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,930
Since it was a bad call,
the score is 1 to 1.

1994
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:23,700
- The last round.
- Okay.

1995
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,740
- The last round.
- That's good.

1996
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,510
- Let's win.
- The last round.

1997
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:30,740
I think we will win
if you press the buzzer first.

1998
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,740
- He has a bad memory.
- He can't remember the moves.

1999
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,780
You should press the buzzer
after the fourth move.

2000
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:36,010
- The fourth move.
- This is hard.

2001
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:38,180
- Here comes the last round.
- This is hard.

2002
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,530
All right. The next song is...

2003
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,620
"We Will Rock You," okay?

2004
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:43,720
"We Will Rock You."

2005
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,970
(The song for the last round is
"We Will Rock You.")

2006
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:46,890
- The third song, cue.
- The music...

2007
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:48,530
The music hasn't started yet, right?

2008
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:50,570
Bam, bam, bam.

2009
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:51,610
(1st move)

2010
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:53,070
It's cool.

2011
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,340
(2nd move)

2012
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:59,510
(3rd move)

2013
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,800
Rock you.

2014
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,550
(4th move)

2015
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:06,320
These moves are hard.

2016
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,680
- You should hit the buzzer.
- I forgot the moves already.

2017
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,360
- You should hit the buzzer.
- I forgot the moves already.

2018
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:11,280
(Flinching)

2019
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:13,280
- That's good. Okay.
- Hit it.

2020
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,090
- Okay.
- Okay.

2021
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,820
Jun Hwan, Ji Hee attacked you.

2022
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,300
- Okay.
- Jun Hwan.

2023
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,620
The moves were simple.

2024
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:21,660
Music,

2025
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:23,530
- cue.
- Your fingers are important.

2026
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,240
We are set.

2027
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:27,140
- We are set.
- Out.

2028
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,930
- Why?
- We won.

2029
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:30,470
Out.

2030
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:32,140
- Why?
- Why?

2031
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,970
He should have begun
as soon as the music started.

2032
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,450
- You had an interval.
- No, I didn't.

2033
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:38,820
Earlier...

2034
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:41,120
- You didn't begin right away.
- Yes, I did.

2035
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:42,780
- She began right away.
- I said, "Bam, bam, bam."

2036
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:44,590
You shouldn't show them the move.

2037
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:45,950
You should cut him some slack.

2038
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,120
- I won't do that.
- She is a tyrant.

2039
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,530
- Ms. Yeom.
- He worked hard...

2040
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:51,220
at the Olympics.

2041
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:54,070
She should receive a doping test.

2042
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:56,390
- You know who he is, right?
- Cha Jun Hwan, a skater.

2043
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:57,470
Sorry.

2044
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:01,470
(She didn't know who he was.)

2045
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:03,930
(Grandmaestro didn't have
much interest in her students.)

2046
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,140
- Ms. Yeom...
- I...

2047
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:07,510
She only cares about
"Infinite Challenge" and herself.

2048
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:08,550
I only care about myself.

2049
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:10,680
It's so funny
that she didn't know who he was.

2050
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,890
- I thought...
- You know now.

2051
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:14,910
he was an idol singer.

2052
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:16,660
I thought he was an idol singer.

2053
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,620
With a score of 2 to 1, Team Ji Hee won.

2054
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:20,930
Okay.

2055
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:23,050
You did well to hit the buzzer.

2056
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:24,800
- Yes.
- You did well to hit the buzzer.

2057
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,620
Good job. It was hard.

2058
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:30,240
- It was hard.
- It was good to see Ms. Yeom again.

2059
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,510
It was good to see Ms. Yeom again.

2060
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:34,510
Let's give a round of applause
to Ms. Jang Yoo Ri too.

2061
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:35,680
Thank you for your hard work.

2062
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:37,510
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2063
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:38,570
Thank you.

2064
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:39,610
- I laughed so much.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2065
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:40,610
You are the best.

2066
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:42,450
- That was so much fun.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2067
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:44,010
- She was so funny.
- Thank you.

2068
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:45,950
- That was fun.
- That was fun.

2069
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:47,010
What?

2070
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,160
Ms. Yeom.

2071
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:51,620
(She walks into a wall.)

2072
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:53,760
- Ms. Yeom, it's this way.
- You can head out this way.

2073
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:54,950
- It's this way.
- I mean...

2074
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,200
- It's this way.
- Do you want to go this way?

2075
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,550
I will draw the curtains.

2076
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:59,030
You can go this way.

2077
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:00,530
- Until the end...
- You can go this way.

2078
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:01,970
- All right.
- I will help you.

2079
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:03,800
- All right.
- I won't go further. Bye.

2080
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:06,430
- She left.
- Good job.

2081
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:08,640
Good job.

2082
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,680
(Se Chan saw her out.)

2083
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:11,700
That was so funny.

2084
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,280
- That was so funny.
- Seriously.

2085
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,570
You did a good job of seeing her out.

2086
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,510
- I helped her out.
- That was so funny.

2087
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:18,050
- All right.
- I laughed so much.

2088
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:21,320
With a final score of 8 to 4,

2089
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,410
Team Ji Hee won.

2090
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:24,930
(Team Ji Hee won the first mission.)

2091
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:26,260
- Nice.
- We won.

2092
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:27,680
- It was the 1st game.
- It was the 1st game.

2093
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:29,300
- Other games remain.
- Thus,

2094
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:32,930
- Captain Ji Hee gets 300 dollars.
- What?

2095
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:34,320
- You get 300 dollars.
- You get 300 dollars.

2096
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:36,430
Ji Hee, you are the best.

2097
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:40,010
- Captain Jun Hwan gets 150 dollars.
- Okay.

2098
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:42,200
Ji Hee, you are the best.

2099
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,930
All right. Please decide on the amount...

2100
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:47,110
- you will give to each member.
- You need to distribute the money.

2101
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,010
Please write it down secretly.

2102
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:50,870
- You need to distribute the money.
- However,

2103
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,340
you can't give the same amount of money.

2104
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:53,890
You can't give ten dollars to each member.

2105
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,820
- The amount must be different.
- I see.

2106
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:58,180
- Please write down the amount.
- We believe in you.

2107
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,030
Here is what other members will do.

2108
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:03,860
If you think you will receive
the smallest amount of money,

2109
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:07,760
put the revolt card into the envelope...

2110
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:10,890
- and put it down.
- Come on.

2111
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:12,910
- We don't need to do that.
- It won't be me.

2112
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:14,910
There is no need for a rebellion.
We should keep things peaceful.

2113
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:16,870
- I believe in my team members.
- We should keep things peaceful.

2114
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:17,930
Think about it.

2115
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:20,110
- I won't do such a thing.
- Who would do that?

2116
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:21,200
I won't do such a thing.

2117
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,680
I rooted for you so much.

2118
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,620
- Jun Hwan, we trust you.
- We trust you.

2119
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:27,010
That's right.

2120
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,050
(How will the two captains
distribute the money?)

2121
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:29,990
Ji Hee, I won't revolt.

2122
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:31,680
Of course not.

2123
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,220
- Why would you do that?
- I won't revolt.

2124
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:36,430
She will give us
the right amount of money.

2125
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,120
This makes me think.

2126
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,890
I can't consult Captain Cha, right?

2127
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,590
(The two captains started off
with a small amount of money.)

2128
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:45,510
She will give us
the right amount of money.

2129
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:47,010
Then we can thank her.

2130
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:49,800
Jae Suk, I think Jun Hwan will give us...

2131
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,410
a lot of money.

2132
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:53,050
- Of course.
- It's the first time,

2133
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:55,820
so he won't give someone a dollar...

2134
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:57,410
- and someone else 50 dollars.
- That's right.

2135
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,390
Thus...

2136
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:01,050
(Did Captain Cha distribute the money
as Se Chan predicted?)

2137
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:02,180
Are you done already?

2138
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:03,550
- Are you done already?
- Why...

2139
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:04,550
(Captain Jin
hurriedly distributes the money.)

2140
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:06,120
- Put it down.
- All right, everyone.

2141
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:08,620
Pick up one envelope.

2142
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:10,300
Okay. Here is my decision.

2143
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,930
There is no need to revolt.

2144
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:15,490
He looked at me with his kind eyes.

2145
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:16,530
That's right.

2146
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,430
Make sure other people can't see
your envelope.

2147
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:20,610
(What did Captain Cha's smile mean?)

2148
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:22,280
This is nerve-racking.

2149
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,610
Look me in the eye.

2150
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:26,680
I made an effort
to distribute the money evenly.

2151
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,050
- You made an effort.
- Now,

2152
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,720
Captain Cha will reveal the amounts first.

2153
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,180
Captain Cha, we trust you.

2154
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,340
Captain Cha, please reveal the amounts.

2155
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:37,120
How much?

2156
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,630
- How much?
- What are the amounts?

2157
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:41,960
He gave 35, 30, 33, and 50 dollars.

2158
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,830
- Did he give me 32 dollars?
- What?

2159
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:45,070
He gave a lot of money.

2160
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,500
- He gave a lot of money.
- That's a lot.

2161
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,570
- That's a lot.
- Why did he give so much?

2162
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:50,290
- There was no reason to revolt.
- Hold on.

2163
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:51,800
Ji Hee's facial expression changed.

2164
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,760
He distributed 150 dollars pretty evenly.

2165
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,580
Please reveal
whether or not you will revolt.

2166
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:56,630
One, two, three.

2167
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,110
(Captain Jun Hwan)

2168
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:03,580
(If Se Chan decided to revolt,
the amounts will be switched.)

2169
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:04,750
I chose to revolt.

2170
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,210
(I chose to revolt.)

2171
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:07,510
(Se Chan's prediction was spot on.)

2172
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,290
I got additional 18 dollars.

2173
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:10,790
That's great.

2174
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:13,660
Captain Cha has 32 dollars...

2175
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:15,290
and Se Chan has 50 dollars.

2176
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:17,330
You are too much.

2177
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:18,420
I couldn't help it.

2178
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,530
Next.

2179
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,260
Captain Jin, reveal the amounts.

2180
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:22,460
I trusted you.

2181
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,040
- Let's see the amounts.
- Okay.

2182
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:26,370
- What are the amounts?
- She gave 70, 40, 80, 30,

2183
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,430
and 80 dollars.

2184
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:28,500
(Suk Jin received the smallest amount.)

2185
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,540
- She gave a lot.
- Did I get 30 dollars?

2186
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,740
Haha got 40 dollars.

2187
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:33,110
- She gave a lot.
- Suk Jin got 30 dollars.

2188
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:34,540
Why did I get 30 dollars?

2189
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:38,420
Ji Hee, he answered
the most number of questions.

2190
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:40,880
I did my best
and led to a score of 3 to 0.

2191
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,050
- It means...
- Ji Hee.

2192
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:43,990
- Ji Hee just doesn't like him.
- I feel so betrayed.

2193
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,790
Ji Hee, I didn't do much.

2194
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:47,630
Please reveal
whether or not you will revolt.

2195
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:49,250
- Okay.
- I said that I am very trustful.

2196
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,220
One, two, three.

2197
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,720
(Haha chose to revolt.)

2198
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,070
Suk Jin.

2199
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:56,590
Suk Jin.

2200
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,170
- Suk Jin.
- This team is ruined.

2201
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:01,070
(Captain Jin got backstabbed
after trusting Suk Jin.)

2202
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:03,170
- I know what you are thinking.
- I thought it would be me.

2203
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:06,040
Jun Hwan and Ji Hee are too nice.

2204
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,040
They are nice.

2205
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,140
Had I been the captain,

2206
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:09,840
everyone would have gotten
less than a dollar.

2207
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,640
- Seriously.
- I would have given...

2208
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,950
- something like 30 cents.
- I would have given nothing.

2209
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:16,160
Haha, you will receive half the amount.

2210
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:17,380
How about me?

2211
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,290
Suk Jin will receive 80 dollars.

2212
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:21,250
- Ji Hee will receive 30 dollars.
- The amounts got switched.

2213
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,390
Okay.

2214
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:25,420
Captain Jin, you can send
one member to the other team.

2215
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:26,920
- I will do that.
- Okay.

2216
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,000
Me?

2217
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:29,760
I will do that.

2218
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,760
(She sends Suk Jin without hesitation.)

2219
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:35,430
- Like I said...
- It doesn't have to be me.

2220
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:37,170
- Okay.
- It can be someone else.

2221
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:38,800
- It's okay. Bye.
- Are you certain?

2222
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,280
Jun Hwan.

2223
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,780
(His attitude changes right away.)

2224
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,970
- Bye.
- I came back to you.

2225
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:46,180
We are set.

2226
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:47,920
- Good job.
- Dad and son.

2227
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,010
- Good job.
- Suk Jin.

2228
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:50,360
- Dad and son.
- They are together again.

2229
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,920
Now, Team Jun Hwan has 5 members
and Team Ji Hee has 4 members.

2230
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,830
In this mission,
you can win some bonus money.

2231
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:59,920
It's the Sticky Slap-Match.

2232
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,960
- Okay.
- It's the game of slap-match.

2233
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,240
But we...

2234
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,390
- We will be fine.
- We will be fine.

2235
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:06,910
You will have 5 rounds
of the 1-on-1 slap-match game.

2236
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:10,170
Unlike the regular slap-match game,

2237
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:12,080
- you will use clay.
- Clay?

2238
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:14,670
You will throw your clay first.

2239
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:18,340
Then you will win if you can lift up
the opponent's clay with yours.

2240
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:19,510
You need to make them stick.

2241
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:20,540
(You will win if you can lift up
the opponent's clay with yours.)

2242
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,010
- You will win if you can do that.
- I get it.

2243
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:25,290
- You need the other piece.
- You need to make them stick.

2244
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:28,160
- It will require a good aim.
- Okay.

2245
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,200
That's right.

2246
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,890
Please decide on the order.

2247
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:32,790
Suk Jin will go first.

2248
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:34,720
- Okay.
- Who will go first?

2249
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,090
Shall I go first?

2250
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:38,740
I guess Ji Hyo is confident.
She wants to go first.

2251
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,370
- Please put it on the floor first.
- It might come off.

2252
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:41,800
Make sure it doesn't happen.

2253
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,380
He is the weak link.

2254
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:46,670
Let's begin.

2255
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,710
- Like this.
- Will he be able to succeed?

2256
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:50,840
- Watch.
- Would you root for me?

2257
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,750
- Okay.
- For goodness' sake.

2258
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,140
Aren't we a team?

2259
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:57,250
Suk Jin!

2260
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:59,380
For whom does he fight?

2261
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:02,530
- He is an individualist.
- I will fight for Jun Hwan.

2262
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:04,250
- Is he on our team?
- Jun Hwan.

2263
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:05,390
Here I go.

2264
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:07,830
It's weak.

2265
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:09,130
He is on our team.

2266
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:10,960
- Hold on.
- He is on our team.

2267
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,540
- What are you talking about?
- Is he on our team?

2268
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,170
- I am sorry.
- We are teammates.

2269
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:15,470
- It's weak.
- Make a square.

2270
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:17,170
- Here I go.
- Good luck.

2271
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,170
- Okay.
- He got it.

2272
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:21,880
(He hit Ji Hyo's piece!)

2273
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,010
- I got it, right?
- Separate them.

2274
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:26,380
- They stuck together.
- They should stick together.

2275
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:28,010
- I just need to lift it up.
- He got it.

2276
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,550
- They stuck together.
- He doesn't know the rules.

2277
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:31,010
They stuck together.

2278
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,460
Okay.

2279
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,180
(Suk Jin succeeded.)

2280
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:37,660
The score is 1 to 0.
Next players, come forward.

2281
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:38,720
Okay.

2282
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,290
- So Min, do you want to go next?
- Sure.

2283
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:42,090
- Who are the next players?
- We will have a referee.

2284
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:43,960
- So Min, this is how you do it.
- When you are playing defense,

2285
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:46,210
you shouldn't do this.

2286
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:47,430
Shall I go next?

2287
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:48,910
- Do you want to go next?
- Use your strength.

2288
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:50,380
Shape the clay like this
when you play defense.

2289
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:52,410
Make a square
so that they can't lift it up.

2290
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,710
(Ignoring)

2291
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:58,040
- No.
- So Min, play rock-paper-scissors.

2292
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,840
- It will stick better.
- You should do this instead.

2293
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,710
- So Min, it will stick better.
- You should do this instead.

2294
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,360
Do this instead
so that they can't lift it up.

2295
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,720
That works too.

2296
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,530
What is this?

2297
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,130
You should aim to attack first.

2298
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,870
That's too...

2299
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:14,830
If you do that,
it will be easy to lift up.

2300
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:16,370
(She doesn't listen to her teammates.)

2301
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:18,000
So Min is doing well.

2302
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,670
This is ours, right?

2303
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:20,930
(Polite)

2304
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,540
You know, Ji Hee and Jun Hwan
met again after 11 years,

2305
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:28,040
but they aren't having a conversation.

2306
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,780
- This is strange.
- We don't have time to do that.

2307
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,280
We are busy playing games.

2308
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,790
- They met again after 11 years.
- Shall we have a match?

2309
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:35,550
- Let's do that.
- Let's have a match.

2310
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,750
You should do this instead.

2311
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,180
- Have you done this before?
- No.

2312
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,530
That's good. They won't get it.

2313
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:44,030
It's my first time touching clay
since elementary school.

2314
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:45,790
I didn't even use it in elementary school.

2315
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:46,830
You should do this instead.

2316
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:48,370
Let's begin now.

2317
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:49,700
This would work if you play offense.

2318
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:50,960
- It's a snake.
- So Min.

2319
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,540
- It's a snake.
- It's a snake.

2320
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:53,540
It's a snake.

2321
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:54,610
It looks like a boa constrictor.

2322
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:56,170
They won't be able to lift it up.

2323
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:57,280
She did well.

2324
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,640
Just make it stick.

2325
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,750
You got this.

2326
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,410
- Good luck.
- That's good.

2327
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,140
- All right.
- Let's see what happens.

2328
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,210
- What?
- No!

2329
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:08,960
(Haha missed.)

2330
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,820
(The expert of the slap-match game
embarrassed himself.)

2331
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:12,290
There is no need to throw so hard.

2332
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:14,660
- Good job.
- Go ahead and make it long.

2333
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:16,030
- What happened?
- Hold on.

2334
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:18,460
- Let's go.
- Just envelope it.

2335
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:20,090
- What?
- Just envelope it.

2336
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:21,590
(So Min doesn't listen.)

2337
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,960
- Here I go.
- Hurry up.

2338
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:24,570
So Min...

2339
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:28,070
is bad at games,
but she is unbelievably stubborn.

2340
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:31,430
- Seriously.
- Hurry up.

2341
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:32,500
(A 37-year-old who doesn't listen)

2342
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,040
You didn't listen
to your parents, did you?

2343
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,340
Be quiet!

2344
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:37,840
You didn't listen
to your parents, did you?

2345
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,880
(The daughter who is
going through puberty explodes.)

2346
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,790
- It's over.
- Be quiet.

2347
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:43,620
- Be quiet.
- Why did you miss it?

2348
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,250
So Min.

2349
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:47,130
- Will you shape the clay again?
- Shape it.

2350
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:49,250
You should have done that in advance.

2351
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,220
You should lump it together.

2352
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:55,000
You should do that when it's your turn.

2353
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,630
Mind your business and...

2354
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:59,070
use that method when you play the game.

2355
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:00,540
Stop telling me what to do.

2356
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:04,930
Gosh, I am so annoyed!

2357
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:09,380
(The big brother is annoyed
because of his younger sister.)

2358
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,540
If you do that...

2359
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,320
- Go ahead.
- If you do that, they will get it.

2360
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,620
- You got it.
- Go ahead.

2361
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:14,790
- They will get it.
- You got it.

2362
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:16,120
- You got it.
- Lift it up.

2363
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,420
You got it.

2364
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:18,620
- Did you succeed?
- Come on.

2365
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:19,960
- Turn it upside down.
- Go ahead.

2366
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,220
- You can do that.
- You succeeded.

2367
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:22,890
- It counts.
- It counts.

2368
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:24,030
- It counts.
- He grabbed it.

2369
01:15:24,030 --> 01:15:25,330
- I used techniques.
- Okay.

2370
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:26,530
- Okay.
- The next players.

2371
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:29,500
- Jun Hwan.
- Why don't you listen?

2372
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,330
- All right.
- Who will go next?

2373
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:32,960
- Ji Hee should go next.
- Next.

2374
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,110
- I will go next.
- They met again after ten years.

2375
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:37,240
They finally met again after 11 years.

2376
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,630
- Ta-da.
- They will go against each other.

2377
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:39,640
(They will go against each other
after 11 years.)

2378
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:41,380
They finally met again after 11 years.

2379
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:42,780
- Okay.
- You took a long time.

2380
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,040
- Hit it.
- There you go.

2381
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,080
(Team Jun Hwan attacks first.)

2382
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,750
(How well can Jun Hwan
control his ttakji?)

2383
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:47,950
That's it, Jun Hwan.

2384
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:49,080
- Hit it.
- There you go.

2385
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,710
- You will miss.
- That's it, Jun Hwan.

2386
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:53,790
(What?)

2387
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:55,750
(Jun Hwan's clay didn't even go near.)

2388
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,130
Jun Hwan.

2389
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,570
(Laughing)

2390
01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:00,720
That was cute.

2391
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,070
- He missed.
- He missed.

2392
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:03,960
- All right, Ji Hee.
- He missed.

2393
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,540
- He missed.
- It was right there.

2394
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:07,070
- Jun Hwan.
- It's hard, right?

2395
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:08,610
- It's hard, right?
- You need to throw it down.

2396
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,710
Don't act like you are good at this game.

2397
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:12,250
- I should roll it up.
- All right.

2398
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:13,750
I should roll it up too.

2399
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:15,950
- I think it will be easy.
- It won't be easy for Ji Hee.

2400
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:17,540
It's the hardest
when it's shaped like a worm.

2401
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,340
- He is spreading it.
- When it's shaped like a worm...

2402
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:21,320
Ji Hee will win.

2403
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:22,860
- Ji Hee will win.
- It won't be easy.

2404
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:23,960
- Ji Hee.
- Ji Hee will totally win.

2405
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,080
- Ji Hee.
- She won.

2406
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,530
- She won.
- She won't lift it up.

2407
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:28,580
(She hits his clay!)

2408
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:29,860
- She will lift it up.
- No.

2409
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,700
- Grab the end.
- Lift it up.

2410
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:32,960
- Don't press it down.
- She won.

2411
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:35,260
It's over.

2412
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,830
- Lift it up.
- It's over.

2413
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:38,760
- Lift it up.
- Don't press it down.

2414
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,260
- Okay.
- Hold on.

2415
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:42,380
(She failed.)

2416
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,240
He pressed his clay on the floor too much.

2417
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,840
- That's not true.
- That's not true.

2418
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,170
It's sticking too much.

2419
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:48,380
That's not true.

2420
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:50,250
- You didn't say anything earlier.
- You are just wrong.

2421
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:52,010
Unbelievable.

2422
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:53,510
He pressed his clay on the floor.

2423
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:55,490
- No, he didn't.
- No?

2424
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:57,420
- No, he didn't.
- Then we will do the same.

2425
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:58,750
Okay.

2426
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:01,880
We will stick our clay on the floor
so that you can't lift it up.

2427
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,250
- I will do that.
- If you hit it,

2428
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:04,720
- you will succeed.
- Aim well.

2429
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,920
I will spread it like a pancake.

2430
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,500
- A bit more.
- Are you listening?

2431
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:11,890
- What?
- I will spread it like a pancake.

2432
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:13,710
- Okay.
- Okay.

2433
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:15,040
(The slap-match thug became absorbed.)

2434
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,630
I don't know
why I am playing so diligently.

2435
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:19,300
- That's good.
- You should play diligently.

2436
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,750
Ji Hee is diligent in everything.

2437
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,000
Good.

2438
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:23,320
- Good.
- All done.

2439
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,080
- Jun Hwan, just hit it.
- Hit it.

2440
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,290
Okay.

2441
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:28,180
- Jun Hwan.
- Jun Hwan, just hit it.

2442
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:29,360
Hit it.

2443
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,680
(He misses again.)

2444
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,180
- Jun Hwan, it's okay.
- It was cute.

2445
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,330
- You are done.
- Hey.

2446
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:35,180
You are as bad as me.

2447
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:36,550
(You are as bad as me.)

2448
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:38,500
- Jun Hwan, it's okay.
- It was cute.

2449
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,960
You just need to hit it now.

2450
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,220
You are as bad as me.

2451
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:42,830
It must be because there is no ice.

2452
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:44,960
- With this...
- Yes.

2453
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,130
Ji Hee.

2454
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:47,540
- My hands...
- Look at my hands.

2455
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:50,380
- Look at my hands.
- We haven't even had our turns.

2456
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:51,970
I did well to pick the white clay, right?

2457
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:54,110
Your hands will turn white.

2458
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:55,380
The white color is fine.

2459
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:56,450
(The white color is fine.)

2460
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:59,420
(Teasing tone)

2461
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,290
(For goodness' sake.)

2462
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:03,820
It's better than orange.

2463
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:04,990
- Jae Suk.
- It isn't so apparent.

2464
01:18:04,990 --> 01:18:06,160
Please go against Jong Kook.

2465
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,990
- Good.
- He is unbelievable.

2466
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:09,660
Our clay looks like a dumpling wrapper.

2467
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:11,660
That's right. It's fine.
The white color is fine.

2468
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,960
The white color is pretty.

2469
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:16,130
Our clay looks like a carrot.

2470
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:17,830
How is that a carrot?

2471
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:19,170
- It's a thin carrot.
- A carrot.

2472
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:20,540
It's the worm poop.

2473
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:22,040
It looks like a sweet potato stem.

2474
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:24,040
I can't tease Jun Hwan.

2475
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:26,450
- Attack, Ji Hee.
- Hurry up.

2476
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:28,950
- Spread it and hit his clay.
- We are equally bad at this.

2477
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:30,170
Spread it and hit his clay.

2478
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:31,970
- Keep it close.
- Okay.

2479
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:33,210
Think of hitting it with your hand.

2480
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:34,880
- Put it on your palm.
- I will use my palm.

2481
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:35,960
- That's it.
- That's it.

2482
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,860
(She hits it!)

2483
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:38,880
- Did I get it?
- Good job.

2484
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,550
- Did I get it?
- Good job.

2485
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:41,750
Lift it up,

2486
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,550
- Don't press it down.
- I won't do that.

2487
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:45,160
- She won't press it down.
- Hurry up.

2488
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,290
- Hold on.
- That's good.

2489
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:47,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

2490
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,570
- That's how you do it.
- That's good.

2491
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:49,960
- Okay.
- Okay.

2492
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,260
That's how you do it. Good job.

2493
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,760
- Okay.
- You did well, Ji Hee.

2494
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:54,330
- All right.
- It was fun.

2495
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:55,330
Okay.

2496
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:56,970
- Jae Suk, you go.
- Okay.

2497
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:58,910
You should show them something.
You're the king of slap-match.

2498
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:00,800
Okay. Bring it on.

2499
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,670
One on one? Okay.
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2500
01:19:02,670 --> 01:19:03,670
Jae Suk, you have to win.

2501
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:05,210
You should win. Prove yourself.

2502
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,450
Show them something.

2503
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:07,790
You have a snake around your neck.

2504
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:09,120
- Good luck.
- This isn't right.

2505
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,710
You should do this.

2506
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:11,710
(You should do this.)

2507
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,380
This is what you should do.

2508
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:15,630
- Good luck.
- That's gross.

2509
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:17,250
Okay. I'll listen to music.

2510
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,290
My goodness.

2511
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,530
(He's wearing
his new Bluetooth earphones.)

2512
01:19:20,530 --> 01:19:21,890
- It looks real.
- It looks so real.

2513
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:22,890
You look good.

2514
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:24,130
- Okay.
- My gosh.

2515
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:25,130
(He calms himself down
by listening to music before a match.)

2516
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:26,570
- Okay.
- All right.

2517
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,800
You can't touch your clay when you defend.

2518
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,540
- Okay.
- We can't touch it.

2519
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:32,210
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

2520
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:33,210
(A surprise attack)

2521
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:34,280
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

2522
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,450
(Startled)

2523
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:37,710
Why?

2524
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:38,820
- What's wrong?
- Is that what we're doing?

2525
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:40,820
- Okay. Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

2526
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:42,140
- Okay.
- He lost.

2527
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:43,820
- Okay.
- He lost again.

2528
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,360
- Good luck.
- Why did you lose?

2529
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,380
Okay.

2530
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,550
Place your clay.

2531
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:49,790
You should do that.

2532
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:51,420
- Go ahead and do it.
- All right.

2533
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,420
- This is perfect.
- It looks good.

2534
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:54,920
This is so easy.

2535
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,500
- Do it.
- This is no big deal.

2536
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,540
Right on here...

2537
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:00,800
- Do it.
- This is no big deal.

2538
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,710
Right on here...

2539
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:04,210
(He fails to hit Jae Suk's clay.)

2540
01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:05,240
Leave it as it is.

2541
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,080
- It's Jae Suk's turn.
- Leave it as it is.

2542
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,580
- Just leave it be.
- This isn't easy.

2543
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:10,780
- I mean...
- It's not easy.

2544
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:12,280
- I know. I agree.
- Okay.

2545
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,990
- Go ahead and do it.
- All right.

2546
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:15,420
- Let's go.
- This is a chance.

2547
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:16,880
- I can do this.
- It's not easy.

2548
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,360
- Give it a try.
- Gosh, this is...

2549
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,220
Spread it thin.

2550
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,880
A little...

2551
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,220
(Touching)

2552
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:25,890
(Pressing it down)

2553
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:27,630
(Grinning)

2554
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:28,720
Why are your hands sweating?

2555
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:29,790
What did you do?

2556
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:30,870
Did you just press it down?

2557
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:32,290
- What did I do?
- I think you pressed it here.

2558
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:33,410
- Where?
- What is this?

2559
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:35,540
- What about it?
- You can't press it down.

2560
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:38,000
- It has your fingerprint.
- Hang on.

2561
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,380
- Look at this. It's stuck.
- I didn't press it.

2562
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:41,500
My goodness.

2563
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,510
- I didn't press it.
- My gosh.

2564
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:45,170
- Hey.
- What did you just do?

2565
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:47,140
- I can't believe this.
- Hey.

2566
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:49,250
- Did you press it?
- What?

2567
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:50,620
Did you just press it?

2568
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:52,680
- You can't do this.
- Stop fighting.

2569
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,180
- You're not supposed to press it.
- Don't fight.

2570
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:55,530
Why are you doing this to us?

2571
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:57,000
- My gosh.
- Stop fighting.

2572
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,290
Did you step on it?

2573
01:20:58,290 --> 01:21:00,090
It has your footprint on it.

2574
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:03,170
The three of them stepped on it.
It has three different footprints.

2575
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:04,430
- They did it on purpose.
- You can't do that.

2576
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:06,130
- Go ahead and do it.
- Here I go.

2577
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:07,870
- Hurry and just do it.
- Okay.

2578
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:09,240
- Hurry.
- Okay.

2579
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,080
- Hurry and throw it.
- Be careful.

2580
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,040
- Okay.
- Yes.

2581
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,000
(It sits right on Jong Kook's clay.)

2582
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,880
(Embarrassed)

2583
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,970
- It's done.
- All right.

2584
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:20,540
- It's stuck.
- This is perfect.

2585
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:22,320
- Okay.
- All right.

2586
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,360
(Yoo Jae Suk wins.)

2587
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,510
Nice.

2588
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:26,920
- Gosh, this is so upsetting.
- Okay.

2589
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:29,530
- Let's do it one more time.
- I'm really mad.

2590
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:31,630
- Good. You can do this.
- It shouldn't be too hard.

2591
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:33,070
- A moderate amount of strength.
- It's stuck.

2592
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:34,420
Okay.

2593
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:37,430
It needs a moderate amount of strength.
It shouldn't be too hard.

2594
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:40,210
- It doesn't have to be so hard.
- All right.

2595
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:43,040
You get 50 dollars from each round.

2596
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,800
You won 2 rounds, and they won 3 rounds.

2597
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,040
Okay.

2598
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,210
- Yes.
- Nice.

2599
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:49,640
Jun Hwan, don't give me this time.

2600
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:51,670
I don't deserve it.

2601
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:53,010
Ji Hee, give me a lot.

2602
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:54,010
- I did a good job.
- Okay.

2603
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:56,050
- I'm just...
- Well...

2604
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:58,250
I believe in Jun Hwan.

2605
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,990
Let's be honest.

2606
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:02,630
One of us must be the last.

2607
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,000
I think so.

2608
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:05,920
I bet he will give you
the least amount of money.

2609
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,000
I think so.
Because I have a lot of money now.

2610
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,390
- You have a lot of money.
- I think so.

2611
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,210
What about you?
You don't need the revolt card.

2612
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:15,910
So Min, you don't need the revolt card.

2613
01:22:15,910 --> 01:22:17,540
She got the revolt card.
I think that's better.

2614
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:20,670
They try to get
the revolt card every time.

2615
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:23,340
These two... I've been watching them.

2616
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:24,920
They pick the revolt card every time.

2617
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:27,140
Captain Cha, I think you have
a lot of revolts on your team.

2618
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:28,320
I know.

2619
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:31,010
The captains are done
distributing the money.

2620
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,720
- We've made our choices.
- Are you done picking your card?

2621
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,790
Captain Jin, show us the amounts.

2622
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:37,790
My gosh.

2623
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:39,700
- Ji Hee gets 60 dollars.
- My goodness.

2624
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,720
- It's Ji Hyo.
- It's 20, 30, and 40 dollars.

2625
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:42,760
(Ji Hyo received the smallest amount.)

2626
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:43,890
(Ji Hyo gets the lowest amount.)

2627
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:44,890
Okay.

2628
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:46,040
- Well done.
- This is good.

2629
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,110
- This is nice.
- I thought you would understand.

2630
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:48,670
All right. You did a good job.

2631
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:51,040
- Should I go first?
- One, two, and three.

2632
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,910
- Good job.
- We love you, Captain Jin.

2633
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:55,210
- I love my team.
- Well done.

2634
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:58,640
Captain Cha, show us the amounts.

2635
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,420
(Captain Jun Hwan)

2636
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:03,080
It's 30, 20, 20, 14, and 15 dollars.

2637
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,320
It's So Min.

2638
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,680
(So Min received the smallest amount.)

2639
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:08,920
- It's So Min.
- You should've let me pick it.

2640
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,830
See? I knew it. They told me...

2641
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:12,290
Open your cards.

2642
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:13,330
- Okay.
- Open your cards.

2643
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:15,330
- I love you, Captain Cha.
- I love you.

2644
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:17,870
Suk Jin failed to revolt.

2645
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:19,670
- Mine was 15 dollars.
- My gosh.

2646
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:20,760
(She didn't revolt one time
and runs into trouble.)

2647
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,880
- You...
- I should've picked it.

2648
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,380
- Suk Jin is not the last.
- You told me not to pick it.

2649
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,250
It's So Min. She gets 14 dollars.

2650
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:29,170
- Okay.
- I'll get my own way from now on.

2651
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,820
Before you have lunch,

2652
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:34,320
Captain Cha can let go of
one of his team members.

2653
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:35,680
Captain Cha, who would you like to let go?

2654
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:36,920
Captain Cha, listen to me.

2655
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,330
If we have to release one of us,

2656
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:41,460
it should be someone
who can interrupt the opponents.

2657
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:44,200
None of us will interrupt them though.

2658
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,530
- Just pick one.
- Interrupt them...

2659
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:48,720
I pick So Min.

2660
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,040
- But...
- Am I the weak link?

2661
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,210
Pick So Min.

2662
01:23:53,210 --> 01:23:54,540
They are trying to release So Min.

2663
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:55,630
So Min?

2664
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:58,500
- Don't do that.
- Don't be like that.

2665
01:23:58,500 --> 01:23:59,500
What's with all the conspiracy?

2666
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,670
- Jong Kook.
- This is for the game.

2667
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:03,320
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

2668
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:04,320
Why not?

2669
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,880
Just send Suk Jin.

2670
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,140
- Just send Suk Jin.
- We want Suk Jin instead.

2671
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:09,550
Send Suk Jin to us.

2672
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:11,120
We already have judges here.

2673
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,990
We have our judges here.

2674
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:15,050
- Who?
- I pick So Min.

2675
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,130
(I pick So Min.)

2676
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,530
All right. Jeon So Min is the weak link.

2677
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:21,530
We don't want her. She's not cooperative.

2678
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:22,570
Go interrupt them.

2679
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:24,260
- She's not cooperative.
- She's...

2680
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:26,410
not cooperative nor good at games.

2681
01:24:26,410 --> 01:24:28,170
She's not good at games.
And she's not cooperative.

2682
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:29,430
We already have our fair share
of dumb members.

2683
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:30,430
We don't want her.

2684
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:32,000
She keeps picking the revolt card here.

2685
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,450
- I don't want her.
- So Min, you're a spy. Okay?

2686
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:35,910
- Welcome, So Min.
- Take her.

2687
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:37,040
My goodness.

2688
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,340
- Don't do this.
- Jun Hwan is really funny.

2689
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:40,710
He didn't even hesitate.

2690
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:41,820
He was firm.

2691
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:45,120
- Gosh, Jun Hwan.
- Jun Hwan.

2692
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:48,880
Now you can have lunch
before the next game.

2693
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,460
Captain Ji Suk Jin
decided the menu for you.

2694
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:53,030
- All right.
- Look forward to it.

2695
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,920
I'll tell you the exact words he said.

2696
01:24:59,690 --> 01:25:02,320
"Jun Hwan, Ji Hee, and
I will have the rice with grilled eel."

2697
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,260
"The rest of the members
will have a box lunch."

2698
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:05,580
My goodness.

2699
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:06,650
Can you give...

2700
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:09,580
the grilled eel
only to Jun Hwan, Ji Hee, and me?

2701
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,770
What about the rest of the members?

2702
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:15,860
They will just have a box lunch.

2703
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:16,860
I see.

2704
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:19,290
- My goodness. You can't do that.
- You can't treat us differently.

2705
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:21,310
All right. We will bring in the food.

2706
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:23,310
- I did this for you.
- I'm really disappointed.

2707
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:24,310
This is upsetting.

2708
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:25,310
What did we do wrong?

2709
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:26,980
Captain Ji, this is...

2710
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:29,310
We all are supposed to eat well.

2711
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:31,320
He's the only one who gets the eels.

2712
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:34,780
Then I'll have some cup noodles.

2713
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:36,690
- No, you can't.
- It's up to Captain Ji.

2714
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:37,860
- It's just cup noodles.
- Why not?

2715
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,650
- You can't have it.
- I need to eat.

2716
01:25:39,650 --> 01:25:41,480
- Can I buy one myself?
- No.

2717
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:42,760
- We can eat cup noodles.
- No.

2718
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,990
- Why can't I buy one myself?
- Let us eat cup noodles.

2719
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:44,990
This is a democratic country.

2720
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:46,260
- Just eat your lunch.
- This is ridiculous.

2721
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:47,990
- What's wrong with cup noodles?
- Why would you eat cup noodles?

2722
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:49,600
- I want to eat it.
- You should eat a box lunch.

2723
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,970
Why can't I eat cup noodles?

2724
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:52,600
I was going to give you
rice with some dried laver.

2725
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,070
- I can't believe this.
- This is a democratic country.

2726
01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:56,780
- Seriously...
- Just eat your box lunch.

2727
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:58,180
- No.
- I don't allow it.

2728
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:59,900
- I want cup noodles.
- Just eat this.

2729
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,150
I will eat my own cup noodles.

2730
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:03,240
- We will...
- I need some soup.

2731
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:04,940
Do you want some cup noodles?

2732
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,910
I'd be happy to eat it,
but are you done fighting?

2733
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:09,320
Get me three. We will have cup noodles.

2734
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:10,760
Can't I eat my own cup noodles?

2735
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:11,760
You can't.

2736
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,320
- You can't have it.
- Why not?

2737
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:19,790
(They were being so childish that
we fast-forwarded the conversation.)

2738
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:21,230
This is so confusing.

2739
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,490
My brains are shaking.

2740
01:26:23,490 --> 01:26:25,330
I want to eat grilled eels.

2741
01:26:25,330 --> 01:26:26,770
- You can't.
- Sit with your team.

2742
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:29,230
I need cup noodles for this box lunch.

2743
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:30,280
You can't have it.

2744
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,400
Give me one!

2745
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,110
No! I don't want to.

2746
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:35,040
Why can't I have cup noodles?

2747
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,520
- You can't.
- Why not?

2748
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,720
It's the captain's call.

2749
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:39,910
The rice is dry, so I need some soup.

2750
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:43,190
No. Just eat the dry rice.

2751
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:44,760
He said he'd cut down on the cost.

2752
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,890
- What?
- To cut down on the cost...

2753
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:47,530
Then he should quit!

2754
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:48,690
(Then he should quit!)

2755
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,760
I want to eat cup noodles.

2756
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,100
- I want one.
- Hey!

2757
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:53,120
Good luck.

2758
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,290
There's no discipline in Running Man.

2759
01:26:55,290 --> 01:26:56,320
(There's no discipline in Running Man.)

2760
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,290
Hey! Why did you
elect the captain in the first place?

2761
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,230
I have to attend the meeting
in Mok-dong once a week!

2762
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:04,030
I can't believe this.
You should look forward to next week.

2763
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:05,400
Next week, you all...

2764
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:08,150
will have to dress up as women.

2765
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,280
I will dress up like a tough man.

2766
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:14,190
(What will happen to Captain Ji
with no leadership at all?)

2767
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:18,220
(The last match between
the two captains finally begins.)

2768
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,520
I hear the bell.

2769
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,980
(The unique race that
you couldn't even watch at the Olympics)

2770
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:24,650
(The battle between the captains
is getting fiercer and fiercer.)

2771
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:25,950
(Who will be the winner?)

2772
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:28,690
(And...)

2773
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:35,070
(A song that has inextricable link...)

2774
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:40,240
(with Running Man)

2775
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:45,410
(They passionately sing the song
instead of the original artists.)

2776
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:46,780
(What are we going to do today?)

2777
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:48,820
(The BTOB Special...)

2778
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:50,320
(without BTOB)

2779
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:52,280
(A powerful blow...)

2780
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,260
(to get rid of all the disappointment)

2781
01:27:55,230 --> 01:27:57,100
(They stop at nothing to win the race...)

2782
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:59,450
(with their great chemistry of 11 years.)

2783
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,900
(It's been so long.)

2784
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,160
(The BTOB Special without BTOB)
