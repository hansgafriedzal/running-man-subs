1
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,270
Oh, there you were.

2
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,370
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

3
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,870
That's ridiculous.

4
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,050
Jun Hwan. Ji Hee. How do you feel?

5
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,000
Is it less awkward now
compared to the opening?

6
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,110
- Yes.
- We switched our numbers.

7
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,750
- Really?
- Yes.

8
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,540
- Who asked first?
- I did.

9
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,180
Oh, you did?

10
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,310
I promised to treat him.

11
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,590
Right.

12
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,950
We've been filming all day today.

13
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,630
Who do you feel most comfortable with?

14
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,150
- Stop it.
- Seriously.

15
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,000
Jun Hwan. Was there anything
that surprised you?

16
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,360
- Well...
- You can be honest.

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,690
- What surprised me?
- Yes.

18
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,830
(Glancing)

19
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,540
If you felt closer or anything.
What about Suk Jin?

20
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,930
- It's not me, is it?
- You can say it.

21
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,370
I love you.

22
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,440
In the end.

23
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,680
- You think I wouldn't love you?
- They have a strong bond.

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,040
(You think I wouldn't love you?)

25
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,510
They have a strong bond.

26
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,480
(Suk Jin's pretentious statement
gives them goosebumps.)

27
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,220
- You think I wouldn't...
- That's so pretentious.

28
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,960
"You think I wouldn't love you?"

29
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,680
- Wouldn't you?
- My goodness.

30
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,830
- Why did you run away?
- That was so pretentious.

31
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,250
That was his best.

32
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,960
- Do you want to switch?
- No thanks.

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,190
- Hey.
- That's your seat.

34
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,060
I said it on behalf of the whole nation.

35
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,760
On behalf of who? Why did you
say that on behalf of the nation?

36
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,260
I said it on behalf of men my age.

37
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,030
- He's pretentious.
- Do your best.

38
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,400
Ji Hee. Compared to your first time
on Running Man,

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,670
which is better?

40
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,480
- Do you feel better?
- The second time is way better.

41
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,750
- Right?
- Yes.

42
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,370
We became very close today.

43
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,450
Yes. He was the most reliable person.

44
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,540
- Haha?
- Yes.

45
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,750
- Haha?
- He'll betray you. Be careful.

46
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,120
- Why Haha?
- I'd never do that.

47
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,650
- He always betrays.
- Never.

48
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,650
- His eyes look so earnest.
- I mean it.

49
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,060
- That's all fake.
- Really?

50
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,950
He's the best liar
among all Christians I know.

51
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,500
Don't say that.

52
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,330
He's the best liar.

53
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,060
He's the best liar.

54
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,560
- I can't tell from...
- Sit down.

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,670
Wait a minute. Jin Hee. Are you...

56
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,840
- It's Ji Hee.
- Ji Hee.

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,580
- Are you an only child?
- Yes.

58
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,780
She's an only child.

59
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,580
- What about you, Jun Hwan?
- I have a brother.

60
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,580
Does your brother figure skate too?

61
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,750
- Does he...
- No.

62
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,510
- Does he skate too?
- He's in a different field.

63
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,540
What does he do?

64
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,950
He just studies.

65
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,560
- He studies?
- He's a student.

66
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,280
How's your relationship with your brother?

67
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,420
We're close.

68
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,680
- Really?
- Really?

69
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,450
Do you say you love him? Do you give hugs?

70
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,170
You tell your brother you love him?

71
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,200
No.

72
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,570
We never do that.

73
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,700
Between brothers?

74
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,640
- But...
- Say you love him?

75
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,110
Some brothers do that.
Jae Jung does that to his brother.

76
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,540
Jae Jung tells his brother he loves him.

77
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,800
Do you say that to Se Hyeong?

78
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,910
- Do you?
- Do you say that to Se Hyeong?

79
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,580
Are you crazy?

80
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,920
Even if someone pays me to do that,
I can never do it.

81
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,950
- Because he's shy.
- You don't say you love him?

82
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,390
Holding his hand? That's crazy.

83
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,290
That's totally crazy. No way.

84
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,820
Jae Suk. Do you tell your sister
you love her?

85
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,860
Are you crazy?

86
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,360
- You don't?
- Never.

87
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,020
- Never.
- You should try.

88
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,420
Do you tell your brother you love him?

89
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,950
No. That's crazy.

90
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,960
Never.

91
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,420
- Do you say that to your sister?
- I say it often.

92
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,860
- You tell her that you love her?
- I tell her I love her.

93
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,360
- What's wrong with him?
- Even just now.

94
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,700
- What about you, So Min?
- To your brother.

95
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,960
Are you crazy? Never.

96
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,730
- Really?
- I heard her...

97
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,200
cursing at her brother.

98
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,770
Do you say it?

99
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,450
I do.

100
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,950
- I've heard it.
- You do?

101
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,950
- I do.
- What about your brother?

102
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,540
He's like, "Are you crazy?"

103
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,320
Really?

104
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,580
Parents have to tell their children
they love them often.

105
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,050
- To make their children say it.
- Really?

106
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,920
- But how come you don't say it?
- What?

107
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,200
(How come you don't say it to your son?)

108
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,020
I will. I will start saying it soon.

109
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,670
(I will. I will start saying it soon.)

110
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,670
(He's annoyed by the truth.)

111
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,760
We still have lots of time together.

112
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,040
- What's wrong with you?
- Why are you upset?

113
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,260
We still have lots of time left.

114
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,440
What's wrong with you?

115
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,670
Why do you tell others to do it
when you don't?

116
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,140
Because...

117
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,380
- Suk Jin.
- What?

118
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,410
You also have a brother.

119
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,480
- I do.
- Do you?

120
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,110
- Do you call your brother brother?
- Do you say you love him?

121
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,450
(Do you call your brother brother?)

122
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,240
Of course I call him brother.

123
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,740
What else should he call him?

124
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,140
- I can't call him mister.
- He should call him brother.

125
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,160
- I mean, if you love him.
- Why do you get confused?

126
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,110
I mean, do you tell him you love him?

127
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,390
I never had a chance to.

128
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,290
- See?
- I can never do that.

129
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,290
I can't even say it to my younger brother.

130
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,130
I never knew he had a brother.

131
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,420
- I had no idea.
- You too?

132
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,020
Yes. He never talks about himself.

133
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,230
You never asked.
Otherwise, why would I talk about him?

134
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,360
All I know about you is...

135
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
that you like Yang Jung A.

136
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,540
He still remembers it.

137
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,940
And that he'll graduate his marriage
at 60.

138
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,940
- Should I give you your mission?
- Yes.

139
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,580
From the 20s to the 50s,

140
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,670
the last mission will bring
all generations together.

141
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,950
It's Who Rang the Bell.

142
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,290
That sounds fun.

143
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,760
Each team will take turns.

144
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,850
This is the headquarters for Team Offense.

145
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,590
Team Defense will wait outside.

146
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,160
Team Defense has a minute...

147
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,200
to hide anywhere outside.

148
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,200
After the minute,
someone from Team Defense...

149
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,740
will ring the doorbell and hide.

150
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,640
After ten seconds,

151
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,410
the tagger from Team Offense will
go out to find them.

152
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,450
At that moment,
the rest of Team Offense...

153
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,510
will put on the eyepatches
and stay in here like zombies.

154
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,760
And Team Defense outside will
put on a bell.

155
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,450
Oh, my.

156
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,260
That's right.

157
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,660
The rule is simple.

158
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,530
If you touch the doll before the tagger,
you win the point.

159
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,100
- We played it before.
- Yes.

160
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,100
On the other hand, the tagger...

161
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,180
Let's say the tagger saw
Ji Hee over there.

162
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,200
He should say Jin Ji Hee
and touch the doll.

163
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,840
Then Ji Hee is out.

164
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,050
Right. We played it before.

165
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,120
- It's advantageous for the tagger.
- Yes.

166
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,210
If you hide to the end, you get a point.

167
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,260
If you touch the doll first,
you get three points.

168
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
- Touching the doll is better.
- Yes.

169
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,690
- Yes. Touching it is better.
- Though it's dangerous.

170
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,430
But if you don't feel confident,
you can stay hidden.

171
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,890
Either touch the doll
before you get caught...

172
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,700
or hurry up and touch the doll
if you get caught.

173
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,870
- Can we fight?
- Yes, of course.

174
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,460
- Can we go hide?
- We have to hide.

175
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,900
I have bells for those who are hiding.

176
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,310
And I'll give you a radio each.

177
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,530
That's very loud.

178
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,700
- Yes.
- You can talk to each other.

179
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,250
Hey. Se Chan. Do you hear me?

180
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,680
- Do we go out?
- Yes.

181
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,580
I'm not good at hiding.

182
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,850
Do you think it's better to get
a point each by hiding...

183
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,280
or get three points
by touching it like a thug?

184
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,760
We should touch it like a thug.

185
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,850
Let's go for three points.

186
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,500
- Three points?
- Yes, let's go for three points.

187
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,700
- Jun Hwan. Let's go.
- Yes.

188
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,760
Jun Hwan. You should press the bell
since you're fast.

189
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,030
We need to hide. Where should we hide?

190
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,460
I'll go hide.

191
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,510
Where should I go?

192
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,810
I'll go to the other side.

193
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,330
Suk Jin. This is our chance.

194
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,400
That Ji Hee is the tagger.

195
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,950
- Listen to Ji Hee's plan.
- You have a plan?

196
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,950
First, there are many doors.

197
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,550
So you should watch each door.

198
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,410
- This opens too.
- Two doors open.

199
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,220
So you should all stand by the door.

200
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,650
Jong Kook can watch the doll.

201
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,560
I should watch the doll
instead of the door?

202
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,020
What's better?
I think this is most important.

203
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,800
That's true, but if I guard the door,

204
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,030
they pretty much can't use that door.

205
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,370
Then you should guard the biggest door.

206
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,810
That's better.
You should take the big door over there.

207
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,180
Ji Hyo and I will take this door.

208
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,740
- So Min will watch the doll?
- So Min will watch the doll.

209
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,270
Right, So Min is... Wait, So Min?

210
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,840
(Wait, So Min?)

211
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,210
- So Min?
- What's wrong?

212
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,950
(So Min is Team Ji Hee's anxiety factor.)

213
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,580
- So Min will watch this?
- Yes.

214
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,580
So Min should...

215
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,560
Then Ji Hyo should watch here,
and So Min and I'll guard the door.

216
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,450
- Sure.
- Okay.

217
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,430
So Min. You should block it.

218
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,130
- Block it with the chair?
- Block it.

219
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,870
You should lie down here.

220
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,160
Lie down.

221
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,810
So Min. You can sit there. That's nice.

222
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,400
- Yes.
- You have the coolest role.

223
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,760
Then who watches this? Ji Hyo?

224
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,400
- I'm watching this.
- Then...

225
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,830
- you guard the door.
- Yes.

226
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,880
Okay.

227
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,340
I'll hide behind the water tank.

228
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,640
(Se Chan hides behind the water tank.)

229
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,950
This is perfect.

230
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,950
(Se Chan hides behind the water tank.)

231
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,320
(Se Chan, Jun Hwan, Jae Suk, Suk Jin)

232
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,560
Se Chan. Are you hiding?

233
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,690
I'm behind the water tank.

234
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,060
Okay.

235
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,150
(Jun Hwan has to press the doorbell.)

236
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,700
(He spots a strong gatekeeper.)

237
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,460
I might run into this door.

238
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,500
(Sighing)

239
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,100
Where should I hide?

240
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,900
Help me.

241
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,080
I can hear everything.

242
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,100
(Jun Hwan has to press the doorbell
and hide in 10 seconds.)

243
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,580
I can hear it.

244
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,120
Okay. Got it.

245
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,450
You have to run really fast.

246
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,190
Are you sure your eyes are covered?

247
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,820
Somewhere close.

248
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,760
Jun Hwan. Did you press it?

249
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,720
(He rang the bell!)

250
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,370
(Jun Hwan starts running.)

251
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,520
He's running.

252
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,090
He's running.

253
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,740
Nine.

254
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,310
Eight.

255
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,030
Seven.

256
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,530
Six.

257
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,770
Five.

258
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,310
Four.

259
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,700
Three.

260
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,740
Two. One.

261
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,740
Go.

262
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,150
- Do I go?
- He ran that way.

263
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,580
Are you outside?

264
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,980
Yes, I'm outside.

265
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,160
(Se Chan is standing guard.)

266
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,250
Yes, I'm outside.

267
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,560
She's outside.

268
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,990
(Sharing Ji Hee's location through radio)

269
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,090
Is she outside?

270
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,460
If you see them, say their names out loud.

271
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,940
Okay.

272
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,460
Is everything okay over there?

273
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,310
Everything's okay.

274
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,440
(Referee Jeon is obviously spaced out.)

275
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,830
You can hear the bell.

276
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,780
They can't just sneak in.

277
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,280
(Se Chan)

278
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,240
She's leaving.

279
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,710
Why is this intimidating?

280
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,880
(But Jun Hwan couldn't hide himself.)

281
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,120
I don't think they're around here.

282
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,250
I see Ji Hee over there.

283
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,360
(He spots Ji Hee outside the window.)

284
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,070
I saw Ji Hee. She's coming this way.

285
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,410
(Team Defense noticed Ji Hee
coming toward them.)

286
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,310
Jae Suk. Where are you?

287
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,080
(Team Defense noticed Ji Hee
coming toward them.)

288
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,650
She's coming here.

289
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,740
(The scaredy-cats are getting nervous.)

290
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,450
She's going over there.

291
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,210
(Rushing)

292
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,060
(She heard a bell ringing.)

293
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,900
(Jae Suk who rushed out...)

294
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,900
(and Ji Hee who missed him by a whisker)

295
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,590
She's in.

296
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,830
(He dashes to the main building
after giving Ji Hee the slip.)

297
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,240
Someone's running here.

298
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,500
Someone's here.

299
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,280
Someone's here!

300
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,710
(Ji Hee doesn't hear
Jong Kook's signal...)

301
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,110
(and heads to the 2nd floor
of the next building.)

302
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,790
Where?

303
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,210
- He went to the right.
- He's here.

304
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,290
Ji Hee. He's here.

305
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,830
He went to the right.

306
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,120
Ji Hee. He's here. By the backdoor.

307
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,250
He's here!

308
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,830
He's here.

309
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,530
(Ji Hee senses something.)

310
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,990
(She spots Jae Suk.)

311
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,580
(She has to touch the doll
before Jae Suk does.)

312
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,780
I'm sorry. I run pretty fast.

313
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,650
He's right in front of me.

314
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,980
(Jae Suk gives up on the backdoor
and takes a detour.)

315
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,110
I can hear it by the backdoor.

316
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,830
Ji Hee isn't here.

317
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,120
(Meanwhile, Ji Hee came running to him.)

318
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,450
It's Jae Suk.

319
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,900
- I can hear the bell.
- It's Jae Suk.

320
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,170
He's running. Come and touch the bell.

321
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,400
- Who is it?
- The doll.

322
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,590
It's Jae Suk.

323
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,830
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk makes it in
through the side door.)

324
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,360
Guard the doll.

325
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,500
It's me, Ji Hyo.

326
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,310
- I can hear it.
- Touch the doll. Who is it?

327
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,970
- Who is it?
- The doll.

328
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,000
(Who will touch the doll first?)

329
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,080
(Running past So Min nonchalantly)

330
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,050
(All he has to overcome
is Ji Hyo's defense.)

331
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,340
- Guard the doll.
- Who is it?

332
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,450
Here.

333
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,520
- Hurry up.
- Here.

334
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,750
- I can hear it.
- Who is it?

335
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,660
(He manages to get through
tight security and earns 3 points.)

336
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,790
Jae Suk did it.

337
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,880
I did it.

338
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,450
- Who's that here?
- I did it.

339
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,930
Who is it?

340
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,430
- Jae Suk.
- I told you to guard the doll.

341
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,670
When did you get here?

342
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,590
When did you get here?

343
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,270
What were you doing, So Min?

344
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,300
So Min!

345
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,570
- Jong Kook.
- What were you doing!

346
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,230
So Min!

347
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,200
I don't know. He sneaked in.

348
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,550
- What do you mean you don't know!
- Hey.

349
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,870
- I said I heard it.
- You have to tell us!

350
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,740
So Min! Pull yourself together!

351
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,210
How can you be a referee with that!

352
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,690
So Min! Seriously!

353
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,290
Do you think it's easy to be a referee?

354
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,480
- You can hear the bell!
- Focus!

355
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,820
Seriously!

356
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,220
I said...

357
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,990
- he was here.
- No more excuses.

358
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,120
(A defenseless gatekeeper
is only getting better...)

359
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,170
(at taking their nagging.)

360
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,330
They wouldn't go up there.

361
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,960
Suk Jin. Ji Hee.

362
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,100
She's going over there.

363
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,830
What just happened?

364
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,280
(Big Nose who's hiding
behind the curtain...)

365
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,470
Where do I go?

366
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,600
(and Jun Hwan who is still
wandering around)

367
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,050
I saw Jun Hwan running away.

368
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,880
(Ji Hee's camera)

369
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,690
(She spots someone hovering around.)

370
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,930
- If you see anyone, say the name.
- I can hear the bell.

371
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,430
I see Jun Hwan.

372
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,220
Do I say his name and touch the doll
while looking at him?

373
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,670
(Flustered Jun Hwan starts running
back to where he came from)

374
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,330
Not here? Where is she?

375
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,040
- Hurry up. Where?
- Cha Jun Hwan.

376
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,100
(Meanwhile,
Ji Hee easily touches the doll.)

377
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,100
(Cha Jun Hwan is out.)

378
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,230
Cha Jun Hwan is out.

379
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,500
Okay!

380
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,240
Good job.

381
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,840
What?

382
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,450
(Jun Hwan finally figured out
what happened.)

383
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,520
I can't believe it.

384
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,210
(Despondent)

385
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,290
(Proud)

386
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,420
Gosh. I'm tired.

387
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,690
I'm sure they're around here.

388
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,850
Who do we have left?

389
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,620
Suk Jin. I'll just hide here.
We need to get at least one point.

390
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,200
(The two of them
are scared of Ji Hee who is fast.)

391
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,490
Jun Hwan. Did you get caught?

392
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,540
Come toward So Min.

393
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,330
Come toward So Min and touch the doll.

394
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,000
Come where So Min is.

395
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,730
The door So Min is standing.

396
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,180
It's the window.

397
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,410
Even if the zombies touch you,
it means nothing.

398
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,650
Come where So Min is.

399
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,210
Someone's telling them
to come to where I am.

400
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,950
Someone's telling them...

401
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,190
to come where I'm standing.

402
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,450
Someone's telling them
to come to where I'm standing.

403
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,900
- She's upstairs.
- Everyone.

404
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,990
So Min. Pull yourself together.

405
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,770
Come through So Min's door quickly.

406
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,270
(He gives out his command
without faltering.)

407
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,630
He's telling them
to come through this door.

408
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,310
(The target is here.)

409
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,910
(Se Chan got Jae Suk's message.)

410
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,080
Come through So Min's door.

411
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,450
(Se Chan got Jae Suk's message.)

412
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,950
(Launching the operation)

413
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,520
(Meanwhile, at the main gate,
where it's guarded securely)

414
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,660
Team Pink.

415
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,950
(Meanwhile, at the main gate,
where it's guarded securely)

416
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,030
- This is bad.
- Who is it?

417
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,250
- Ji Hee.
- Oh, come in.

418
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,490
Where are they?

419
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,720
- I can't see.
- You shouldn't get too far.

420
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,860
Exactly.

421
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,830
(He infiltrates the building
after turning the corner.)

422
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,070
- You shouldn't get too far.
- Exactly.

423
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,700
You should look around.

424
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,080
- Wait.
- You shouldn't get too far.

425
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,130
(Ji Hee is suddenly running again?)

426
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,950
(She spots Se Chan.)

427
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,970
(She runs toward the doll
without a break.)

428
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,150
Wait. It's me, Ji Hee.

429
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,970
Se Chan!

430
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,290
He's in front of me.

431
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,020
(Se Chan takes a detour
and heads to So Min's door.)

432
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,190
(Will the operation be successful?)

433
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,210
What happened?

434
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,030
- Se Chan.
- He's in front of me.

435
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,980
- Se Chan.
- Yang Se Chan is out.

436
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,720
Se Chan. My gosh.

437
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,090
- Someone's coming.
- What happened?

438
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,120
Someone's coming.

439
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,770
- Ji Hee saw you.
- Suk Jin.

440
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,830
- We have Suk Jin left.
- Suk Jin.

441
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,460
You have a minute left.

442
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,700
Did she see me?

443
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,330
If you came through So Min's door,
you would've been safe.

444
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,940
Let me tell you again.

445
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,240
It has to be So Min's door.

446
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,310
Is So Min an open door or what?

447
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,550
You must.

448
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,950
It's fun to run around.

449
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,950
(Youngblood who finds running fun)

450
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,020
Jae Suk. Did you get caught?

451
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,710
(On the other hand, there's old blood...)

452
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,950
Who got caught?

453
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,220
(who hasn't even taken a step
out of his post.)

454
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,250
(Suk Jin unexpectedly
became the last survivor.)

455
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,720
You have a minute left.

456
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,090
- What?
- You have a minute left.

457
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,330
Only a minute left?

458
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,670
Then I need to win a point.

459
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,940
I should go out.

460
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,270
I need to go.

461
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,330
(He's finally ready to face off.)

462
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,770
(Charging forward)

463
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,630
It's fun to run around.

464
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,950
(Ji Hee was just
running around innocently.)

465
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,610
(She runs into Suk Jin
as soon as she gets out.)

466
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,340
Suk Jin!

467
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,450
- Suk Jin!
- I hear the bell! It's the bell!

468
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,520
(Suk Jin's nowhere close to Ji Hee
who is a fast runner.)

469
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,820
- It's the bell.
- You can't go through that door.

470
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,830
Suk Jin!

471
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,350
You can't go through that door.

472
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,330
(Suk Jin is out.)

473
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,270
(The mid-aged man
arrived a little too late.)

474
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,400
It's over.

475
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,490
- It's over.
- This door doesn't count.

476
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,100
You could've used this door.

477
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,440
- I won.
- Okay.

478
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,600
You're very good.

479
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,130
You're good.

480
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,280
You'll switch now.

481
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,920
If we hide well, we might win.

482
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,650
- We don't have to touch it.
- Exactly.

483
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,110
- Go.
- I hear the bell.

484
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,080
Jun Hwan. You have to watch for Jong Kook.

485
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,110
- Kim Jong Kook!
- Okay. Come and touch it.

486
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,830
(Jong Kook was hiding
right in front of the door.)

487
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,220
(He gets eliminated right away.)

488
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,090
(Jun Hwan eliminates the tiger
as soon as the game starts.)

489
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,620
- Kim Jong Kook is out.
- Okay.

490
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,730
- Okay.
- We did it.

491
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,040
It's a deal.

492
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,460
Take this. I can't run anyway.

493
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,830
- So Min.
- So Min is out.

494
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,040
He's over there.

495
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,630
- Jin Ji Hee.
- Run.

496
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,280
Ji Hee. Run.

497
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,150
- Song Ji Hyo!
- No.

498
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,500
- Hurry up.
- Jin Ji Hee.

499
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,210
(He manages to eliminate everyone.)

500
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,550
- Everyone.
- Yes.

501
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,790
So...

502
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,710
Team Jun Hwan wins
by eliminating everyone.

503
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,210
Okay. We finally won.

504
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,580
- Well done.
- Here's 300 dollars, Captain Cha.

505
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,580
(Captain Cha gets 300 dollars.
Captain Jin gets 150 dollars.)

506
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,420
- Good job.
- And 150 dollars for Captain Jin.

507
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,660
Distribute it, please.

508
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,470
- We wouldn't place last.
- No.

509
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,470
We'd never place last.

510
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,500
Here are the revolt cards
for the rest of you.

511
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,900
We don't even need it.

512
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,480
What should I write?

513
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,240
This is the hardest time for the captains.

514
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,870
Ji Hee.

515
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,840
Just give me ten dollars. I mean it.

516
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,870
Ji Hee.

517
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,080
- I know.
- You know?

518
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,520
- You know me.
- Yes.

519
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,020
How many people get a penalty?

520
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,560
- Only one person gets the penalty.
- Okay.

521
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,150
But everyone aside the winner is
the candidate,

522
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,230
and we'll spin the roulette.

523
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,730
- Really?
- Right.

524
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,620
One space for 2nd place,
two spaces for 3rd place, and so on.

525
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,120
(They get spaces on the roulette
according to their ranking.)

526
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,460
They'll spin the roulette to pick one.

527
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,470
For your information, it's neck and neck.

528
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,000
- Really?
- We're all alike.

529
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,860
- I'm done.
- The members should...

530
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,710
hold only the envelope.

531
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,510
- Captain Jin will reveal it first.
- Okay.

532
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,080
Ta-da.

533
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,640
- How much do I get?
- One hundred dollars for Ji Hee.

534
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,310
Fifty dollars, four dollars,
twenty dollars.

535
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,940
Twenty dollars and twenty-one dollars.

536
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,050
Four dollars?

537
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,880
- Four dollars for Jong Kook.
- Four dollars?

538
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,520
Wait. How much does So Min get?

539
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,520
So Min didn't get the minimum amount.

540
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
I made a prediction.

541
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,290
(So Min rebelled against Ji Hee
when she wasn't in last place.)

542
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,380
You did a great job.

543
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,960
You did a great job.

544
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,760
So Min chose to revolt
in that situation? I'm impressed.

545
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,030
So Min, you have ten dollars now.

546
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,330
Be honest with me.
Were any of you on my side?

547
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,500
I have too many enemies.

548
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,930
So Min, I was so excited
to have you on my team.

549
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,480
How many enemies do I have?

550
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,740
Captain Cha, please show us
your board now.

551
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,900
- One, two, three.
- Let's find out.

552
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,370
- How much?
- Captain Cha.

553
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,510
(This time, Captain Cha's decision
will be revealed.)

554
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,640
(Jun Hwan: 90 dollars, Jae Suk: 1 cent)

555
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,670
- Ninety dollars. One cent?
- Ninety dollars, one cent...

556
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,880
- Okay.
- One cent?

557
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,050
That's nice. He got one cent.

558
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,580
He gave me 110 dollars?

559
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,380
- Jun Hwan. Just one cent?
- One cent?

560
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,580
He gave Suk Jin 110 dollars?

561
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,960
It must be his strategy.
He thought Suk Jin might revolt.

562
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,730
Now, open your cards.

563
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,620
- Gosh, I didn't choose to revolt.
- I chose...

564
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,390
You just got one cent.

565
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,860
Me neither. I love you, Captain Cha.

566
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,130
(Se Chan got 99.99 dollars.)

567
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,580
(Big Nose who received 110 dollars
chose to revolt.)

568
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,130
I should've picked the revolt card. Gosh.

569
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,240
I'm impressed.

570
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,370
- That's impressive.
- Jun Hwan, you did a great job.

571
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,280
- Jun Hwan, you're so smart.
- Oh, he did it intentionally.

572
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,020
- We both succeeded.
- Yes.

573
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,110
- We caught the rebels.
- We pulled it off.

574
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,380
- I'll announce the final result.
- Okay.

575
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,330
The person in the first place
will be exempt from the penalty.

576
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,490
Starting with the 2nd place,
1 slot is added.

577
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,090
So the 9th place gets 8 slots.

578
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,390
- Eight slots for the ninth place?
- Yes.

579
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,460
That person will get the penalty.

580
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,160
- Please.
- I hope I'm in the top three.

581
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,570
- The winner is...
- The winner.

582
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,630
Is it Haha?

583
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,800
No way.

584
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,430
(Who could be the winner?)

585
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,710
- Se Chan.
- Yes!

586
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,600
- Se Chan.
- Yes!

587
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,170
- What?
- Jun Hwan, thank you so much.

588
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,580
- Really?
- Yes.

589
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,370
Thank you, Jun Hwan.
I thought it was Haha.

590
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,220
Jun Hwan, thank you so much.

591
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,050
- You got 272 dollars and 99 cents.
- That's amazing.

592
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,610
I don't think
I've ever placed first before.

593
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,910
The person who placed second is...

594
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,920
Ji Hee. And Jun Hwan placed third.

595
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,560
- Suk Jin placed fourth.
- Yes!

596
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,650
- Who is in last place?
- So Min.

597
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,390
It could've been me.

598
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,690
- So Min is so hilarious.
- While we're putting the letters...

599
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,660
- Suk Jin chose the penalty.
- Yes.

600
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,040
We've gone soft.

601
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,270
- Let's pick something harsh.
- Harsh?

602
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,600
Let's go with a harsh penalty.

603
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,100
- How about something stinging?
- Stinging?

604
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,100
Yes.

605
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,670
We can't make the guests do it.

606
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,940
You're right.

607
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,870
Then let's prepare
two different penalties.

608
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,750
One for the members
and the other for the guests.

609
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,250
It took us a long time to decide.

610
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,460
- Is it a bomb? Cream?
- Will you shoot something?

611
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,060
The penalty is to put wax strips
on your arms and take them off.

612
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,120
- What?
- What?

613
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,530
- Wax strips on both of your arms.
- That's good.

614
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,800
(It's stinging and harsh
just as Captain Ji requested.)

615
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,560
- On the arms?
- That's too harsh.

616
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,860
We can do it on the legs too, right?

617
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,800
- If you want, yes.
- Okay. Good.

618
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,090
If you wax your legs,
you'll have to wax your thighs too.

619
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,270
Exactly.

620
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,040
- The captains won't have to do it.
- I didn't get many slots.

621
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,900
- Pardon?
- You'll get a different penalty.

622
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,040
Oh, I see.

623
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,330
My name is on only a few slots.

624
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,510
- Two. And three.
- You see...

625
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,780
- It'd be nice if Ji Hee was picked.
- I got too many slots.

626
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,170
- Okay.
- Who will spin it?

627
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,480
- I'll do it.
- Ready.

628
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,580
(Ji Hee: 1, Jun Hwan: 2,
Suk Jin: 3, Haha: 4)

629
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,410
- Please save me.
- Now, spin the wheel.

630
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,990
Let's go!

631
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,150
(Jun Hwan spun it!)

632
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,680
(Who will get the penalty?)

633
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,230
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

634
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,300
- Oh, my.
- It's slowing down.

635
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,760
It's okay. I'll just do it.

636
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,500
- Please.
- Oh, no.

637
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,690
(Ji Hyo: 5, Jong Kook: 6,
Jae Suk: 7, So Min: 8)

638
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,930
(The roulette slows down sharply
near Jae Suk, Haha, and So Min.)

639
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,270
- Please.
- Oh, no.

640
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,170
(Who will get the penalty?)

641
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,270
- No.
- Haha.

642
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,300
(Haha will get the penalty.)

643
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,900
(Disappointed)

644
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,130
But he...

645
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,010
Look at him.

646
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,280
(Haha with only 4 slots
beat So Min with 8 slots.)

647
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,370
- Monk Ha.
- I'm saved.

648
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,610
- Is it really Haha?
- It's hard to believe.

649
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,290
- So Min, congratulations.
- Thank you.

650
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,880
Wasn't Haha ranked high?

651
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,190
- I had a bad feeling about this.
- What are the odds?

652
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,080
We'll give the top two prizes.

653
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,650
- Ji Hee and Se Chan.
- Yes.

654
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,350
(The prize for the top 2 is
high-quality Korean beef.)

655
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,590
Okay.

656
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,290
Thank you.

657
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,560
- Shall I give you some?
- No, that's okay.

658
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,170
Haha will get the penalty now.

659
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,040
- Where do you want to do it?
- Okay.

660
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,540
(Haha will get the harsh, stinging
penalty recommended by Captain Ji.)

661
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,870
- Before that, Ji Hee and Jun Hwan,
- Right.

662
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,570
- please say a few words.
- Okay.

663
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:34,420
First of all, it was so nice
to see Jun Hwan after a long time.

664
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,380
I had so much fun today.
And I'll be back on the show later.

665
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,020
(Ji Hee, a leader like a big sister,
fell more deeply in Running Man.)

666
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,490
I, too, was excited to see Ji Hee
after a long time.

667
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,320
And I had so much fun
with Jae Suk, Suk Jin,

668
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,230
Se Chan, and So Min on my team.

669
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,670
- Thank you.
- Jun Hwan,

670
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,970
- we hope you get a good result...
- We're rooting for you.

671
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,270
- at the world championship.
- You can do it, Jun Hwan.

672
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,010
(The cast members received
good energy from Figure Prince too.)

673
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,330
- You can do it.
- It must be painful.

674
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,830
- I'm ready.
- You can do it.

675
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,780
- He looks like Krillin.
- Here we go.

676
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,100
Krillin?

677
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,180
(Child Monk Ha is ready to get waxed.)

678
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,780
Peel it off slowly. That'd hurt more.

679
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,040
(He screams and swears.)

680
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,020
- It must have hurt.
- It looked painful.

681
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,960
- Good job, everyone.
- Thank you.

682
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,420
Thank you.

683
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,690
(We thank Ji Hee and Jun Hwan
for sharing their reunion with us.)

684
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,460
- Ji Hee, you did a great job.
- Thank you.

685
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,930
- We'll begin the shoot now.
- Yes.

686
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,270
Play the music. Go.

687
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,790
(Unlike the usual opening,)

688
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:31,440
(we begin on a stage
with dazzling lights.)

689
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,370
("Only One for Me" by BTOB)

690
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,300
(Ah, yeah)

691
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,010
(Shouting)

692
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,840
(You are the only one for me)

693
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,310
(Old man, please come this way.)

694
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,960
(They haven't sung this song
in a long time.)

695
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:07,200
- BTOB was supposed to come out.
- That's right.

696
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,970
- What a shame.
- Exactly.

697
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,630
- It's a shame.
- Please tell us how they're doing.

698
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,400
First of all, when we held
a fan event overseas...

699
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,540
to meet our fans in foreign countries,

700
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,310
- we always sang BTOB's song...
- True.

701
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,420
- as we began the event.
- "Only One for Me".

702
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,580
- We sang "Only One for Me"...
- Yes.

703
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,490
- at the beginning of the event.
- That's right.

704
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,290
(Despite the poor singing abilities
of some members...)

705
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:33,030
("Only One for Me" made them all
look like great singers.)

706
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:36,170
- We sang the song as we began.
- That's right.

707
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,360
- We planned to perform the song...
- Yes.

708
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,270
- with BTOB on our show.
- We were supposed to sing together.

709
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,100
- I was excited about it.
- For the past few weeks,

710
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,830
- I heard what BTOB said...
- Right.

711
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:48,710
- from some idols who knew BTOB.
- Yes.

712
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,600
"Why haven't they invited us
to their show..."

713
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,680
- "when they sang our song?"
- That's right.

714
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,880
- What a shame.
- Since BTOB made its comeback,

715
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,490
we decided to do a special episode
about BTOB.

716
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,220
- So we put on the same outfits...
- Exactly.

717
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,990
- that we wore in our concerts.
- That's right.

718
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:07,050
- And we rented this concert hall.
- But...

719
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,960
Unfortunately, this morning,

720
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,030
- one of the members of BTOB...
- That's right.

721
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,770
- tested positive for COVID-19.
- Right.

722
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:15,200
- I'm so sad.
- We're very disappointed too.

723
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,470
- Exactly.
- I'm so disappointed.

724
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,180
- They came to the entrance.
- Exactly.

725
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,240
- But they had to go back.
- What a shame.

726
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,780
- Look how sad So Min is.
- Right.

727
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,400
- She's all dressed up.
- I'm wearing a headband too.

728
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,300
- Exactly. I'm wearing earrings too.
- I thought she was crying.

729
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,340
Exactly. <i>I can't</i>

730
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,610
(I can't live without you)

731
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,520
(They sing the song again
as they're disappointed.)

732
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,580
- We're supposed to sing with them.
- What a shame.

733
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,650
We began the show with BTOB's song.

734
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,190
- Go, BTOB!
- Go, BTOB!

735
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,460
- Go, BTOB! "Only One for Me".
- We hope to see you guys soon.

736
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,150
- It's okay.
- Right. It's such a shame.

737
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,430
But the problem is...

738
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,930
Eat a lot of garlic.

739
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,270
- What should we do today?
- Eat a lot of garlic.

740
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,770
We're the ones who are in trouble.

741
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:48,890
What should we do today?

742
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,630
- What are we going to do?
- We planned something...

743
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,800
- to do with BTOB.
- What will we do today?

744
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,370
It was supposed to be a match
between Running Man and BTOB.

745
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,070
- A match?
- We prepared all sorts of games.

746
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,110
- I could've taught them a lesson.
- That's a shame.

747
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,220
- It would've been so fun.
- So...

748
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,850
We wanted to see the seven of you
working together to beat them.

749
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,960
But they wouldn't have been
able to beat us.

750
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,350
When we join our forces,
no one can beat us.

751
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,650
- No one can beat us.
- Of course.

752
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,620
- So you'll have to be divided.
- Let's do that.

753
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,460
- Let's do that.
- Then...

754
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,320
- Since it's the BTOB special...
- Yes.

755
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,630
- Many of us have blood type B.
- Oh, right.

756
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,940
- Me.
- Who else?

757
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,400
- I'm a type B too.
- Me too. You're a type B too?

758
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,630
- Right.
- All three of you are type B?

759
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,330
- Yes, we're all type B.
- Oh, really?

760
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,510
- You see...
- You're a type B?

761
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,830
Men with blood type B...

762
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,340
- are not popular with women.
- Men with blood type B...

763
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,370
- You're wrong.
- Men with blood type B are...

764
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,640
- popular with women.
- No, they're not popular.

765
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,880
- Women in their 20s like them.
- Oh, really?

766
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,290
- Because they're attractive.
- But it changes as they age.

767
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,020
- But you know, right?
- What?

768
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,720
It's pointless to talk about it.

769
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,930
- The blood type doesn't matter.
- True.

770
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,890
- If a man looks good...
- Men looking like us...

771
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,890
- Women would fall for him.
- They...

772
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,350
- They only care about the looks.
- Exactly.

773
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,590
- Your blood type doesn't matter.
- True.

774
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,670
- They don't care about it.
- They don't.

775
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,390
- They care about your looks.
- Why do both of them...

776
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,670
- have blood type B? How annoying.
- Just your looks.

777
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,860
Why? You look ugly too
because of your hair.

778
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,130
- I look ugly too?
- It doesn't matter.

779
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,070
Although the blood type personality
theory...

780
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,210
- is not absolutely accurate,
- Right.

781
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,600
there are a few traits I agree about
as a man with blood type B.

782
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,280
- I agree with Jae Suk.
- Is that so?

783
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,420
- Yes, there are a few things.
- All three of them are funny.

784
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,080
- There are some similarities.
- They say...

785
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,420
that people with blood type B
tend to be self-centered.

786
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,520
- That's not true.
- No, we're not.

787
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,290
- People with blood type A are...
- I heard...

788
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,880
- known to sulk easily.
- Come on.

789
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,460
- That's not true.
- His blood type is A.

790
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,730
- You're wrong about that.
- People with blood type A...

791
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,530
- They do sulk easily.
- Right?

792
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,700
But that's why types A and B are
compatible with each other.

793
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,200
- That's right.
- Type A...

794
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,000
- You mean, as a married couple?
- Type A...

795
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,540
- My wife is a type A.
- Is she?

796
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,270
- Kyung Eun is a type A too.
- Yes, she's a type A.

797
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,970
Jae Suk, Go Eun is a type A too.

798
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,130
- Really?
- Unbelievable.

799
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,900
- I got goosebumps. Unbelievable.
- Really? My goodness.

800
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,570
- I got goosebumps.
- Isn't your younger girlfriend...

801
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,600
who's in your house a type A?

802
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,680
(Isn't your younger girlfriend
who's in your house a type A?)

803
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,710
- Is she?
- You don't know?

804
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,680
- No.
- Ask her.

805
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,380
Anyway, we're type B, and...
What's your blood type?

806
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,790
- Ji Hyo, what's your blood type?
- What's Ji Hyo's blood type?

807
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,790
- I'm a type A.
- She's a type A.

808
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,880
- Oh, you're a type A?
- So Min, you're a type A too?

809
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,790
- No, I'm a type AB.
- Jong Kook is a type AB too.

810
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,620
- I'm a type AB.
- You're a type AB, Jong Kook?

811
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,120
(He used to think that he was a type A.)

812
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,890
- I turned out to be a type AB.
- Oh, I see. You're a type AB.

813
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,590
- Hold on. What was that?
- I think that's right.

814
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,890
- Are you belittling type AB?
- Why?

815
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:00,060
- My mom is a type AB. How dare you?
- My dad is a type AB too.

816
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,290
Are you speaking badly of my mom?

817
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,860
- My brother is a type AB too.
- Na Eun is a type AB too.

818
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,130
- You said she was a type A.
- Na Eun is a type AB too.

819
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,330
Oh, you're talking about Na Eun?

820
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,540
- Na Eun is a type AB too.
- You see...

821
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,780
- Jong Kook doesn't look like one.
- Those with blood type AB are nice.

822
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,680
Jong Kook looks like a type B.

823
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,810
- No. He's definitely a type AB.
- I thought I was a type A.

824
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,420
- No wonder...
- I found out that I was...

825
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,990
- a type AB 3 or 4 years ago.
- I found it weird...

826
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,460
that you didn't have a type A
personality. You're a type AB.

827
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,610
I knew it.

828
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,520
- I'm surprised that she's a type A.
- I'm a type A.

829
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,730
I thought you were a type O.

830
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,290
- I'm a type A.
- I thought you were a type AB.

831
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,290
- You've known me for a long time.
- I thought she was a type O too.

832
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,790
- Right.
- She sulks easily, you know.

833
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,790
- She gets mad over what happened...
- She's a type A.

834
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,790
three years before all of a sudden.

835
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,890
- Who?
- Ji Hyo.

836
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,590
- When did I do that?
- That's...

837
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,290
- That's what a type AB does.
- That's...

838
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,040
- That's you. You should know that.
- When did I do that?

839
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,470
Hold on a second.

840
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,710
- I said I was a type AB.
- Stop.

841
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,330
- Oh, gosh. He's scary.
- He really is.

842
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,710
- You three punks with blood type B.
- Okay.

843
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,870
- What's with those sleeves?
- He's a type AB.

844
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,640
- Are you going to do a mask dance?
- What do you mean?

845
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,870
- Anyway...
- Okay.

846
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:51,540
- BTOB couldn't make it here today.
- Right.

847
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,290
- Since many of us are type B...
- That's a good idea.

848
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,990
- How should we be divided?
- Into 3 teams of 2, 2, and 3?

849
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,230
- We'll be divided into three teams.
- I have a better idea.

850
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,260
The 3 of you team up together,
and the 4 of us will team up.

851
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,530
- That sounds good.
- One should play on both teams.

852
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:02,460
- Right.
- Then one of the female members...

853
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,030
- It should be a type AB.
- Yes, playing on both teams.

854
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,090
So Min often participates in games
as a referee anyway.

855
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,090
- You can move between the teams.
- Right.

856
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,400
- Exactly.
- So Min can be the referee.

857
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,270
- You can be the referee.
- She can move between the teams.

858
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,070
So Min, since you're a type AB,

859
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,100
- move between the two teams.
- Great.

860
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,510
- Between type A and type B.
- You should do that.

861
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,710
- But he's a type AB too.
- He should stay on that team.

862
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,810
- Be the referee at the same time.
- You have both type A and B traits.

863
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,110
- Listen.
- You know a lot about this.

864
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,690
Hey, you're playing a huge role today.

865
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,190
But... I used to like
being in a position like this.

866
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,450
- This is So Min's special.
- But now...

867
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,460
You're amazing.

868
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,810
It makes me look like I have
a weak presence. Pardon?

869
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,620
- Weren't you a weak link last week?
- Exactly.

870
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,320
- Suk Jin was a weak link too.
- But I...

871
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,350
Be a kkakdugi as in "weak link", and
sell kkakdugi as in "radish kimchi".

872
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,470
- It's not like that.
- So Min's kkadugi. Sounds good.

873
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,590
- I want a sense of belonging.
- You know, So Min might...

874
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,290
- A few months later,
- Yes.

875
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,130
she might actually sell kkakdugi
on a home shopping network.

876
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,600
- That would suit her.
- Wouldn't that be great?

877
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,510
(The premium quality kkakdugi
made by the human kkakdugi)

878
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,510
(It sounds like a good career plan.)

879
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,450
- It sounds great, right?
- Jeon So Min's kkakdugi.

880
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,680
- Jeon So Min's kkakdugi.
- Jeon So Min's...

881
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,310
- Referee Kkakdugi.
- It's all about your image.

882
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,610
- Absolutely.
- That's right.

883
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,420
- So Min is also a great dancer.
- Indeed.

884
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,610
- Show us your dance.
<i>- Kkakdugi</i>

885
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,610
- Jae Suk, you should say,
- That's great.

886
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,880
- "Check out Locust too."
- Locust.

887
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,820
(Buy So Min's kkakdugi,
and get free Locust.)

888
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,350
<i>We're going hunting for kkakdugi</i>

889
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,390
- She plays along with every joke.
<i>- Here we go</i>

890
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,430
(So she became the only
kkakdugi artisan in showbiz.)

891
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,670
- Did you see her face?
- Exactly. She's so hilarious.

892
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,590
Then it will be a match
between type B and the rest.

893
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,440
- Okay.
- We'll begin the race now.

894
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,240
- "Type B and the rest"?
- Yes.

895
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,330
- What's that?
- "Type B and the rest"?

896
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,870
- That's not cool.
- Hold on.

897
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,510
- The BTOB special...
- It was supposed to be...

898
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,400
- BTOB must be upset.
- It's just...

899
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,780
- Just let it go.
- We're the stars of the show today.

900
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:28,310
It was going to be a 7-on-7 match,
so we had to change...

901
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,990
- the rules of the games.
- Yes.

902
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,490
- It's type B versus the rest.
- Got it.

903
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,810
You'll play games that are suitable...

904
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,990
- for the teams of 3 and 4 members.
- Type B versus the rest.

905
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,650
According to the game results,

906
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,230
- you'll receive penalty balls.
- Yes.

907
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,000
The team that's chosen at the end
will get a penalty.

908
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,120
- Understood.
- The whole team?

909
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,560
- What about me? I'm a weak link.
- Right. What about So Min?

910
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:46,740
- You'll choose one team at the end.
- The team you want to stay on.

911
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,330
If your team is picked after that,
you'll get a penalty.

912
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,710
- Oh, I see.
- You can choose. It's a good thing.

913
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,240
But what if no one wants me on their team?

914
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,400
- It's up to you.
- You'll be the one to choose.

915
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,280
- That wouldn't happen.
- You'll get to choose any team.

916
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,800
- We can't reject you.
- Exactly.

917
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,640
So Min, please choose the first team
before changing your clothes.

918
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,450
- For the first mission.
- You won't tell me about the game?

919
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,110
- Can't I decide after that?
- She won't get the information?

920
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,250
- No, she won't.
- So Min.

921
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,220
- We'll do it without you this time.
- For now...

922
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,230
- Right. We'll see how it goes.
- Hey.

923
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,320
- We're all type B.
- I knew it.

924
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,820
- I knew they'd say that.
- That's enough.

925
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,790
- In this round...
- You can join them if you want.

926
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,270
- Start with that team.
- So Min.

927
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,860
- You don't want to get a penalty.
- Right.

928
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,500
- So Min, for now...
- Try to change them.

929
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,240
- Blood type B...
- This is the BTOB special.

930
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,900
Only my mom is a type B in my family.

931
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,400
My dad and my little brother are
both type AB.

932
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,870
Therefore, I'm more like a type B.

933
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,870
- Good.
- I choose this team.

934
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,400
- Okay.
- I choose this team.

935
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,980
(So Min chose Team Type B.)

936
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,400
- Okay.
- In the first mission,

937
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,450
- you'll be divided like this.
- Yes.

938
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,450
- Okay.
- Okay.

939
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,810
- Please change your clothes now.
- Okay. Let's go.

940
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,460
(Which of the 2 teams will win?)

941
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,620
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

942
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,390
What's this? I see something huge.

943
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,850
What could that be for?

944
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,930
- Oh, my. What's this?
- The streetlight is so pretty.

945
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,360
- It's really pretty.
- Indeed.

946
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,290
What's that image at the back?
Like some sort of background.

947
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,270
(The crazy So Min starts dancing
on the streetlight.)

948
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,040
What is this?
What are we going to do with this?

949
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,240
What is this?

950
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,440
- I guess this is a wooden bench.
- What's this?

951
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,600
- Is this for hitting someone?
- I think...

952
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,780
- Isn't this place too big for us?
- I don't think...

953
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,780
- we need a place this big.
- It's too big.

954
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,140
- Right?
- Indeed.

955
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,310
Gather around, my team members.

956
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,450
- Right, she was on our team.
- Come.

957
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,040
People with blood type B don't
act up like that.

958
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,610
- You can take off your mask now.
- People with blood type B...

959
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,790
- don't act up.
- Oh, I forgot.

960
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,880
Let's do this.

961
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,290
Hey, don't be mean to her.

962
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,930
She has a different blood type.

963
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,350
What are your parents' blood types?

964
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,930
- You can move between the teams.
- Your parents.

965
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,030
But don't stay on this team...

966
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,440
- I'm the only one you can rely on.
- That's true.

967
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,500
Ji Hyo is the only one I can rely on
from that team.

968
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,240
Exactly. Ji Hyo is the only one
you can rely on.

969
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,600
- You can rely on me too.
- We care so much about you.

970
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,240
- That's right.
- Then why are you getting upset?

971
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,070
I'm just telling you
that you're wrong about that.

972
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,680
Hey, even Suk Jin doesn't say
anything either.

973
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,980
- He doesn't even care.
- I'll be nice to you. You'll see.

974
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,680
Isn't Suk Jin the captain?

975
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,040
- Exactly.
- You'll see.

976
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,610
- You'll see.
- Suk Jin, aren't you the captain?

977
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,380
- Aren't you the captain?
- Exactly. He's the captain.

978
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,990
That doesn't matter to me.

979
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,620
- Of course, it matters.
- That's an outdated perspective.

980
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,230
- You see, Suk Jin...
- A good title can change a person.

981
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,150
- knows it instinctively.
- What do you mean?

982
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,170
He knows his position in the food
chain and how to survive.

983
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,590
He knows how to survive in a group.

984
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,670
He knows how to behave to survive.

985
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,890
- He sure does.
- The captain is at the end.

986
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,170
- He knows it.
- I just feel sorry for him.

987
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,330
Why does it matter...

988
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,280
- Only he's wearing a jacket.
- It doesn't matter to me.

989
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,680
- I didn't realize that.
- He's wearing a jacket.

990
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,540
- We'll begin the first mission.
- Yes.

991
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,600
Since all the members of BTOB are
very athletic...

992
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,340
- True. They must've worked out...
- Yes.

993
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,980
- very hard. They looked muscular.
- Lee Min Hyuk...

994
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,290
And they were so eager to beat you
as well.

995
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,220
- Exactly. I don't know why...
- So we...

996
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,110
- our guests are eager to beat us?
- But...

997
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,050
None of them were able to beat us.

998
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,930
- In fact, there's no one...
- They were no match for us.

999
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,790
- who would aim to beat Suk Jin.
- Exactly.

1000
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:31,200
Suk Jin always acts so determined
and confident.

1001
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,440
- No one can beat us.
- He speaks louder than any of us.

1002
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,090
- He has so much to say.
- We'll accept anyone's challenge.

1003
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,670
- Tell them to form a team of seven.
- The average...

1004
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,600
Okay. Anyway, the first mission...

1005
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,500
requires physical strength and agility.

1006
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,440
It's Agonizing and Painful.

1007
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,670
- I guess it'll be painful.
- We'll have to endure pain.

1008
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,050
- The games we'll play today...
- I don't feel pain.

1009
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,440
So Min, you're good at it, right?

1010
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,880
The winning team will get
only three penalty balls.

1011
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,610
- Yes.
- The losing team will get ten.

1012
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,880
- Got it.
- I see.

1013
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
Ten penalty balls.

1014
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,650
In the first round, we'll give you
a sponge stick and flour.

1015
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,820
You'll have a 1-on-1 match,
playing the rice barley game.

1016
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,190
- You have to hit the opponent...
- Rice. Barley.

1017
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,130
while saying "Rice" to get a point.

1018
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,130
- You fail if he or she stops you.
- Okay.

1019
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,400
Gosh, I would've had a chance
to smash the BTOB members' heads.

1020
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,610
What a shame. He would've...

1021
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,300
- smashed them to a pulp.
- You can say "Rice" five times.

1022
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,900
The more you succeed in attacking,
the more points your team gets.

1023
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,900
I understand.

1024
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,270
Who will be the first player?

1025
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,050
- Well... From our team...
- I'll go first.

1026
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,250
- Okay.
- Then So Min will go first.

1027
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,320
Suk Jin will be our first player.

1028
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,320
Suk Jin should go first.

1029
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,440
If it's Suk Jin...

1030
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,320
How about So Min goes first
since it's Suk Jin?

1031
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,320
Hey. My gosh. I can't believe her.

1032
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,000
Hey, why would you...
It's just ridiculous...

1033
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,800
how So Min thinks that she can beat me.

1034
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,690
What makes you think that you can beat me?

1035
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,860
You think you have a chance to win?
You think you can beat me, right?

1036
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,440
It won't hurt.

1037
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,040
Everyone on our team wanted to
compete with Suk Jin.

1038
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,130
I wish I was out there.

1039
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,210
- I wanted to compete with him.
- He's funny.

1040
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,270
- Go ahead.
- Can we start now? A practice game?

1041
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,610
- No. We should start right away.
- Start without a practice game.

1042
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,920
There's no practice run in life.

1043
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,650
I think you should take off your glasses.

1044
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,150
- Ready.
- Don't hit the side.

1045
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,880
- Say "Barley" or "Rice".
- "Barley."

1046
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,050
- Is this the right position?
- Yes. Get set.

1047
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,980
Go.

1048
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,300
(Rice!)

1049
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,460
- Rice.
- Gosh.

1050
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,500
(What?)

1051
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,500
- What's with you lately?
- Oh, man.

1052
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,170
Seriously?

1053
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,670
- Hey.
- Can you believe this?

1054
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,900
- Hey, why...
- What's gotten into you?

1055
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,070
- Why would she...
- Hey, So Min.

1056
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,040
- I mean... Hey.
- That's not how you play this game.

1057
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,300
- My gosh.
- You should've pretended first.

1058
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,440
- It's not that.
- I'm sorry.

1059
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,980
- I saw the madness in her eyes.
- It wasn't like that.

1060
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,420
- She must have lost her mind.
- Exactly.

1061
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,250
- You have madness inside you.
- I'm sorry.

1062
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,250
- She drives me crazy.
- Watch me, So Min.

1063
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,250
- Okay.
- Barley.

1064
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,290
- Barley. Rice.
- Barley. Rice.

1065
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,520
- Like this.
- I attacked him right away.

1066
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,230
- You shouldn't just beat him up.
- You should pull it back.

1067
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,630
- You were like this. "Rice!"
- I shouldn't skip that part?

1068
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,000
- This is what you did.
- I'm sorry.

1069
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,550
- Just wait and see.
- You shouldn't do it like that.

1070
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,770
- I didn't hit you like that.
- Just wait and see.

1071
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,800
- Suk Jin will get back at you.
- Right.

1072
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,440
So Min, you can put less flour
on the stick.

1073
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,090
- Oh, I see. Okay.
- That's too much.

1074
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:51,130
The stick turned black
after a single blow.

1075
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,900
- Here we go. Barley.
- Just do as you want.

1076
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,110
- Like this?
- Yes, that's good.

1077
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,710
- Barley.
- Good.

1078
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,000
- Barley.
- Okay. Gosh.

1079
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,270
(Flour falls off.)

1080
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,380
- Barley.
- Oh, no.

1081
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,070
- Barley.
- Good. That's how you should do it.

1082
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,250
(Hitting repeatedly)

1083
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,420
- She said, "Barley."
- Barley.

1084
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,460
- Barley.
- Darn.

1085
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,880
- He's upset.
- Right.

1086
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,020
- Calm down.
- Why, Suk Jin?

1087
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,190
- He's annoyed.
- His face is covered in flour.

1088
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,380
- He got annoyed.
- Sit down now.

1089
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,730
- It's just a game. What's wrong?
- He got upset.

1090
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:16,230
- I'm so annoyed.
- It's just a game, Suk Jin.

1091
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,820
- Why did you hit me so hard?
- Barley.

1092
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,270
Barley.

1093
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,400
(But Suk Jin keeps getting floured.)

1094
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Suk Jin, you should let it go
right after you grab it.

1095
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,860
- Let it go right away.
- You should spread your arms.

1096
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,000
- Barley.
- Good.

1097
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,340
So Min, you shouldn't hit him like that.

1098
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,040
- Barley.
- Hey, stop it.

1099
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,050
You shouldn't hit him like that.

1100
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,110
Barley!

1101
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,770
- Wait.
- What's with you today?

1102
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,050
- So Min.
- What's up with you?

1103
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,340
- What's wrong with you today?
- Okay, I get it.

1104
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,320
- There is madness in her eyes.
- Without a warning...

1105
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,440
Rice!

1106
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,550
- There is madness in her eyes.
- Without a warning...

1107
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,590
Rice!

1108
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,250
I won, right?

1109
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,380
- I won.
- What are you doing?

1110
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,400
- He has to be seated.
- Right.

1111
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,130
You know what? Just consider I lost.

1112
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,630
You did it five times, so take a seat.

1113
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,670
Why?

1114
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,820
Suk Jin...

1115
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,300
- Can't you do it with a smile?
- At least put on a smile.

1116
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,400
Suk Jin, come on.

1117
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,960
(Laughing)

1118
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,210
How is she supposed
to take this as a game?

1119
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,300
- You did great though.
- Okay.

1120
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,500
Suk Jin is on the offense next.

1121
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,770
How many times must one take it?

1122
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,500
- She's good at this.
- Seok Sam's with us today.

1123
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,000
- He's Seok Sam today.
- Okay.

1124
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,570
You know I respect you, right?

1125
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,920
- Well...
- It doesn't mean anything.

1126
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,020
It's only a game.

1127
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,380
- This won't be a controversy.
- Can't the weak link...

1128
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,710
change who she's up against?

1129
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,320
- No.
- Don't I get that advantage?

1130
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,210
- Here.
- Your hands shouldn't touch.

1131
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,650
- Not like that.
- Keep your arms wide.

1132
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,090
- Like this.
- At least this far apart.

1133
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,130
- About this wide.
- Like this.

1134
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,520
- Rice!
- What?

1135
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,860
- Rice!
- She caught it.

1136
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,130
(His blitz attack didn't work.)

1137
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,730
- How slow of you.
- How did she grab it?

1138
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,710
- How?
- That was very slow.

1139
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,070
- That was slow.
- You...

1140
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,070
- So Min, focus.
- So Min...

1141
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,380
Barley. She's good at grabbing it.

1142
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,270
So Min, you're doing great.
You look so cool right now.

1143
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,250
Rice!

1144
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,670
(His second attempt was a success.)

1145
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,920
- Okay.
- Keep going.

1146
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,340
- I can't see a thing.
- Right?

1147
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,880
Bar...

1148
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,750
Barley.

1149
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,130
You can't block with your hands like that.

1150
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,290
Keep your arms apart.

1151
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,190
- That's right.
- Your arms should be that wide.

1152
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,420
- There you go.
- Barley.

1153
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,500
- Rice!
- Yes!

1154
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,960
- It was right in the middle.
- Must you hit that hard?

1155
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,900
- You smacked her on the head.
- That wasn't nice.

1156
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,570
- I got invested in the game.
- You did it twice.

1157
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,840
Are you all right?

1158
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,570
Of course. The two weakest links
shouldn't be this way.

1159
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,170
Exactly.
You're both the weak links among us.

1160
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,250
They make quite the rivals, don't they?

1161
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:12,900
You have one more attempt left.

1162
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,320
Barley.

1163
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,750
Nicely done. That was great.

1164
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,190
- Barley.
- That gaze is perfect.

1165
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,520
Barley.

1166
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,290
(He keeps baiting her with barley.)

1167
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,460
Rice.

1168
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,860
(She's humiliated.)

1169
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,250
Are you all right? I'm sorry about that.

1170
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,590
That was mean of you.

1171
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,920
(So Min was played by
the annoying Seok Sam again.)

1172
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,000
- But...
- That was hilarious.

1173
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,270
- That was mean of you.
- Wasn't it fun?

1174
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,540
- You scored four points.
- Four points?

1175
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,840
- Nice!
- All right.

1176
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,170
- Suk Jin's loving it.
- Next up...

1177
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,500
is Jong Kook.

1178
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,610
- Jong Kook?
- Then...

1179
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:42,210
I'll handle him.

1180
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,300
Jae Suk...

1181
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,110
- Then I'll...
- Okay.

1182
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,170
He knows it should be him.

1183
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,610
- I'll show you.
- Sure.

1184
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,980
- If you think about it...
- Go, Jae Suk.

1185
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,480
- Will you go first?
- No, you can go first.

1186
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,840
- No, go first.
- You can go first.

1187
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,590
- You can go first.
- No, you go first.

1188
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,290
- Gosh.
- He's being considerate.

1189
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,860
- Sure, go first.
- Okay.

1190
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,820
Bring it on!

1191
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,460
So Min.

1192
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,690
What are you doing?

1193
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,070
- This isn't a sticky rice cake.
- So Min.

1194
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,630
- Seriously?
- What are you up to?

1195
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,670
This isn't a rice cake.

1196
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,960
- I'm trying to do my best.
- Who made you the master?

1197
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,380
What are you doing?

1198
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,440
It's all in the hands, Jong Kook.

1199
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,000
Don't be ridiculous.

1200
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,770
"Su" means hands and "ta" means to hit.

1201
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,570
- Here we go.
- Sure.

1202
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,380
- Grab the blue part.
- Here we go.

1203
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,710
(They bicker over
the placement of his hands.)

1204
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,820
We're both men, aren't we?

1205
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,650
- Don't cheat.
- It will hurt.

1206
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,110
- If I hold it here...
- It won't hurt.

1207
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,290
- What?
- Come on.

1208
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,750
Where on the bat I hold
is not your concern.

1209
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,650
Can I grab it anywhere I want as well?

1210
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:34,820
What?

1211
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,630
- Not his collar though.
- I see.

1212
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,270
- All right.
- Our blood type is B.

1213
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,860
- Let's do this.
- All right!

1214
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,270
Show how unique our personalities can be.

1215
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,210
(The two enemies go head to head.)

1216
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,480
Go, Team Type B.

1217
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,400
Go, Team Type B. You are the best.

1218
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,650
Go, Team Type A.

1219
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,590
Rice!

1220
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,690
Show how unique you are.

1221
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,440
- All right!
- Show how unique you are.

1222
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,320
- What...
- Nice!

1223
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,820
- Jae Suk.
- Don't be intimidated.

1224
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,420
- Are you kidding me?
- Trick him with barley first.

1225
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,130
- Trick him with barley first.
- Got it.

1226
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,630
- Barley.
- Good.

1227
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,090
- Yes, have fun with him.
- Barley.

1228
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,770
You're dominating this game.

1229
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,270
Go, Team Type B.

1230
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,730
He's trembling.

1231
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,460
- Barley.
- He's trembling.

1232
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,040
You can tell that he's nervous.

1233
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,340
- Barley.
- Nice!

1234
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,000
He's obviously nervous.

1235
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,940
(He tricks Jong Kook.)

1236
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,210
You're playing him nicely.

1237
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,170
- He hasn't been able to attack you.
- Barley.

1238
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,320
Nice.

1239
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,610
- Rice!
- Yes!

1240
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,380
(He lands his first attack!)

1241
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,690
- Rice.
- No, don't.

1242
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,480
- You got 1 out of 3.
- Only 1 out of 3.

1243
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,790
- The second one didn't count.
- It did.

1244
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,190
What are you talking about?

1245
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,860
- You said rice.
- When?

1246
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,860
- We heard you.
- Did I?

1247
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,960
- You said it.
- Of course.

1248
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,500
That didn't count though.

1249
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,340
Barley.

1250
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,040
- Rice!
- Jong Kook grabs it every time.

1251
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,480
Why are you...

1252
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,800
Don't say "rice" first.

1253
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,480
Don't say "rice" first before hitting him.

1254
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,610
There's no need to be nice.

1255
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,340
- Keep it short.
- Is that how I did it?

1256
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,380
- This is your last chance.
- Why are you afraid of the bat?

1257
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,750
- How many did I get?
- Only one.

1258
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,380
- You got one out of four.
- One out of four?

1259
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,550
You need at least one more.

1260
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,920
- Barley.
- You need this point.

1261
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:12,050
Barley.

1262
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,420
- You can tell when he'll say rice.
- Rice!

1263
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,460
See what I mean?

1264
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,090
(Jong Kook grabbed it again.)

1265
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,570
- Seriously?
- Why are you so bad at this?

1266
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,130
- Three barley, and one rice.
- You say barley twice...

1267
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,130
or three times before going for the rice.

1268
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,400
- Why are you so bad at this?
- Exactly.

1269
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,630
You're terrible at this.

1270
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:26,210
- Can I try it one more time?
- Jae Suk.

1271
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,980
- Just let him smash you.
- Oh, no.

1272
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,340
Why are you so bad at this?

1273
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,480
Jae Suk's an idiot.

1274
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,770
- Rice!
- An idiot.

1275
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,300
Rice!

1276
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,110
(The muscular warrior viciously warms up.)

1277
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,270
Nice!

1278
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:38,420
I love it. I love your gritty attitude.

1279
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,860
- I won't cover it in flour.
- Let's do this.

1280
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,710
No flour?

1281
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,820
- Why won't you dip it in flour?
- You're scaring us.

1282
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,460
I won't cover it in flour.

1283
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:49,860
I'll keep it clean.

1284
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,070
Where's the flour?

1285
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,960
Why won't you dip it in the flour?

1286
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,300
Jae Suk, he's more focused
on smacking you.

1287
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,940
He wants to smack you around, that's all.

1288
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,570
- You just need to grab it though.
- Of course.

1289
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,340
All right.

1290
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:02,270
Barley.

1291
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,380
- Jae Suk's already scared.
- Barley.

1292
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,550
- Barley.
- Open your eyes.

1293
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:08,820
Watch out for the edge.

1294
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,210
You might get injured
if you get hit by it.

1295
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,520
- You get what I mean, right?
- Yes.

1296
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,840
Look where it'll hit you.

1297
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,320
- I'll scratch your face.
- He's nervous.

1298
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,520
- Are you sure about this?
- What can I do?

1299
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,130
Move a little forward.

1300
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,920
You can tell that he's nervous.

1301
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,360
- Get in a little closer. Good.
- He's intimidated.

1302
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,420
Rice!

1303
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,570
(Grunting)

1304
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,800
- That...
- What?

1305
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,230
- What?
- Is this allowed?

1306
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,690
- Come in closer.
- Is this allowed?

1307
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,070
- Come in closer.
- Are you sure?

1308
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,340
The bat has been ripped.

1309
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,130
- Oh, no.
- What on earth?

1310
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,230
Let's keep on playing. Bring it in closer.

1311
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:38,150
Keep your hands lifted
and your eyes on the bat.

1312
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,550
- You can grab it.
- Just don't close your eyes.

1313
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:41,650
- He...
- He's about to cry.

1314
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,420
- I feel bad for Jae Suk.
- He might cry.

1315
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,210
Barley. Your swing shouldn't be big.

1316
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,380
He's like a puppy.

1317
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,710
No big swings.

1318
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,790
He might cry.

1319
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,090
Barley.

1320
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,800
- Rice!
- He blocked it.

1321
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:56,250
(One hit)

1322
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,320
- Did he?
- Yes.

1323
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,170
(Two hits)

1324
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,440
Rice!

1325
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,900
- There's static electricity.
- Are you okay?

1326
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,170
(His hair is floating.)

1327
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:08,570
There's static electricity.

1328
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:10,300
- Are you okay?
- His hair.

1329
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,550
- Look at his hair.
- Let's dip it in some flour.

1330
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,210
It looks like it hurts.

1331
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,670
- Please get him some flour.
- Why isn't there any flour?

1332
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:16,790
- Right.
- Exactly.

1333
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:18,820
- Why isn't there any flour?
- Dip it in some flour.

1334
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,380
- Wait.
- Put some on your hair.

1335
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,820
What's wrong with you?

1336
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,190
Because there's none on here.

1337
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,230
- I can't believe it.
- You got 3 out of 3.

1338
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,420
- My gosh.
- What do you mean?

1339
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,550
He missed one.

1340
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:28,590
- I blocked one.
- No, I got it.

1341
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,020
- You didn't.
- He blocked one.

1342
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,520
- I blocked one.
- I really did.

1343
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,500
- We'll say that he did.
- Sure. Let's say that.

1344
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,690
"We'll say that he did?"

1345
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,630
- I blocked it for sure.
- All right.

1346
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:38,710
- Smile, will you?
- I feel bad for him.

1347
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:39,860
- Poor Jae Suk.
- Barley.

1348
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,440
It shakes too much.

1349
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:42,770
Barley.

1350
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:43,800
(Ah...)

1351
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,300
- Barley.
- Jae Suk might cry.

1352
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,150
- He's about to cry.
- Barley.

1353
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:49,270
(You can tell that a defeat is imminent.)

1354
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,550
Barley.

1355
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:51,650
Rice!

1356
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,340
Rice!

1357
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,750
(The game ends with him
getting a beating.)

1358
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,650
(Mr. Static Electricity
couldn't even fight back.)

1359
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,050
- Just sit down.
- Don't cry, Jae Suk.

1360
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,420
- All right.
- Hold on.

1361
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,860
- What did you think?
- I...

1362
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:04,690
- How is this allowed?
- What do you mean?

1363
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,690
- How is this allowed?
- What?

1364
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,170
Why do you look like you've been wronged?

1365
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,590
You won four points.

1366
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:10,840
- Sure.
- Nice.

1367
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,360
- You did great.
- I know.

1368
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,630
- It's all right.
- It's only a game.

1369
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:15,110
That was only the preliminary game.

1370
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:17,270
- It's time for the main event.
- Sure.

1371
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,210
- Come on in.
- This is Round Two.

1372
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,150
I see you came prepared
to entertain BTOB today.

1373
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:25,320
You were going to milk
everything out of them.

1374
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,790
<i>I can't live without you</i>

1375
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,020
What's this?

1376
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,590
- What's that?
- What's this?

1377
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,480
- This looks like fun.
- What's this?

1378
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,190
- I don't know what it is though.
- Those must burst open.

1379
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,630
Gosh, look at that.

1380
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:43,610
The 3.5m stick behind you
will be incorporated in this game.

1381
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,900
When the stick is dropped,

1382
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,480
you will try and burst the balloons.

1383
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:55,570
You will stay on the ground
and reach up at the same time.

1384
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,650
That's simple. It's not easy at all.

1385
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,320
- It's not difficult.
- Sounds easy enough.

1386
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,050
- We need to burst the balloons.
- Over here?

1387
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,050
- It just needs to be dropped.
- That's right.

1388
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:05,750
- Can you drop it for us?
- Let's see.

1389
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,690
- Like this?
- Move forward, Haha.

1390
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:08,920
Should I move forward?

1391
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,360
Just look at where you need to be.

1392
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,070
Sit below your designated balloons.

1393
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,800
Here's the thing.

1394
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,360
If you grab onto the stick too early,

1395
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,570
the people behind you
could be out of range.

1396
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:19,860
- Gosh.
- Exactly.

1397
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,480
- Burst them at the same time.
- Sure.

1398
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,570
(Their individual agility
and teamwork are crucial.)

1399
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:23,800
- All right.
- Let's hold up our arms.

1400
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,000
Please get ready.

1401
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,750
- Wait.
- This is how it'll be.

1402
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,670
- This is how it'll be.
- Gosh.

1403
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,520
- That's terrifying.
- Do it once more.

1404
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,520
Let me show you once more.
It'll be like this.

1405
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,860
It'll fall exactly like this.

1406
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,290
- Looks good.
- You can't...

1407
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,190
- slow down the stick like that.
- I wasn't doing anything.

1408
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,480
- Let me do it.
- We'll be watching.

1409
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,630
No, we'll drop it for you.

1410
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,150
You already put on your gear.

1411
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,590
- I'll take it off then.
- What?

1412
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:44,000
- Why...
- Are you speaking casually to me?

1413
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,170
What do you mean?

1414
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:46,730
You're younger than me, so I'm allowed to.

1415
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,360
- Move.
- No, move.

1416
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,500
Move!

1417
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,710
Let me do it instead.

1418
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,110
- Jong Kook allowed it.
- Go ahead.

1419
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:53,710
Jae Suk, show us once more.

1420
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,800
We'll try and get into position.

1421
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:56,710
- Oh, no!
- It'll be like this.

1422
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,710
- You're done practicing.
- This is doable.

1423
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,150
- But...
- It's like an amusement park ride.

1424
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:02,110
Don't worry.
It's like being at an amusement park.

1425
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,090
Let me try that again.

1426
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:08,110
- All right.
- You only get one chance.

1427
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:09,750
- You only get one chance.
- Got it.

1428
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:12,820
So Min, if you grab it too early,
the stick won't reach them.

1429
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,400
- You get that, right?
- Sure.

1430
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,630
What principle is this?

1431
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,230
- The principle of the lever.
- That is correct.

1432
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,500
Why didn't the two of you answer?

1433
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,940
Are you their teacher?

1434
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,090
They are my students.

1435
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,440
The principle of the lever?

1436
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,610
- Your students?
- Yes, the principle of the lever.

1437
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:27,130
I see they are on the same academic level.

1438
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,480
- They are.
- Right.

1439
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,110
You are pretty much on the same level.

1440
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,550
You must have empty heads
as your students.

1441
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:32,880
- All three of them?
- Yes.

1442
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,050
- You want to have a quiz with us?
- Do you really want to?

1443
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:37,420
Bring it on.
I can win against the three of you.

1444
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,480
- Okay.
- All right. Here we go.

1445
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,790
Let's go. Let's go for it.

1446
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:40,820
- Let's start.
- Start.

1447
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,250
- You only have one chance.
- Okay.

1448
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,020
- Get ready.
- Get ready.

1449
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,130
In 1, 2, 3.

1450
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,320
Three.

1451
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,500
(How will the three empty heads'
challenge turn out?)

1452
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,130
- All right! They got 2.
- They got 2.

1453
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,570
(They got 2.)

1454
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:00,840
- They got two.
- It's all right.

1455
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,980
You missed that.

1456
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,110
- It's okay. Let's get out of here.
- I slapped it right away.

1457
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,400
You got two points.

1458
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,340
- We're pretty good.
- We're good.

1459
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,070
Type B is surely good.

1460
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:12,790
- We should've burst all three.
- We can do it.

1461
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:13,980
It was close though.

1462
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,480
- Take a seat.
- All right.

1463
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,130
Can you lower it a little?

1464
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,480
- Okay, I will.
- Okay.

1465
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,020
- Does it hurt?
- No.

1466
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,550
- He can't feel the pain.
- Is it okay?

1467
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:23,690
- It doesn't hurt.
- I bet it does.

1468
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,300
I bet it hurts!

1469
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,460
Are you sure you're okay?

1470
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,590
It doesn't hurt.

1471
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,730
(The man with a bamboo stick
is goofing around.)

1472
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:32,130
I'm glad.

1473
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:34,070
I'm glad it doesn't hurt.

1474
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,400
I'm glad...

1475
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,540
I'm glad you're okay.

1476
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,000
- I am okay, but...
- Okay.

1477
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,800
- He is annoyed.
- But you should know your limit.

1478
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,380
Okay. You're okay, right?

1479
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,270
I'm okay.
I tried it out for the sake of safety.

1480
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:44,340
You only gave it a go.

1481
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,550
- Yes, I did.
- Well done. You did well.

1482
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,210
Try lowering it.

1483
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:49,590
Watch. Try adjusting your position.

1484
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:51,150
- Lower it.
- There you go.

1485
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:53,730
- It's right here.
- Okay.

1486
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,500
- It's right here.
- It's right here.

1487
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,130
- In 1, 2, 3. Boom!
- Boom!

1488
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,130
- Okay, I got it.
- Let's go for it.

1489
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:00,170
You should lower it as is.

1490
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,630
Of course. How else would I lower it?

1491
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,840
Don't mess with it midways.

1492
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,860
- So when I lower it...
- How far are you going back?

1493
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,840
(Lowering backward)

1494
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,110
- Hey.
- Sir.

1495
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:10,230
Hey.

1496
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:11,300
Are you shooting an arrow?

1497
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,770
- What?
- Are you shooting an arrow?

1498
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:13,980
An arrow?

1499
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,340
What do you mean?

1500
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,190
Your pose is extreme.

1501
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:19,110
Are you going to cut us in half or what?

1502
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:21,020
- It's because he doesn't get it.
- I'm sorry.

1503
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,820
Type Bs can do only one thing at a time.

1504
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,860
Gosh, seriously.

1505
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,460
Every blood type
has its own characteristic.

1506
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,050
Respect that.

1507
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:28,960
Do you want to check
what your blood type is now?

1508
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,190
What did you say?

1509
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:31,730
What did he say?

1510
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,570
- What did you say?
- What?

1511
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,960
- I'll stop here.
- Stop. That's it.

1512
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,230
- I'll start now.
- Okay.

1513
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:40,070
- We got it. You can start.
- I'll start.

1514
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,730
In 1, 2, 3.

1515
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,040
- Let's start.
- Let's start. Grab it.

1516
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,150
- I got it.
- Grab it.

1517
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,380
- Grab it!
- I got it.

1518
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,570
(What will be the result
of Team Type A and Type AB?)

1519
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:48,150
- Okay!
- All right! We got it.

1520
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,690
- Okay!
- Okay! They all burst.

1521
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:51,980
- We got it, right?
- Three points!

1522
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,250
- All right!
- Yes!

1523
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,250
(They got 3 points
for bursting all 3 balloons.)

1524
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,960
- You see?
- You practiced for too long.

1525
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,750
They practiced for too long.

1526
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,750
You let them.

1527
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:01,320
- They rehearsed for an hour!
- You let them.

1528
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,190
You enjoyed watching it.

1529
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:04,860
Didn't they practice for too long?

1530
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,500
- You let us!
- You let us practice!

1531
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,500
- You let us practice...
- You let us!

1532
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,670
because it was fun.

1533
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:10,860
I was hit by the bamboo
several times because of you.

1534
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,230
You still got another round.

1535
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,170
- Let's start the next round.
- We still have more?

1536
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:16,800
No, don't take off your helmets.

1537
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,400
- We shouldn't?
- We're playing something else?

1538
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,440
- What's that?
- It's long!

1539
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,480
(Here comes a gigantic bamboo stick.)

1540
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,670
Oh, my gosh.

1541
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,050
- What's this?
- It's a longer stick.

1542
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:27,150
- That's why they let us try it.
- It's longer.

1543
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,790
So this is...

1544
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,020
They wanted to make it longer.

1545
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,020
It's scary though.

1546
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,250
- It's thrilling though.
- It looks fun.

1547
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:35,500
I'm actually scared.

1548
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:38,690
Let's get to it right away.
This time, it'll be a 6m stick.

1549
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,070
Originally, we were going to have
all six members try it,

1550
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,670
but we'll have only three members.

1551
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:44,000
- All 3 of us?
- All 3 of us?

1552
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,210
Since you're wearing the helmets,
let's start with you guys.

1553
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,900
This isn't anything hard!

1554
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,000
Why don't we give them
no time to practice?

1555
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,110
We won't have practice this time.

1556
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,250
They practiced too much.

1557
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,380
Exactly.

1558
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,940
(Exclaiming)

1559
00:51:58,110 --> 00:51:59,920
- They practiced too much.
- I know.

1560
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,790
(Lifting)

1561
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,520
- This is...
- There will be no practice.

1562
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,090
- All right.
- Wait. Sir!

1563
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:07,020
- You should figure it out yourself.
- We need to know where it drops.

1564
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,300
You should figure it out yourself.

1565
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,360
- Lower it for us. That's not fair.
- That can't happen.

1566
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,800
- We'll do it just once.
- Yes, let's try it.

1567
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,230
- Let's lower it.
- We need to get in our position.

1568
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,570
We must get in our position.

1569
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:16,630
It's about here.

1570
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:17,900
- You should lower it more.
- Wait.

1571
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:19,900
That's it. It's around here.

1572
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,480
- That's it. It's around here.
- You should try it now.

1573
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,500
- Let's start.
- Let's start.

1574
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,630
- Here we go.
- Okay.

1575
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:24,940
You must say "start"
on the count of three.

1576
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,270
- Start!
- Start!

1577
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:28,320
- In 1, 2, 3. Start!
- In 1, 2, 3. Start!

1578
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:29,770
- Start!
- Start!

1579
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:31,150
- Wait, it's so scary.
- Start.

1580
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:33,590
(Team Type A and Type AB burst
all 3 balloons in the previous round.)

1581
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,460
(Will they be able
to burst all the balloons this time?)

1582
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,730
(Screaming)

1583
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,630
(Smashing with a bamboo stick)

1584
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:42,820
Yes! Well done!

1585
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,590
- Was it you?
- Were you hit? You burst them.

1586
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,270
You popped two balloons.

1587
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:48,170
- Suk Jin, well done.
- All right.

1588
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,000
Actually, it doesn't hurt.

1589
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,170
It doesn't hurt.

1590
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,710
(It's Team Type B's turn.)

1591
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,900
- Who's going to skip the turn?
- I will.

1592
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,880
- Gosh, you.
- I'll skip my turn.

1593
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,270
- You should let So Min sit out.
- Have So Min sit out.

1594
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:00,980
- But So Min found it fun.
- So Min.

1595
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,210
So Min. Thank you.

1596
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,820
You should sit out since it hurts.

1597
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,380
It hurts.

1598
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:06,710
- What?
- You should sit out...

1599
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:08,610
- because it hurts. No.
- But she likes it.

1600
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,360
- You should sit out.
- What's with you?

1601
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,150
- It's better if she sits out.
- Why are you worried about me?

1602
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,000
So Min, you should do it.

1603
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
- You should do it for her.
- Don't let her sit here.

1604
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,270
Se Chan told me to sit out
because it'll hurt.

1605
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:18,320
It'll hurt.

1606
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,570
(Se Chan told me to sit out
because it'll hurt.)

1607
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,190
(Smiling from ear to ear)

1608
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:23,840
(Laughing)

1609
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,070
My gosh.

1610
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:27,440
(Team Type B's old guys are
enjoying their fresh love story.)

1611
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,340
- To be honest...
- All right, then.

1612
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,980
That must've been heart-fluttering
for you, So Min.

1613
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,020
- Sir, don't meddle in.
- Why not?

1614
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,480
I should put this on, right?

1615
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,170
Then I'll sit in front.

1616
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,880
I'll sit in front.
You should sit at the back.

1617
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,940
(The little scaredy-cats volunteer
to sit in the front.)

1618
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,550
I think the last seat is really scary.

1619
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,550
It is. Let's have Jae Suk sit there.

1620
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:46,230
That's the scariest seat.

1621
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,860
Let's have them check their positions.

1622
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,360
- We'll give you only one chance.
- Guys, don't worry.

1623
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,730
- Give us a chance.
- We'll give you a chance.

1624
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,570
Jae Suk, sit closely.

1625
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,070
- Sit closely.
- Don't tell us what to do.

1626
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,070
- Sit closely.
- Okay.

1627
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,960
Here it goes. Watch carefully.

1628
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,960
You should get one, at least.

1629
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:01,610
- It's long.
- It's right here.

1630
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:02,980
- You got it, right?
- Hey!

1631
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,110
That's it.

1632
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,000
(Grunting)

1633
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,270
Hey!

1634
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:08,750
- Jae Suk.
- That was a delay of game.

1635
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:11,210
- Come on!
- Hey, Mr. Delay!

1636
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,790
We're running out of time!

1637
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:13,820
(Scared)

1638
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,650
It's so scary.

1639
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:17,150
- I guess it's impossible.
- That little...

1640
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:18,360
This is it.

1641
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,860
It doesn't hurt!

1642
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,900
You can do it!

1643
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,050
- Are you ready?
- You got this!

1644
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:24,670
- We popped two.
- Wait.

1645
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:27,340
- We'll start now.
- No! We need to practice.

1646
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,770
No, you're done with it.

1647
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:30,230
- We haven't checked our positions.
- Let Jae Suk get the feel of it...

1648
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:31,270
since it's his first time.

1649
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:32,900
- That's right?
- What?

1650
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,770
Did you just drop honorifics?

1651
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,770
- No!
- Okay.

1652
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:38,000
Lower it.

1653
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,300
- Here we go.
- You must watch it until the end.

1654
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,020
Keep your eye on it.

1655
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,020
(Swinging)

1656
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,710
(Gosh, darn it.)

1657
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:45,790
This is how it'll be like.

1658
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,020
I even grabbed on it.

1659
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,290
Hey, it's much faster in the real game.

1660
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:52,590
Okay. Let's go for it!

1661
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,860
- Brace yourselves.
- I have no fear!

1662
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,320
- Type B has no fear!
- You can do it!

1663
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,090
- You got this!
- Type B!

1664
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:01,190
- Jae Suk, you shouldn't dodge.
- Let's go, Type AB!

1665
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,590
- Come on! What are you on about?
- Don't dodge.

1666
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:04,940
I'll lower it once you say, "start."

1667
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,670
- In 1, 2, 3. Start!
- In 1, 2, 3. Start!

1668
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:07,730
Here we go!

1669
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,900
- Here it goes.
- It'll fall on your heads.

1670
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,270
It's going to hurt a lot.

1671
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:14,880
(It's Team Type B's last chance.)

1672
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,520
(Will they be able
to burst all the balloons?)

1673
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,520
Don't avoid it.

1674
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,360
- Okay!
- Okay! We got this.

1675
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,710
What was that?

1676
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:26,090
(Doing a big bow all of a sudden)

1677
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,250
- What was that?
- Jae Suk!

1678
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:29,320
- Why did you dodge?
- What was that, Jae Suk?

1679
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,770
Gosh, you scaredy-cat.

1680
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,130
- They got two as well.
- Seriously.

1681
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:33,920
- Gosh, seriously.
- Gosh, you scaredy-cat.

1682
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:37,000
He told us this earlier
because he was scared to get hit.

1683
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,070
"I think it'd be fun
to control the bamboo stick."

1684
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,630
"So Min, you should do it."

1685
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,210
- He kept telling me to do it.
- It's so scary.

1686
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:44,250
All right!

1687
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:48,610
Team Type A and Type AB
wins with a score of 25 to 21.

1688
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:50,840
(Team Type A and Type AB
wins with a score of 25 to 21.)

1689
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,050
- You did well.
- Really?

1690
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:55,290
Team Type A and Type AB
gets only three penalty balls.

1691
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:57,860
And Team Type B gets ten penalty balls.

1692
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,230
- All right.
- It doesn't sound bad.

1693
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,630
You'll get ten penalty balls.

1694
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,150
I won't be leaving.

1695
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,800
I think it's only right
for you to join the other team.

1696
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,130
- But I won't.
- All right.

1697
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:08,300
- It's time to have lunch.
- Okay.

1698
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,460
Today's lunch menu was prepared
by someone more important...

1699
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,960
than Captain Ji.

1700
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,670
You'll have delicious tteokbokki
and crunchy fried chicken...

1701
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:16,940
that our client prepared for us.

1702
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,070
- It sounds good.
- I love crunchy fried chicken.

1703
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:23,170
I'd like to change my name
to Yoo Crunchy Fried.

1704
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:24,550
It suits you.

1705
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:25,840
- I'll change it to Habokki.
- I'll change mine to Jeon Chicken.

1706
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:27,610
- Call me Yoo Crunchy Fried.
- I'm Yang Tteok.

1707
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:28,690
You can call me Crunchy Fried.

1708
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:32,380
Those who sit with Haha
can't have crunchy fried chicken.

1709
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,090
- Why not?
- He's a model for another brand.

1710
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,400
You should stay out during lunch.

1711
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,230
- You should pack your meals.
- Why did you have to choose it?

1712
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,400
Haha can choose two members
to have tteokbokki with.

1713
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:44,340
It's Jae Suk for sure.

1714
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,000
But I'm Yoo Crunchy Fried.

1715
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,710
It'll be Jae Suk and Jong Kook.

1716
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,040
Who? Me?

1717
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,250
- You can't pick me.
- But I'm Yoo Crunchy Fried.

1718
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,920
- Then...
- Jae Suk and Suk Jin...

1719
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,250
But I'm Yoo Crunchy Fried.

1720
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,610
- Let him have tteokbokki.
- It's because...

1721
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:00,820
he went through a lot as a captain.

1722
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,290
- I didn't do much though.
- I'll pick So Min and Se Chan then.

1723
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:04,420
What? Why me?

1724
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,550
I just wanted to have tteokbokki with you.

1725
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:06,730
That's ridiculous!

1726
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:08,920
- No, I don't want to.
- That's right.

1727
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,090
They should get some quality time
while having tteokbokki.

1728
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:13,190
- No, I don't want to.
- Let's have tteokbokki together.

1729
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:14,440
- You should.
- Why should we?

1730
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,270
- Why are you so conscious of them?
- This is great!

1731
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,400
- He's so conscious of them.
- This is great.

1732
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,460
- I...
- So Min...

1733
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,440
Haha is indeed good with variety shows.

1734
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,900
- With variety shows?
- You're great with variety shows!

1735
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,670
- My gosh, it looks good.
- It's rose tteokbokki.

1736
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:27,050
It's Fen Haozi noodles.

1737
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:28,550
It's a type of glass noodle.

1738
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:30,210
It looks good.

1739
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,920
- It looks good.
- Enjoy your meal.

1740
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,190
I haven't seen you for a while,
crunchy fried chicken.

1741
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,460
Crunchy fried chicken!

1742
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,520
Let's see how their
crunchy fried chicken tastes.

1743
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,320
(Opening the box)

1744
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,300
- It looks really good.
- It's seriously...

1745
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,360
- Here.
- There are no bones.

1746
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,500
<i>- I love that there are no bones</i>
- Thank you.

1747
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,730
Gosh, it looks so good.

1748
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:53,570
I love that there are no bones

1749
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,730
The sauce is...

1750
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:55,940
(They have a feast of crunchy
fried chicken and tteokbokki.)

1751
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,300
The sauce is really good.

1752
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,980
It tastes different.

1753
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,300
It's so crunchy.

1754
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,570
I really wish you two could start dating.

1755
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:05,520
- What did you say?
- I wish they start dating.

1756
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,480
- You can't just say that.
- It's not that.

1757
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,360
- They look good together.
- Don't do that.

1758
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,980
Why don't you try feeding a piece
to Ji Hyo?

1759
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,520
Don't make them do something like that.

1760
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,050
- Why would you make them do that?
- I just wanted to see them do it.

1761
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,860
Should I punch you in the face?

1762
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:20,300
Don't they look good together?
I think they look great!

1763
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,670
Didn't you two send signals to him?

1764
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,670
But I want to try
the crunchy fried chicken.

1765
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,270
(But I want to eat crunchy fried chicken.)

1766
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:29,300
Why don't you say something?
Describe the taste, will you?

1767
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,610
It's their turn.

1768
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,110
- What's this?
- Won't our part be aired?

1769
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:34,770
No, we won't because
we're only having tteokbokki.

1770
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:36,340
If I were to steal their attention,

1771
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,880
you'll have to kiss each other.

1772
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,980
(If I were to steal their attention,
you'll have to kiss each other.)

1773
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,480
I would if this was a drama.

1774
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,610
I would too,

1775
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:42,750
- but I can't just do it.
- Let's say this is a drama.

1776
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,690
I can't do it with him.

1777
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:45,980
- Why not?
- Why don't you just turn his head?

1778
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,020
No, I can't.

1779
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,500
Just turn his head.

1780
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,630
- We're friends, that's why.
- For the preview.

1781
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,670
- I'm serious.
- Just turning his head.

1782
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,360
Many of them told me that I kiss well.

1783
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,670
(Grabbing)

1784
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,000
What are you doing?

1785
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:58,860
- He just told me to turn your head.
- Right. Just turn his head.

1786
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,300
- I'm going this way?
- Yes.

1787
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,670
You're kissing all of a sudden
while having tteokbokki.

1788
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:02,840
- That guy...
- What?

1789
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,750
You're so annoying.

1790
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,840
Why do you want us to do it?

1791
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,250
- What? Because...
- To steal the attention.

1792
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,150
they're stealing the limelight.

1793
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,210
Is this tteokbokki or udon?

1794
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:12,250
Of course it's tteokbokki.

1795
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,590
How many times do I have to tell you?

1796
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,650
The crunchy fried chicken is really good.

1797
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:16,650
It is.

1798
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,960
- Crunchy fried chicken.
- I met Yi Kyung the other day,

1799
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,520
Only the strong.

1800
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,860
- Second syllable.
- Jeong Il Nam.

1801
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,590
What was that?

1802
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:25,630
It was an acrostic poem.

1803
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:27,570
Who is Jeong Il Nam?

1804
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:29,000
What? I have no idea.

1805
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,860
- Gosh, it's spicy.
- Why did you say his name then?

1806
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,540
That's how you do acrostic poems.

1807
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,070
Doesn't he sound strong?

1808
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,040
Right! Jeong Il Nam sounds strong.

1809
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:38,070
It sounds like a name a bully would have.

1810
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,170
(They all got on the bus
after their meal.)

1811
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:41,250
Put your seatbelt on.

1812
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,250
- You see our soccer team...
- The soccer team?

1813
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,320
We moved the stadium to Yangjae-dong.

1814
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,150
- Really?
- Jong Kook.

1815
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,290
- Yes?
- There's only one member...

1816
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:49,420
of your soccer team here.

1817
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,420
I haven't been to the games lately though.

1818
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,630
Why would you tell us...

1819
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,860
- I'm just sharing...
- where the new stadium is?

1820
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,860
Aren't we supposed to share
what's going on in our lives?

1821
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:58,270
The director of our show
went to one of your games.

1822
00:59:58,270 --> 00:59:59,730
- I heard he was good.
- He's pretty good.

1823
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:02,630
But what did Myung Jae say?
Did he mention about Jong Kook?

1824
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,130
- Did Myung Jae...
- This is exactly...

1825
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:05,400
what Myung Jae said about Jong Kook.

1826
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,500
- What did he say?
- What did he say?

1827
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,670
Tell him to say it to my face.
Why would you speak on his behalf?

1828
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:10,270
He didn't like to see Jong Kook
acting out, right?

1829
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:12,210
- He mentioned two characteristics.
- What are they?

1830
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,300
The first one is...

1831
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:16,380
that the teammates are boisterous
when one of them makes mistakes,

1832
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,480
but when Jong Kook does,
they suddenly grow quiet.

1833
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,480
(They suddenly grow quiet
if Jong Kook makes a mistake.)

1834
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,790
It's supposed to be a secret!

1835
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:22,480
- That's for sure.
- It's a secret?

1836
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,290
Yes, it is. It must be kept a secret.

1837
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:26,150
A witty guy like him didn't know that.

1838
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,090
- He's like a textbook.
- What else?

1839
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:29,400
The second one...

1840
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,690
is that...

1841
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,920
when he runs out of energy
in the second half,

1842
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:34,670
they suddenly have fights
against each other.

1843
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:35,670
(They have a fight
when the second half begins.)

1844
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:37,860
I like to have tussles,

1845
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,940
so I tell them not to take it easy.

1846
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,770
I tell them to have tussles...

1847
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:44,480
and to focus on having tussles.

1848
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,070
Does every ball go to Jong Kook?

1849
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:48,170
- No, that's not the case.
- It's not?

1850
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:50,420
Jong Kook is in a position
that doesn't score.

1851
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,790
- He's a supporter?
- He's a striker who doesn't score.

1852
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:53,790
- That's right.
- Is that so?

1853
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:54,960
Maybe he can't score.

1854
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,020
- I don't score on purpose.
- He doesn't score on purpose.

1855
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:58,880
I pass the ball to the other player
at a critical moment.

1856
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,290
He really does.

1857
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:02,050
- That's what I do.
- There are...

1858
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:04,860
many players who are in their early 20s.

1859
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,860
They can't catch up with Jong Kook
in terms of stamina.

1860
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:10,500
We went to play a game in the new stadium.

1861
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,040
I saw someone with big ears
playing soccer.

1862
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,670
It was CODE KUNST.

1863
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:16,670
- CODE KUNST?
- Yes.

1864
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:18,380
- What did you call him?
- I heard he's good.

1865
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,380
It's CODE KUNST.

1866
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,110
- It's CODE KUNST?
- Yes.

1867
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,420
CODE KUNST is good at soccer.

1868
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,270
No, he plays like an old man.

1869
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:25,790
Like an old man?

1870
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:27,880
He just slanders everyone else.

1871
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,480
I compliment those who play well.

1872
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,290
Then who is one player
that you approve of?

1873
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:33,320
Patrice Evra.

1874
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,380
- Patrice Evra?
- Park Ji Sung.

1875
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:35,590
- Ji Sung.
- Patrice Evra and Park Ji Sung.

1876
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:37,190
- Or Son Heung Min.
- Heung Min and Ji Sung...

1877
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:38,820
are pretty good.

1878
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,270
(He only approves
of world-class soccer players.)

1879
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:42,360
They're approved
by people all around the world.

1880
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,270
- Young Jae will come to play often.
- I know this place.

1881
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:45,360
- It's the ophthalmic clinic...
- Which one?

1882
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,570
- I often go to.
- Which one?

1883
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:47,670
Me too.

1884
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:48,730
No one asked you.

1885
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:50,480
(No one asked you.)

1886
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,250
(Suddenly spewing out an acronym)

1887
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,380
- That's so childish.
- Right.

1888
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,880
- No one asked him.
- No one wants to know.

1889
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,520
No one wants to know
where your ophthalmic clinic is.

1890
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,210
- No one wants to know.
- We don't care...

1891
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:01,190
Do you even know what that means?

1892
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,960
That no one asked you
and no one wants to know.

1893
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,690
- That's not it.
- That's not what it means.

1894
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,750
"No one wants to know."
Isn't that what it means?

1895
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:09,420
- "No one wants to know."
- No, that's not what it means.

1896
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,320
No one asked you and no one wants to know.

1897
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,570
Then tell me what it means
in three seconds.

1898
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:15,400
- One, two, three.
- Mul naengmyeon.

1899
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,400
(Mul naengmyeon)

1900
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,040
- They don't want to know.
- I don't want "mul naengmyeon."

1901
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,770
It means I don't want "mul naengmyeon?"

1902
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,130
Don't sit your butt down.

1903
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:22,570
(I don't want mul naengmyeon
Don't sit your butt down.)

1904
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:23,770
You guys have perfect teamwork.

1905
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:25,150
It really means that.

1906
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:28,170
What do you want as a gift
when you two get married?

1907
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,380
Stop talking about that!

1908
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:30,770
Can't I even talk about it?

1909
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:32,650
- We already talked about this.
- Why do you keep mentioning it?

1910
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:34,150
Do you want an 85in TV?

1911
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,250
Don't promise things carelessly.

1912
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,290
I can afford a TV myself.

1913
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:39,750
- If you get married...
- What's wrong with you?

1914
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,020
- A 99in TV is a bit expensive.
- Forget it.

1915
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:42,820
I'm sorry but even if we do get married,

1916
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:43,820
you shouldn't come.

1917
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,270
- Why not?
- You don't want him to come?

1918
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:46,400
- You're...
- Why not?

1919
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,230
- That means you actually...
- Whatever!

1920
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:49,360
(Whatever!)

1921
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,090
- Whatever?
- Whatever. No one cares.

1922
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:52,130
- Whatever!
- Whatever!

1923
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:53,360
I can't believe he's saying that.

1924
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,270
- Gosh, this is...
- No one asked.

1925
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:56,980
It's weird to hear him say such things.

1926
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,670
- Whatever.
- It doesn't suit you at all.

1927
01:02:58,670 --> 01:02:59,840
It doesn't suit him.

1928
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,980
- They say that a lot.
- Whatever.

1929
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,320
Now that I'm older,

1930
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,340
I realized that's what everyone feels.

1931
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:08,420
- Whatever!
- "Whatever?"

1932
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:10,050
- You can't say that.
- Whatever.

1933
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:11,420
- Whatever. He's right.
- Whatever.

1934
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,690
- You can say that to everything.
- Whatever.

1935
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:14,480
- But...
- I don't care what you say.

1936
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,250
- You can say that to everything?
- Whatever.

1937
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,020
- Whatever.
- Whatever. Get your face away.

1938
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:19,860
- Whatever. Get your face away.
- That's not right, Suk Jin.

1939
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:21,090
- Why not?
- You have to use the right words.

1940
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:22,940
- Whatever, you punk.
- Hey.

1941
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,730
- That's not right.
- He told me...

1942
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:26,770
- So Min, that's not right.
- to get my face away.

1943
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:28,730
- Still. It's not right.
- You must filter what you say.

1944
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:30,940
- When you're in your 50's,
- What's wrong with you?

1945
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,250
you'll be flustered by it.

1946
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,300
Because you find it cute?

1947
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:34,500
Who came up with that?

1948
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,270
You don't know how it came to be, right?

1949
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,420
- Whatever...
- I do.

1950
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,690
It means, "Whatever, go watch TV."

1951
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,920
- That's what it means.
- You didn't know?

1952
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:44,110
- "Whatever, go watch TV."
- Whatever...

1953
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:45,150
They're telling you to go watch TV.

1954
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:46,960
It's like,
"Whatever, go watch Running Man."

1955
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,230
Oh, "Whatever, go watch Running Man?"

1956
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,500
- Yes.
- That's right.

1957
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,730
- You didn't know the meaning?
- You know what NANC is?

1958
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:54,020
- Of course.
- What does it mean?

1959
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,960
- What does it mean?
- "I don't want mul naengmyeon."

1960
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,040
("I don't want mul naengmyeon.")

1961
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:59,040
"Don't sit your butt down."

1962
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,070
You're right. You're pretty good.

1963
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:03,800
"I don't want mul naengmyeon,
but you'll be curious about it."

1964
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,300
You can make use of it.

1965
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,770
- NANC.
- Please...

1966
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:09,020
I hope someone uses this on another show.

1967
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,270
- NANC.
- Of course I know what it is.

1968
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:12,420
- "I don't want mul naengmyeon."
- "I don't want mul naengmyeon."

1969
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,650
- I can learn whatever you tell me.
- Of course.

1970
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:17,110
- I've been memorizing it.
- That's so cute.

1971
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:18,650
- By the way,
- It's what young kids use.

1972
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:20,650
- this thought occurred to me.
- What is it?

1973
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,320
I wish Eun Hye...

1974
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,500
was here with us.

1975
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,570
Why you...

1976
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:28,130
- Wouldn't it have been fun?
- That was so random.

1977
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,360
It'd have been fun.

1978
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,190
That's how thoughts occur.
You just throw your ideas.

1979
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:32,460
On our YouTube channel...

1980
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,460
- You just throw your ideas.
- Did you see it?

1981
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,570
Eun Hye Special lasted for almost an hour.

1982
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:37,770
- What do you mean?
- There's a collection of it.

1983
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:39,300
- There's a collection on it.
- A collection of it?

1984
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:41,380
- There's a special collection.
- And why would they do that?

1985
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,880
I didn't do it. They did!

1986
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,320
They made a collection of it.
Guys, you should check it out.

1987
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,880
- Stop it. Why would they?
- There's a collection of it.

1988
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,880
- By the way...
- Eun Hye, I'll call you!

1989
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,650
Have you ever met Eun Hye, though?

1990
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:53,860
Of course! We used to work together.

1991
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,420
- Really? I bet you didn't.
- On which show?

1992
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:57,050
It was a show called "Fort Boyard."

1993
01:04:57,050 --> 01:04:59,360
It's one that Nam Hee Suk
and Hyo Lee hosted.

1994
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,270
- "Fort Boyard?"
- Eun Hye was on it?

1995
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:03,500
- You were the host?
- You were the host of the show?

1996
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,670
He was the grandpa
who was stuck in the castle.

1997
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:07,110
- I see.
- No wonder.

1998
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:09,170
- Hey!
- You were an extra?

1999
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:15,480
(Suk Jin played a man living
in a steeple who gave quizzes.)

2000
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,670
Actually, Hee Suk and Hyo Lee
were the main hosts.

2001
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:18,790
- They were the main hosts.
- They were the two main hosts.

2002
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:21,150
- Right.
- I was a man who gave out quizzes.

2003
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:22,690
- A man who gave out quizzes.
- Like an extra?

2004
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:25,250
How can you say that? Come on.

2005
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:27,320
- Hey. He was Extra Ji.
- Hey!

2006
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,320
Extra Ji?

2007
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,230
- He was Extra Ji.
- Extra Ji?

2008
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:31,860
It was such an important role.

2009
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,860
Because they had to give you a role.

2010
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:36,270
I was so happy with that role then.

2011
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:37,360
- Back then.
- Right.

2012
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,570
We shot the show on an island.

2013
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:41,170
So I talked with Eun Hye...

2014
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,570
Okay, that's enough.

2015
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:44,480
What do you mean? It's only the beginning.

2016
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,210
- Whatever!
- Whatever!

2017
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:47,650
- You can stop it now.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2018
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:48,940
- Whatever!
- Whatever!

2019
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,150
Eun Hye said that she liked Jae Suk.

2020
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,750
When she said that, you said this.

2021
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,290
- What?
- "I like Yang Jung A."

2022
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,190
- Hey.
- Am I right?

2023
01:05:58,190 --> 01:05:59,420
- Hey.
- Aren't I right?

2024
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:02,020
Yang Jung A might be shocked
when she hears this.

2025
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:04,650
Jung A, I'm rooting for you!

2026
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:06,670
He's such an oldie.
He made a heart like this.

2027
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:09,270
- He made a heart like this.
<i>- I can't live without you</i>

2028
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:10,400
(Shyly confessing his feelings as a fan)

2029
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,300
Stop it. I'm always rooting for you.

2030
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,570
He made a heart like this.

2031
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,940
- She still looks the same.
- I'm your fan.

2032
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,670
- By the way,
- Yes?

2033
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,610
when can I switch my team?

2034
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:22,070
You can switch your team now.
Which team would you like to join?

2035
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:23,570
Why did you bring it up?

2036
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,480
- Then she can...
- She can switch.

2037
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,650
She should join the other team too.

2038
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,690
- Right.
- Right. That way, it'll be fun.

2039
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:30,190
Aren't you too lazy to get changed?

2040
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:32,130
- Switch your team.
- I pick Team Type A and Type AB.

2041
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:33,230
- Team Type A and Type AB?
- Yes.

2042
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:34,690
- I want to give it a try.
- Go ahead.

2043
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:35,900
- But her clothes...
- You didn't get a taste of Type B.

2044
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:37,050
You should try out the other team too.

2045
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:38,090
For your information,

2046
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:39,800
So Min will be playing
a very important role.

2047
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,460
- Okay.
- Really?

2048
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,770
She switched to Team Type A and Type AB.

2049
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:44,500
Are we playing a quiz?

2050
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:46,130
Could it be a quiz?

2051
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:48,380
- It must be a quiz.
- They won't let us...

2052
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,770
- play foot volleyball, will they?
- Then she can be a referee.

2053
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:52,650
We must be playing foot volleyball.

2054
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:53,990
- We are playing foot volleyball.
- We are?

2055
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:56,010
- We're playing foot volleyball.
- Nice!

2056
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:57,960
- Someone pooped here.
- It's mud.

2057
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,490
The ball won't bounce from here.

2058
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:03,730
- I'll tell you the rules now.
- Okay.

2059
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:05,030
The next mission...

2060
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:08,030
is called Longing to Score.

2061
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:10,740
You came up with a good name.

2062
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:12,960
You'll be playing foot volleyball.

2063
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:15,630
It's impossible for So Min to play...

2064
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:18,170
- because she injured her leg.
- That's right.

2065
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:19,940
Here's the role she'll play.

2066
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,480
She will play a referee.

2067
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:23,980
But...

2068
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:24,990
- Why do I get to play a referee?
- She'll be a referee.

2069
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:27,150
But it's not just an ordinary referee.

2070
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:29,590
When your team scores,

2071
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:30,710
(When your team scores)

2072
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:32,760
you can raise two points by lying.

2073
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,780
Come on.

2074
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,920
(She can raise 2 points by lying.)

2075
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,590
- However,
- You are the best.

2076
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:40,670
if the other team catches her lying,

2077
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,990
her team won't receive any points.

2078
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:44,260
They can catch her lying.

2079
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,610
If you make a mistake,
you will lose one point.

2080
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:46,610
Okay.

2081
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:47,900
We can catch her lying.

2082
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:50,210
- So Min lies often.
- You might fail to score a point.

2083
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:51,400
So they can catch her lying.

2084
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,480
Do it when things are uncertain.

2085
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,570
I won't raise the points
unless it's necessary.

2086
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:55,650
- Okay.
- I won't do it if you are winning.

2087
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:57,320
- Try not to do it.
- Try not to do it.

2088
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,780
- We planned to have a 4-on-4 match.
- Okay.

2089
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,280
So each team must recruit...

2090
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:06,550
one female staff member.

2091
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:07,590
- What?
- But...

2092
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:10,590
each team must recruit
one female staff member.

2093
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:11,730
- What?
- But...

2094
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,190
Seon Myung is really bad at it.

2095
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,570
All the female staff members...

2096
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:16,690
- are hopeless.
- Just don't give the ball to her.

2097
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:17,940
Pick a staff member each.

2098
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:18,960
Seon Myung, come here.

2099
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,130
- Seon Myung, come here.
- Let's recruit Ji Yeon.

2100
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,300
Seon Myung is hopeless.

2101
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,030
- Seon Myung is hopeless.
- Ji Yeon is better. Ji Yeon.

2102
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:24,780
- Join our team.
- Ji Yeon, have you done this?

2103
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,010
- Ji Yeon.
- Ji Yeon.

2104
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:27,880
- Seon Myung, come here.
- Look at Seon Myung.

2105
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,280
It's better to recruit someone
who has done this before.

2106
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,320
- Seon Myung, come here.
- Ji Yeon is better.

2107
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,490
- She is better than Seon Myung.
- I think she is pretty good.

2108
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:35,360
- Both are hopeless, but...
- Seon Myung, join our team.

2109
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:36,550
Seon Myung, you are better.

2110
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:38,150
- We will recruit Ji Yeon.
- Now,

2111
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:40,230
you will change into uniform
and play foot volleyball.

2112
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:41,960
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2113
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:43,150
Okay.

2114
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:44,400
Come over here.

2115
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:47,090
- My goodness.
- Weaklings.

2116
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:48,900
- Hey.
- Stand over there.

2117
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:50,340
I couldn't shorten the straps.

2118
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,170
- They are adjustable.
- I couldn't shorten them.

2119
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:53,300
Se Chan is good at it.

2120
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,530
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

2121
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,880
- I heard that you are good at it.
- He can't do it. He is on my team.

2122
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,070
He is on my team.

2123
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:59,740
Se Chan is really good at it.

2124
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,550
You are a junior comedienne.
Shorten my straps.

2125
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:02,650
"Comedienne?"

2126
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:03,820
What did you say?

2127
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:04,940
Forget it.

2128
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:07,190
- Here.
- How do you shorten them?

2129
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:09,050
I left them as they were
because they were too much work.

2130
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:10,610
Here.

2131
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:11,920
(Impressed)

2132
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,090
Hey.

2133
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,490
This is incredible.

2134
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:16,360
Are you stupid? I mean...

2135
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:17,800
It's easy.

2136
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,300
None of us could do it.

2137
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:22,840
Go ahead.

2138
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,510
Suk Jin, this strap is a bit short.

2139
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:27,940
This strap is a bit short.

2140
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,210
It got caught.

2141
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,480
Hey.

2142
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:33,170
- It got caught.
- You should help Suk Jin properly.

2143
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:35,570
- Pull it up like this.
- It's good enough.

2144
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:37,340
Stop.

2145
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:38,920
Stop. It's good enough.

2146
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,550
- Let's shorten them more.
- Hey.

2147
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,990
- Stop.
- So Min.

2148
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:45,530
All right. Let's begin.

2149
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:46,790
She came into power.

2150
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:50,050
- She came into power.
- You can scatter the mud...

2151
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:52,870
- on the opposing team's court.
- Okay.

2152
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:54,620
You can scatter it to hinder their moves.

2153
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:55,740
- Yes.
- Okay.

2154
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,740
The mud will be effective
at the right spots.

2155
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,500
- Here.
- We need to cheat.

2156
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,460
Put some mud in the middle.
This spot is dry.

2157
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:03,940
- There you go. That's good.
- That's good.

2158
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:05,840
Let's put all of it in one spot.

2159
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:08,080
Nice.

2160
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:09,210
- All right.
- More.

2161
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:10,480
Spread it out.

2162
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:13,010
- It's neat.
- Se Chan.

2163
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:14,540
- Yes?
- Why don't you poop here?

2164
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:18,010
What are you talking about?

2165
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:19,160
I was just joking.

2166
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,750
- For goodness' sake.
- We wouldn't do it for real.

2167
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,420
- I am serious.
- Stop pooping with your mouth.

2168
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:24,660
Just give me three minutes. I can do it.

2169
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:26,500
Don't be so stinky.

2170
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:28,400
You can't poop on the court.

2171
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,660
- I was just joking.
- Just give me three minutes.

2172
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,130
Go to your position.

2173
01:10:32,130 --> 01:10:33,440
Let's begin.

2174
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:35,200
Okay.

2175
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:37,410
You will play a single round
for 15 points.

2176
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:38,800
Okay. Give me the ball.

2177
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,840
Let's begin. Let's attack.

2178
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:43,780
Let's begin.

2179
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,580
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2180
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,510
Send the ball toward Seon Myung.

2181
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:50,050
Seon Myung and Suk Jin
are the weak members.

2182
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:52,050
- I need to cover for Seon Myung.
- Send it to Seon Myung.

2183
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:53,230
All right. Let's begin.

2184
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:57,160
(The game starts.)

2185
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,200
- I need to cover for Seon Myung.
- Send it to Seon Myung.

2186
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,790
- Do your best.
- Seon Myung.

2187
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:02,130
- Okay.
- Seon Myung.

2188
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,240
That's it.

2189
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:05,740
(She shows
her 1st slapstick comedy of 2022.)

2190
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:06,870
Good job.

2191
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:08,630
Good job, Seon Myung.

2192
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,280
That was funny.

2193
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:11,980
- That was sweet.
- Go ahead.

2194
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,370
That was as sweet as honey.

2195
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:14,910
- Give them a point.
- Seon Myung.

2196
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:16,150
Give them a point.

2197
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,510
- Go. Let's begin.
- Go.

2198
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:19,910
Seon Myung.

2199
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:21,320
- Okay.
- It's for Seon Myung.

2200
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,380
Score a point.

2201
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:23,790
- Mine.
- Kick it right away.

2202
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:26,050
- Okay.
- Why did you send it so high?

2203
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:27,490
I don't want to touch the ball
with my face.

2204
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:28,900
- Send it over the net.
- Get ready.

2205
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,900
- No, Suk Jin. Leave it be.
- Suk Jin.

2206
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,900
(He hits a home run.)

2207
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:36,500
I am sorry.

2208
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:39,260
I am sorry. I thought I could do it.

2209
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:41,070
About six people went,

2210
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,740
- "Gosh."
- I am sorry.

2211
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:44,700
- It won't matter if we win.
- I am sorry.

2212
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,110
If they score a point,
So Min will give them two points.

2213
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:47,450
- It's 2 to 0, right?
- Yes.

2214
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:48,910
- It's out.
- Out.

2215
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,210
- It's out.
- It's out.

2216
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,410
- Raise the number.
- It's out.

2217
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:53,580
So Min, we scored.

2218
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:55,490
- Good job, So Min.
- Okay.

2219
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:56,510
Good job.

2220
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:58,580
(So Min can secretly raise
2 points as a referee.)

2221
01:11:58,690 --> 01:11:59,990
Jae Suk, wait.

2222
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:02,900
- Will you object?
- We need to be careful.

2223
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,160
- She won't do it from the start.
- Object if you want to.

2224
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,400
(What will be Team Type B's choice?)

2225
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,660
- We object.
- What?

2226
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,090
- All right.
- Did she do it from the start?

2227
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:10,630
- Referee Jeon...
- She would do it from the start.

2228
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,570
I told So Min not to do it
if she can help it.

2229
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:13,740
Referee Jeon...

2230
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
changed the number honestly.
So this team will lose a point.

2231
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
(Referee Jeon only raised 1 point!)

2232
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:20,700
(Team Type B loses 1 point.)

2233
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,510
- They don't know me.
- Good job, So Min.

2234
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:24,040
They don't know me.

2235
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:26,380
- Why did you object?
- You should have asked us.

2236
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:29,010
- Ji Yeon, make sure you watch her.
- Good job.

2237
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,660
He suddenly nags at Ji Yeon,

2238
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,050
- "Make sure you watch her."
- Let's begin.

2239
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:34,050
All right.

2240
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:36,120
Hold on.

2241
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,400
- You need to kick hard.
- Are your feet okay?

2242
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:38,830
- Good.
- It's mine.

2243
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,370
- Okay.
- Get it over the net.

2244
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:42,540
- Get it over the net.
- Come on.

2245
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:44,440
- Good.
- I will kick it.

2246
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,570
I will get it over the net.

2247
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:47,040
Get it over the net.

2248
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:49,110
- Okay.
- There you go.

2249
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,330
(A dead ball shot)

2250
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:53,540
- That's how you do it.
- Okay.

2251
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,670
- Good job.
- Raise the score.

2252
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:57,120
- So Min, there is no need.
- Did you raise the score?

2253
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:59,250
- Raise the score.
- The score.

2254
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,540
Seon Myung, you stood there well.

2255
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,620
- Shall we object?
- No.

2256
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,080
- Will you object?
- No.

2257
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,190
- Let's give it a pass.
- Let's do that.

2258
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:07,620
All right.

2259
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:10,030
This time, Referee Jeon raised two points.

2260
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:11,330
(Team Type B: 1 point,
Team Type A and Type AB: 3 points)

2261
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:13,420
(She succeeded in coning them.)

2262
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,960
All right.

2263
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:16,830
- So Min.
- Good job, So Min.

2264
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:17,870
That was terrific.

2265
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,260
So Min, nice timing.

2266
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:20,830
(Referee Jeon's poker face
is pretty good.)

2267
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:22,410
We have an advantage.

2268
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:24,080
(Haha serves.)

2269
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,300
- A sky-high serve.
- Okay.

2270
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:27,200
Okay.

2271
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,670
(A mud shot)

2272
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,250
You hit the spot perfectly.

2273
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,290
It's a mud festival.

2274
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:34,450
How did it land on the spot?

2275
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:36,410
- I didn't think of that.
- It was the perfect shot.

2276
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:38,190
There is no way around it.

2277
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,330
Let's not lose a single point from now on.

2278
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:42,250
- Seon Myung, go.
- Don't touch the ball.

2279
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:43,250
- Leave it be.
- Leave it be.

2280
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:45,460
- Seon Myung.
- Kick it.

2281
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:46,530
- Okay.
- Seon Myung.

2282
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:48,630
- Seon Myung.
- Kick it.

2283
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:49,630
- Okay.
- Seon Myung.

2284
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:51,160
(Backheading)

2285
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:53,700
(She attacked her own team with her head.)

2286
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:54,830
You did well.

2287
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:57,940
- Why won't you let her play?
- You did well.

2288
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:00,500
- Seon Myung is so funny.
- Why won't you let her play?

2289
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,700
Good job, Seon Myung.

2290
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,080
Ji Yeon, you should serve.

2291
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:04,870
- It's okay.
- Give it a try.

2292
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:06,010
- It's okay.
- Ji Yeon, serve.

2293
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:08,750
Are you lowering yourself
to Seon Myung's level?

2294
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,380
Ji Yeon, serve.

2295
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:12,030
- Stand behind the line.
- Ji Yeon, serve.

2296
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,530
(Her foot volleyball skills are
still a mystery.)

2297
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,730
I am sure Ji Yeon is better.

2298
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:18,760
What?

2299
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:22,160
(A fiery shot)

2300
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,700
What was that?

2301
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:28,700
(Shaolin foot volleyball)

2302
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:30,410
- What was that?
- That was incredible.

2303
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:31,740
- Hold on.
- That was incredible.

2304
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,480
- How did you do that?
- How did you do that?

2305
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:34,870
- I don't know.
- How did you do that?

2306
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:36,840
- Hey.
- Hey.

2307
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,370
- How did you do that?
- What was that?

2308
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:39,840
- What was that?
- How many times did she touch it?

2309
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,450
There were two touches.

2310
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:42,790
- Was it a fiery shot?
- Did I succeed?

2311
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:44,050
- That was awesome.
- Really?

2312
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:46,080
- Ji Yeon, do it again.
- Do it again.

2313
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,290
- How did you do that?
- Teach us.

2314
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:49,700
- You are so cool.
- Move to the back.

2315
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:51,050
How did you do that?

2316
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:52,120
- Hold on.
- You can kick gently.

2317
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,420
You shouldn't go over the line.

2318
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:56,460
It's in.

2319
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,910
(A no-spin drop shot)

2320
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:02,870
- That was cool.
- For real. How did you do that?

2321
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:04,300
How did you do that?

2322
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:07,800
(She plays the Shaolin foot volleyball.)

2323
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,370
For real. How did you do that?

2324
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:10,540
How did you do that?

2325
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,580
- This is unfair.
- Do it again.

2326
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,320
- What was that?
- What was that?

2327
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:16,580
- Is she a secret weapon?
- Hey.

2328
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:19,330
- Ji Yeon is good.
- It's okay. Try it again.

2329
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:20,550
- Let's go.
- Try it again.

2330
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:21,900
- Send it that way.
- Let's receive the ball.

2331
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,200
Hold on.

2332
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,530
- Send it that way.
- Let's receive the ball.

2333
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:27,500
(She suddenly showed a knee kick.)

2334
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,500
- Out.
- Okay. Give us the ball.

2335
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:30,630
- Ji Yeon.
- You did well.

2336
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:32,240
Raise the score.

2337
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,130
- Let's go. What's the score?
- Will you object?

2338
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:36,110
- Okay. Let's go.
- Hold on. Will you object?

2339
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:38,650
- This time...
- Catch her.

2340
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:39,750
- Let's catch her.
- Let's catch her.

2341
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:42,320
I don't think she did it this time.

2342
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,650
We need to catch her.

2343
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:45,690
- Catch her!
- We object.

2344
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:46,840
Catch her!

2345
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,190
We object.

2346
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:49,490
She got caught.

2347
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:50,750
Okay.

2348
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,830
(Referee Jeon got caught
raising 2 points!)

2349
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:54,030
- Zero points.
- Zero points.

2350
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:55,730
Team Type A and Type AB
won't receive any points.

2351
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:57,000
So it's...

2352
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
We should object every single time.

2353
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,290
It only costs us one point.

2354
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:02,130
- Let's go.
- Ji Yeon did so well.

2355
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,290
- She did a superb job.
- It's okay.

2356
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:05,870
- Ji Yeon.
- We can't head the ball.

2357
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:07,160
- Here we go.
- You can do it.

2358
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,330
- I will receive it.
- Ji Yeon, receive the ball.

2359
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:10,500
- Mine.
- Ji Yeon, it's yours.

2360
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:12,840
- Let Ji Yeon receive it.
- Let Ji Yeon receive it.

2361
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:15,150
- Ji Yeon.
- Ji Yeon, it's yours.

2362
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:16,410
- Ji Yeon.
- There you go.

2363
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:17,410
- Receive it.
- Seon Myung.

2364
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:18,450
- Seon Myung.
- Seon Myung.

2365
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:21,040
- Receive it.
- Seon Myung.

2366
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,580
(You can go.)

2367
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,990
- Gosh.
- We got this. Good job.

2368
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:26,690
- Good job.
- Good job, Seon Myung.

2369
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:27,990
Good job. You did well.

2370
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:29,090
- It won't matter if we win.
- Suk Jin,

2371
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:31,450
pick up the ball.
Why are you making her do it alone?

2372
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,500
- Why is no one picking up the ball?
- Seriously.

2373
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,870
She is the one who missed it.

2374
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:37,440
Seon Myung, why did you go?

2375
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:38,610
She is the one who missed it.

2376
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,660
- You need to do better.
- Here I go, Ji Hyo.

2377
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,280
Come on.

2378
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,780
- That's good. Suk Jin.
- Jong Kook.

2379
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:46,610
- Go.
- Give it to Ji Yeon.

2380
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,150
Let Ji Yeon kick the ball.

2381
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,510
(A heel kick)

2382
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:54,540
- Come on. Kick it.
- Head it.

2383
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:56,080
Okay.

2384
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:57,860
- Come on. Kick it.
- Head it.

2385
01:16:58,010 --> 01:16:59,580
(She twitched on the spot.)

2386
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,330
What are the two of you doing?

2387
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:03,450
They fell in love when their eyes met.

2388
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,230
Did time suddenly stop?

2389
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:06,660
Did you fall in love suddenly?

2390
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:08,700
Time must have stopped.

2391
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,440
<i>- You raise me</i>
- Did your heart beat fast?

2392
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,160
Seon Myung, stop going after the ball.

2393
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:14,440
Suk Jin, you should go.

2394
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,130
Why aren't you moving?

2395
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:19,540
- Go.
- Here I go, Jong Kook.

2396
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:21,480
- Okay. That's good.
- I got it.

2397
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,750
- That's good.
- Seon Myung, kick it.

2398
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:24,250
- I got it.
- Seon Myung, kick it.

2399
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:25,280
- Let's score a point.
- There you go.

2400
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,690
- Get it over the net.
- Let Ji Yeon kick it.

2401
01:17:26,690 --> 01:17:27,710
- Okay.
- Ji Yeon, it will be hard.

2402
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:28,860
- Move out of the way.
- Do well.

2403
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:29,910
Ji Yeon.

2404
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,380
Ji Yeon.

2405
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:34,050
(She hit the mark.)

2406
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:37,090
(Nice slapstick comedy)

2407
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:38,360
Se Chan, that was great.

2408
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,400
(Se Chan got into an accident.)

2409
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,830
- Se Chan.
- It's okay.

2410
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:42,500
I can't believe
you received the ball with that.

2411
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,660
That startled me.

2412
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:46,700
I couldn't receive the ball.
I should have done it confidently.

2413
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,330
Will you catch her or not?

2414
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:49,830
- Jae Suk, let's catch her.
- What?

2415
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,110
I haven't changed the score yet.

2416
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:52,500
You haven't changed the score yet?

2417
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:53,950
Did she change the score?

2418
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:55,650
- I bet she has a headache.
- You raised two points, right?

2419
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:58,540
Jae Suk, let's catch her.
Look at her eyes.

2420
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,250
All right.

2421
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:03,880
- Maybe not.
- Please decide.

2422
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,190
- Maybe not.
- One, two, three.

2423
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:06,290
- We won't catch her.
- We won't catch her.

2424
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:07,660
(They decide not to catch her.)

2425
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:09,400
- Correct.
- I knew it.

2426
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,420
(Referee Jeon had only raised 1 point.)

2427
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,530
- She probably didn't have a choice.
- That's right.

2428
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:14,790
Shall we begin?

2429
01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:17,700
You need to do better.

2430
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:18,830
- Move out of the way.
- Ji Yeon.

2431
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:19,910
- All right.
- Move out of the way.

2432
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:21,000
It's okay. We saved the ball.

2433
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,110
One more time?

2434
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:25,280
- There you go.
- Seon Myung.

2435
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,700
- Seon Myung.
- Get it over the net.

2436
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,080
(My goodness.)

2437
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:30,820
Get it over the net.

2438
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:32,840
He is really bad.

2439
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:34,950
- Did you do that on purpose?
- No.

2440
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:36,490
- Are you a spy?
- I really didn't.

2441
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:38,750
This is driving me crazy. We might lose.

2442
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:39,920
- My goodness.
- It's okay. You did well.

2443
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:40,990
What are you doing?

2444
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:42,120
Ji Hyo is bad at foot volleyball.

2445
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,500
- Okay. You will kick it, right?
- Will you kick it?

2446
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,590
- Okay. I got it.
- Send it over the net.

2447
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:48,120
- Okay.
- Why did you send it so high?

2448
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:53,960
Will you kick it?

2449
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,040
(The rally keeps going.)

2450
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,630
Mine.

2451
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,110
Okay.

2452
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:02,370
- All right.
- Okay.

2453
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,450
(Se Chan makes a mistake.)

2454
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,340
- All right.
- The court is too slippery.

2455
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:07,340
Good job.

2456
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:09,990
- What will it be?
- One, two, three.

2457
01:19:10,490 --> 01:19:11,790
Let's catch her.

2458
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:13,190
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2459
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:14,250
- Let's catch her.
- Let's catch her.

2460
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,290
(They decide to catch her!)

2461
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:16,330
(Team Type B: 12 points)

2462
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:19,290
- She got caught.
- Why does this keep happening?

2463
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,030
(Team Type A and Type AB
fails to score a point.)

2464
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:22,700
- I mean...
- I told you not to do it.

2465
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:25,200
- They keep catching me.
- You don't need to do it.

2466
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,000
- So Min has that face.
- We caught her.

2467
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:31,170
- You keep twitching your lips.
- It was a hard-earned point.

2468
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:32,250
Why do you keep twitching your lips?

2469
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:33,370
Okay. Let's resume. It's okay.

2470
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:36,010
- How did they know?
- Hey, just turn around.

2471
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:38,480
Let's begin.

2472
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:39,950
(Jong Kook serves.)

2473
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:41,210
- Go.
- Nice.

2474
01:19:42,490 --> 01:19:43,750
That's good. Ji Yeon.

2475
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:44,860
No.

2476
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,550
All right.

2477
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:48,790
All right.

2478
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:50,230
(Oh.)

2479
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:54,200
- Why did you run toward the ball?
- She is cute.

2480
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,000
- You should have done this.
- She is cute.

2481
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,540
- The ball was coming nicely.
- Okay.

2482
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:58,910
Why did you block it?

2483
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:00,910
(Team Type A and Type AB
is a complete mess.)

2484
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:02,610
- The last point.
- Matchpoint.

2485
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:04,130
Ji Hyo, here I go.

2486
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,610
Come on.

2487
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:07,700
Nice serve. Suk Jin.

2488
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:08,750
Jong Kook.

2489
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:10,410
Okay. Send it up in the air.

2490
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:13,010
- Good.
- All right. Two touches.

2491
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,150
- This is hard.
- Ji Yeon, get it.

2492
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:17,250
- Ji Yeon.
- Move out of the way.

2493
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:18,550
- Okay.
- Good.

2494
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:20,250
Ji Yeon, can we play
a slow-motion video...

2495
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,620
- of your face?
- Ji Yeon.

2496
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:23,360
Ji Yeon, you did this.

2497
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:25,230
Seriously.

2498
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,700
It will be funny with the right music.

2499
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,630
Will you catch her or not?

2500
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:32,440
They couldn't receive the short shot.

2501
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:35,200
Did you raise the score?

2502
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,980
- Yes.
- She raised the score.

2503
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,080
(Referee Jeon changed the score
after much deliberation.)

2504
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,170
- What?
- Catch her.

2505
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:41,110
- Let's catch her.
- One, two, three.

2506
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:42,620
- One, two, three.
- Let's not catch her.

2507
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:43,870
- One, two, three.
- We won't catch her.

2508
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:45,280
Correct.

2509
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,250
(They are correct again.)

2510
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:49,410
So Min has that facial expression.

2511
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:50,910
- Why are you so easy to read?
- We...

2512
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:53,230
Even I can read her.

2513
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:55,750
If she has raised the score correctly,
she looks at them.

2514
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,550
If she did it incorrectly,
she looks at us.

2515
01:20:57,550 --> 01:20:58,790
She can't look at them.

2516
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:00,500
(When she raised the score correctly)

2517
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,870
(Confident)

2518
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:04,700
(When she conned them)

2519
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,300
(Avoided eye contact)

2520
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,660
How do they know? It's so fascinating.

2521
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,500
I told you not to be greedy.

2522
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,110
For goodness' sake.
This is driving me crazy.

2523
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:14,150
It's okay.

2524
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:15,200
Good luck.

2525
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:16,840
- Matchpoint.
- I will serve.

2526
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:18,080
- Serve well.
- Let's have a rally.

2527
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,820
(The game will end if Team Type B scores.)

2528
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:20,880
Good.

2529
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,320
Let's go.

2530
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:24,750
- Okay. I got it.
- Suk Jin.

2531
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:25,950
- Mind your manners.
- Head it.

2532
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:29,860
- I told you to head the ball.
- Nice.

2533
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:32,120
- Okay. I will save it.
- Nice.

2534
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:34,000
- Okay. I will save it.
- Okay.

2535
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,090
- You saved it.
- Head it.

2536
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,660
- What are you doing?
- Kick it.

2537
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,570
(A grand finale)

2538
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:41,960
Hey.

2539
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,130
Suk Jin.

2540
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:45,200
(Captain Ji laughs
even though it was his mistake.)

2541
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:48,250
- It wasn't you. It was him.
- Seon Myung.

2542
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:50,710
I know that it was me.
Your fighting spirit made me laugh.

2543
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,840
- It was a spike.
- We just needed to get it over.

2544
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,190
- Game over.
- I knew they would lose.

2545
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:58,360
- Ji Yeon, good job.
- Team Type B won.

2546
01:21:58,360 --> 01:21:59,690
- Okay.
- Okay.

2547
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:00,790
That hurts my pride.

2548
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:02,550
- You did well, Seon Myung.
- You did well.

2549
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:04,620
Team Type B will get
three penalty balls...

2550
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:06,700
and Team Type A and Type AB
will get ten penalty balls.

2551
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:08,420
Seon Myung and Ji Yeon were funny.

2552
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:10,500
- You did well.
- They are good.

2553
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,040
It was nice to have So Min as the referee.

2554
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,000
- She did well.
- So Min, it was funny.

2555
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:16,800
So Min finally found something
she is good at.

2556
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,040
- It was twice as interesting.
- I really want to play the game.

2557
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,370
- I really want to play the game.
- You need to think about your leg.

2558
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:26,150
For the last game,
both teams need to use their teamwork.

2559
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:27,710
It's the Chalk Is a Must.

2560
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:29,160
- What is it?
- Chalk?

2561
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,190
It's a race that is a mix...

2562
01:22:30,190 --> 01:22:32,580
of the Name Tag Elimination
and Save the Chalk.

2563
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:33,660
Okay.

2564
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:36,620
Among the chalk pieces you have saved,

2565
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:38,000
you will combine the length
of the longest five.

2566
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,230
The team with the longer length will win.

2567
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:40,400
- Five?
- Yes.

2568
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,570
We have more members.

2569
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,290
(Now,)

2570
01:22:44,290 --> 01:22:47,630
(we have sad news for the viewers.)

2571
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:51,300
(To enjoy the proper
Name Tag Elimination,)

2572
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:57,510
(we rented a spacious and dynamic place.)

2573
01:22:57,910 --> 01:23:02,880
(But the race ended in 11 minutes.)

2574
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:08,250
(1. The members were distracted
when they hid the chalk pieces.)

2575
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,620
I can't believe it.

2576
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:10,700
What?

2577
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:11,830
It's blocked.

2578
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:14,090
(They were hopeless
from the hiding stage.)

2579
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:16,200
This is bad. It's blocked.
I am sorry, but...

2580
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:18,090
Okay. I will hide it here.

2581
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,410
There is no time.

2582
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:21,570
(2. They were one-dimensional
in selecting the hiding places.)

2583
01:23:21,570 --> 01:23:23,410
- What?
- What is it?

2584
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:24,780
(The chalk got found in 2 minutes.)

2585
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:26,410
- It's here.
- Where?

2586
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,150
Let's see it.

2587
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:29,210
(They destroyed it right away.)

2588
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:31,280
Maybe it's Suk Jin's.

2589
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,150
(He found another one.)

2590
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:34,290
Where is it?

2591
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:36,690
(Suk Jin didn't exceed expectations.)

2592
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:37,910
Suk Jin is out.

2593
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,950
Suk Jin doesn't travel far.

2594
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:41,790
Gosh.

2595
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:45,760
(3. 4 minutes into the race,)

2596
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,030
Reflection Skill.

2597
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:48,900
(Jong Kook got eliminated
due to the Reflection Skill.)

2598
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,240
(Reflection Skill)

2599
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,960
Jong Kook is out.

2600
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,440
(The ace member went to the jail
in less than 5 minutes.)

2601
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:54,960
- Out.
- How did this happen?

2602
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,080
- I need to get it wrong, right?
- Suk Jin is out.

2603
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:58,610
I will give you the question.

2604
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:02,040
Who is the man behind the saying,
"The die is cast?"

2605
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:05,150
Number 1, Julius Caesar.
Number 2, Abraham Lincoln.

2606
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:07,150
- I need to get it wrong.
- You need to get it wrong.

2607
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:09,190
I think the answer is number two.

2608
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:10,510
- Number one.
- No.

2609
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:11,860
It's correct.

2610
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,290
- It's correct.
- Hey.

2611
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:15,250
- It's correct.
- So Min.

2612
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,860
- It's correct.
- You got it right.

2613
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:19,070
You lost 30cm.

2614
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:20,870
- It's correct.
- Is it correct?

2615
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:23,790
- Why is it correct?
- She keeps getting it right.

2616
01:24:23,790 --> 01:24:25,370
- You should go to Seoul University.
- Is it correct?

2617
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,300
Take off their name tags.
Jong Kook is out.

2618
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,440
Jong Kook is out.
Take off their name tags.

2619
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,650
- Come here.
- Jae Suk.

2620
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:34,150
- Come here.
- Take Jae Suk out.

2621
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:36,280
- We are men.
- We are Type B.

2622
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,840
- We are Type B men.
- What happened?

2623
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:41,380
- Team Type B won.
- Yes!

2624
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,190
(Team Type B won.)

2625
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:45,010
Okay.

2626
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:47,950
It will be funny
if they receive the penalty.

2627
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:51,500
Team Type B
versus Team Type A and Type AB.

2628
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:54,530
The number of Team Type B's
penalty balls...

2629
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,000
- is 16.
- I did my best.

2630
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,440
For Team Type A and Type AB,
the number is 23.

2631
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,700
- It's okay.
- The difference isn't great.

2632
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:02,830
The difference isn't great.

2633
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:05,540
- Seven.
- That's right. We can still win.

2634
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:07,000
This is the real deal.

2635
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,340
It will be satisfying
to win in this state.

2636
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:11,620
I will first tell you what the penalty is.

2637
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:12,690
What is it?

2638
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:14,190
The penalty of the day is...

2639
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,380
the water bucket.

2640
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:17,820
- It's cold today.
- It's a big one.

2641
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:19,050
The water bucket.

2642
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:21,330
(They prepared a water bucket
on a cold day.)

2643
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:22,790
- It's a big one.
- It really is.

2644
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:26,500
Producer Lee Myung Jae will draw a ball.

2645
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,000
- This is...
- My goodness.

2646
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,370
This is scary.

2647
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:32,400
- Let's huddle close.
- Put the penalty balls inside.

2648
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,500
The team loses
if its penalty ball gets picked.

2649
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,170
Then a bucket of water
will be poured on them right away.

2650
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:38,280
Okay.

2651
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,250
I have a bad feeling about this.

2652
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:41,300
- No.
- I am mistaken, right?

2653
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:43,370
- Don't say that.
- Please don't let it be us.

2654
01:25:43,650 --> 01:25:45,370
So you get the water
if your penalty ball comes out.

2655
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,340
- That's right.
- That team loses.

2656
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:48,450
- That team loses.
- Yes.

2657
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:50,290
We should take off the audio equipment.

2658
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:53,050
Now comes the final result of the race.

2659
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:55,120
- Okay.
- Mix up the balls more.

2660
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,250
- Stop looking.
- Okay.

2661
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:58,160
- Stop looking.
- Se Chan, stop looking.

2662
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,620
- Shall I stop looking?
- All right.

2663
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:03,040
In terms of probability,
Team Type B has an advantage.

2664
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,240
(In terms of probability,
Team Type B has an advantage.)

2665
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,500
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2666
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:08,570
Which team will it be? Please pick a ball.

2667
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,740
Are you going to tell us the result
before pouring the water?

2668
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,500
- Team Type B has an advantage.
- Please.

2669
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,040
The water will be poured
right after the announcement.

2670
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,080
Please announce the result.

2671
01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:25,110
(Team Type B: 16 balls
Team Type A and Type AB: 23 balls)

2672
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:26,700
(Which team will get the penalty?)

2673
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:28,370
- It's Team Type B.
- Team Type B loses.

2674
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:29,400
(Team Type B loses.)

2675
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,000
- It's Team Type B.
- Team Type B loses.

2676
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,240
(Pouring water)

2677
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,650
Team Type B loses.

2678
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:36,940
(Presenting a bucket of icy cold water)

2679
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:39,440
Oh, cold.

2680
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,910
Okay! We won.

2681
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:43,750
- We won.
- See?

2682
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:45,750
I told you.

2683
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:47,360
(Team Type A and Type AB won in the end.)

2684
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:49,820
- So cold.
- So cold.

2685
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:51,930
- I told you I had a bad feeling.
- So cold.

2686
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:53,690
I told you I had a bad feeling about it.

2687
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:55,330
- So cold.
- Good work.

2688
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:56,600
Because I never fail.

2689
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,940
- We won!
- Yes. We can do it.

2690
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:00,640
Okay.

2691
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:07,440
(Ten men and women are wandering
to find their love.)

2692
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,320
(Park Ah In, Kim Hee Jung,
Roh Jeong Eui, Yoo Jenny)

2693
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,350
- Go.
- Ah In.

2694
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:12,820
(Love is about seducing.)

2695
01:27:12,910 --> 01:27:13,910
I love only one girl.

2696
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:14,910
I love you.

2697
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:16,650
(Love is about getting swayed.)

2698
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:18,580
He reminds me of the boy
I had a crush on in university.

2699
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:19,580
(Love is about winning.)

2700
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:20,650
They're all very pretty.

2701
01:27:20,650 --> 01:27:24,360
(War of love is sometimes sweet...)

2702
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:27,570
(and sometimes brutal.)

2703
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:30,290
(What's the 1st need
of Maslow's hierarchy of needs?)

2704
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:31,330
(Something phenomenon?)

2705
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:32,530
(It starts with S?)

2706
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:34,940
(However)

2707
01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:36,330
You have been...

2708
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:38,280
(There are people interrupting
their love.)

2709
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:41,150
(Not Spring, Candy or Penalty)
