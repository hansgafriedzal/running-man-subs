1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,380
(March 14, White Day)

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,800
(The shoot began
on the warm White Day.)

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,080
Hello.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,720
- Please slate once.
- Okay.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,290
So Min is injured, so I'll do it.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,020
Instead of So Min. One, two, three.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,480
So Min...

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,750
So Min put the cast back on.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,290
She got it off too soon.

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,700
- And she was being too frivolous.
- Right.

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,200
- On her little toe,
- I knew this would happen.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,000
- a small crack was found.
- Really?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,470
It opened up again.

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,800
It was my first time
breaking a bone.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,610
You should stop when you feel pain.

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,310
You were right about that
I shouldn't go into rehab...

17
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,610
- when it hurts.
- Exactly.

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,210
- You should stop.
- Right.

19
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,780
So Min can't wait...

20
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,180
to run around again.
She's frustrated...

21
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,180
- because she can't.
- You should get some rest.

22
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,180
- She wants to dance.
- I really want to dance.

23
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,080
Dance with only one leg.

24
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,250
- I really want to dance.
- Stop it.

25
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,360
- What do I do?
- That's enough.

26
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,890
(Playful)

27
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,820
- Dance with your upper body.
- A situation like this...

28
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,620
- I want to dance.
- Dance with your upper body.

29
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,040
You shouldn't be like this.

30
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,240
- You want to do things like this.
- I really want to do it.

31
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,330
This is driving me crazy.

32
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,470
- Stop it.
- Don't do that.

33
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,140
- Hey.
- Hey.

34
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,310
You might hurt your leg again.

35
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,430
Enough. Stop it.

36
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,170
- So Min.
- Just leave her be.

37
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,450
You're not young enough
to heal right away.

38
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,480
She's an aunt.

39
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,980
- Right.
- An aunt talking about blood types.

40
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,840
Aunt So Min, stop it.

41
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,510
By the way, Ji Hyo has been...

42
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,280
- posting a lot of photos.
- They are really cool.

43
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,420
- Who took them?
- Who took those photos?

44
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,230
- You care about your social media.
- What's with you?

45
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,450
- I'm curious.
- What's gotten into you?

46
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,450
Recently, people say...

47
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,420
- That looks really cool.
- that I look like an old lady.

48
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,820
- What are you talking about?
- That's not true.

49
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,000
- No way.
- So I wanted to try a new style.

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,430
- I see.
- So I'm trying.

51
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,640
Did someone tell you how to pose?

52
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,730
Yes.

53
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,030
- Really?
- They nagged me a lot.

54
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,370
- That's nice.
- They came up with some ideas?

55
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,010
- Did they tell you what to do?
- Who did that?

56
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,780
- It looks so natural.
- So did you...

57
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,810
- hire someone?
- No.

58
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,920
It's just that my staff
told me what to do.

59
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,390
- They taught me how to pose.
- I see.

60
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,040
I can see that.

61
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,560
- They are pretty.
- She looks different now.

62
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,590
- They are going viral.
- I'm working hard.

63
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,560
So they are not
from your daily life.

64
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,680
She's trying new things.

65
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,120
But you shouldn't be too contrived
on your social media.

66
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,000
It should show your life as it is.

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,820
- You can't make things up.
- You think it's artificial.

68
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,930
That's what people do
on social media these days.

69
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,000
- Is that what they do?
- That's what young people do.

70
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,240
You always take photos
in a shirt with wide armholes.

71
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,900
- Showing his nipples.
- Nipples...

72
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,680
- Photos of his nipples.
- I'm just the same.

73
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,470
- You take photos of your nipples.
- Photos of his nipples.

74
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,550
What are you talking about?

75
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,990
It's not like I show
my nipples on purpose.

76
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,310
But I can see your nipples.

77
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,680
- My nipples...
- It can happen.

78
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,910
It's not like...

79
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,220
When people take photos of me...

80
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,090
- This is what you do.
- They just come out.

81
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,680
Why would I do this?

82
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,150
A nipple shot.

83
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,000
- He's strange.
- Don't you do this a lot?

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,400
- I don't.
- You don't?

85
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,900
- That's not what I do.
- It's not?

86
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,930
Of course.

87
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,770
- Gosh.
- A nipple shot?

88
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,900
A nipple shot?

89
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,060
- That's funny.
- He likes it.

90
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,560
- It's hilarious.
- Suk Jin likes it.

91
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,400
It sounds funny. A nipple shot.

92
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,900
- A nipple shot sounds funny.
- My social media isn't R-rated.

93
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,280
That's nice.

94
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,150
Today, to celebrate spring,

95
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,020
we have invited some actresses...

96
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,280
- who wanted to join our show.
- Oh, dear.

97
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,180
Jae Suk, introduce them one by one.

98
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,430
Before I introduce today's guests...

99
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,490
Last week, BTOB was
supposed to be here.

100
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,560
- Right.
- I know.

101
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,060
They couldn't join us
because of COVID-19.

102
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,120
- It happens a lot these days.
- I know.

103
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,270
I heard something today.

104
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,000
One of our guests for today
tested positive, right?

105
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,300
- Yes.
- Right.

106
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,100
That's what he was going to say.
Why did you bring it up?

107
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,600
Am I not supposed to say that?

108
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,370
Jong Kook, he's the captain.

109
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,240
- Hey, I'm the captain.
- I mean...

110
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,650
I have to attend a meeting
after the shoot today.

111
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,440
- You will go home after this.
- Right.

112
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,340
- But I have to go to Mok-dong.
- I see. It's close.

113
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,280
Jong Kook is Captain Nipple.

114
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,150
Oh, right. You are the captain too.

115
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,960
- Captain Nipple.
- He's Captain Nipple.

116
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,150
I see.

117
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,530
(Imitating Captain Nipple)

118
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,750
- That's just Na Hoon A.
- Really?

119
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,120
That's Na Hoon A.

120
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,650
You take a lot of nipple shots.

121
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,400
(Today's guests who will be
with the two reliable captains)

122
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,560
That's funny.

123
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,870
All right. Let's bring
in the guests for today.

124
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,210
Let me introduce our first guest.

125
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,180
We have Park Ah In.

126
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,280
(The first guest Park Ah In)

127
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,440
(Actress Park Ah In)

128
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,050
- She's famous.
- Her acting is amazing.

129
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,250
(She transforms
into many different characters.)

130
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,020
("Mr. Sunshine", "Descendants
of The Sun", "Sweet Home")

131
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,620
- She's amazing.
- Ah In.

132
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,850
Hello.

133
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,400
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

134
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,490
- Ah In, nice to meet you.
- Hello.

135
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,290
- Pleased to meet you.
- Welcome.

136
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,440
Ah In, please introduce yourself.

137
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,600
- I'm Actress Park Ah In.
- I see.

138
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,970
Nice to meet you.

139
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,670
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm nervous.

140
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,140
- Please tell us about your dramas.
- Okay.

141
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,900
- "Mr. Sunshine"...
- It can wait.

142
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,380
- I'm saying this because...
- I'm sorry.

143
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,320
- We want her to feel comfortable...
- Why are you being bossy?

144
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,720
- I'm not being bossy.
- Be nice.

145
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,150
I just want to get to know her.

146
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,850
If you want to know, just ask me.
I'll tell you about her.

147
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,330
Is it wrong to ask her
about her dramas?

148
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,590
All right. Let me tell you
about her most famous works.

149
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,030
- "Mr. Sunshine".
- I really liked the drama.

150
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,070
She played Go Ae Soon,
Kim Tae Ri's cousin.

151
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,070
The one who gambled.

152
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,090
(She played Go Ae Soon
on "Mr. Sunshine".)

153
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,590
- I get it.
- Do you remember that?

154
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,070
- Of course, I do.
- I know.

155
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,470
- I remember.
- You're her.

156
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,100
- And "Descendants of The Sun".
- On "Descendants of The Sun",

157
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,340
she played a chest surgeon
from a rich family.

158
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,800
- "Descendants of The Sun".
- I remember her.

159
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,950
- The hair...
- I remember that.

160
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,040
- You fought with her.
- Exactly.

161
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,340
- I know.
- She's like a professional woman.

162
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,520
She looks like a city girl.

163
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,220
- You mostly play bad girls, right?
- Yes.

164
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,480
- Mostly mean girls.
- Mean girls.

165
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,690
Right.

166
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,220
It's like...

167
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,220
This is my first time meeting her,

168
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,590
but this is how I feel.

169
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,420
She looks like a chest surgeon
who appears on a morning TV show.

170
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,070
- Right.
- And...

171
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,730
- a lawyer.
- An eloquent lawyer.

172
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,790
- She looks like a lawyer.
- Right.

173
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,860
Even when she stands,
she looks a little like...

174
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,470
Most people look like this,

175
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,510
- but she stands like this.
- That's what professors do.

176
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,650
- She looks like a professor.
- Really?

177
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,970
- Yes.
- A professional woman.

178
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,890
This is Ah In's
first time on Running Man.

179
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,020
I'm really nervous.

180
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,760
- Are you nervous?
- Did you sleep well?

181
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,050
I woke up at around 4 a.m.

182
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,130
- Did you wake up?
- Wake up?

183
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,260
- When did you go to sleep?
- What time did you go to sleep?

184
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,350
Around 9 p.m.

185
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,530
That's early.

186
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,700
Around 9 p.m.

187
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,220
- That's early.
- She went to bed early.

188
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,790
- She had a good night's sleep.
- She slept a lot.

189
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,220
She slept more than I did.

190
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,860
- That's when you should wake up.
- She slept more than I did.

191
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,660
You slept for seven hours.

192
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,010
- But you...
- That's when you should wake up.

193
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,340
- It was time to wake up.
- Most people...

194
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,940
sleep seven hours a day.

195
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,510
It's just that you woke up at 4am.

196
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,340
I was worried I wouldn't
be able to sleep.

197
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,910
You don't sound nervous at all.

198
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,380
- You were worried.
- I was nervous.

199
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,040
Do you usually sleep
for like 16 hours?

200
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,220
She says there was a member
of Running Man she wanted to meet.

201
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,590
- Who is it?
- He looks...

202
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,790
like a man I had a crush on
back in college.

203
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,850
Who is it?

204
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,850
- So I'm a huge fan.
- I see.

205
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,630
(They all seem excited
even though they don't show it.)

206
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,400
So... But can I tell you that later?

207
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,090
- When I show my specialty.
- Sure.

208
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,010
- When she shows her specialty.
- Specialty?

209
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,530
And there's someone
you don't want to be on a team with.

210
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,080
- Jong Kook?
- Why?

211
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,240
Why?

212
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,720
(She reveals it right away.)

213
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,740
So it's not Jong Kook.

214
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,910
Jong Kook isn't the one she likes.

215
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,840
- You're not him.
- You're out.

216
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,890
She's not a fan of yours.

217
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,590
- Jong Kook...
- He's her number one choice.

218
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,690
- He's...
- He thought it would be him.

219
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,850
You don't want to be on
a team with me?

220
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,030
No. I think he will be too quiet.

221
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,400
- I see.
- That's not true.

222
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,850
He's really talkative.

223
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,400
- He's like an old woman.
- He talks a lot.

224
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,900
- It's just...
- He talks like an old woman.

225
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,470
She says you seem quiet.

226
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,790
But there's more.

227
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,010
"I think he's too quiet,
so he won't take good care of me."

228
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,600
- That's not true.
- I'm caring.

229
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,640
He doesn't seem so nice and kind.

230
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,950
- He is very kind.
- He is nice and kind.

231
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,300
- But he's...
- Bo Pil.

232
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,710
Make me look good.

233
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,110
What did you do with my image?

234
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,150
(He's a victim
of the thug-like image.)

235
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,910
- You should change the BGM.
- Jong Kook has...

236
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,350
an image of obstinacy.

237
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,130
- That's surprising.
- Obstinacy.

238
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,530
- It is surprising.
- I thought it would be him.

239
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,150
You know that? I made
three guests into stars.

240
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,700
- My goodness.
- Stop saying that.

241
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,830
I made them stars.

242
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,290
- That's what I did.
- Seriously.

243
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,470
- You should be a star yourself.
- That's ridiculous.

244
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,290
- What are they doing now?
- Sa Rok is...

245
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,230
- Sa Rok?
- It's Sae Rok.

246
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,360
Right, Sae Rok.

247
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,140
- What's her family name?
- Just stay still.

248
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,210
- I thought he was...
- I had no idea who it was.

249
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,540
- I didn't know what he was saying.
- What's Sa Rok?

250
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,170
- Who's Sa Rok?
- Is it a dog's name?

251
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,040
Look. I have the big picture.

252
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,040
- This is how I introduce her name.
- What's her family name?

253
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,410
- Eun Sae Rok?
- Eun Sae Rok.

254
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,780
You're getting
a lot of comments now.

255
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,020
They say you should try
to make yourself known.

256
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,190
(They say you should try
to make yourself known.)

257
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,090
(Laughing)

258
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,330
Chan Hee is laughing.

259
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,960
- Sae Rok, are you doing well?
- He likes it.

260
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,160
- He likes jokes like this.
- Sae Rok.

261
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,360
All right.

262
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,630
- I made a few guests into stars.
- And...

263
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,730
Ah In will...
After a little while...

264
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,590
- When all the guests are here,
- I'm curious.

265
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,140
she will show us her specialty.

266
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,270
- All right.
- She prepared something.

267
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,170
Thank you.

268
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,880
Let me introduce our next guest.

269
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,710
She is Kim Hee Jung.

270
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,150
(The second guest Kim Hee Jung)

271
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,910
- Oh, dear.
- All right.

272
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,720
She's Hee Jung.

273
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,120
(In the drama "Tough Guy's Love",
she played Won Bin's niece Ggok Ji.)

274
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,560
(She was a talented child actress.)

275
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,090
(She has grown
into an excellent actress.)

276
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:59,360
(She's now a key player for
FC Wonder Women on "Shooting Stars".)

277
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,210
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.

278
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,270
(Nice to meet you.)

279
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,100
- Hey.
- I'm so nervous.

280
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,600
(I'm so nervous.)

281
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,920
- Nice to meet you. What's wrong?
- Hello.

282
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,870
I worked out too hard,
so my legs are...

283
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,880
Hello.

284
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,420
She says she worked out too hard.

285
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,850
She can't walk well.

286
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,220
- Hello.
- She plays soccer.

287
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,720
- That's right.
- Really?

288
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,750
On "Shooting Stars".

289
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,490
Let me introduce her.

290
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,470
It's been 23 years since her debut.

291
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,330
- Did you say 23 years?
- She's a big senior.

292
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,500
Her famous work is
the KBS drama "Tough Guy's Love".

293
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,940
When she was young...

294
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,130
I know the drama.
"Tough Guy's Love".

295
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,310
I thought
you were talking about him.

296
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,370
- No, I'm Nipples.
- Nipples.

297
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,180
I'm Nipples.
And she's "Tough Guy's Love".

298
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,320
- He's Kim Nipple.
- I'm...

299
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,420
- Stop it. That's enough.
- Kim Nipple?

300
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,320
Enough is enough.

301
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,690
- Nipple Instagram.
- Kim Nipple.

302
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,460
Don't you have something
to do with it?

303
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,380
It's just that I have low nipples.

304
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,250
- Low nipples.
- Low nipples.

305
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,120
He has low nipples.

306
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,490
He's Kim Nipple,
and he's Low Nipple.

307
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,890
- Low Nipple.
- Low Nipple.

308
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,360
- Low Nipple and he's...
- Low Nipple.

309
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,310
- Low Nipple.
- Low Nipple.

310
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,840
(They are becoming one
when talking about nipples.)

311
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,600
We are talking
too much about nipples.

312
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,210
(All they've talked
about is nipples.)

313
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,310
So Min likes it.

314
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,550
I like that.

315
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,000
So Min...

316
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,450
looked like this.

317
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,050
- Low Nipple.
- So Min likes that.

318
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,160
All right. We have Hee Jung here.

319
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,590
She used to be in a dance crew
with Honey J.

320
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,960
- She's a great dancer.
- She dances so well.

321
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,830
- She's amazing.
- I want to see her dance.

322
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,300
I thought she would be...

323
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,390
- a good dancer for some reason.
- You did?

324
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,590
Have you ever met us
when you were on the dance team?

325
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,840
- Yes.
- I did.

326
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,760
- Did you?
- When I was on the dance team?

327
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,580
- Yes. When you were a dancer.
- And did you see us, Ah In?

328
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,770
(Did Ah In see us?)

329
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,470
I saw you when you
performed with a dance team.

330
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,240
I was talking about Hee Jung.

331
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,720
It's all right.

332
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,690
- What's with you, Professor Park?
- I didn't know.

333
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,380
I guess Professor Park
is half asleep.

334
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,850
- She didn't get enough sleep.
- I thought...

335
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,720
she used to be a dancer.

336
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,850
I will stay quiet.

337
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,830
She's just trying
to join the conversation.

338
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,390
- I didn't understand what you said.
- Today,

339
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,970
Hee Jung is dressed...

340
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,470
like a dancer.

341
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,730
- Like the captain of a dance crew.
- Like a girls' hip hop dancer.

342
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,070
- She has that vibe.
- Just like a girls' hip hop dancer.

343
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,500
- She's here to show off her dance.
- Great.

344
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,630
- We'll see her dance later.
- I'm excited.

345
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,310
- I can't wait.
- Our today's guests are amazing.

346
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,910
- They'll show off their talents.
- I'm excited to see it.

347
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,870
She must be amazing since she
used to be a member of a dance crew.

348
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,410
- Now, let's meet the last guest.
- Okay.

349
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,740
- Next up is Roh Jeong Eui.
- All right!

350
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,720
She starred in "Our Beloved Summer".

351
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,920
- Yes.
- That's right.

352
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,460
- Oh, my.
- Welcome.

353
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,020
- I saw her in the drama.
- Oh, my.

354
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,880
- "Our Beloved Summer".
- "Our Beloved Summer".

355
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,460
I just wanted to know what you were
doing since you ignored my calls.

356
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,120
(Jeong Eui played a bold idol star
in the drama "Our Beloved Summer".)

357
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,760
I was going to stay
just for five more minutes.

358
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,390
I have to be on a live music show
shortly.

359
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,540
(She made a strong impression
through her confident character.)

360
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,860
(The rising star, Roh Jeong Eui)

361
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,270
I could eat you alive.

362
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,000
- She's a great actress.
- Jeong Eui, welcome.

363
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,310
- Hello.
- Hello.

364
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,310
(Jeong Eui came out
with something in her hand.)

365
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,510
- Hello.
- Is today White Day?

366
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,470
- Yes, it is.
- I brought something for everyone.

367
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,420
- A woman gives a man chocolate.
- March 14.

368
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,450
- It's a White Day gift.
- Oh, my. Thank you.

369
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,720
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

370
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,560
- I got you one too, So Min.
- Thank you.

371
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,020
Does a woman give a man chocolates
or vice versa?

372
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,350
- A man gives a woman chocolates.
- A man does on this day.

373
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,700
- Here you go.
- Thank you for this, Jeong Eui.

374
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,390
Let me tell you something
about Jeong Eui.

375
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,520
Jeong Eui said...

376
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,590
- that she was a Running Man kid,
- Right.

377
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,990
- and she liked the show so much...
- Yes.

378
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,410
- that she even dreamed about it.
- Really?

379
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,710
- Yes.
- Is that true?

380
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,040
I had a dream where I came on
the show three times.

381
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,580
- Oh, my.
- Do you remember the details?

382
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,240
In those dreams,
I was chased by the members.

383
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,840
- I'm sure she was chased by me.
- Many people have such a dream.

384
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,720
- Mostly, they're chased by me.
- Yes.

385
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,510
Many people even wet themselves
while being chased by him.

386
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,330
- So we had to pause for a while.
- That's right.

387
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,220
It's a true story.

388
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,060
Did you really have
that kind of dream?

389
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,720
- Yes. I've been a huge fan...
- That's understandable.

390
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,390
- Right.
- since I was in elementary school.

391
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,430
- I'm grateful. You grew up well.
- Indeed.

392
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,230
We've met all of our guests
including Jeong Eui.

393
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,170
As I said earlier, the three guests
prepared something to show us.

394
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,230
- They prepared it for Running Man.
- Yes.

395
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,040
- That's so exciting.
- Really?

396
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,970
- Ah In, Hee Jung,
- I'm excited.

397
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,270
- and Jeong Eui.
- Yes.

398
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,380
They'll show off their talents
1 by 1. Ah In said earlier...

399
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,480
that she'd let us know
which member she wanted to...

400
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,610
- team up with while performing.
- That's right.

401
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,250
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

402
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,380
- Good. Ah In will perform first.
- Okay.

403
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,850
- Let me just put on a skirt.
- Sure.

404
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,430
- She watched "X-Man" as a kid.
- Probably.

405
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,570
- I'll put it on quickly.
- She brought a sword. Oh, my.

406
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,570
Will she cut the person she wants
as a teammate with that sword?

407
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,300
- Hold on.
- Could she stab that person?

408
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,360
- That person must be the one.
- I guess so.

409
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,440
- Now...
- Oh, my.

410
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,810
- Ah In is...
- She looks like a pro dancer in it.

411
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,130
- Now...
- I'm not so good at it.

412
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,710
- Ah In will perform a dance for us.
- Yes. I'll just...

413
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,410
- I'll do my best.
- Let's give Ah In...

414
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,270
- a big round of applause.
- Yes!

415
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,680
(Professor Park will perform
a sword dance.)

416
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,350
- She looks charismatic.
- She's amazing.

417
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,830
- I'm impressed.
- That's incredible. Oh, I'm sorry.

418
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,350
- She picked up the sword.
- She picked up the sword.

419
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,890
I can feel it.

420
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,120
Will you slash the person's neck?

421
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,360
My, she's amazing.

422
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,710
(Ah In caught Haha off guard.)

423
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,870
- It must be him.
- Haha?

424
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,040
- I think it's Haha.
- It must be Haha.

425
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,050
I can tell she has
a lot of experience. She's amazing.

426
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,550
- She's pointing at Se Chan.
- She's pointing at him.

427
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,740
- She startled me.
- Is it Se Chan?

428
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,950
(Who could be the man?)

429
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,010
Is it me?

430
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,610
It's Suk Jin.

431
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,610
Is it me?

432
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,460
- It's Suk Jin.
- Me?

433
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,090
No, that can't be.
I don't believe it.

434
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,620
No.

435
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,160
That can't be true.

436
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,620
- It's Suk Jin.
- Is it really me?

437
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,120
- There's no way.
- She picked Seok Sam.

438
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,490
Is it really me?

439
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,200
- This is the 1st time in 10 years.
- No!

440
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,440
(It's so hard to believe
that she picked Seok Sam.)

441
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,200
- My gosh. I'm so grateful to her.
- Hold on.

442
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,260
- That can't be true.
- That was unexpected.

443
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,840
- Thank you so much, Ah In.
- Isn't it the 1st time in 10 years?

444
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,970
I think the whole part should be
edited out.

445
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,370
- He...
- No. Hey.

446
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,130
- I'm a huge fan of his.
- Really?

447
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,240
- Yes.
- Really?

448
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,710
- I'm flattered.
- I love his TikTok videos too.

449
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,920
Oh, my videos?

450
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,450
(Surprisingly, his TikTok videos
made him popular.)

451
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,840
- TikTok Grandpa.
- Oh, I see.

452
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,920
- She's a fan of TikTok Grandpa's.
- She likes my TikTok videos?

453
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,250
- Also, he's always calm and steady.
- That's unexpected.

454
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,930
- I like a calm and steady person.
- Oh, I see.

455
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,350
- His nickname is Petty.
- I'm always calm.

456
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,750
- We call him Petty.
- Yes, we call him Petty.

457
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,120
When I'm with someone who's
so funny and extremely energetic,

458
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,890
- I get a little daunted.
- You feel pressured.

459
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,070
- I make others comfortable.
- Indeed.

460
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,540
- I really want to team up with you.
- That's great.

461
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,760
- I understand. Okay.
- I mean it.

462
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,000
- It turns out...
- I'm a big fan of yours.

463
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,870
- Thank you.
- that Ah In likes TikTok Grandpa...

464
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,810
also known as Petty...

465
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,870
- There are hidden fans like me.
- Exactly.

466
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,140
- I know, right?
- Yes.

467
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,610
- I'll do my best.
- Okay.

468
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,180
- That's great.
- I guess he has many shy fans.

469
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,240
- Exactly. I'm a shy person.
- I see.

470
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,590
- True.
- I don't tell others I'm his fan.

471
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,980
- It's embarrassing to tell others.
- Yes.

472
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,980
- So...
- He's my favorite celebrity.

473
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,060
- Why is it embarrassing?
- He's her favorite celebrity.

474
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,060
Like a secret you can tell...

475
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,290
- no one else but your best friend.
- Exactly.

476
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,660
- I know what that means.
- You think you might get teased.

477
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,590
You can't talk about it
when there are more than two people.

478
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,620
- That's right.
- But I keep being drawn to him.

479
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,070
But you can't help but
be drawn to him.

480
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,070
- He keeps drawing my attention.
- Yes.

481
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,090
- And I feel protective of him.
- Yes.

482
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,260
- Exactly.
- That's right.

483
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,390
While everyone else is talking about
top stars,

484
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,090
- you want to mention Suk Jin.
- That's right.

485
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,470
- But you can't.
- I know what that feels like.

486
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,260
- They might think...
- "Can I talk about him?"

487
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,100
- "Would they think I'm weird?"
- Right.

488
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,840
- "They could."
- Of course.

489
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,770
- Why?
- Stop it.

490
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,740
- Enough is enough.
- What's wrong?

491
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,140
- Hey, I do have pride.
- What's the matter?

492
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,610
You've all contemplated being
Suk Jin's fan at least once, right?

493
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,220
- Gosh. Stop it already.
- Wait.

494
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,690
- That's enough.
- You don't have to hide it anymore.

495
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,350
They all will
come out of the closet.

496
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,350
- You don't have to hide it anymore.
- Don't be shy.

497
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,090
- Don't be embarrassed.
- You can say that you like me.

498
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,220
When you meet your whole family
on a national holiday,

499
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,630
ask everyone, "Is it okay
for me to be Ji Suk Jin's fan?"

500
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,800
(Ask your family, "Is it okay
for me to be Ji Suk Jin's fan?")

501
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,260
(Ji Suk Jin Challenge)

502
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,600
- He looks happy.
- It takes great courage.

503
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,230
- I didn't know he was like that.
- That's not true.

504
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,310
- Great. Next, following Ah In,
- Yes.

505
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,010
Hee Jung will perform a dance.

506
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,190
(Following Ah In,
Hee Jung will perform a dance.)

507
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,980
(She begins
while showing off her groove.)

508
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,790
- She has a good groove.
- She's great.

509
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,990
She's amazing.
She has such a good groove.

510
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,490
- She won't start right away.
- Right.

511
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,670
Let's go!

512
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,730
She's good.

513
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,310
(The former dance crew member's
stunning girls' hip hop dance)

514
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,640
She's incredible.

515
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,290
(Cheering)

516
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,190
(So she finished her sexy
girls' hip hop dance performance.)

517
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,250
- You should form a girl group.
- I agree.

518
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,250
Jeong Eui wants to dance too.

519
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,560
Let's see Ah In's dance first.

520
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,700
(Sorry, coming through.)

521
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,870
- She startled me.
- She's amazing.

522
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,130
Go, Professor Park!

523
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,060
- I love you, Professor Park!
- That's impressive.

524
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,730
(She looks like a professor
who joined her students on a trip.)

525
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,470
- Professor Park.
- She's a great dancer.

526
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,410
- She's really good at dancing.
- She looks so serious.

527
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,380
- But her dance is a little strange.
- She's great.

528
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,880
- Way to go!
- That was amazing.

529
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,650
(Cheering and shouting)

530
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,920
(Are they shouting, "School"?)

531
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,450
- Boombastic!
- That was amazing.

532
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,080
(Loud)

533
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,930
Hey, that song was popular
a long time ago.

534
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,280
I got carried away.

535
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,930
- Hey.
- I want to stand next to you.

536
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,400
- What was that?
- I got too excited.

537
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,020
Let's let them dance again.

538
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,990
- Jeong Eui doesn't just dance...
- That was amazing.

539
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,970
as well as an idol star,
but also can make an idol face.

540
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,140
- She looks so bubbly.
- Indeed.

541
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,410
The dimples on her cheeks...

542
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,940
- Like an ending fairy.
- I want to see her ending face.

543
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,270
Can you show us your ending pose?

544
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,300
- The pose at the end.
- Something like this.

545
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,680
- In a close-up shot at the end.
- Okay.

546
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,650
- Hold it for about three seconds.
- One, two, three.

547
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,240
- One.
- One.

548
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,690
- She looks a bit awkward.
- Two.

549
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,040
- She's not an idol singer.
- I can see that.

550
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,240
- She's never performed on stage.
- Exactly.

551
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,250
- You asked her to do it.
- She's definitely not an idol star.

552
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,360
- She's not desperate for this.
- Exactly.

553
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,390
- She doesn't have to be.
- Her acting career matters more.

554
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,790
Those who are desperate to be
on variety shows would do this.

555
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,520
So Min, can you show us?

556
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,760
- That's a good idea.
- Let's let So Min try it.

557
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,870
- Try it.
- So Min, show us.

558
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,170
- Which camera should I see?
- She's desperate.

559
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,560
- That one.
- Chan Hee's camera.

560
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,790
- Ready, go.
- Go.

561
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,330
- That's not what an idol would do.
- I want to team up with her.

562
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,000
- You should control your breathing.
- What kind of idol would do that?

563
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,950
- That was too much.
- Hey.

564
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,150
- My gosh.
- You looked scary.

565
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,310
Exactly.

566
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,580
- Ji Hyo, do you want to try it?
- Ji Hyo will do it well.

567
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,190
- Good.
- Which camera should I see?

568
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,420
- Ji Hyo, that's good.
- Good.

569
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,720
- She might fall asleep.
- That's right.

570
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,130
(Breathing heavily)

571
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,470
- Why are you breathing like that?
- Why would you...

572
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,870
- Why?
- She did her best.

573
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,930
- I saw them breathing like that.
- Right.

574
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,560
- Did you just finish jogging?
- We're all quite old.

575
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,170
We're all just like Rain.

576
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,760
Did you just finish jogging?

577
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,910
We're all old-fashioned.

578
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,110
Let's give the three guests
a round of applause.

579
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,110
(Ah In, Jeong Eui, and Hee Jung will
join us for the race.)

580
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,880
- Thank you so much.
- You all did a great job.

581
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,350
Today, with the three actresses
who look great in spring...

582
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,010
and like Running Man,

583
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,620
we'll have the Not Spring, Candy
or Penalty race.

584
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,980
To celebrate White Day,
we planned a couple race.

585
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,660
In every mission, you'll pair up
with the opposite gender.

586
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,860
- I see.
- I see.

587
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,400
Since it's White Day,
after each mission ends,

588
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,400
the male members can pick
one female member...

589
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,490
- to give a candy.
- I see.

590
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,140
The girls won't know who gave who.
Those who didn't get any candies...

591
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,800
- will get one penalty ball.
- What?

592
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,000
- Oh, really?
- A penalty ball?

593
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,380
The girls who didn't get
any candies.

594
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,510
The female member who gets
the least penalty balls will win...

595
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,950
and receive a prize.

596
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,850
The female member with the most
penalty balls will get a penalty.

597
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,620
Meanwhile, the female members can
exchange the candies they got...

598
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,890
with ballots at the end of the race.

599
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,050
They will use the ballots
for the male member popularity poll.

600
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,560
The first place will get a prize,

601
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,400
and the last place will get
a penalty.

602
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,730
The winner of each mission will get
a benefit for the popularity poll,

603
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,300
so you should do your best
to win each mission.

604
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,110
(They need to win the opposite
gender over to win the race.)

605
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,880
Before we begin the race,

606
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,010
I'd like to tell you about the rule
that Captain Ji suggested.

607
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,180
- Really?
- Yes.

608
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,150
- They might be a little shy.
- True.

609
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,890
- So let's add a funny element.
- Okay.

610
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,630
One of the male members will
act as a female member.

611
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,890
And one of the female members will
act as a male member.

612
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,020
Which ones?

613
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,220
You can do it.

614
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,960
No. I won't do it.

615
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,170
- I'm...
- You'd look good though.

616
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,830
I can't do it
because I look like a tough guy.

617
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,700
I'm considering Jong Kook
and Jae Suk.

618
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,910
But I think Jae Suk would enjoy it
more than Jong Kook would.

619
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,380
Which of Ji Hyo and So Min should
dress as a man?

620
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,770
Ji Hyo would look better
when dressed as a man,

621
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,300
but it'd be funnier
if So Min did it.

622
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,620
- Let's pick So Min.
- She has never done it before.

623
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,650
- She hasn't.
- Right.

624
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,450
So today, Jae Suk,
your name is Jenny.

625
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,550
- No wonder why it says "Jenny".
- Oh, I see.

626
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,360
- So Min, you're Jeon So Bal.
- So Bal?

627
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,780
- So Bal.
- So Bal.

628
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,550
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

629
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,630
That's why.

630
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,900
Please put on your wigs.

631
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,560
- Pick a wig.
- I have to wear a wig?

632
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,100
- It's Suk Jin's idea, right?
- Ji Hyo, I'll be a man.

633
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,330
- The lady from "Snowpiercer."
- "Snowpiercer?"

634
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,610
- "Snowpiercer." I'm a big fan.
- "Snowpiercer?"

635
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,260
He does look like Tilda Swinton.

636
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,000
- Exactly.
- "No."

637
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,640
- He really looks like her.
- As if it were intentional...

638
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,950
He reminds me of
the movie "Get Out."

639
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,710
Noh Joo Hyun is here.

640
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,710
(Noh Joo Hyun is here.)

641
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,350
"Why Can't We Stop Them."

642
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,420
(So Bal looks like a handsome man
in his 40s.)

643
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,980
- Mr. Noh.
- You look handsome.

644
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,240
- Mr. Noh Joo Hyun.
- You look really handsome.

645
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,420
The game you'll play to choose...

646
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,220
your partner
for the first mission is...

647
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,820
The Same Mole We Have.

648
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,430
- "The same mole"?
- The girls will...

649
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,960
- be in a different room.
- Okay.

650
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,820
- The guys will pick a nickname,
- Yes.

651
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,060
and draw a mole
on one another's face.

652
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,640
After that,

653
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,330
we'll draw the same mole on a board.

654
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,970
The girls will choose their partners
based on the shapes of the moles.

655
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,970
(The girls will pick their partners
based on the moles and nicknames.)

656
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,150
And the girls should draw
the same moles on their faces.

657
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,310
- Really?
- Yes.

658
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,950
- The girls will go upstairs now.
- Of course.

659
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,960
- Got it.
- Okay.

660
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Jenny is going upstairs.

661
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,580
- Yes.
- Jenny.

662
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,860
Where should I draw the mole?
Who should be my partner?

663
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:12,720
Among the cast members
of Running Man,

664
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,060
there's no one
that I want to pair up with.

665
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,970
Do you want to pair up
with Jong Kook?

666
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,230
- Me? Anyone but Suk Jin.
- Yes.

667
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,440
- Anyone but Suk Jin would be fine.
- Right.

668
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,030
Then we can just let Ah In
pair up with him.

669
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,150
- That sounds great.
- Suk Jin and...

670
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,620
If you really pick him
only by seeing the mole...

671
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,950
- Then we're destined to pair up.
- Exactly.

672
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,420
What's taking them so long?

673
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,980
Well...

674
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,390
Jenny can't stop checking herself
in the mirror. Is that okay?

675
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,630
(The adolescent girl
who loves herself too much)

676
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,460
- Jenny... Oh, gosh.
- Gosh, seriously.

677
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,660
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- Jenny has such a small forehead.

678
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,670
She has a small forehead.

679
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,130
Your forehead...

680
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,760
- Why?
- It's too small.

681
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,600
- Her forehead is too small.
- It's too small.

682
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,230
Having a small forehead isn't
a big deal.

683
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,830
I cut the fringe intentionally.

684
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,070
- But your forehead...
- Worry about your foreheads.

685
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,730
Mind your own business.

686
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,680
- I have a nasty temper.
- Do you?

687
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,620
Did you all appear on the show
"The Mate"?

688
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,350
- Hey, how about we have a sauna?
- Yes?

689
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,810
- No. What are you talking about?
- Hey.

690
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,080
Let's have a sauna together
after the shoot.

691
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,580
- Are you sure?
- Let's play soccer too.

692
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,630
Come on. Oh, man.
So Bal is so funny.

693
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,520
(Her role is an ordinary man,
but she acts like a thug.)

694
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,760
- Everyone.
- Yes.

695
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,020
- Yes.
- First, pick a nickname...

696
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,230
that the girls can't assume
to be yours easily.

697
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,170
- What should I pick?
- Pick your nickname.

698
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,230
I pick...

699
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,330
(I pick...)

700
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,410
Eric.

701
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,470
I...

702
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,210
I'll be Brad Pitt.

703
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,850
- Brad Pitt?
- Brad Pitt.

704
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,720
My nickname is Superpower.

705
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,040
Superpower?

706
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,740
I'll be Hamster.

707
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,620
- But that's obvious.
- What about you, Jong Kook?

708
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,660
What should I pick?

709
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,690
You should be Nipple.

710
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,320
- Nipple?
- That'd be too obvious.

711
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,720
- How about Jjujju?
- What?

712
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,930
Jjujju? That would be obvious too.
Should I pick that one?

713
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,130
- No. It's irrelevant.
- How about Secret Jjujju?

714
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,320
Secret Jjujju.

715
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,400
- Secret Jjujju sounds perfect.
- Secret Jjujju.

716
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,640
- Okay. I'm Secret Jjujju.
- Secret Jjujju.

717
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,330
- That sounds good.
- My nickname is Secret Jjujju.

718
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,730
- Secret Jjujju.
- Secret Jjujju.

719
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,500
Secret Jjujju.

720
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,210
- I can do this all day.
- That's okay.

721
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,680
(They start drawing a mole
without hesitating.)

722
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,240
- It's easier to use this way.
- Yes.

723
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,510
- You should press it down.
- It's smoother on the side.

724
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,220
I play a sad character.

725
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,650
(I play a sad character.)

726
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,480
(They just have to draw a mole,
but they're being creative.)

727
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,050
Suk Jin, I think you should
make it darker.

728
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,050
Se Chan, don't you think
that's too much?

729
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,930
I'm done.
I have it all over my nose.

730
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,970
- I drew along my lip line too.
- That's...

731
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,870
Hey, no one will choose you.

732
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,670
(Cocky)

733
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,030
Hey, your nickname Superpower
suits you.

734
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,970
(With the mustache,
Superpower So Bal acts arrogantly.)

735
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,880
- If you were a man,
- But men wouldn't act like that.

736
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,610
I bet you would be such a womanizer.

737
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,850
- Every woman would fall for me.
- Right?

738
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,240
She wouldn't be as popular
if she were a man.

739
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Brother, come on.

740
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,740
(Brother, come on.)

741
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,720
Why are you acting like a thug?

742
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,280
- Don't all men act like this?
- Not all men...

743
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,190
- act like that.
- Why do you keep moving your mouth?

744
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,460
- She's trying to look like a man.
- She keeps doing that.

745
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,630
- Don't all men do this?
- Are you eating a candy?

746
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,160
- We don't do that.
- What's that?

747
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,670
- Brother.
- We don't do that.

748
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,870
This is what we all do.

749
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,600
Why do you do that?

750
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,140
(What do you do that for?)

751
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,560
- What do you do that for?
- And this too.

752
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,410
Why do you do that?

753
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,230
While sitting down, you stand up
and walk like this. "Let's go."

754
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,950
(Walking awkwardly)

755
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,040
"Wait."

756
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
(Only the men can relate to it.
So Bal can't understand it.)

757
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,150
Oh, I get it. You mean, this?

758
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,740
- Like this?
- All men do this.

759
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,620
Hey, stop it.

760
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,010
(She's so eager to imitate them.)

761
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,810
- Am I doing it right?
- All men can relate to it.

762
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,960
(So Bal wants to try everything
that the other guys do.)

763
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,050
(The men picked their nicknames
and drew their moles.)

764
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,820
(Secret Jjujju, Hamster, Eric,
Superpower, Brad Pitt)

765
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,130
The time has come.

766
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,200
My gosh. What's that?

767
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,020
What's that?

768
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,760
- Superpower must be Haha.
- My gosh.

769
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,870
And Hamster must be...

770
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,710
- I think it's Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

771
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,260
Secret Jjujju.

772
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
Let me see.

773
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,270
I think that Eric is So Bal.

774
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,510
Brad Pitt must be Se Chan.

775
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,470
Hamster must be Seok Sam.

776
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,450
Secret Jjujju must be Kim Nipple.

777
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,080
(Jenny guessed
only 1 nickname right.)

778
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,310
Me?

779
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,480
(Ah In is the 1st girl
to choose her partner.)

780
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,820
(She desperately hopes to pick
Suk Jin.)

781
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,400
Should I pick an easy one?
It's hard to decide.

782
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,630
There are many shy fans of mine.

783
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,670
(Brad Pitt Suk Jin drew a big mole
on his forehead.)

784
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,670
He looks happy.

785
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,230
- Do you really want Seok Sam?
- Don't change your mind.

786
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,710
Yes, I want to pair up with him.
I think he'll make me comfortable.

787
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,730
Now, we'll meet Brad Pitt's partner.

788
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,970
- Okay.
- Who could that be?

789
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,150
- Did they choose their partners?
- Brad Pitt's partner...

790
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,150
Brad Pitt.

791
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,970
Ah In seemed to like Suk Jin
so much.

792
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,040
- I know, right? Could it be...
- I think...

793
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,120
- Ah In?
- I'm sure she picked you.

794
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,240
- Maybe not. She only saw the mole.
- I'm sure of it.

795
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,310
She must've known which one was you.
I bet she picked you.

796
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,120
Brad Pitt's partner,
please come out.

797
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,390
I hope she picked Suk Jin.

798
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,240
Brad Pitt's partner,
please come out.

799
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,840
(Who is the partner of Suk Jin
who's waiting for his number 1 fan?)

800
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,870
Hey.

801
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,480
(Jenny appears.)

802
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,840
- Gosh, Jae Suk.
- Darn. I'm so unlucky.

803
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,380
- Jenny.
- Jae Suk.

804
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,460
- Ah In...
- Why would you pick me?

805
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,720
- Why?
- We were expecting Ah In.

806
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,150
Why would you pick me?

807
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,490
I guess you guys made it confusing.

808
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,530
- Ah In should've picked him.
- It's not confusing.

809
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,800
It's so obvious that it's Suk Jin.

810
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,000
Why...

811
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,090
- I mean, the nose...
- It's simple.

812
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,090
Why?

813
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,000
Ah In picked the mole on the nose
because she thought it was Suk Jin.

814
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,770
(Ah In thought the mole on the nose
was Suk Jin's.)

815
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,900
- What? She picked Se Chan?
- Really?

816
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,240
Oh, she thought it was a signal.

817
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,330
- I mean... Gosh.
- Oh, she thought it was a signal.

818
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,840
- Why is it Seok Sam?
- Seriously.

819
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,070
Gosh. Why did this happen
on a day like this?

820
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,220
- Why is it Seok Sam?
- I'm so annoyed.

821
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,450
- Why is it you?
- Jae Suk, didn't you know?

822
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,220
- I had no idea.
- I thought it was intentional.

823
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,290
I don't like this.

824
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,350
Hey, are you saying
that Ah In drew this...

825
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,150
- on her nose?
- Oh, no.

826
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,790
- I feel bad for her.
- I thought...

827
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,500
- Just to be my partner?
- Yes.

828
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Ah In drew the same mole
on her nose to pair up with you.

829
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,360
- I feel bad for her.
- I thought...

830
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,700
(Hee Jung appears.)

831
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,860
- What's going on?
- She made a big sacrifice.

832
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,970
- Whose partner is she?
- Poor Ah In.

833
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,980
- Oh, she picked Jong Kook.
- Oh, right.

834
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,040
(She picked Secret Jjujju.)

835
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,310
I picked SJ.

836
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,780
- Right. Thanks.
- SJ.

837
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,780
- SJ, Secret Jjujju.
- That's right.

838
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,610
- The next member is coming out.
- I thought it was him.

839
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,950
(Next, Jeong Eui appears.)

840
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,680
- Oh, gosh. She hit her face on it.
- What happened?

841
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,220
- Are you okay?
- Open your eyes.

842
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:02,960
Are you okay?

843
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,080
- She drew tears.
- She's crying.

844
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,590
I asked you if you were okay.

845
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,570
(She picked Haha as her partner.)

846
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,820
Jeong Eui.

847
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,860
We thought this one was...

848
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,470
- Se Chan.
- You thought that was me?

849
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,830
- Oh, right. Yes, that's right.
- Right.

850
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,570
- Move backward.
- Thinking that she drew that...

851
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,510
She says that Ah In looks cute
with this mole. I didn't want...

852
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,980
- I'm so upset.
- Ah In must be...

853
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,370
- Poor her.
- Exactly.

854
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,050
(Ah In appears.)

855
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,720
I had no idea she would... Oh, gosh.

856
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,990
I feel so bad for her.

857
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,320
- What a shame. I had no idea.
- Poor her.

858
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,880
- It's okay for a man, but...
- Poor her.

859
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,000
- Ah In, I'm so sorry.
- It's too much.

860
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,890
I clearly told Suk Jin...

861
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,200
- that I wanted to pair up with him.
- I know.

862
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,590
- And he agreed to it.
- One, two, three.

863
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,390
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

864
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,040
(Both said, "I'm sorry.")

865
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,660
- What a shame.
- I'm sorry.

866
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,330
- I thought...
- I asked you to be my partner...

867
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,510
during the break.

868
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,100
Yes, but we didn't discuss
where I should draw a mole.

869
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,450
We all thought it was you.

870
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,570
- Exactly. He drew...
- Exactly.

871
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,370
We all thought it was you
because your nickname is Big Nose.

872
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,410
I know.

873
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,790
I didn't do it intentionally.

874
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,460
- We thought it symbolized Big Nose.
- Exactly.

875
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,320
(Right then, Ji Hyo appears.)

876
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,790
My princess.

877
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,060
- My princess is here.
- She picked Superpower.

878
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,590
- My little princess.
- I'm glad she picked So Bal.

879
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,590
- We didn't know it was her.
- This is great.

880
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,070
- Don't walk up the stairs, So Bal.
- Ji Hyo, you picked me.

881
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,590
I knew it was you.

882
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,270
- My lovely princess.
- Let's move aside a little.

883
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,070
- Gosh. What a shame.
- It's such a shame.

884
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,830
- My princess.
- Gosh, seriously.

885
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,070
I said I would be happy
as long as it wasn't Seok Sam.

886
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,130
(They all found out
who were their partners.)

887
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,450
- Gosh. Look at that.
- What's that?

888
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,570
- Oh, gosh.
- I guess it's a water bomb.

889
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,670
Right. Water will fall.

890
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,250
A water bomb over our heads? Okay.

891
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,570
I guess we'll wear a hat though.

892
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,950
Oh, water will fall on our heads.

893
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,680
I had to leave
while trimming my wig.

894
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,320
- I know.
- Would a man with your face...

895
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,420
be popular with girls?

896
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,880
Of course.

897
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,890
(Of course.)

898
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,890
My little princess.

899
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,860
- A pretty boy.
- Oh, my.

900
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,590
Don't you think she looks so great
in that hairstyle?

901
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,740
- My princess.
- Just like the cartoon character...

902
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,040
I want her to have this hairstyle.

903
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,970
- I told you about the character.
- I mean it.

904
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,040
So Min, you should wear that wig
in real life.

905
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
Exactly.

906
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,980
Oh, my.

907
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,250
There comes Jenny.
She's wearing hairpins.

908
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,780
- Who? Jenny?
- You look so pretty,

909
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,070
- Jenny.
- Darn.

910
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,950
He really is ugly, isn't he?

911
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,250
He isn't satisfied
with this situation.

912
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,950
How did you know that?

913
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,880
Are you satisfied
with your partners?

914
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,990
No!

915
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,530
I'm not.

916
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,200
- I'm not even talking to him.
- Unbelievable.

917
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,700
- Don't even call him my partner.
- Can't you see we're sitting apart?

918
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,000
Please be more considerate.

919
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,770
- What?
- Don't be absurd.

920
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,700
How gentler can I be?

921
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,900
No, not you.

922
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,270
- He meant Suk Jin.
- We'll get into it later on.

923
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,630
- Wait and see.
- Jenny's a fierce one, isn't she?

924
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,510
- Of course.
- How scary.

925
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,810
How could I possibly like her?

926
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,410
Anyway, let's begin the first game.

927
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,840
In the first game,

928
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,180
you will see just how sharp
your partner is.

929
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,150
This is Head Smack Detective.

930
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,560
Head Smack Detective?

931
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,260
One team will put on hats...

932
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,420
and sit below the water balloon.

933
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,230
The rest of you
will stand behind them.

934
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,070
Out of those standing in the back,

935
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,970
one team will step forward...

936
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,740
and smack the heads of those seated.

937
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,510
- I see.
- For instance,

938
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,510
let's say that Jenny and Suk Jin
were seated.

939
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,070
Ji Hyo would smack someone...

940
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,900
and then So Bal
would smack the other person.

941
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,510
The couple seated will deliberate
who smacked their heads.

942
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,980
Get it right and you'll swap places.

943
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,870
Get it wrong and the other couple
will earn a point.

944
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,050
It's about telling who hit whom.

945
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,490
We won't know
until we play the game.

946
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,650
Ten minutes after the game begins,
the water balloons will explode.

947
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,680
The couple that gets soaked
will lose three points.

948
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,150
(The couple that gets soaked
will lose three points.)

949
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,700
Who will like to go first?

950
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,000
Maybe Jenny and...

951
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,360
- Us.
- Sure, we'll go first.

952
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,630
Sure thing.

953
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,700
Goodness.

954
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,100
Only one couple
will smack our heads from behind.

955
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,240
- Two in total.
- Right.

956
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,930
You need to guess...

957
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,740
- who hit you.
- We need to get it right.

958
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,900
They need to be able
to know who hit them,

959
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,640
- so put some force behind it.
- Of course.

960
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,140
The hat can go flying, right?

961
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,490
- Okay.
- That's perfectly fine.

962
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,490
You can tell who it is
by how they hit others.

963
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,410
- Everyone has a unique touch.
- That's right.

964
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,180
Let the game begin.

965
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,680
- Do we close our eyes?
- And go.

966
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,880
(The game begins.)

967
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,090
Just so you know,

968
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,120
- So Min can't sit this out.
- No, she can't.

969
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,920
- This...
- Let's trade places.

970
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,630
What on earth?

971
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,660
- No, wait.
- That's not it.

972
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,860
(Jenny gets smacked once.)

973
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,330
(Jenny gets smacked twice.)

974
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,810
- No, wait.
- That's not it.

975
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,600
Sorry, we'll do that again.

976
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,310
(Confusion occurs.)

977
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,010
You should've hit the other person.

978
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,450
You should've hit Suk Jin.

979
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,840
- It wasn't done correctly.
- I heard loud sounds.

980
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,910
- Wait.
- We didn't quite get it.

981
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,250
We didn't quite get the rules.

982
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,110
- How so?
- So Min was supposed to hit you.

983
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,320
- How can you not get this?
- I know who it was.

984
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,580
They didn't quite
understand the rules.

985
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,150
- You got smacked twice, right?
- Right.

986
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,490
She didn't quite
understand the rules.

987
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,150
- Ji Hyo hit you.
- Ji Hyo hit you...

988
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,730
- and So Min hit you too.
- You should hit the other person.

989
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,730
I'll remember
the touch of your hands though.

990
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,330
- Especially you.
- I know it too.

991
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,500
These two.

992
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,310
- I know their touch.
- Do you get the rules now?

993
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,740
- We'll start over.
- So Min, come on.

994
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,330
Let's walk around behind them first.

995
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,170
- Right, let's rotate.
- Not in front of them.

996
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,280
That's a good idea.

997
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,640
Let's confuse them a little.

998
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,570
- I can tell who it is.
- Go!

999
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,410
- Let's wait it out a little.
- Those well-mannered...

1000
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,640
- Swoosh!
- You startled me.

1001
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,850
- Don't go in front of them.
- I know who's well-mannered.

1002
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,410
- I know.
- I can tell.

1003
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,620
(Jong Kook smacks Jenny's head.)

1004
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,760
(Ho!)

1005
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,620
The partner's up next.

1006
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,360
She flew ahead...

1007
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,500
which means it wasn't So Min.

1008
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,330
(Jong Kook's partner Hee Jung
smacks Suk Jin's head.)

1009
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,570
Get guessing.

1010
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,170
The hand was delicate.
It was a woman's.

1011
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,170
Judging by the thin hand,
it has to be a woman's.

1012
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,840
- I smelled her perfume as well.
- This isn't easy, you know.

1013
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,020
- It's hard.
- It's not easy.

1014
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,140
It was a woman.

1015
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,250
(The oldest detective recalls
how the hand felt.)

1016
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,340
Was it Jong Kook?

1017
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,050
No, I think it was Se Chan.

1018
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,150
Se Chan and Ah In.
He can't look me in the eyes.

1019
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,320
- He can't.
- Se Chan?

1020
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,990
But Se Chan would've
smacked us hard.

1021
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,030
- Was it So Min?
- So Min?

1022
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,420
She flew forward
after someone smacked you.

1023
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,890
That was So Min.

1024
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,660
- Maybe it was really her.
- No way.

1025
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,630
It can't be her.

1026
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,390
- How stupid can you be?
- They're arguing.

1027
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,930
Can't you be nicer to Jenny?

1028
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,400
- Be nicer.
- He's not Jae Suk today.

1029
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,480
- This is Jenny.
- She's your partner.

1030
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,100
- Stupid?
- Be nicer.

1031
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,170
Just think about it.

1032
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,370
- You're partners.
- After you were hit,

1033
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,910
she flew out in front of you.
It couldn't have been her.

1034
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,110
She was only trying to trick us.

1035
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,910
How about this, then?

1036
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,880
- How did he know?
- I was smacked like this.

1037
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,350
This is how it was for me.

1038
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,760
- In my case...
- No way.

1039
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,620
- I was smacked like this.
- What?

1040
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,850
- Check this out.
- Show me.

1041
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,230
I was smacked like this.

1042
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,500
Get back here.

1043
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,970
This has turned
into a comedy sketch.

1044
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,860
- Get back here.
- A comedy sketch.

1045
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,660
That was like a comedy sketch.

1046
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,530
That hurt.
Did someone hit you that hard?

1047
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,660
That's how it was for me.

1048
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,830
Take your pick, then.

1049
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,240
- Who do you think it was?
- So Min and Ji Hyo?

1050
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,350
- Let's go with Haha.
- Haha and Jeong Eui.

1051
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,510
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1052
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,640
- Jeong Eui.
- Haha.

1053
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,320
- Darn it.
- Please sit back down.

1054
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,580
- The balloons didn't explode.
- Unbelievable.

1055
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,620
(Hee Jung and Jong Kook
score a point.)

1056
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,050
Guess whenever you're ready.

1057
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,180
(Groaning)

1058
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:47,220
(Ah In's full swing)

1059
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,850
You have to stay seated.

1060
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,830
That was insane!

1061
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,160
- No way.
- That hurt.

1062
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,140
(Se Chan smacks Jenny.)

1063
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,240
Did that hurt or not?

1064
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,470
- Did that hurt or not?
- It really hurt.

1065
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,330
- It hurt for me as well.
- I was smacked hard.

1066
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,330
The couple with both our members.

1067
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,950
Busted. She caught my eye.

1068
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,240
Her? So Min?

1069
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,350
No, not her.

1070
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,740
Ah In went like this.

1071
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,010
(Swoosh)

1072
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,450
- What did she do?
- How did she react?

1073
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,660
The second I stood up,
she went like this.

1074
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,490
(She immediately looked away.)

1075
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,030
- Was it Se Chan?
- Right.

1076
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,260
- Se Chan and...
- But I was hit really hard.

1077
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,490
- Se Chan and...
- A guy hit me.

1078
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,550
- I know I'm right.
- It was a guy!

1079
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,600
No, it was Ah In.

1080
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,030
- It wasn't me.
- Ah In smacked you on the head.

1081
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,720
- Let me see your hand.
- I saw how she reacted.

1082
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,300
- Really?
- Look at Haha's expression.

1083
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,260
Se Chan's the one who smacked me.

1084
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,660
- That's who we're going with?
- Se Chan and...

1085
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,030
- How stupid can you be?
- Se Chan and...

1086
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,240
- He called him stupid again.
- Park Ah In.

1087
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,200
Okay!

1088
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,640
Another couple will sit down.

1089
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,640
- Did she...
- It was Ah In.

1090
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,240
- Ah In...
- Were you the one who hit me?

1091
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,320
Ah In couldn't look me in the eyes.

1092
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,050
It's hard to tell who it is
when the guest smacks you really hard.

1093
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,260
Ah In likes to smack people around.

1094
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,390
She laid it on him.

1095
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,550
It was no joke.

1096
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,990
They all seem eager to play.

1097
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,450
We can't fool around
because of the balloons.

1098
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:57,430
(Who will smack them
on their heads this time?)

1099
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,720
I can feel your presence.

1100
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,410
Okay, I felt a punch.
That was a woman's.

1101
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,370
- Did someone hit you?
- It wasn't rough.

1102
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,640
It wasn't rough? Got it.

1103
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,320
I know it was So Min.

1104
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,470
I wasn't hit very hard.

1105
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,490
Then it was Ji Hyo.

1106
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,410
- Say it was Ji Hyo.
- Yes, Ji Hyo and...

1107
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,620
- So Min's the one who punched me.
- Did it hurt?

1108
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,120
They're on the same team, right?

1109
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,180
- I was punched.
- Got it.

1110
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,350
- Who was it?
- So Min.

1111
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,450
- And Ji Hyo.
- They didn't even look at us.

1112
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,990
- So Min.
- And Ji Hyo.

1113
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,160
(They were caught in record time.)

1114
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,030
- Nice!
- Why am I so obvious?

1115
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,430
Why am I so obvious?

1116
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,870
- Well...
- Why did you use your fist?

1117
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,260
What's wrong with you?

1118
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,640
So Min, come on.

1119
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,640
- Why do I always get caught?
- How do they know it's her?

1120
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,910
So Min, get a grip on yourself.

1121
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,050
- Unbelievable.
- How did you know it was me?

1122
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,510
- Jeong Eui, come on.
- This is fun.

1123
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,870
Ah In's having a blast.

1124
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,240
She's like, "This is fun."

1125
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,280
(Professor Park
is enjoying the game.)

1126
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,120
- It's nice to be back.
- It gets confusing.

1127
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,450
(So Bal and Ji Hyo
will be smacked on the head.)

1128
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,830
- Sorry.
- Watch your step.

1129
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,890
Jae Suk, seriously?

1130
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:02,120
(Like a short-track skater)

1131
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,870
- This time, it'll be Jae Suk.
- Okay.

1132
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,070
I mean, Jenny. One...

1133
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,410
One...

1134
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,580
I think it really was Jae Suk.

1135
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,370
I think it was Jae Suk.

1136
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,970
I mean it. The hand felt edgy.

1137
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,120
- I think it was Jae Suk.
- No, you can't look.

1138
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,550
- What?
- Are you kidding me?

1139
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,390
(She looks back.)

1140
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,490
- What?
- Are you kidding me?

1141
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,950
- Sorry.
- What's the matter with You?

1142
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,010
- Again.
- Do it again.

1143
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,580
- What's with her?
- All right.

1144
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,850
- Do it again.
- You can't keep doing this.

1145
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,890
- That's wrong.
- But...

1146
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:33,700
Don't live your life this way.

1147
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,700
He said...

1148
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,260
Let's put our hands forward.

1149
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,660
- I'm sorry.
- Shoot your arms out.

1150
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,700
Who will it be?

1151
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,870
Haha?

1152
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,140
- Sure thing.
- Haha, go ahead.

1153
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,240
On three, Haha and his partner
will smack their heads.

1154
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,740
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1155
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,870
Should I hit her
on the count of three?

1156
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,350
- No, I'll do it.
- Sure.

1157
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,780
- All right.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1158
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,050
(Smack!)

1159
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,950
- Hey!
- Not yet!

1160
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,850
(Not yet!)

1161
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,490
- Seriously?
- Come on!

1162
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,780
- I'm done playing this game.
- What's wrong with her?

1163
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,200
- What's the matter with you?
- She's ruining a good game.

1164
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,800
Stop peeking!

1165
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,600
I didn't mean it.
It was involuntary.

1166
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,330
- But...
- You'll do it again.

1167
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,700
- Seriously?
- Unbelievable.

1168
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,470
I can't help myself.

1169
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,070
Only look back when you're told to.

1170
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,200
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

1171
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,700
What's wrong with me?

1172
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,180
- There's no need to cry.
- I'm tearing up.

1173
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,240
- Ji Hyo...
- It just happened.

1174
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,550
Why do I keep looking back?

1175
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,370
- What's with me?
- It's hard for her to sit still.

1176
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,720
Go ahead and smack me again.

1177
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,780
Then...

1178
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,820
Please gather around again.

1179
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,050
Jeong Eui and Hee Jung
should hit them respectively.

1180
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,890
They aren't on the same team,
but who cares.

1181
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,350
Whoever wants to hit them
should hit them.

1182
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,830
Here we go.

1183
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,330
Who will it be?
Have you made up your minds?

1184
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,260
- One, two, three!
- Three!

1185
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,970
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1186
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,100
(Smack!)

1187
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,240
All I felt was a tap.

1188
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,260
Guess who it was.

1189
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,640
(The investigation begins.)

1190
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,600
It was Jeong Eui.

1191
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,200
Really?

1192
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,510
I think it was Jeong Eui who hit me.

1193
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,820
- I think Haha hit you.
- Really?

1194
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,080
- Haha?
- Did you hit them both?

1195
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,320
- Was it Haha?
- Will she get this right?

1196
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,490
No, Jeong Eui's the one who hit me.

1197
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,910
- What?
- Jeong Eui hit me, not you.

1198
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,490
I felt a man's touch.

1199
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,910
Could it have been Suk Jin?

1200
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,680
(Oh!)

1201
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,450
- Oh?
- Yes, oh!

1202
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,600
Are you a caveman?

1203
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,100
- What was that?
- What on earth was that?

1204
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,830
You're allowed to speak, you know.

1205
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,870
- Am I allowed to speak?
- Are you a monkey?

1206
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,240
He's terrible
at comedy sketches, you see.

1207
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,140
- He sounded like a caveman.
- It felt rough though.

1208
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,410
- How perceptive.
- I think...

1209
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,030
- It wasn't Suk Jin.
- I think it came from this way.

1210
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,850
- Why can't you tell who it was?
- How come...

1211
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:31,950
From this direction.

1212
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,450
Haha could've hit you like this.

1213
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,350
- By crossing directions?
- Just know that it wasn't...

1214
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,390
Jenny or Suk Jin.

1215
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,010
Jeong Eui.

1216
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,410
- It wasn't me.
- It wasn't me or Suk Jin.

1217
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,580
- It wasn't.
- It really wasn't.

1218
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,990
(Anyone could be the culprit,
so who was it?)

1219
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,930
I'll go with Haha then.

1220
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,100
- But...
- Sure.

1221
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,760
- In 1, 2, 3. Haha.
- Jeong Eui.

1222
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,700
(Did Ji Hyo guess right?)

1223
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,700
- See?
- How did you know?

1224
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,030
- How did you know?
- I knew it was Jeong Eui.

1225
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,870
- No way.
- Unbelievable.

1226
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Please take your seats.

1227
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,350
Jeong Eui's been messing with us
all throughout the game.

1228
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,680
- Jeong Eui...
- She isn't playing around.

1229
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,950
- What was that?
- My gosh!

1230
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,080
(The water balloons popped.)

1231
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,350
(Screaming)

1232
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,180
- What was that? Why did they pop?
- Goodness.

1233
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,760
- That scared me.
- Why did they pop on us?

1234
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,120
- That scared me.
- All right!

1235
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,800
- Why did they suddenly pop?
- That's minus three points for you.

1236
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,720
- Why did they suddenly pop?
- All right!

1237
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,830
It was an accident.

1238
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,140
- You got unlucky.
- All right!

1239
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,600
(Monk Haha and Jeong Eui
were very surprised.)

1240
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,640
All right!

1241
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,030
You find everything fun, don't you?

1242
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,240
It's time to announce the ranking.

1243
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,870
You'll get the benefits
needed at the end...

1244
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,700
according to your ranking.

1245
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,780
- Is that so?
- Okay.

1246
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:42,470
First place goes to Jong Kook
and Hee Jung who got three points.

1247
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,510
(1st place: Jong Kook and Hee Jung)

1248
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,640
They did well.

1249
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,990
- Yes!
- Second place...

1250
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,490
goes to Se Chan and Ah In.

1251
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,990
(2nd place: Se Chan and Ah In)

1252
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,390
Jenny and Suk Jin
and So Min and Ji Hyo...

1253
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,390
are both in third place.

1254
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,430
Haha and Jeong Eui
are in last place.

1255
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,550
Seriously...

1256
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,930
We'll give you benefits
according to the results.

1257
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:01,890
We'll hand out candies
as the first mission ended.

1258
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,240
(First handing out of candies)

1259
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,780
The male members will head outside
with candies that have their names.

1260
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,950
You'll see boxes with the names
of the female members.

1261
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,780
Open the box of the female member
you want to partner up with next...

1262
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,680
- and put your candy in.
- Got it.

1263
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,490
If two or more male members
pick the same female member,

1264
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,680
the female member will pick
her partner.

1265
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,890
Who's going first?

1266
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:25,050
If there's a female member
who receives no candies,

1267
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,890
she'll get penalty balls.

1268
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,100
- Those with no candies?
- Yes.

1269
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,260
- That's...
- That's mean.

1270
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,430
- Don't worry, Ah In.
- All right.

1271
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,470
- We get one each?
- It's okay.

1272
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,530
- You won't betray me, will you?
- Of course not.

1273
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,070
- I can play well.
- Okay.

1274
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,660
Can you tell us
which male member you prefer?

1275
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,740
Let's start with Jenny.

1276
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,080
- With who?
- With Jenny.

1277
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,830
- Jenny.
- Who would you like?

1278
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,100
I won't change my mind.

1279
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,780
Why don't you appeal yourself
with dancing?

1280
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,240
- So we can pick you.
- Come on.

1281
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,280
- I bet I wasn't that bad.
- I...

1282
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,120
It's weird that you'd appeal
yourself to get candy.

1283
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,550
Don't put your candies in my box.
I'm serious.

1284
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,680
- That's quite appealing.
- Jenny!

1285
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,950
I find him appealing.

1286
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,450
- You don't want it?
- No. Don't put it in my box.

1287
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,120
- Are you sure?
- Hey, you're charming.

1288
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,260
You're charming.

1289
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,870
(You're charming.)

1290
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,740
You're strangely charming.

1291
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,970
- So Bal...
- She's stepping up.

1292
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,700
If you want,
then you can put yours in mine.

1293
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,100
- Is that so?
- But you told us not to.

1294
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,240
Where's your place?

1295
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,140
So Min's hair is funny.

1296
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,050
- She's so funny.
- My place?

1297
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,850
Her pick-up line is so old though.

1298
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,410
- Ji Hyo, it's your turn.
- She's hilarious.

1299
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,490
I...

1300
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,320
I have faith in my partner.

1301
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,780
- You mean So Bal?
- So Min.

1302
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,390
You can't trust people like her.

1303
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,030
But So Bal... Hey.

1304
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:36,220
(Kneeling performance)

1305
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,100
You know what she told me earlier?

1306
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,300
She said she wouldn't
change her mind,

1307
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,470
but she went up to Jenny...

1308
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,300
- and said, "Where's your place?"
- "Where's your place?"

1309
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,910
- "Where's your place?"
- That's her charm.

1310
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,970
- I'm a bad boy.
- Hey.

1311
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,030
- That's her charm.
- Right?

1312
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,030
You're the only one I love.

1313
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,740
Did something get in your eye?

1314
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,240
(You mean this?)

1315
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,550
- What about Ah In?
- Suk Jin agreed to pick me.

1316
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,580
(Suk Jin and Shy Suk Jin
have finished making a deal.)

1317
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,680
- Gosh, she dumped me.
- She doesn't know who Suk Jin is.

1318
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,580
Ah In isn't even looking at me.

1319
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,780
Okay, fine.

1320
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,160
- I bet no one wants you.
- I'm going for Jenny.

1321
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,180
All right.

1322
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,160
But Ah In is older than you.

1323
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,300
- Pardon?
- She's older.

1324
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,200
- What?
- How old are you, Ah In?

1325
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,330
Oh, me?

1326
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,370
- I'm sorry, but...
- I was born in 1985.

1327
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,330
- I'm so sorry, Ah In.
- She's older than you?

1328
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,660
I'm so sorry, Ah In.

1329
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,660
She's older than you?

1330
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,240
- Hey! Why you...
- I didn't know either!

1331
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,010
- You're older than me?
- She's older than me?

1332
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,180
I made a slip too.

1333
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,280
I thought she was way younger
than me.

1334
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,870
- I also thought she was younger.
- So I called her casually.

1335
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,550
- Really?
- I'm so sorry, Ah In.

1336
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:26,200
- You'd better behave yourself.
- How old are you?

1337
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,740
- How old are you?
- I'm so sorry!

1338
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,870
- He was born in 1986.
- She was born in 1985.

1339
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,450
- I was born in 1985.
- Sorry, I was born in 1986.

1340
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,820
- I'm a year younger. I'm sorry.
- Ah In.

1341
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,080
- I'm sorry, Ah In.
- So Min.

1342
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,720
- Se Chan.
- I'm sorry.

1343
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,350
I naturally thought
she'd be younger than me.

1344
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,030
You both made mistakes.

1345
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,700
- How embarrassing.
- You should address her properly.

1346
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,260
- I had no idea.
- All right.

1347
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,760
Let's start with Suk Jin.

1348
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,970
- Shall I go first?
- Yes.

1349
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,200
But the thing is...

1350
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,070
- Ah In.
- You look so young.

1351
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,390
- Ah In.
- Yes, Suk Jin?

1352
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,830
- You see, Running Man is...
- What is he on about?

1353
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:54,680
- Speak properly.
- What? "Running Nan?"

1354
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,850
I hope you won't be hurt.

1355
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,280
You want to partner up
with someone else?

1356
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,510
- What's with him?
- What's with him, seriously?

1357
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,370
- He can't even speak properly.
- Mister, what did you say?

1358
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,850
Didn't he say "Running Min?"

1359
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:04,850
(Seok Sam becomes less attractive
every time he opens his mouth.)

1360
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,990
- What is Running Min?
- Running Min.

1361
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,120
Running Min?

1362
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,950
Mister! Don't put your candy
in my box!

1363
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,350
I will never!

1364
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:13,490
I won't let you be
if you put yours in mine, old man.

1365
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:14,930
I won't!

1366
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:18,200
(Who will Suk Jin choose?)

1367
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:22,930
Should I surprise Jenny?

1368
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,640
(In which box
did Suk Jin put his candy?)

1369
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,800
- I'll...
- I almost went crazy there.

1370
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,780
- put it in here.
- Jeong Eui wasn't good at games.

1371
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,680
All right.
Everyone has made their decision.

1372
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,050
Female members,
please stand in front of your boxes.

1373
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,220
Come forward.

1374
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,950
Please open them
on the count of three.

1375
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:39,350
- Okay.
- One.

1376
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,510
I think Jenny got a lot.

1377
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:41,720
Two, three.

1378
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:44,120
(Opening their boxes)

1379
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,430
(Where did the male members'
candies go?)

1380
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,660
Why are there so many?

1381
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,300
I have one.

1382
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,600
- Yes!
- Why are there so many?

1383
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:52,530
Why did I get so many?

1384
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,030
Jenny is so popular.

1385
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,070
What happened?

1386
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,200
- Ji Hyo is in trouble.
- Why did I get so many?

1387
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,640
(Suk Jin chose Ah In.
Se Chan and So Bal chose Jenny.)

1388
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,100
(Haha chose Jeong Eui.)

1389
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,180
(Jong Kook chose Hee Jung.)

1390
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,140
- Wait. Who didn't get any?
- Why did...

1391
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,680
Yes!

1392
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,050
I knew it.

1393
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:09,450
Why did I get so many?

1394
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:10,580
Ji Hyo got none.

1395
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,620
(Ji Hyo got no candies,
so she got a penalty ball.)

1396
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,490
I knew So Min would betray me.

1397
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:15,890
- You're partners with Jong Kook.
- I let you go because I love you.

1398
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:19,280
So Jenny will receive
one more benefit.

1399
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,350
- Right.
- And you can choose...

1400
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:23,600
a member you like better.

1401
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,030
Gosh, this is...

1402
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,330
Jenny, those who love each other
look like each other.

1403
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,740
Look at our mouths.
This is clearly true love.

1404
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:31,910
He's right.

1405
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:33,430
(Staring intently)

1406
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,910
- You guys are practically married.
- Why don't you appeal yourselves?

1407
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,510
- You guys are practically married.
- Appeal yourselves.

1408
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,010
- Jenny.
- No, wait.

1409
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,220
So Bal, you're too cheesy. Get out.

1410
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,720
- Yes!
- Why?

1411
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,580
(Sad)

1412
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,910
You should stay next to Ji Hyo
and protect her.

1413
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:49,010
You're way too cheesy.

1414
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:50,930
- Ji Hyo, you should...
- So Bal and Ji Hyo are reunited.

1415
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:51,930
- How dare you ask...
- They're reunited!

1416
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:53,180
where my place is?

1417
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,220
Go to her!

1418
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,490
- Can't I reject her?
- How dare you ask...

1419
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:56,720
where my place is
at times like this?

1420
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,870
(Kneeling to apologize)

1421
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,990
(There you go.)

1422
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:03,600
- I hate gestures like that.
- I love you.

1423
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,970
I love you.

1424
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,100
(So Bal kneels all the time
to maintain her relationship.)

1425
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,010
- You're the only one I love.
- You might get beaten at this rate.

1426
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,830
- You might be beaten.
- You're good, So Bal.

1427
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:11,600
- You're the only one I love.
- So Bal is so smooth.

1428
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,950
- You're the only one I love.
- Forget it.

1429
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,470
I want to have a baby with you.

1430
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,580
Forget it!

1431
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,180
"I want to have a baby with you?"

1432
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,640
- She wants a baby?
- Let's move to have lunch.

1433
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,120
- Okay!
- Let's go!

1434
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,580
We're sitting with our partners?
All right.

1435
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,030
I have to sit with my partner?

1436
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,620
- You can sit here for now.
- Okay.

1437
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,430
- Or you can sit here.
- You became so polite.

1438
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:30,570
No, that's not it.

1439
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:31,720
(Se Chan has suddenly become polite
to Ah In.)

1440
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,870
He's become way too polite.

1441
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,760
So Min, you look exactly
like Princess Knight, right?

1442
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,470
Yes, I look exactly like her.

1443
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,470
There's an old animation
called "Princess Knight."

1444
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:39,910
- We have the exact same hairstyle.
- Yes, you do.

1445
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,740
And she wears princess' dresses too.

1446
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,140
Gosh, I want to
have braised pollack.

1447
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,580
- What did you say?
- Okay, Suk Jin.

1448
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,680
(He suddenly wants to have
braised pollack.)

1449
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,080
Okay, Suk Jin.
You can get off and have it.

1450
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,080
Go ahead, Suk Jin.

1451
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:50,740
(They tell Suk Jin to get off
as he wants braised pollack.)

1452
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,180
- Braised pollack...
- He's getting off!

1453
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,660
Please wait, sir!

1454
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:54,820
He's getting off for real.

1455
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,180
- Never mind.
- Suk Jin...

1456
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,830
- You're not having it, right?
- I'll have it when I get home.

1457
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,660
- Please hold, sir.
- I'll get it delivered at home.

1458
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,120
- Sir!
- He said he won't eat it.

1459
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,450
Please stop the bus.

1460
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:04,660
- Never mind, sir.
- Please stop.

1461
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,800
They're joking.

1462
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,200
Please get off, Suk Jin.

1463
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,800
He said we were joking.

1464
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,070
You can say whatever you want.

1465
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,640
- It's okay.
- You're our captain, after all.

1466
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,930
- He's right.
- Go ahead.

1467
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,680
Suk Jin, that's my water.

1468
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,910
- No, it's mine.
- I just had it.

1469
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:17,080
- No, I...
- I put it in here after I had it.

1470
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,870
- Really? I had it too.
- You should get off and have it.

1471
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,120
- Sir!
- He'll get off to have water.

1472
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:22,470
Good work today.

1473
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:25,010
- He actually stopped the bus.
- It's okay. I found mine.

1474
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,510
The bus set off again.

1475
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,050
All right.

1476
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,720
The guests didn't hesitate
to hit my head today.

1477
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,680
- I know. They hit really well.
- I was really surprised.

1478
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,350
- Because Ah In...
- She knows...

1479
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,220
because she's watched
our show a lot.

1480
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,970
- So she knows.
- Jeong Eui also hit very hard.

1481
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,200
- Jeong Eui hits hard.
- So she knows.

1482
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,330
- What was that?
- There you go.

1483
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,330
(Hey! Who was that?)

1484
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,870
- The thing is...
- You're smiling.

1485
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:47,930
It's Jenny.

1486
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:50,280
You're smiling. You can't fool me.

1487
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,010
- It wasn't me.
- Yes, it was.

1488
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,370
- It wasn't me.
- I'm sure it was you.

1489
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,780
- It wasn't me.
- It was me.

1490
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,390
(It was me.)

1491
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,890
- You didn't get me.
- You didn't get her.

1492
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:02,010
Was it really you?

1493
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,260
- It was really her.
- It was Hee Jung.

1494
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,780
You hit me so hard.

1495
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,530
- She can hit hard.
- It was Hee Jung.

1496
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:08,800
If you think about it,
what Hee Jung did was weird.

1497
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,700
Why did she suddenly hit him?

1498
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,120
- No, I...
- They told her to.

1499
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,300
- We've only met today.
- We told her to.

1500
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,330
Let it go, Suk Jin.

1501
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:15,990
- It's okay, Hee Jung.
- I was starving. I'm sorry.

1502
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:17,570
- It's okay.
- She said she gets sensitive.

1503
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:18,830
I'm so happy...

1504
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:20,870
- Since we love and trust you,
- that you're with us today.

1505
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:22,280
- we played with you.
- Of course.

1506
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,910
It's okay. You can hit my head
anytime you want today.

1507
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,280
This is what Running Min
is all about.

1508
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:28,450
It's Running Min.

1509
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:29,850
This is what Running Min
is all about.

1510
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,450
"Is there a spy among us?"

1511
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,990
- "A spy."
- "A spy."

1512
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,390
- "Find the spy."
- "A spy..."

1513
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:36,410
- "in Running Min."
- "Find him."

1514
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,490
There's no time
for Suk Jin to rest.

1515
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:42,330
This is why
he sometimes falls asleep.

1516
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,970
He passes out from exhaustion.

1517
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:47,330
Suk Jin, you can lean on my hand.
I'll support your head.

1518
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:49,890
- It's okay.
- I'll support your head.

1519
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,470
- He's the best.
- Hey.

1520
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,030
Stop it, everyone.
My fan is here today.

1521
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,510
- Who?
- My fan is here.

1522
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:56,780
- Oh, right.
- So stop it.

1523
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,300
- Oh, Ah In?
- We must help save his face.

1524
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,550
Since his fan is here...

1525
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:02,640
He's become really polite.

1526
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,410
- Of course.
- Because I didn't know her age.

1527
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:06,990
I'm usually polite.
I thought you were younger than me.

1528
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:08,910
Didn't you go through
something similar before?

1529
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:10,930
- Right, he did.
- That guy from Germany.

1530
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:12,450
- What?
- Who was that guy again?

1531
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,950
- It was Yoo Teo.
- Right. It was Teo.

1532
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:15,950
I was like, "How old are you again?"

1533
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,600
He said he was 40.
So I apologized right away.

1534
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,390
(He apologized right away.)

1535
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,370
(Teo, who was born in 1981,
visited Running Man as a guest.)

1536
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:23,530
(Teo.)

1537
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:25,410
(How old are you, Teo?)

1538
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:26,470
(I'm 40.)

1539
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,030
(I'm sorry.)

1540
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:31,100
(Se Chan was rude to Teo
who was 5 years older than him.)

1541
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,910
(And to Yeon Hee who visited
on the same day...)

1542
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,280
(How old are you, Yeon Hee?)

1543
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,350
(I was born in 1988.)

1544
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:37,580
Yeon Hee is younger than us.

1545
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:40,850
(He treated Yeon Hee
as someone older.)

1546
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:43,320
(You talk casually to those
who are older than you.)

1547
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,030
(He made many mistakes
to the guests that day.)

1548
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:47,350
But Ah In
seemed younger than Se Chan.

1549
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:49,350
- You make so many mistakes.
- I know.

1550
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:50,720
It's because they all look young.

1551
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,200
He was only trying to be nice.

1552
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,870
Captain Ji prepared
a Korean food buffet.

1553
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,760
- It sounds delicious.
- Thank you.

1554
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,260
- Thank you!
- Did he pay with his own money?

1555
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,280
No, we used our money.

1556
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,410
- That's too bad.
- Of course they should.

1557
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,140
You should treat us with your money
since you're a captain.

1558
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,300
- That's...
- Suk Jin would never do that.

1559
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,410
- That'd be too much.
- But I bet...

1560
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:08,470
- he prepared candies, at least.
- He's not that considerate.

1561
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:10,180
- I bet he prepared candies.
- Right.

1562
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,140
- Why are you eating so much today?
- That'd be going overboard.

1563
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,580
- You're eating so many candies.
- Why are you eating so much?

1564
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,280
Jeong Eui, I'm addicted to this.

1565
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:17,780
He's had 30 of them already.

1566
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,680
- I can't stop eating it.
- His hands...

1567
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,950
- His hands are shaking.
- He's so strange.

1568
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:22,220
How many is he having?

1569
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,890
- You said you don't like sweets.
- He's become strange.

1570
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,120
But this is so addictive.

1571
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,100
Everyone, after we get there,
and while having lunch,

1572
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,160
a mafia will carry out
their hidden mission.

1573
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,700
(There's a hidden mission
for the mafia.)

1574
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,260
(The mafia will carry out
their mission during lunch?)

1575
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,830
- What?
- There's a mafia among us?

1576
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:35,870
No, we'll decide
who'll become the mafia.

1577
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:37,240
- What?
- We'll decide now.

1578
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:40,280
You'll get off one by one,

1579
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,820
and a couple will become mafias
through drawing lots.

1580
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:45,990
And the mafias must carry out
their mission during lunch.

1581
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,660
- I see.
- The rest of you must catch them.

1582
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,410
- They'll be caught for sure.
- They will be.

1583
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:52,120
If I become the mafia...
My hands will shake...

1584
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,890
- if Jong Kook looks at me.
- I know.

1585
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:56,050
"Oh, it's you?"

1586
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:59,070
Let me tell you in advance.
I'll be doing strange things.

1587
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:00,660
- Me too.
- I'll be doing strange things.

1588
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,870
Why? We have to guess
who the mafias are.

1589
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:03,260
Mafias are usually at ease.

1590
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:04,910
They'll pretend to be on purpose.

1591
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:06,570
All right.

1592
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:09,200
- Let's do it.
- Something smells delicious.

1593
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,780
Please...

1594
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:14,180
It won't be easy to carry out
the mission during lunch.

1595
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,350
I have done it before.

1596
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,410
So we're a team, right?

1597
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:17,740
- Yes, you are.
- That's right.

1598
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,120
- You'll pick 1 out of 5 cards.
- Which one should we pick?

1599
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,390
(There's only one card
that says mafia.)

1600
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:23,760
- Go ahead.
- This one?

1601
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,220
Just don't pick
the mafia card. Please.

1602
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,260
(Which card did Jeong Eui pick?)

1603
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,330
All right!

1604
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,390
- We're civilians.
- Let's eat at ease.

1605
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:34,660
- Ji Hyo and So Bal.
- Yes.

1606
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,700
"So Bal?"

1607
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,100
There are four cards here.

1608
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,740
(Civilian)

1609
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,780
That's a relief.

1610
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,010
(Ji Hyo and So Bal
are civilians as well.)

1611
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,240
(Unlike the two who are relieved
after picking the civilian card...)

1612
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,240
- You want to be a mafia?
- Yes, I do.

1613
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:48,870
I wish I could be a mafia.

1614
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,780
She wants to be a mafia,
but I don't.

1615
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,990
I wish I could be a mafia.

1616
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:53,280
- Please pick one.
- One of the two?

1617
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,120
(There are three cards left.)

1618
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,660
- One of the two? One of the three?
- Among these three.

1619
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:58,680
- You should pick it.
- Me?

1620
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,720
Yes.

1621
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,600
(Will Ah In become a mafia
as she wished?)

1622
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,660
We're civilians.

1623
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,120
Do we bring it with us?

1624
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,700
(Sadly, Suk Jin and Ah In
became civilians.)

1625
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,530
- We have to pick one?
- This is...

1626
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,830
(Jenny picked one boldly
as soon as he came in.)

1627
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,370
(They picked the mafia card.)

1628
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:17,050
- What?
- You are...

1629
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,370
Why did you pick this?

1630
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,050
Today's mission is very simple.

1631
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:25,120
You'll be having
a Korean food buffet.

1632
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,410
- Everyone will be given a plate.
- Okay.

1633
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:31,120
If one has food on their plate,

1634
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,120
the other one can't put food
on his plate.

1635
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:34,490
- What does that mean?
- What does that mean?

1636
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:37,430
It means you can't have food
on your plates at the same time.

1637
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:38,530
Even just a little.

1638
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,220
(They can't have food
on their plates at the same time.)

1639
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,570
It's similar to the mission
where one had to remain standing.

1640
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,830
- It's the worst.
- It is.

1641
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:46,510
- Don't eat a lot.
- Okay.

1642
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:47,510
- Let's just eat a little.
- Let's eat little by little.

1643
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:48,780
- You'll have to eat lightly today.
- Got it.

1644
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,010
Cup noodles are considered one too.

1645
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,280
- Okay.
- Okay.

1646
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:52,510
Got it.

1647
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:53,510
- Do we start right away?
- Yes.

1648
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,580
- Do we go up here?
- The rest are up there.

1649
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,680
It sounds fun.

1650
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:58,230
She looks relaxed.

1651
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,160
- So Bal.
- Yes?

1652
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,770
- Are you fixing your hair?
- Yes.

1653
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,770
You don't even wash your hair?

1654
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,540
Don't people wash their hair
once a week?

1655
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,560
- So Min.
- Gosh.

1656
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,810
What kind of man behaves like this?

1657
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,870
No one does this.

1658
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,180
Who does that?

1659
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,710
- What are you, a thug?
- Can you make it more natural?

1660
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:16,210
Men don't act that way.

1661
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:17,210
(While So Bal
is acting like a thug...)

1662
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:18,290
Jenny.

1663
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,620
Jenny?

1664
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,080
What?

1665
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,480
- There are only three seats.
- You weren't doing anything?

1666
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,750
- There are three.
- We were.

1667
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,830
- Are you the mafia?
- What did you do?

1668
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,250
Jenny, sit here.

1669
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,160
Suk Jin is crossing his arms.
This must be it.

1670
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,160
- Yes.
- I see.

1671
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:33,000
All right.

1672
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,540
- It's started.
- Mafia.

1673
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,730
- Jong Kook.
- Come sit here.

1674
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:37,410
Let's see if anyone
is behaving strangely.

1675
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,960
You're crossing your arms.

1676
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,180
- Let me see your faces.
- You're crossing your arms.

1677
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,870
- Is anyone acting strange?
- Let me scan your faces.

1678
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:46,270
(He starts scanning them
as soon as he enters.)

1679
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:47,980
- Is anyone acting strange?
- Let me scan your faces.

1680
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:48,980
All right.

1681
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,290
- You're not the type to cross arms.
- All right.

1682
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:52,350
Great.

1683
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:55,210
Jae Suk didn't even look at me once
and kept looking away...

1684
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:56,560
when I came in.

1685
00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:00,080
(Viper picked out the mafias
as soon as it began.)

1686
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,200
(Will they be able to get away
from Viper?)

1687
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,460
- All right.
- Everyone,

1688
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,430
we'll bring in the buffet
that Captain Ji requested.

1689
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:08,200
- Yes!
- All right!

1690
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,460
Everyone, I insisted on
having this today.

1691
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,460
Please give me a round of applause.

1692
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,180
- All right. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1693
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,270
You look so happy.

1694
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:17,080
There are cup noodles too.

1695
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,370
Those are my favorite.

1696
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:19,850
There's pork cutlet too.

1697
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:21,270
Braised spicy chicken.

1698
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:22,410
There's fried rice as well.

1699
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,180
- Wow, this is...
- There are noodles too.

1700
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,480
(I should have this with noodles.)

1701
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,580
- This is octopus.
- I should have this with noodles.

1702
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:29,660
I'll have fried rice.

1703
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,250
(Laughing)

1704
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:32,660
- Pork cutlets are...
- This is...

1705
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,560
- What is it?
- Is it good?

1706
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,200
You should just eat comfortably.
They're the mafias.

1707
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,430
- Who?
- This team.

1708
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:39,520
- Team Red.
- Why do you think it's us?

1709
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,870
- Just eat comfortably.
- Why did he pick us?

1710
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:41,890
He's at it again.

1711
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:43,370
- He's at it again.
- Just eat comfortably.

1712
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:44,640
- Thank you.
- Jong Kook.

1713
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,160
- We don't even have to see it.
- It's them?

1714
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,830
It'll be too unfair if we pick them
after seeing their behavior.

1715
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:49,930
- So I'll just...
- It's them?

1716
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,270
pick them as mafias
from the beginning.

1717
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,680
He's at it again.

1718
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,770
- But...
- How frustrating.

1719
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:57,580
Strangely,
his hunches are always right.

1720
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,450
- I should just eat comfortably.
- Yes, go ahead.

1721
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:01,080
- Let's eat.
- Thank you for the food.

1722
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,210
- Mafias, just enjoy your meal.
- Thank you for the food.

1723
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,850
- I'll start with noodles.
- All right.

1724
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:05,930
We think...

1725
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,060
- those two are behaving strangely.
- I want noodles too.

1726
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,960
Or it could be them.
Haha is being strange too.

1727
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,060
- I'll have noodles.
- There's a drumstick.

1728
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,770
Haha is being strange too.

1729
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:15,700
(Jae Suk can't put food
on his plate.)

1730
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,460
Should I have tteokbokki?
Gosh, this is...

1731
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,960
Wait. Should I have ramyeon?

1732
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,210
(He moves to the corner
while grumbling.)

1733
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,480
- Why did you spill it?
- I'm a civilian for sure.

1734
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,580
Gosh, this is...

1735
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,580
- Let's have this.
- Who eats so loudly?

1736
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,270
- It looks like...
- Thank you for the food.

1737
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:33,890
Se Chan and Jae Suk
are moving separately.

1738
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,580
I'm just boiling hot water
for cup noodles.

1739
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:39,060
I have to boil the water first.

1740
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:40,500
I was so hungry.

1741
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,960
I can't even speak.

1742
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,960
(Se Chan began his own feast.)

1743
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,000
Can I have some of the noodles
you mixed?

1744
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,330
Why are you eating mine?

1745
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:49,890
(So Bal's unexpected move)

1746
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:51,830
- Eating someone's food.
- It's because he took a lot.

1747
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:53,870
- Look at that.
- That's strange.

1748
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:55,680
- Why are you suddenly eating his?
- You're eating Se Chan's food.

1749
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,270
But there are noodles
in front of you.

1750
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:58,770
Because he took a lot.

1751
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,080
(So Bal helps the mafias
by stealing Se Chan's noodles.)

1752
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,980
So Min, I'm sorry,
but we all have to catch the mafias.

1753
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,790
You shouldn't confuse others.

1754
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:08,120
- I didn't intend to.
- Your action... That was strange.

1755
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,120
(Thanks to So Min,
Jong Kook is paying less attention.)

1756
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:10,960
So Min took someone else's food?

1757
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,460
I love noodles.

1758
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:19,200
(He can't have the noodles
when it's right in front of him.)

1759
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,060
You should mix noodles
with seasoned octopus.

1760
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,100
Right?

1761
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:24,270
Hey, finish your food already.

1762
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,100
(Let me eat some food too.)

1763
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,980
"Finish your food"? That's strange.
Why is he rushing him?

1764
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,020
- He has to finish it first?
- You should finish it already.

1765
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:35,350
What's going on?

1766
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,450
- There's rice here.
- Really?

1767
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:39,480
(While Se Chan is shoving noodles
in his mouth,)

1768
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,560
This looks so good.

1769
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,680
(Jae Suk
just goes through noodles.)

1770
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,830
I should mix seasoned octopus
with this.

1771
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:46,830
Who are you talking to, Jae Suk?

1772
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:48,120
I'm talking to myself.

1773
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:53,160
(Meanwhile,
Se Chan finally emptied his plate.)

1774
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:55,430
You must watch carefully
what other teams are doing.

1775
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:57,870
(As soon as Se Chan
emptied his plate,)

1776
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:00,270
(Jae Suk fills his plate
with food.)

1777
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:03,480
This looks really good.
It looks incredible.

1778
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,040
See if the water is boiled.

1779
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,120
Jae Suk and Se Chan...

1780
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,580
are having noodles.

1781
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,480
- This is...
- The noodles are really good.

1782
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,890
- I just love noodles.
- This is...

1783
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,020
- This is...
- Jong Kook, I just love noodles.

1784
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,680
- Stealing others' food.
- It's really good, right?

1785
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:21,350
But... Hey.

1786
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:24,560
It's as if Jong Kook
is on a stakeout.

1787
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,160
(Detective Kim's stakeout)

1788
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,330
What?

1789
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:29,060
He was doing this while eating.

1790
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:33,000
(His eyes were fixed on the suspects
as he ate.)

1791
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:35,580
Detective Kim Nipple,
you're amazing.

1792
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,580
You're amazing,
Detective Kim Nipple.

1793
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,640
(Even his nipples are glaring
at the suspects.)

1794
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,850
Are you going to have that?

1795
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,120
No, I'm good.

1796
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:43,210
- Then you should...
- It's okay. You can have it.

1797
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,710
(Se Chan stalls for time
in the corner while Jae Suk eats.)

1798
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:47,080
I think this is Jae Suk's.

1799
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,020
- Can I have Coke?
- Of course you can.

1800
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,020
(In the meantime,
Jae Suk emptied his plate.)

1801
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,480
This is just so good.

1802
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,680
(Se Chan saw that Jae Suk
emptied his plate.)

1803
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,060
This is...
There's no webfoot octopus here?

1804
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,200
- Right.
- It's so natural.

1805
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,560
(Right then, Jae Suk reached out
to get more food.)

1806
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,140
- Do you need anything, Ah In?
- No, it's okay.

1807
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,660
The pork cutlet is really good.

1808
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,100
The old-style pork cutlet.

1809
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,430
- The pork cutlet...
- Yes, the old-style pork cutlet.

1810
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:08,730
is light and nice.

1811
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,810
Let me try some of tteokbokki.

1812
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:17,390
(Adding tteokbokki
on top of pork cutlet)

1813
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,890
- Aren't you eating too much?
- Sorry?

1814
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:24,080
- Aren't you eating too much?
- No.

1815
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,160
You have three more minutes.

1816
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,120
You can have your meal comfortably
for three more minutes.

1817
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:32,770
(The civilians keep a close watch
as there's not much time left.)

1818
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,370
Isn't he acting awkward?

1819
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:35,660
(Jenny, who even got tteokbokki,)

1820
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:38,460
(starts having cup noodles.)

1821
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,500
The chopsticks. My gosh.

1822
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:43,710
Where's each team sitting?
Two here and two there.

1823
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:45,580
The pork cutlet is so good!

1824
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,310
Maybe the mission is
to sit together...

1825
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:50,710
and never get up.

1826
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:52,620
Why don't we try getting up?

1827
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:53,980
This is so good.

1828
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,290
- How about we try...
- We can all try getting up now.

1829
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:58,430
- I did get up earlier.
- Haha did get up earlier.

1830
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,250
(Hold on...)

1831
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:04,460
Are you done already?

1832
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,460
(Are you done already?)

1833
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:07,870
(Flustered)

1834
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:09,230
- I am going to eat more.
- Are you done?

1835
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:10,540
- Why aren't you eating?
- Why aren't you eating?

1836
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,160
- He hasn't eaten much.
- Why aren't you eating?

1837
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,270
Why aren't you eating?

1838
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:15,830
Haha, you have done this before.

1839
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,450
Don't be so cruel.

1840
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:20,000
- Why aren't you eating?
- He hasn't said much either.

1841
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:22,850
- I am going to eat more.
- Are you waiting for Jae Suk?

1842
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,310
- Who?
- Can you eat...

1843
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,980
only when Jae Suk isn't eating?

1844
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,210
(Can you eat
only when Jae Suk isn't eating?)

1845
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:30,960
- It's not like that.
- That must be it.

1846
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:34,200
That must be it.

1847
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,830
I saw him pick up Coca-Cola earlier.

1848
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,500
He looked at Jae Suk...

1849
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,460
and pretended to drink
until Jae Suk was done chewing.

1850
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,040
- It's not like that.
- Eat something.

1851
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,270
- When Jae Suk...
- I can eat.

1852
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:44,430
- It doesn't matter.
- Eat something.

1853
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:45,710
- Eat at the same time.
- It doesn't matter.

1854
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,830
- It's strange.
- His plate is empty.

1855
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,040
Besides...

1856
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:52,980
He can't eat
because Jae Suk is eating.

1857
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,080
I can eat.

1858
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,120
- That's not true.
- Try kimchi.

1859
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:57,450
I ate kimchi earlier.

1860
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,480
Did you eat everything earlier?

1861
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,120
- Aren't you going to eat more?
- I am.

1862
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,960
- Why aren't you eating?
- Are you going to eat or not?

1863
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,120
I am thinking.

1864
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,930
Se Chan loves to eat food,
but his plate...

1865
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:10,230
- Lunchtime is over.
- Already?

1866
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:13,060
It's time to apprehend
the mafia members.

1867
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:16,000
- Jae Suk and Se Chan.
- Us?

1868
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,810
Se Chan and Jae Suk.

1869
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:19,930
Se Chan and Jenny.

1870
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,710
Se Chan behaved so strangely.

1871
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:22,910
Se Chan.

1872
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,620
With four votes, Se Chan and Jenny
became the candidates.

1873
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:29,040
The mafia members are...

1874
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:30,750
Jenny and Se Chan.

1875
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:31,890
We were right.

1876
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:33,680
We aren't mafia members.

1877
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,910
We were right.

1878
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:36,660
- It was so obvious.
- Are you guys mafia members?

1879
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:38,680
Why did you get so much food?

1880
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:41,100
Were you starved?

1881
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,960
If one member had food on his plate,

1882
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,270
the other member couldn't eat.

1883
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:46,890
The mission was too difficult.

1884
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:49,390
He got both tonkatsu and tteokbokki
on his plate.

1885
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,370
Why did you get young radish kimchi?
You didn't even eat it.

1886
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:54,980
I looked suspicious
because my plate was empty.

1887
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,270
- That's right. You didn't eat much.
- But these are my favorite dishes.

1888
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,040
- These are my favorite dishes.
- You failed from the start.

1889
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,180
As soon as Jong Kook entered,
he looked at Jae Suk and said,

1890
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:03,480
- "Oh."
- "Oh."

1891
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,520
"Guys, you can relax and eat."

1892
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,750
- You know...
- "It's Jenny."

1893
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,160
It wasn't just Jae Suk.
Se Chan's face was rigid too.

1894
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,620
The moment Jong Kook did that,
the production crew went...

1895
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:11,750
They couldn't eat in peace.

1896
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:12,890
(Sighing)

1897
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:15,560
You saw
how quiet they became, right?

1898
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:18,330
The two of you will receive
a disadvantage at the end.

1899
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:20,370
Other teams will receive a benefit.

1900
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:22,730
However, one team will be excluded.

1901
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,660
- Jenny and Se Chan can choose.
- Really?

1902
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,730
One team won't receive a benefit.

1903
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:28,370
- In that case...
- Yes.

1904
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,140
Our decision is obvious.

1905
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:31,810
Yes. Jong Kook and...

1906
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:32,980
What?

1907
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:35,210
(Jong Kook gets punished
for making them suffocate.)

1908
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,350
Of course.

1909
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:37,520
Hear me out for a second.

1910
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,540
Did I pressure you
while you were eating?

1911
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,580
- You did that from the start.
- Listen.

1912
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:42,620
- Jong Kook.
- No, I didn't.

1913
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:44,160
- I simply shared my opinion.
- Listen.

1914
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,460
I told you to relax and eat.

1915
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:46,980
"Jae Suk didn't look at me."

1916
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:50,390
Then we sat down, right?

1917
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,560
"All right. Relax and eat."

1918
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:54,700
"The answer is given."

1919
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:55,960
(The answer is given.)

1920
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,000
- It wasn't like that.
- You pressured us, okay?

1921
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,830
Who made you uncomfortable
while you ate?

1922
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:02,370
- It was Haha.
- Haha.

1923
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:03,870
- But Haha.
- To be honest,

1924
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:05,640
it was Jong Kook's accusation...

1925
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,140
- that drove me to that extent.
- That's right.

1926
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,270
That little...

1927
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,040
Jong Kook was so certain.

1928
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,950
That's ridiculous.
I only said one thing.

1929
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:16,060
Since their opinions are divided,

1930
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,290
we will choose Suk Jin and...

1931
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:18,660
- Why?
- Hold on.

1932
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,960
(Suk Jin receives the shocking news
while eating.)

1933
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,160
Hold on.

1934
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:23,730
- Isn't that the solution?
- Yes.

1935
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:26,500
- Both of them feel victimized,
- That's right.

1936
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:29,200
- so we can't choose them.
- That's right. I didn't do much.

1937
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:32,330
Isn't that right, Se Chan?
Both of them feel victimized.

1938
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:34,370
- They feel victimized? Hey.
- No way.

1939
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,770
You punk.

1940
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,430
- Do you want a scalding?
- "You punk."

1941
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:40,080
- Do you want a scalding?
- "You punk."

1942
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,080
(He meant to say "Scolding".)

1943
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:43,750
- He wasn't scary at all.
- He can't speak.

1944
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,480
"Do you want a scalding?"
What are you talking about?

1945
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:47,040
"You punk."

1946
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:48,560
"Do you want a scalding?"

1947
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,410
Otherwise, we could pick Ji Hyo...

1948
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:52,250
- and So Min.
- Why?

1949
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:53,430
- That's right.
- Come on, Jae Suk.

1950
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:55,200
- If you remember,
- Come on, Jae Suk.

1951
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,620
So Min did something strange
to show that she is a civilian.

1952
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:00,960
I simply did that
since he had a lot of noodles.

1953
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,140
After you finish your meal,
we will meet at the last location.

1954
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,330
Okay.

1955
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,230
It's men's last chance to pick
a woman who will get the candy.

1956
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,040
- She needs someone who can...
- Why would I change my pick?

1957
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,850
(They deliver their candies
to the women they like.)

1958
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:15,770
Whom should I pick?

1959
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:17,480
(It's So Bal's turn.)

1960
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:23,060
(With her injured leg,
she ponders in a cool way.)

1961
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,180
What should I do?

1962
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:25,520
Whom should I pick?

1963
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,730
(Whom should I pick?)

1964
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:29,730
(Sighing)

1965
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:30,830
(Whom will So Bal pick?)

1966
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:31,960
For goodness' sake.

1967
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:34,270
- Hurry over here, So Bal.
- Hey.

1968
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:35,330
Run over here.

1969
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:36,730
- You are the youngest one.
- Hey.

1970
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,640
- Listen.
- Don't do it.

1971
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:40,160
- So Bal needs to get beaten up.
- What?

1972
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:41,730
- So Bal needs to get beaten up.
- What?

1973
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:42,870
What was that?

1974
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:44,750
- Hey.
- Stand up straight.

1975
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,600
- Stand up straight.
- What are those fashionable shoes?

1976
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,270
- Fashionable shoes.
- Mister.

1977
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:49,810
- "Mister?"
- "Mister?"

1978
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,080
Who do you think you are?

1979
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,580
Look at this.
So Bal is uncontrollable.

1980
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,310
- So Bal is uncontrollable.
- You little...

1981
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:56,980
Not even my dad scolds me.
Who do you think you are?

1982
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,180
(Spitting)

1983
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:00,080
(Laughing)

1984
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,830
- He is happy.
- He is happy.

1985
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:03,960
- He is happy.
- You are cute.

1986
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:07,020
That came out of nowhere.
"You are cute."

1987
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,500
All right, everyone.

1988
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,410
- The gentlemen put in the candies.
- Really?

1989
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:13,410
One, two, three.

1990
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:15,080
For goodness' sake.

1991
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,180
(Hee Jung and Jeong Eui: 2 candies
Ji Hyo: 1 candy)

1992
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,210
Come on.

1993
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:18,540
- What?
- There's a new guy.

1994
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:19,910
- You are so mean.
- Ah In, I had my reasons.

1995
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:21,310
- What?
- Ah In.

1996
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:22,910
- You are so mean.
- Ah In, I had my reasons.

1997
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,290
I wanted you to try having
another member...

1998
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:26,850
- as a partner.
- But there are no candies.

1999
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:29,660
They must be happy.

2000
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:32,160
Hee Jung and Jeong Eui
received two votes each.

2001
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:34,830
Jenny and Ah In
will receive a penalty ball.

2002
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,250
Let's start with Hee Jung.

2003
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,520
I thought I could become the best...

2004
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,120
by stealing Jong Kook's woman.

2005
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,330
Get your hands out of the pockets.

2006
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:44,330
- Hey.
- Don't be so arrogant.

2007
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,210
Don't be smug
just because you are handsome.

2008
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:48,000
If you are handsome, act like it.

2009
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,100
- It's so hard to choose one.
- Put it down.

2010
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,600
You won't see them again
after this game.

2011
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:55,080
- You won't see them again.
- Jenny.

2012
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,180
Seriously.

2013
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:57,310
(Jenny speaks her mind.)

2014
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,620
- In that case...
- Good idea.

2015
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:00,020
So Bal is out.

2016
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:02,250
- I am sorry.
- That taught you right.

2017
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:03,560
- Hey.
- My goodness.

2018
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,120
This is how life is.

2019
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,460
You got rejected.

2020
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:08,100
Get lost, you punk.

2021
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,390
Jeong Eui rejected Haha.

2022
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,660
- Jeong Eui rejected Haha.
- Jeong Eui chose Se Chan.

2023
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:13,830
- Okay.
- Did she reject me?

2024
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,330
Hey, come here.

2025
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:18,310
- Little one, come here.
- You got rejected too, Octopus.

2026
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:20,540
- Octopus.
- You didn't even think.

2027
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,040
We agreed to be cool about it.

2028
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,810
- All right.
- Be cool about it.

2029
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:26,680
Ah In, choose the man you want.

2030
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,870
I am confident.

2031
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:31,980
That's good.

2032
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,850
- Okay.
- That's good.

2033
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:35,680
- Octopus.
- Team "How Do You Play?"

2034
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,410
- Octopus, come here.
- Team "How Do You Play?"

2035
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:39,080
- Let's go.
- Team "How Do You Play?"

2036
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:41,120
They shouldn't be together.

2037
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,500
- Are they Team "How Do You Play?"
- Okay. I have the same partner.

2038
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,330
- What is this?
- There are circular saws.

2039
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:47,560
Things will get cut off.

2040
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,640
- No way.
- Look. There are circular saws.

2041
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:52,100
- Things will get cut off.
- Things will get cut off.

2042
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:53,500
- I see.
- This is scary.

2043
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:54,640
Things will get cut off today.

2044
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:57,000
All right, everyone.
The two of you are attached.

2045
01:05:57,850 --> 01:05:59,410
Ah In, he is handsome.

2046
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,910
- He is my boyfriend.
- She cares about a man's looks.

2047
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,520
Here comes the last mission.

2048
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,480
Ji Hyo and Suk Jin...

2049
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:07,620
don't even look at each other.

2050
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:09,810
- They aren't close.
- We have done that for 13 years.

2051
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:12,080
- We are a family.
- That's right.

2052
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,430
Here comes the last mission.

2053
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,160
If you fail to get the answer,

2054
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,890
you could fall from the tree
and get a heart attack.

2055
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,160
- It's the Heart Attack Quiz.
- It's a quiz.

2056
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,200
Heart Attack Quiz.

2057
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,330
- Is it a quiz?
- Is it a quiz?

2058
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:22,640
Okay.

2059
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,640
- We are a good team.
- So Min.

2060
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,370
You aren't So Min. Ji Hyo.

2061
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:28,410
- Is it a quiz?
- I am bad at it.

2062
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:30,040
I am Empty Head.

2063
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,810
I am stupid.

2064
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:35,020
Jenny was the king
of "Janghak Quiz."

2065
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,980
Each match will be
between two teams.

2066
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:39,850
Two people will sit
on the wooden board.

2067
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,210
Two people.

2068
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:43,850
And these are...

2069
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:48,060
the names of the viewers
who love Running Man.

2070
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:49,250
- Really?
- Yes.

2071
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:53,020
They sent us
their information and questions.

2072
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,230
- My goodness.
- Thus,

2073
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:58,310
the viewers are
of various age groups...

2074
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:00,410
from a kindergartener
to an office worker.

2075
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:02,730
The team that has a priority...

2076
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:04,270
- will pick a name.
- Okay.

2077
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,500
Then you will check the information
that comes with the name.

2078
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:09,750
- The board consists of 20 sections.
- Okay.

2079
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,580
You will decide how many sections
you want to bet on a question.

2080
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:14,580
- That's right.
- We will bet sections.

2081
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:17,250
You will receive the question
afterward.

2082
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:20,660
The opposing team will lose sections
if you answer it correctly.

2083
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:22,160
The match ends
if your board collapses.

2084
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,560
- Okay.
- All right.

2085
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,230
The difficulty levels differ,
so choose the question well.

2086
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:29,290
- Okay.
- You need to choose the name well.

2087
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:32,370
You can guess the age from the name.

2088
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:33,910
Ye Eun would be a good choice.

2089
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:35,730
I don't know anyone
named Saet Byeol.

2090
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:37,730
My friends are named Eun Sook,

2091
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:39,500
- Mi Young...
- That's right.

2092
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,640
- Eun Jeong.
- Eun Ja.

2093
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,770
Gyeong Nam would belong
to someone old.

2094
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:45,180
Other teams can sit down.

2095
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:47,620
- Team 2 and Team 3, wear a helmet.
- Are we going first?

2096
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

2097
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,350
- This is scary.
- You know,

2098
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:55,230
it's really scary
even though the height isn't great.

2099
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:57,060
Which team wants to go first?

2100
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:59,600
- That team will go first.
- In that case...

2101
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,620
- I am nervous.
- What?

2102
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:01,640
Go first.

2103
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,330
- Why?
- It's better to go first.

2104
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:04,730
- Really?
- Okay.

2105
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:06,870
- We will go first.
- You can't take it back.

2106
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,980
Pick a name of your choice.

2107
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,500
- All right.
- Pick one.

2108
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,950
(Which name
would give them an advantage?)

2109
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:17,020
- Which one do you want?
- Kim Jong Kook.

2110
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:18,180
- How about Kim Jong Kook?
- Kim Jong Kook?

2111
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:19,390
- Kim Jong Kook?
- Yes.

2112
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:21,250
It must be hard
to live with that name.

2113
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,750
Kim Gook Jong?

2114
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:23,750
It must be hard
to live with that name.

2115
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:24,850
A 27-year-old.

2116
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:29,960
- A senior economy major.
- S University.

2117
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:31,470
- No.
- It will be difficult.

2118
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:32,720
The question will be difficult.

2119
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,170
- It will be difficult.
- Suk Jin.

2120
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:36,430
- Did you major in management?
- Yes, I did.

2121
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:37,670
An economy-related question
would be nice.

2122
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:39,410
I don't know much about the economy.
Suk Jin would know.

2123
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:41,230
- It would be nice.
- I don't know anything.

2124
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:43,130
You have a priority on the question.

2125
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:45,170
Decide how many sections
you want to bet.

2126
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:47,770
- Bet five sections.
- A man named Kim Jong Kook...

2127
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:49,340
- should do sports.
- How many sections?

2128
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,380
(Jong Kook can't allow
such a thing.)

2129
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:51,880
- How many are there?
- How many sections should we bet?

2130
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,120
- About...
- Two?

2131
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,260
Since he is an economics major,
we shouldn't bet many sections.

2132
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:58,090
Suk Jin invests in stocks.

2133
01:08:58,090 --> 01:08:59,550
- I was a management major.
- He knows a lot about the field.

2134
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:01,330
- Shall we bet one section?
- Let's do that.

2135
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,200
- Come on.
- The number is too small.

2136
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,220
(The number is too small.)

2137
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,170
Suk Jin knows a lot
about the economy.

2138
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:08,000
- Bet three sections.
- Come on.

2139
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,800
He is...
Then we will bet two sections.

2140
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,870
- Two sections.
- Yes.

2141
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:12,710
For goodness' sake.

2142
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:14,410
Bet four or more sections.

2143
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,410
Bet four or more sections.

2144
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:18,100
He is glaring at me.

2145
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,580
- Why did I go last?
- You went last.

2146
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,670
Why did I go last?
Why did you stop saying something?

2147
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:23,970
Why would you bet 2 sections?
Bet 3 sections.

2148
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:25,250
- Leave us be.
- All right.

2149
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:27,220
- The difficulty level will be high.
- Here comes the question.

2150
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:28,310
Let's see.

2151
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:30,760
This question was submitted
by Kim Jong Kook.

2152
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,830
What's a management technique...

2153
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:38,300
which involves consigning a task
to a third party?

2154
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,020
What?

2155
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:42,230
- What's a management technique...
- I don't know.

2156
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:45,510
which involves consigning a task
to a third party?

2157
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:47,600
- A management technique?
- Yes.

2158
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,010
- To a third party?
- A management technique.

2159
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:50,040
(Kim Jong Kook)

2160
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,340
- Puppet boss.
- Third-party act.

2161
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:54,270
- Puppet boss.
- CFO.

2162
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,950
Tell us this much.
Is the answer Korean or English?

2163
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,790
It's English.

2164
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:01,460
- English.
- Is it English?

2165
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:02,960
- Agency.
- What was the question again?

2166
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,300
It involves giving a task
to another company.

2167
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:10,090
- You must have heard it often.
- I know.

2168
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:11,870
- What is it?
- I know.

2169
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:14,370
- Is it a proverb?
- Whatever TV.

2170
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,470
- Is it a proverb?
- Whatever TV.

2171
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:18,510
(Whatever TV?)

2172
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:20,840
You are in trouble.

2173
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:22,580
- You are in trouble.
- What will you do?

2174
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:24,410
You are in trouble.
What will you do?

2175
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:25,750
Giving a task to a third party.

2176
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:28,010
- Yes.
- A third party. English.

2177
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:29,120
(He pretends to know the answer.)

2178
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:31,790
- How could you not know it?
- Suk Jin would know the answer.

2179
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:32,880
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2180
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:33,920
Consulting.

2181
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,760
- Come on.
- Consulting is incorrect.

2182
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,310
- This is...
- It has three syllables.

2183
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:38,550
- Three syllables?
- That's right.

2184
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:39,760
And it's English?

2185
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,660
- Yes.
- Puppet boss.

2186
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:42,850
Maximus?

2187
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:45,060
- Three syllables?
- Puppet boss.

2188
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:46,390
- Puppet boss.
- Puppet boss.

2189
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:47,670
Puppet boss.

2190
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:48,870
(He says "Puppet boss" is
a management technique.)

2191
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,200
You will recognize
it when you hear it.

2192
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,100
- We will recognize it.
- This is driving me crazy.

2193
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,340
Would you give me a letter?

2194
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:55,510
Can I give them a hint?

2195
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:57,170
- Give us a letter.
- You gave them many hints.

2196
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,880
The answer has
three syllables, right?

2197
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,550
- I will give you the first one.
- A letter.

2198
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,620
(His gesture gives them
the first syllable.)

2199
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:06,790
- What is that?
- Let's go.

2200
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:08,420
It's a crucial hint.

2201
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:09,980
What?

2202
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:11,290
Let's go.

2203
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:14,720
(He even mouths the word.)

2204
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,220
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2205
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:18,630
(Suk Jin was faster!)

2206
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:19,630
- Suk Jin.
- Let me answer.

2207
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:21,170
- Outsourcing.
- Outsourcing.

2208
01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:23,630
- Outsourcing. That's right.
- Outsourcing.

2209
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:25,370
- Outsourcing.
- Didn't I say it faster?

2210
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:27,060
You said it faster.

2211
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,630
Why didn't you answer sooner?

2212
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:30,010
It's basic knowledge.

2213
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:31,270
- Outsourcing. Right?
- I didn't know.

2214
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:32,410
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

2215
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:35,080
- I know what outsourcing is.
- I read newspapers.

2216
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,510
- You read newspapers.
- Do you read newspapers these days?

2217
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:38,090
- Outsourcing.
- What is up with you?

2218
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:40,120
Didn't I say it faster?

2219
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,290
The sections are getting cut.

2220
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,380
- Didn't I say it faster?
- What?

2221
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,550
(Whirring)

2222
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,980
The sections are getting cut.

2223
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,590
Behind them.

2224
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:48,720
(The saw begins to cut
the sections.)

2225
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,090
Behind them.

2226
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:52,700
(The loud noise makes them fearful!)

2227
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:53,920
This is no joke.

2228
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,730
Behind them.

2229
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:58,470
- I said it faster.
- The show became spectacular.

2230
01:11:58,470 --> 01:11:59,670
They are tipping forward.

2231
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:00,730
(Oh!)

2232
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:02,630
Stop!

2233
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,270
We have the preview now.

2234
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:05,800
- Boombastic.
- Boombastic.

2235
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,210
No!

2236
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:08,380
Boombastic!

2237
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,640
Skrr

2238
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,790
(The secret behind
the blockbuster-worthy preview)

2239
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:15,660
Running Man must have
a lot of money for production.

2240
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:17,960
There is Ji Seok Jun.

2241
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,090
Shall we pick Ji Seok Jun?

2242
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:21,290
- Sure.
- Let's go. We pick Ji Seok Jun.

2243
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:22,890
Seok Jun.

2244
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:24,550
- Seok Jun.
- I bet he isn't old.

2245
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:26,630
- A 24-year-old.
- An aspiring civil servant.

2246
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:28,470
- We will bet two sections.
- No.

2247
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,500
Bet five sections.

2248
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,100
- Suk Jin.
- You are weak.

2249
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:33,670
- You are weak.
- You are weak.

2250
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:35,710
- We will bet five sections.
- Okay.

2251
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:37,470
Let's do this.
Instead of ten sections,

2252
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:39,210
we will bet five sections.
That's life.

2253
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:41,580
- How many rounds will you have?
- Let's get it right.

2254
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:43,720
- End the match in five rounds.
- Ji Hyo.

2255
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,220
This question should be easy.

2256
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:47,750
This question was submitted
by Ji Seok Jun.

2257
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:49,960
What's the judicial authority
of Joseon Dynasty...

2258
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:54,090
that received orders from the king
to interrogate criminals?

2259
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,960
I think I know this one.

2260
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,330
- Joseon Dynasty.
- You have ten seconds.

2261
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,670
- Isn't it an executioner?
- A judicial authority.

2262
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:01,060
It isn't an executioner.

2263
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:02,060
No?

2264
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,890
No?

2265
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,370
An executioner isn't
a judicial authority.

2266
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:06,600
- Hurry up.
- Three,

2267
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:08,510
- Hurry up. I know the answer.
- two,

2268
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:09,540
one.

2269
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:12,750
- What's the answer?
- Isn't it Police Bureau?

2270
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:14,880
Of course not.

2271
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,340
- Justice Pao.
- A government office.

2272
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:17,670
You criminal!

2273
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:19,640
- Lock him up.
- You criminal!

2274
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,590
- Drag him away right now.
- That's right.

2275
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,330
- Guards!
- Guards, drag him away...

2276
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,830
and beat him up.

2277
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,200
- Beat him up with a paddle.
- A paddle.

2278
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:34,020
If you know the answer,
give us a hint.

2279
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,200
- It's...
- Hadongkwan.

2280
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:39,210
- That restaurant has tasty food.
- That's right.

2281
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:40,510
- That restaurant has tasty food.
- Hadongkwan.

2282
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,840
Feed him gukbap!

2283
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:44,670
Gomtang has a refreshing taste!

2284
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,450
It's only open till 2 a.m.

2285
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:47,510
(Their ridiculous hints don't help.)

2286
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:49,140
- Seriously.
- I feel like I know the answer.

2287
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:50,620
- Right?
- We bet five sections.

2288
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:51,720
We will know once we hear it.

2289
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:52,790
Let me answer.

2290
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:54,010
- Department of Justice.
- That's right.

2291
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:55,510
- Okay.
- Okay.

2292
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:58,180
- Yes!
- Let's go.

2293
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:00,290
- I just remembered it.
- No!

2294
01:14:00,290 --> 01:14:03,500
Drag Ji Suk Jin
to Department of Justice!

2295
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:04,890
I am sorry.

2296
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:06,500
I will get the next one right,
Ji Hyo.

2297
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:11,090
Send the criminal
to Department of Justice.

2298
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:14,170
(The circular saw
cuts the sections.)

2299
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:15,930
(Gosh!)

2300
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:17,510
- Suk Jin is scared.
- This is nerve-racking.

2301
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:19,600
This is driving me crazy.

2302
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,910
(The circular saw goes in deep.)

2303
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:23,140
- I am curious.
- Someone will...

2304
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:24,750
Suk Jin, stop moving.

2305
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:26,050
It cut more than five sections.

2306
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:27,180
All right.

2307
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:29,680
(It went a bit more.)

2308
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,790
- Stop moving.
- It went a bit more.

2309
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:32,550
We do it by hand,
so please understand.

2310
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:34,460
The next one.

2311
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:35,520
I am scared.

2312
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,460
- We will go with Yang Se Eun.
- This is scary.

2313
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,000
All right.

2314
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,830
- A cafe.
- A 29-year-old who runs a cafe.

2315
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,370
- Bet five sections.
- Five sections.

2316
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:44,540
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2317
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:45,800
Five sections.

2318
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:50,100
The Maori people of New Zealand
greet each other...

2319
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:52,300
by rubbing a body part.
Which body part is this?

2320
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,270
I think it's the forehead.

2321
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:55,770
- Nose or forehead.
- That's right.

2322
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:57,620
Let me answer.

2323
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,420
- Go.
- Nose.

2324
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:02,260
(They got the correct answer
with ease!)

2325
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:03,420
- Nose.
- I was a bit uncertain.

2326
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:04,850
Here we go.

2327
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:07,330
(Team Jong Kook's
wooden board gets cut.)

2328
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:08,590
They might fall.

2329
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,390
(Whirring)

2330
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:12,590
I think we will fall.

2331
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:14,630
- Are you okay?
- I think we will fall.

2332
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:15,970
Come on.

2333
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,090
(The circular saw is
right behind them.)

2334
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:18,410
Why didn't they fall yet?

2335
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:19,630
I am scared.

2336
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:21,040
(The onlookers are more fussy.)

2337
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,430
- Oh, my goodness.
- No!

2338
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:24,580
- They didn't fall yet.
- Oh, my goodness.

2339
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,170
They will fall.

2340
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,770
- Boombastic!
- They didn't fall.

2341
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:30,920
- Boombastic!
- Skrr

2342
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,480
Are you sitting at the back?

2343
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,550
No, we aren't.
We are sitting properly.

2344
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:35,810
- Jong Kook, how about Han Sang Il?
- What?

2345
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:37,550
An elementary schooler
will be Kwak Si Woo.

2346
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:39,220
- Would Si Woo be young?
- He would be a child.

2347
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:40,330
- Would he be young?
- Yes.

2348
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:42,420
- Shall we go with Si Woo?
- The name is trendy these days.

2349
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,160
Okay. We will go with Kwak Si Woo.

2350
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,220
I bet Si Woo is old.

2351
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:48,760
He is a child. I am certain of it.

2352
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:49,970
For goodness' sake.

2353
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:51,060
(A 37-year-old office worker,
Kwak Si Woo)

2354
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:52,840
He is in the IT industry!

2355
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:57,800
What a surprise!

2356
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,950
- Boombastic!
- What a surprise!

2357
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,420
Is he 37 years old?

2358
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:03,770
Boombastic.

2359
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,510
He lives young.

2360
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,180
He lives young.

2361
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:10,760
- I bet he has a babyface.
- Yes.

2362
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:12,350
- I...
- I bet he has a babyface.

2363
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:13,590
Here comes the question.

2364
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:15,660
- Okay.
- We won. They will fall.

2365
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:18,260
What's a different term
for computer programming...

2366
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,700
which involves making programs
with computer languages...

2367
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:26,930
such as C, Java, Python, etc.?

2368
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:28,670
- For goodness' sake.
- For goodness' sake.

2369
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:31,230
I don't own a computer at home.

2370
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:32,800
Who uses a computer these days?

2371
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:33,800
For goodness' sake.

2372
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,080
What's a term for making programs?

2373
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,140
I know this one.

2374
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:38,950
- Making programs?
- Yes.

2375
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,420
For goodness' sake.

2376
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:41,480
Programs?

2377
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,850
The answer has two syllables, right?

2378
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:45,980
- Making programs?
- Begin the countdown.

2379
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:47,180
- Hold on.
- Five...

2380
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:48,800
Making programs?

2381
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,630
Give them a hint.

2382
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:52,000
- Coding?
- Yes.

2383
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:53,300
Three.

2384
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,890
- What?
- Two.

2385
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:55,930
What could it be?

2386
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:56,970
- That's right.
- One.

2387
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:58,040
- Really?
- That's right.

2388
01:16:58,230 --> 01:16:59,340
Let me answer.

2389
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,600
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

2390
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:01,630
Ji Hyo.

2391
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:02,970
- Coding.
- Yes.

2392
01:17:02,970 --> 01:17:04,730
I see.

2393
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:06,300
Coding.

2394
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:07,970
We will fall.

2395
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:09,080
- You never know.
- They will fall.

2396
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,380
- We will fall.
- Let's go.

2397
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,880
(The board is already tilted,
but five more sections will be cut!)

2398
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,290
There is no hope.

2399
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:18,090
Bye!

2400
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:19,590
(Breaking)

2401
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,590
(Jong Kook and Hee Jung are out!)

2402
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:25,420
- Are you okay?
- That's scary.

2403
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,590
(In the next match,
Jae Suk and Haha lost!)

2404
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:30,340
They lasted long.

2405
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:32,710
- Okay.
- Metaverse is everywhere.

2406
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:34,340
Se Chan and Jeong Eui won.

2407
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:35,730
(Empty Head is good at quizzes
these days.)

2408
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:37,600
I finally got one answer right.

2409
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,970
- Okay.
- Metaverse.

2410
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:41,950
- Please stand at the front.
- Yes.

2411
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,250
Yes.

2412
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,680
- All the missions are over.
- Yes.

2413
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:50,960
Women received a penalty ball
every time they got zero candies.

2414
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,880
More penalty balls
have been added...

2415
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,700
in accordance with the result
of each mission.

2416
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,890
Women will have
the popularity poll for men first.

2417
01:18:00,130 --> 01:18:03,630
The candies you have received today
are your ballots.

2418
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:04,700
(Women can use those ballots
for the popularity poll.)

2419
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:05,730
You understood, right?

2420
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:09,510
Those who received many candies
have many ballots.

2421
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:14,670
Votes have been distributed
as per the mission results.

2422
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:16,770
Combining the result
of the popularity poll...

2423
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:18,640
will give us the final rankings.

2424
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,010
(The last place
will get the penalty.)

2425
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:24,220
I will now reveal
how many ballots each woman has.

2426
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:27,460
- Ji Hyo has one ballot.
- Oh, no.

2427
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:29,520
Ah In has three ballots.

2428
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,520
She has a lot.

2429
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,760
Hee Jung has four ballots.

2430
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:34,060
Jeong Hui has five ballots.

2431
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:35,300
Why does she have so many?

2432
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:37,260
Jenny has two ballots.

2433
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:39,300
Use those ballots for the poll.

2434
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:41,670
The man who places last
will get the penalty.

2435
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:42,800
- Without fail?
- Yes.

2436
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,130
How many ballots does Jenny have?

2437
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:45,210
Two.

2438
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:46,380
Jenny.

2439
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:47,450
(Se Chan suddenly becomes nice.)

2440
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:48,950
Hello.

2441
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:50,340
- I am in your care, Jenny.
- Jenny.

2442
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:51,840
Those jerks.

2443
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,120
"Those jerks?"

2444
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,720
- How does Jenny have two ballots?
- Jenny.

2445
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,810
- Those jerks.
- Come on.

2446
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:58,310
Those weaklings.

2447
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:00,050
- Jenny voted quickly.
- Write my name on one ballot.

2448
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:01,130
- Those weaklings.
- Jenny voted so quickly.

2449
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:02,220
Jenny is done voting already.

2450
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:03,890
For goodness' sake.

2451
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:05,590
We shouldn't pressure them.

2452
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:06,920
Ah In, did you vote for me?

2453
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,700
- All right. The results are in.
- Okay.

2454
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:11,090
The men's winner.

2455
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:12,510
- Winner?
- Winner.

2456
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:14,370
- It's a popularity poll.
- I bet it's Suk Jin.

2457
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:15,380
- I don't think it's me.
- Jong Kook.

2458
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:17,270
I think it is Suk Jin.

2459
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,750
We have three winners.

2460
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,550
- Really?
- That's nice.

2461
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:24,170
Because you got extra votes
after each mission.

2462
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:26,380
- But I never won.
- I never won any mission.

2463
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:27,880
- I want to be the winner.
- So we have...

2464
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:31,120
- three winners here.
- Okay.

2465
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,520
(Who are the 3 winners?)

2466
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,590
I don't want to get a penalty.

2467
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,630
Haha, Se Chan, and So Bal.

2468
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:37,700
- Seriously?
- Yes.

2469
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:38,830
Are you sure?

2470
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:42,060
(1 mission and 4 votes,1 mission
and 4 votes, 2 missions and 3 votes)

2471
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:43,590
Jong Kook...

2472
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:44,800
What happened?

2473
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:46,060
- What...
- Jong Kook.

2474
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:47,340
I won a lot today.

2475
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:49,300
Jeong Eui, I'm so touched.

2476
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:50,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2477
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:52,080
I don't want to be the last.

2478
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,750
- I don't want to be the last.
- My gosh.

2479
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,840
Didn't she have four votes?

2480
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,010
What happened?

2481
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:58,380
And the thing is...

2482
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:01,090
Didn't I win any mission?
Not even once?

2483
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:02,220
I don't know.

2484
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:05,220
(When she made her 2nd choice)

2485
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:09,200
(Hee Jung got candies from So Bal
and Jong Kook and chose Jong Kook.)

2486
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:10,460
I'm sorry.

2487
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:13,560
(She felt bad for So Bal
when she was eliminated.)

2488
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:19,410
(She gave 2 votes to Jong Kook
and another 2 to So Bal.)

2489
01:20:19,970 --> 01:20:22,210
I gave them two votes each.

2490
01:20:23,170 --> 01:20:24,170
Thank you.

2491
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:25,170
(Thanks to her,
So Bal has survived.)

2492
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:26,410
- Well...
- Suk Jin and Jong Kook.

2493
01:20:26,410 --> 01:20:28,580
One of you got 4 votes,
and the other got 3 votes.

2494
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,450
It's decided by one vote.

2495
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:31,470
This is unbelievable.

2496
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,180
- I think I won twice.
- Jong Kook.

2497
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:34,840
The loser with three votes is...

2498
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:50,440
(The loser is decided
by only 1 vote.)

2499
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,110
(Ah In didn't want to be
on the same team with Jong Kook.)

2500
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:55,390
(And Suk Jin is
Ah In's favorite star.)

2501
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,630
Ji Suk Jin.

2502
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,650
- What?
- I voted for him.

2503
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:04,430
- Good for you.
- I'm so relieved.

2504
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:06,490
- Ah In.
- I voted for you. I'm serious.

2505
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:08,360
- Ah In.
- I really did.

2506
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,430
How many votes?

2507
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:11,800
I thought I had to split the votes.

2508
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:12,810
Gosh.

2509
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:14,900
You should've
given me all your votes.

2510
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,400
Ah In knew that.

2511
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,270
- She knew she could vote for you.
- You should've voted for me.

2512
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,550
Ah In knew she could give
all her votes to one person.

2513
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:21,600
It could've been dangerous for me.

2514
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,880
The three winners will play
rock-paper-scissors for the prize.

2515
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:26,890
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- This will be my first time...

2516
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:28,350
to win as a man.

2517
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:29,980
- Princess Knight.
- My first time to be...

2518
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:31,220
- the men's winner.
- I'll show paper.

2519
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,980
You should keep playing as a man.

2520
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:34,980
- Princess Knight.
- You are lucky as a man.

2521
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,630
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

2522
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:39,300
(So Bal wins?)

2523
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:41,360
You're the winner.

2524
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:43,800
- You must be thrilled.
- You're the men's winner.

2525
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,010
- So Bal.
- This is my first time.

2526
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:48,140
- You should carry the wig with you.
- Next week...

2527
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:49,380
You should carry it around.

2528
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,600
You look like Ahn Young Mi.

2529
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,900
- Princess Knight.
- You're right.

2530
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,510
You look like Ahn Young Mi.

2531
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,880
Hey, stop it.

2532
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,050
- You called me Ahn Young Mi.
- You're good.

2533
01:21:58,050 --> 01:21:59,390
Kids are watching.

2534
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:01,140
- You called me Ahn Young Mi.
- That's too much.

2535
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:03,310
- That's good.
- Hey.

2536
01:22:03,310 --> 01:22:04,780
This isn't like "Radio Star."

2537
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:07,260
- Jenny.
- That's enough.

2538
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:09,690
The men's winner is Jeon So Bal.

2539
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:11,430
- Good job.
- She's the men's winner.

2540
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:12,630
I'm so jealous.

2541
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,990
Now we will decide
the female member to get a penalty.

2542
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:17,100
I'll announce the numbers
of penalty balls.

2543
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,810
It must be Jae Suk.

2544
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:21,640
The woman with the fewest
penalty balls is the winner.

2545
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:24,400
And the one with the most
penalty balls will get a penalty.

2546
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:25,980
Roh Jeong Eui has one ball.

2547
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:26,980
(Jeong Eui 1)

2548
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,140
Park Ah In has two.

2549
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:30,050
Song Ji Hyo has three.

2550
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:31,880
Kim Hee Jung has three.

2551
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:33,480
And Yoo Jenny has five.

2552
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:35,610
- My goodness.
- Okay.

2553
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:38,730
Roh Jeong Eui with the fewest
penalty balls is the winner.

2554
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,990
Please bring in the prize.

2555
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:44,990
- My goodness.
- You never win as a woman.

2556
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:46,360
- This is my first time to win...
- As a man...

2557
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,390
as a man.

2558
01:22:47,390 --> 01:22:48,690
What? This is a designer label.

2559
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:50,970
- It's a designer label.
- It's Gucci.

2560
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:53,510
All right. The prize for today is...

2561
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,140
- It's Gucci.
- For a man...

2562
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:56,710
(For a man...)

2563
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:58,230
We have a brand-name necktie.

2564
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:00,350
Hey!

2565
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,550
You can't do this to me.

2566
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:03,110
You can give it to your dad.

2567
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:05,140
- I mean...
- A brand-name scarf for a woman.

2568
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:06,480
- Give it to your dad.
- Great.

2569
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,850
Give it to your dad.

2570
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:09,780
- Give it to your dad.
- My gosh.

2571
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:12,520
- This is pretty.
- You can wear it, Jeong Eui.

2572
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,350
- This is nice.
- So Min.

2573
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:16,060
- It's pink.
- I'm envious.

2574
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,760
This is pretty.

2575
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,990
(She puts it on right away.)

2576
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:23,360
Bombastic

2577
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:27,810
(Manager Jeon is feeling excited
during the office get-together.)

2578
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:29,270
Jeong Eui looks pretty.

2579
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:31,230
- I'm so upset.
- She's pretty.

2580
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:32,900
- It looks good on you.
- You look great, Jeong Eui.

2581
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,570
Jenny and Suk Jin will...

2582
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:35,770
My goodness.

2583
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:37,480
This is your first time as a couple.

2584
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:39,350
- The first couple.
- Gosh.

2585
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:41,610
- That means bad luck.
- I can't believe this.

2586
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:43,220
- Bombastic.
- Skrr

2587
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:45,060
- I'll announce today's penalty.
- Okay.

2588
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:47,060
- I'm glad you're doing this.
- Why?

2589
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,100
- Today is White Day.
- Right.

2590
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:54,300
You will make a bouquet of roses for
your beloved ones before going home.

2591
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:55,690
- That's a lot of work.
- It's perfect.

2592
01:23:55,690 --> 01:23:57,890
- I hate it.
- All right.

2593
01:23:57,890 --> 01:23:59,270
- Bye.
- I'll see you later.

2594
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:01,010
- Bye.
- Bye.

2595
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:03,140
- I've never done this before.
- Have you tried this before?

2596
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:04,400
No way.

2597
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,740
I've never done this before.

2598
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:07,600
I will...

2599
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:09,420
use only one kind.

2600
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:11,220
I will mix different roses.

2601
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:12,240
This is pretty.

2602
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,390
That's half-hearted.

2603
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:15,350
I think red roses are pretty.

2604
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:17,110
- You should use things like this.
- Gosh, no.

2605
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:18,610
I just need these.

2606
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:20,890
You can't be like that.

2607
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:21,890
Gosh.

2608
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:25,470
Actually, I'm a little shy
to buy my wife flowers.

2609
01:24:25,890 --> 01:24:28,490
I can use the penalty as an excuse.

2610
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,890
My wife recently bought a vase.

2611
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:33,310
In a fit of anger?

2612
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:35,600
No wonder why she did.

2613
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:37,930
Gosh, seriously...

2614
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:41,550
Anyway, for my wife...

2615
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:43,920
You're saying that too much.

2616
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:45,980
That doesn't sound sincere.

2617
01:24:46,110 --> 01:24:47,680
When he was a newlywed,

2618
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,060
he went to play video games
without his wife all the time.

2619
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:52,480
You should know that.

2620
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,280
- That's true.
- He was really...

2621
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,820
The past doesn't matter.
What matters is the present.

2622
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:58,390
You don't buy her flowers a lot.

2623
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:00,100
Have you done this before?

2624
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,170
Sure.

2625
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:02,230
- Do you do this often?
- Yes.

2626
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:04,800
What is this?

2627
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,100
- Let go of it.
- This is...

2628
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:08,170
Even a bundle of wild flowers...

2629
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:09,600
would look better than this.

2630
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:11,380
(It's a bouquet of unidentified
flowers that look like weeds.)

2631
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:13,680
- This is like...
- What's wrong?

2632
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,380
I can't wait
to read comments on this.

2633
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:16,980
(I can't wait
to read comments on this.)

2634
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:20,520
They would say, "Suk Jin is giving
a lick and a promise to go home."

2635
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,590
- I know. That's what they say.
- Right.

2636
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:24,980
What's the big deal?

2637
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:26,980
We won't live for 100 years anyway.

2638
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:29,760
Then why did you invest in the US funds?

2639
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:30,990
(Then why did you invest in the US funds?)

2640
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,520
I still want to live...

2641
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:35,230
- well off for the 100 years.
- You say life is no big deal,

2642
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:37,230
but why did you invest
so much in the US funds?

2643
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:38,490
- Well...
- You prepare for the future.

2644
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:41,670
I should be prepared for the 100 years.

2645
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:45,440
(Now they are wrapping the flowers.)

2646
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:51,940
- My gosh.
- What are you doing?

2647
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:53,590
What's all this?

2648
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:55,850
- What are you doing?
- This is strange.

2649
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:57,680
I can't make it look pretty.

2650
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:59,130
- Look at this.
- All right.

2651
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:01,260
- This is different.
- What's different?

2652
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:03,520
(The bouquet is done.)

2653
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,690
This is the best I can do.

2654
01:26:04,690 --> 01:26:05,890
(The bouquet is done.)

2655
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,490
I'll give this to my wife.

2656
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:08,690
That's big.

2657
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:10,770
- This is it.
- This is mine.

2658
01:26:10,770 --> 01:26:11,990
You're done.

2659
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:13,970
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2660
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:15,230
Thank you.

2661
01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:16,810
(We'd like to thank Jeong Eui,
Hee Jung, and Ah In...)

2662
01:26:16,810 --> 01:26:18,380
(for joining us today
with their cheerful energy.)

2663
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,350
(A few days later)

2664
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:24,380
- How cute.
- My puppy.

2665
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:28,980
(What is Ji Hyo doing here
on Friday when she's off?)

2666
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:32,150
(And Se Chan?)

2667
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:33,590
This is so hilarious.

2668
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:38,350
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan are
having a preliminary meeting.)

2669
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:40,170
Captain Ji...

2670
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:43,170
(It's Captain Ji...)

2671
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:48,270
(who called them here.)

2672
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:50,430
(I'm the busiest one here.)

2673
01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:52,710
(I'm busy.)

2674
01:26:53,770 --> 01:26:55,770
(Depart from games.)

2675
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:57,610
(Widen our spectrum.)

2676
01:26:57,610 --> 01:27:01,180
(Captain Ji's last pledge
full of populism)

2677
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:02,850
(No missions)

2678
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,390
(No penalties)

2679
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:06,780
(It's literally a race
where they just have fun.)

2680
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:08,680
(They find everything they eat...)

2681
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,490
(and everything
they play with themselves.)

2682
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:12,890
(They do everything
they want to do.)

2683
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:15,690
(It's a 100-percent
independent personalized trip.)

2684
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:17,360
Fold a finger
if you are not wearing glasses.

2685
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:22,100
(They are allowed
to do anything here!)

2686
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:25,070
(As Captain Ji imagined,)

2687
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:28,570
(they enjoy their freedom
to the fullest.)

2688
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:29,980
(Right at the moment...)

2689
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:33,890
(A suspicious secret
that interrupts their free time?)

2690
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:35,680
(It was one o'clock earlier.)

2691
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:37,150
This is strange.
The pens are everywhere.

2692
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:40,980
(It's somewhat suspicious.)

2693
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:45,630
(Captain Ji's retirement trip)

2694
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:48,390
(Captain Ji's
Imagination Comes True)
