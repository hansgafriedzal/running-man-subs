1
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,620
(3 days before the shoot)

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,890
(A rainy Friday night)

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,470
- Isn't that it?
- No.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,780
I think fortune-telling is...

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,230
- Hello.
- Hey.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,500
- Hey.
- Hi.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,070
- Hello.
- Hey.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,250
(The empty seat was for Se Chan.)

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,520
- Are we starting right away?
- Yes.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,090
What's going on?

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,290
Gosh, I was surprised.

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,290
This is funny. This doesn't
happen a lot on Running Man.

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,980
It feels like we're shooting abroad.

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,290
I know.

15
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,800
It's funny that you and I
are doing something together.

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,830
It feels like we're shooting abroad.

17
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,130
Captain Ji picked you two for us.

18
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,130
- The two of us?
- Yes.

19
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,340
- For what?
- Why?

20
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,530
This is Captain Ji's
last race as a captain.

21
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,230
That's what we don't have on Running Man.

22
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,410
We don't have to play games every time.

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,880
How did you come up with all these games?

24
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,810
The writers of Running Man
need to take a break.

25
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,060
Whatever Running Man does
is what Running Man is.

26
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,980
- Then what do we do?
- Like what?

27
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,420
We should think about it now.

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,420
(We should think about it now.)

29
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,790
- On your last week as a captain...
- Yes.

30
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,320
- Only the members?
- Yes. The thing is,

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,100
- we were inspired by you.
- Like what?

32
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,130
You guys will just have fun.

33
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,930
You can play games
to decide who will do the dishes.

34
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,930
- I'd love that.
- Anything you want.

35
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,400
I've always wanted to do things like this.

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,310
- Like a school trip.
- Exactly.

37
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,510
What do you think
the members can try then?

38
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,150
You would need to suggest a theme though.

39
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,320
For players, it is easier that way.

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,350
You can't just tell them to have fun.

41
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,180
- You could give them a jegi.
- Okay.

42
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,060
- It's me.
- Hey.

43
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,520
- Captain Ji.
- You guys are having a meeting.

44
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,260
That's right.

45
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,520
Is there anything you need to decide?

46
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,200
Yes. I'd like you...

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,200
to pick a few members
who can discuss things with us.

48
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,370
- Well... I think Ji Hyo...
- Yes.

49
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,370
(Ji Hyo)

50
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,270
- and Se Chan.
- Why?

51
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,010
I guess these two are the least busy ones.

52
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,450
(I guess these two are
the least busy ones.)

53
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,540
He said you two are...

54
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,320
the least busy ones.

55
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,410
I'm the busiest one here.

56
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,990
- Ji Hyo.
- I'm busy.

57
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,510
You sleep a lot...

58
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,250
So he thinks we are like leftovers.

59
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,930
Ji Hyo, he thinks you and I are leftovers.

60
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,170
- So we should...
- That's ridiculous.

61
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,800
(He calls Captain Ji feeling upset.)

62
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,670
All right. Suk Jin.

63
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,640
- Suk Jin.
- What?

64
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,930
Suk Jin, I'm with Ji Hyo now.

65
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,030
- Suk Jin.
- Ji Hyo?

66
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,900
- Yes.
- Gosh, Suk Jin.

67
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,550
(Yes, I can see you.)

68
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,050
- Gosh, Suk Jin.
- Do you see me?

69
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,080
Yes, I can see you.

70
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,470
Why do you look so horrible today?

71
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,940
Why is your face all swollen?

72
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,710
What's the problem?

73
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,810
You need to put on some makeup.

74
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,930
(Something needs to be done
about Captain Ji's face.)

75
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,560
Suk Jin. Isn't this his first time
to show his bare face?

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,620
Suk Jin, do you not mind
showing your bare face like this?

77
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,020
My face has always been an issue.

78
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,430
I guess he's right.

79
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,840
Suk Jin.

80
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,370
What are you two doing?

81
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,580
What's with him? Suk Jin.

82
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,210
You made us plan an outing.

83
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,770
You picked us.

84
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,000
If you were going to stay home,

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,020
- you should've joined the meeting.
- You should come.

86
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,920
I worked my socks off.

87
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,050
Gosh, Suk Jin...

88
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,620
You're the captain.
You should attend the meeting.

89
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,220
- What do you think you're doing?
- Hang on.

90
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,930
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

91
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,520
I don't think it's a meeting.
You're just having dinner.

92
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,620
No, we are...

93
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,520
You're not committed to this.

94
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,030
What are you talking about?

95
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,300
You can't come up with
good ideas when you are full.

96
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,870
What do you know about meetings?

97
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,080
You should stay hungry for good ideas.
You can't eat that.

98
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,440
The destiny of Running Man
is in your hands now.

99
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,440
What are you talking about?
You just put it on us.

100
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,120
I did put it on you.

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
He's scratching his body.

102
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,520
- Gosh.
- This episode is up to you.

103
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,210
Why is it up to us?

104
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,220
You're the captain.

105
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,220
- Why is it up to us?
- This isn't about us.

106
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,120
Is there anything
you want to try with the members?

107
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,830
We could have some drinks on an outing.

108
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,190
What do you want to do on an outing?

109
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,740
Let's have some beef barbecue.

110
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,270
- Isn't that nice?
- That sounds like a good idea.

111
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,810
Everyone likes beef. All our members do.

112
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,030
How about we make Suk Jin cook for us?

113
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,770
Suk Jin will cook ramyeon for us.

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,710
It would be nice if we had
things like a popularity award.

115
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,150
We don't need a big prize.
Something we can use at home.

116
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,310
- Like detergent.
- I see.

117
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,290
- A prize like tissues.
- Tissues.

118
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,560
- Detergent.
- Tissues sound good.

119
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
That would be the best.

120
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,820
When we get there,

121
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,160
it will be fun to wear a uniform.
It will bring us together.

122
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,260
A team uniform? It's a little...

123
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,930
I know it will bring us together, but...

124
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,430
I want to play the Informal Talk Game.

125
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,310
If we play the Informal Talk Game,

126
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,630
So Min and you will be first in line.

127
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,330
We will be first in line.
I'll be number one.

128
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,410
I don't want to do it.

129
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,680
(She suddenly feels tired.)

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,440
- You should use honorifics.
- You should use honorifics to me.

131
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,140
Why don't we write down our complaints?

132
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,510
(An idea for their outing,
writing down complaints)

133
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,050
- Anonymously?
- Yes, anonymously.

134
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,310
- I guess you have many complaints.
- No.

135
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,450
Who do you hate now?

136
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,880
- No.
- Who is it you hate?

137
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,060
- Haha?
- No.

138
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,690
She's not saying anything.

139
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,170
There must be someone.

140
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,820
Or you could suggest that...

141
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,800
they decide on seniority for the day
before we start.

142
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,430
We can play games
to decide seniority for the day.

143
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,670
Do you think it's possible
to have Jong Kook below you?

144
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,070
- Jong Kook?
- Yes.

145
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,930
He's too stubborn. You know that.

146
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,870
He wouldn't listen to me.

147
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,200
It's impossible. He's too stubborn.

148
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,220
You know him.

149
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,180
"All right, Ji Hyo. Okay, I'll do it."

150
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,720
"Would this work?"

151
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,990
Then he would throw a tantrum.

152
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,120
"Do you want me to eat this or what?"

153
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,060
"All right." He would be like this.
It's not going to work.

154
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,660
- Forget it.
- I know. Forget about it.

155
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,800
Let's not do that.

156
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,620
- I guess this is it.
- Okay.

157
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,670
- Clap once.
- One, two, three.

158
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,690
(And 3 days later!)

159
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,540
- Jae Suk.
- Hey.

160
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,740
- Hello.
- You look nice.

161
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,870
- You're here.
- Hey.

162
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,130
- It is sunny today.
- The weather is nice.

163
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,410
It's really good.

164
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,910
- Haha.
- Hey.

165
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,480
- Look at him.
- Hey.

166
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,780
- He's wearing a sweatsuit again.
- Hello.

167
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,940
- Hello.
- As always.

168
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,720
Did you get your pants from
the Korea Expressway Corporation?

169
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,940
- No.
- What's with them?

170
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,660
- Aren't they pretty?
- What happened?

171
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,490
- This is...
- Suk Jin, if you lie down here,

172
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,120
- you can be part of the line.
- It should be the same fabric.

173
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,690
You can lie down on here.

174
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,990
- There he goes.
- It's nice to be out.

175
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,820
I bet he's just got joint pains.

176
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,800
- He groaned.
- Isn't it nice to be out?

177
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,130
- His joints just popped.
- After staying home the whole time.

178
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,560
Don't pretend to be excited.

179
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

180
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,370
Hello.

181
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,110
- Hello.
- Hey.

182
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,810
- Hello.
- It's been a long time.

183
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,240
- Hello.
- I've missed you all.

184
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,780
- Hey.
- Stop it.

185
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,180
- Don't walk around.
- What's wrong with you?

186
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,720
- I'm just glad that I'm back.
- You might break your leg again.

187
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,220
You can't be like this.

188
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,920
- You might break your bone again.
- You know what?

189
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,030
You're likely to get injured
when you work out in good condition.

190
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,250
- Exactly.
- That's true.

191
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,250
"Gosh, what's with me today?"

192
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,690
- That's not good.
- Then you could get hurt.

193
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,030
That's when you get injured.

194
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,800
You just saw what Suk Jin did.
When he got off the car...

195
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,890
"Oh, dear."

196
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,190
- But when the camera is on...
- When we got here...

197
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,670
"Gosh, this is so nice!"

198
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,040
He's healthy.

199
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,740
- That was fake.
- He pretended to be excited.

200
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,980
- I was really excited.
- That's a fake life.

201
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,870
- I was excited to be out.
- He forced himself to be excited.

202
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,550
- It is nice to be out.
- Suk Jin's mood.

203
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,350
- True or false?
- True or false?

204
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,420
- I'm not lying.
- True or false?

205
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,920
- I don't fake anything.
- False!

206
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,720
- False!
- You're lying again.

207
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,790
Ji Suk Jin's Fake Life!

208
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,310
(Ji Suk Jin's Fake Life,
to be continued)

209
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,160
- Se Chan, you look nice today.
- You think?

210
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,950
- Yes. Today...
- I went to a beauty salon.

211
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,560
By the way, are you going...

212
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,230
to Gwacheon Racecourse today?

213
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,470
(Giddyup!)

214
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,820
Why? A racecourse?

215
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,490
He imitates horse racing right away.

216
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,830
That's what comedians do.

217
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,970
He makes jokes about it.

218
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,930
Ji Hyo, your hair looks great.

219
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,830
- It's grown a lot.
- It looks the best.

220
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,370
- This is the hairstyle I want.
- You do?

221
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,740
You'd look like Lee Kwang Soo then.

222
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,870
It will make you look like Lee Kwang Soo.

223
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,510
No, it's not Kwang Soo.
I want to be like Ji Hyo.

224
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,940
- I like her hairstyle.
- Like this?

225
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,050
Hey.

226
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,350
Her hair looks nice because of her face.

227
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,750
I guess it's really sunny today.

228
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,160
Suk Jin, I can see your earwax.

229
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,720
(Suk Jin, I can see your earwax.)

230
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,230
(His earwax is shown.)

231
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,990
I saw that last week.

232
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,100
- Really?
- He always has it.

233
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,170
It must be clear today.

234
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,600
Your earwax...

235
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,690
- During the opening...
- Hey.

236
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,260
- I can see earwax in his ear.
- He has that all the time.

237
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,760
Is it okay to talk about earwax...

238
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,870
- on a variety show?
- What about it?

239
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,740
Have variety shows come this far?

240
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,810
It must be really sunny today.

241
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,140
- It's a sunny day.
- The weather is nice.

242
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,680
I can see through his ears.

243
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,280
I made a big contribution to this episode.

244
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,740
- Hey, I'm still the captain.
- Until today?

245
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,880
Until today.

246
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,380
- Forget it. You are not a captain.
- Is that true?

247
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,490
What are we having for lunch?

248
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,660
- Isn't it over?
- Today is a good day.

249
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,680
- What?
- Isn't it over yet?

250
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,750
Will we be cooking ourselves?

251
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,060
- I only care about lunch.
- We will be cooking then.

252
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,160
What are we having for lunch?

253
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,190
- We can cook anything we want.
- What are we going to eat?

254
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,560
- Jae Suk, you know what?
- Are you a restaurant owner?

255
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,300
It's ridiculous
that Suk Jin is the captain.

256
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,540
He shifted his work to me and Ji Hyo.

257
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,130
So the two of us had to do an extra shoot.

258
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,170
- Really?
- Yes.

259
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,760
He didn't attend the meeting.

260
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,970
He just made me and Ji Hyo
come up with some ideas.

261
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,070
So Ji Hyo and I had a meeting
at a Chinese restaurant.

262
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,470
Suk Jin, you're the captain.

263
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,110
- You should attend the meeting.
- You should've joined us.

264
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,250
I had something else to take care of.

265
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,790
- You were home.
- I know you were home.

266
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,450
He was lying down at home.

267
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,660
- He said "Hey" with a swollen face.
- He was wearing a loose shirt.

268
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,060
True or false?

269
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,560
False!

270
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,800
- He's a liar.
- He's unbelievable.

271
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,930
I had to spend some time
with my wife at home.

272
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,320
- That's not work.
- Why at home?

273
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,360
- I had plans with my wife.
- My gosh.

274
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,460
What are we doing today?

275
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,540
As you just heard,

276
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,830
today is Suk Jin's last day as a captain.

277
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,700
There's something
Captain Ji said every time.

278
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,250
We should forget about missions.

279
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,920
We should try to do what we want
to do without playing games.

280
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,840
This is what he said, so...

281
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,610
That means he doesn't
want to do this show.

282
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,210
That's not true. I just want
things to be spontaneous.

283
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,560
What is it he wants to do?

284
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,480
- He wants to slack off.
- Aren't you tired...

285
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,130
of playing games every time?

286
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,630
- I'm fine with it. It's fun.
- I find it interesting.

287
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,060
(They prefer games.)

288
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,090
That's what I come here for.

289
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,400
"What game are we playing today?"

290
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,860
I want to fight and betray others.

291
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,730
- I want some quizzes too.
- Well...

292
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,510
- All right. I know it's fun.
- It's fun to solve quizzes.

293
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,910
To be honest, there are
a lot of observation shows...

294
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,200
- on other channels.
- I don't like it.

295
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,680
- We should play more games.
- Exactly.

296
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,710
We can take a break today.
I'm not saying we shouldn't do it at all.

297
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,390
- But that's what we do.
- That's not what I meant.

298
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,810
- Jong Kook, stop frowning.
- I love to play games.

299
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,480
- Just stop frowning.
- My gosh.

300
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,980
I love it.

301
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,090
(Captain Ji suddenly
touches Jong Kook's face.)

302
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,300
I love it.

303
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,770
- I'm punishing you out of love.
- My goodness.

304
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,500
I care about Jong Kook a lot.

305
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,090
Why are you doing that?

306
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,330
- In a lovely way.
- Do you really have to do that?

307
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,810
He's afraid you might get upset.

308
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,470
- He did this in a cute way.
- In a lovely way.

309
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,510
(Acting cute)

310
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,880
As Captain Ji requested,

311
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,280
you're not going
to have any missions today.

312
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,290
- Really?
- That's great.

313
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,980
- I'm here for missions.
- Why?

314
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,890
We will show you how we have fun.

315
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,060
- I hate things like this.
- I hate it.

316
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,080
- Suk Jin.
- What are we doing then?

317
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,160
- This is even harder.
- This is what I hated the most...

318
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,430
when we did "Family Outing."

319
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,760
They don't tell me what to do.

320
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,820
Like Jong Kook said,

321
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,500
I hate it when our production crew
says things like that.

322
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,460
"You can just have fun
without doing anything."

323
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,730
- I hate it a lot.
- I like it though.

324
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,230
- It's really difficult.
- We've never done it before.

325
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,730
And do you know what happens
when we actually have fun?

326
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,910
They are like this.

327
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,470
That makes me nervous.

328
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,470
They are like this.

329
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,550
(Upset)

330
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,650
- That makes me nervous.
- I feel really uncomfortable.

331
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,920
- They are displeased.
- Right.

332
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,940
"You told us to have fun."

333
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,980
"I know."

334
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,420
- Then they have a meeting.
- They discuss things.

335
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,180
Why did they tell us
to have fun in the first place?

336
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,350
- We will have fun doing nothing.
- So, today,

337
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,800
there won't be any missions.

338
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,690
You will just hang out
and have fun with the other members.

339
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,540
But it's up to you to finish the shoot.

340
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,640
Hey.

341
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,700
- Don't say that.
- I don't want things like that.

342
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,540
They feel uncomfortable
when you say things like that.

343
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,380
- See?
- I'd rather do as I'm told.

344
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,150
If you think you are done filling up
the airtime of 90 minutes,

345
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,180
you can ring the bell
you will see at the outing site.

346
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,280
(The shoot is over
as soon as the bell rings.)

347
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,440
- Really?
- You mean 90 minutes?

348
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,520
- Do you want us to ring the bell?
- Yes.

349
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,920
How long has it been?

350
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,580
I guess it's been eight minutes.

351
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,580
- No.
- What?

352
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,920
- I bet it's worth 10 minutes.
- No, it will be 10 minutes.

353
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,180
- Ten minutes?
- We did a lot of things.

354
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,560
Including the walking,
it will add up to 12 or 13 minutes.

355
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,300
We walked all the way here.

356
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,630
We just walked. That doesn't count.

357
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,800
We put on the microphones.

358
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,900
- Hey, the microphone.
- That's ridiculous.

359
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,090
- He's the worst.
- Jae Suk is a popular MC.

360
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,690
- It should be about him.
- You're the best.

361
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,930
If we have him on TV,
we will get good ratings.

362
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,430
Once you ring the bell,
today's race will be over.

363
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,330
- Really?
- Are we going home like that?

364
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,880
Yes. But if you fail
to fill up the airtime...

365
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,470
- You should take care of it.
- Additional shooting?

366
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,840
We have your schedule...

367
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,810
for the next 3 or 4 weeks.

368
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,520
There might be additional shooting.

369
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,580
This is worse.

370
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,080
- It's like a penalty.
- They want us to try our best.

371
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,580
It would've been easier
if we'd played like three games.

372
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,660
I know.

373
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,980
What's with you, Suk Jin?

374
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,430
We could've had some guests
and played games together.

375
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,320
This will become a good memory.
It is going to be fun.

376
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,930
What if Running Man comes to an end?

377
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,830
When Running Man comes to an end,
we are going to cherish this moment.

378
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,770
- Why would it come to an end?
- Why would you say that?

379
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,430
- We're doing a good job.
- Things are going well now.

380
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,880
It will eventually come to an end.

381
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,010
I'm sorry, but it won't be over.

382
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,100
You will leave the show,
but we will stay here.

383
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,780
It's just you who will leave the show.

384
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,750
That's plausible though.

385
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,110
- That's what I look forward to.
- What do you look forward to?

386
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,560
One day, Jong Kook... No, you're Jae Suk.

387
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,020
- Jae Suk.
- You seem flustered.

388
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,820
This is what I'm waiting for. One day,

389
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,930
I will leave this show.

390
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,560
And I'll hand over my position
to my replacement.

391
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,950
That's going to happen next week!

392
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,560
(That's going to happen next week!)

393
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,800
(Silent roars)

394
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,330
This is true!

395
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,510
That's too soon.

396
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,170
- True.
- Give me some more time.

397
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,470
Can you stay a little longer?

398
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,830
Isn't that cool?

399
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,340
For the first time on a variety
show, I will have my successor.

400
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,570
Your successor, my foot.

401
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,750
Who do you want...

402
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,110
- to be your replacement?
- Someone clumsy.

403
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,810
- Like who?
- Your replacement?

404
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,940
- I haven't thought about it.
- Do you think...

405
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,890
is there anyone who can replace you?

406
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,580
- Someone like you.
- What do you think?

407
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,890
Someone to replace Suk Jin?

408
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,160
It should be someone younger than me...

409
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,090
- and older than Jae Suk.
- Really?

410
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,160
It's hard.

411
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,000
So you want someone who was born in 1971,

412
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,560
All right then. Suk Jin will go...

413
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,900
and find someone who was born in 1971.

414
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,640
- Go!
- Let's go!

415
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,670
We never know where he's going.

416
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,040
It will be fun to find
Suk Jin's replacement.

417
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,510
Who will be Suk Jin's replacement?

418
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,310
- Let's go find it!
- Born in 1970 or 1971.

419
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,570
Either 1970 or 1971.

420
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,680
- Doesn't it sound fun?
- That's a great idea.

421
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,840
- So...
- We might...

422
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,310
find your replacement
sooner than you thought.

423
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,440
When I...

424
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,390
When I have to leave this show...

425
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,920
- He's crying.
- Isn't it now?

426
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,560
It will be worth four episodes.

427
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,610
- Looking for my replacement.
- Suk Jin.

428
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,810
- Four weeks.
- Go ahead...

429
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,950
- and apologize.
- Just wrap it up.

430
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,060
Just say you will try your best.

431
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,800
- Tell them you'll work hard.
- They might find your replacement.

432
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,900
Just tell them that you will work hard.

433
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,590
Running Man is part of my life.

434
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,960
He apologizes.

435
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,400
He was born in 1966,

436
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,430
- and he's apologizing.
- I've been apologizing a lot.

437
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,510
He was born in 1966.

438
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,200
- I'm sorry.
- That came out wrong.

439
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,830
- "I don't want to leave the show."
- I'll try my best.

440
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,510
I will give it my best shot.

441
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,710
What I just said was a lie.

442
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,750
(What I just said was a lie.)

443
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,440
(False)

444
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,710
- That's right.
- The fake life!

445
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,350
- False!
- I'm sorry.

446
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,660
- Ji Suk Jin's fake life!
- Ji Suk Jin's fake life!

447
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,290
- I carried my joke too far.
- I know.

448
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,130
So, as Captain Ji said,
you will have fun together.

449
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,400
It ends when the bell rings,
and if it's not enough,

450
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,300
- we'll shoot a little longer.
- Got it.

451
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,400
- That's not a problem.
- Okay.

452
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,170
Obviously, there's no mission
or penalty today.

453
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,140
- Now, we'll move to the location.
- Okay.

454
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,180
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

455
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,200
This is so nice.

456
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,280
- Something like that.
- Push it back. It's 90 degrees now.

457
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,420
No, it isn't.

458
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,420
(- It's 90 degrees now.
- No, it isn't.)

459
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,250
- What?
- Yes, it is, Suk Jin.

460
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,750
- What do you mean it's not?
- It's 90 degrees.

461
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,250
- What do you mean it's not?
- It must be uncomfortable.

462
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,310
- What...
- Push it back a little.

463
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,310
- Then...
- That's a lie.

464
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,350
- Why do you keep denying things?
- Come on. Lean back, Suk Jin.

465
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,580
- What does he mean?
- Lean back, Suk Jin.

466
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,400
- Suk Jin. I mean, Captain Ji.
- It's uncomfortable.

467
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,190
- I was going to give him a massage.
- I prefer sitting like this.

468
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,590
- I'll do it for you.
- That's okay.

469
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,960
Suk Jin, you're upset now, right?

470
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,000
No, I'm not.

471
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,300
(- You're upset now, right?
- No, I'm not.)

472
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,460
- Again, he said, "No."
- He's lying.

473
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,230
People often think I'm upset
when I'm actually not.

474
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,470
- Right.
- Then when you're upset,

475
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,570
- how do you look?
- It happens at home too.

476
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,880
- What do you do when you're upset?
- Exactly.

477
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,380
- I...
- What do you do when you're upset?

478
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,840
People would walk away from me
when I get angry.

479
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,520
- Do you yell at others?
- Who did that?

480
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,150
When I was in middle school,
kids all ran away immediately.

481
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,080
- Why?
- You cry when you're angry, right?

482
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,790
- I guess Haha is right.
- You cry and yell, right?

483
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,890
- He'd pee himself too.
- Right.

484
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,580
- He'd pee and cry at the same time.
- Exactly.

485
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,060
- While peeing himself?
- "Go away! Stay away from me!"

486
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,530
- Then he starts peeing.
- "I'll throw poop at you!"

487
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,300
I bet he peed.

488
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,430
That's why everyone ran away from him.

489
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,460
(The young Seok Sam beat his enemies
with a biological weapon.)

490
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,540
Right.

491
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,360
He said everyone walked away from him.

492
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,910
- By the way,
- That was hilarious.

493
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,880
I talked to So Min on the phone...

494
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,640
- while she was quarantined.
- Yes.

495
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,200
She seemed to feel so cooped up.

496
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,550
- Of course.
- I was the last one to get it.

497
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,970
- So Min was the last one.
- Yes.

498
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,390
Suk Jin, Haha, Jong Kook, and I...

499
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,420
- talked in a group chat room.
- True.

500
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,890
- We had video chats too. So Min...
- I remember that.

501
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,080
- joined us when she wasn't sick.
- That's right.

502
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,000
But when So Min was sick,
we were all working busily.

503
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
- Right.
- Exactly.

504
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,160
- So we missed her calls.
- Right.

505
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,930
- I felt bad about it.
- No one spoke in the chat room.

506
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,770
And Suk Jin and Jong Kook had
a video chat with me.

507
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,170
- We had a video chat once.
- Then they said it was enough,

508
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,310
- and they had done enough for me.
- But...

509
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,880
- You know...
- We had a long chat though.

510
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,430
We chatted for 40 minutes,
but she wouldn't hang up.

511
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,510
Right. Suk Jin actively joined the chat.

512
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,810
He came up with various topics
to talk about. I was impressed.

513
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,310
- I thought,
- He sure is our captain.

514
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,050
- But it was funny...
- "He's participating passionately."

515
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,610
- that they told me to hang up...
- Yes.

516
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,160
during the video chat.
I thought it was ridiculous...

517
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,390
because they were talking to
each other while looking at me.

518
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,690
They had a chat without me
and then told me to hang up.

519
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,030
- They had nothing to talk about.
- That's because they're men.

520
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,060
- They didn't have a chat with me.
- Right.

521
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,820
We didn't know what to talk about
after talking about each other.

522
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,640
- They told me to leave suddenly.
- Right.

523
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,000
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

524
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,310
What did you do yesterday?

525
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,810
I stayed at home all day yesterday,
Jae Suk.

526
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,930
(What a simple, clear answer.)

527
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,340
That was a simple and clear answer.

528
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:01,970
- It was simple and nice.
- How she said it was funny.

529
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,380
Can somebody make a collection
of clips where Ji Hyo says,

530
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,750
- "I stayed at home all day?"
- "I stayed at home all day."

531
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,310
- "I stayed at home all day."
- The collection of Ji Hyo's clips.

532
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,920
- That sounds funny.
- "I stayed at home all day."

533
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,150
It's a short sentence.

534
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,490
- "I stayed at home all day."
- "I stayed at home all day."

535
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,080
- That was a clear answer.
- "I stayed at home all day."

536
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,760
- We'll arrive at a grocery store.
- I see.

537
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,990
- Already? That's sad.
- It's about time.

538
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,230
In the meeting, we came up with
this idea for motivating everyone.

539
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,300
We'll buy some products
to be given as prizes.

540
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,500
- We'll get what we use at home.
- Like what?

541
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,660
- I like that idea.
- Such as detergent,

542
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,440
- toilet paper, or ramyeon.
- Good. I like that.

543
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,560
- I want to win such prizes.
- What we need in daily life.

544
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,810
- Such products will be the prizes.
- I like the idea.

545
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,170
We're out of diapers.

546
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,170
That can be a prize too.

547
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,710
But no one else but you want it, Haha.

548
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,010
- I mean, you and Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin wears diapers.

549
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,480
Only the two of you want it.

550
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,550
Suk Jin.

551
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,020
- Start crying.
- It's useless for us.

552
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,080
- And scream too.
- As I said before...

553
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,810
Pee your pants now.

554
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,960
Then we'll run away.

555
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,120
Fine! I heard you!

556
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,530
Just stop it, will you?

557
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,090
(Suk Jin showed the original version.)

558
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,030
"What did I ever do wrong?"

559
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,420
I would never yell like that
when I'm angry.

560
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,060
- That's not a cool way.
- That was hilarious.

561
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,330
Everyone, we're going grocery shopping.

562
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,630
Right. There are no rules for it.

563
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,710
Let's get enough food for us
to eat for the day.

564
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,480
- No. Hold on.
- Let's not make things complicated.

565
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,510
- Let's just have a simple meal.
- This is not an overnight trip.

566
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,250
- We shouldn't get too much food?
- Let's buy just enough food.

567
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,520
- You can get personal items too.
- Right.

568
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,380
- Just one personal item for each.
- Of course.

569
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,380
Bring one more cart.

570
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,650
- The grain syrup snack.
- Don't get too much food. Okay?

571
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,960
- The grain syrup snack.
- Don't get too much food.

572
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,260
(Haha picks up a snack
even at the entrance.)

573
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,920
- The grain syrup snack.
- Pick up what we'll actually eat.

574
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,060
- That one is good.
- You won't eat this?

575
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,090
- That one is good.
- Indeed.

576
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,800
- You guys won't eat this?
- I'll eat it.

577
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,970
- I'll eat it.
- I want M snack.

578
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,270
- It goes well with this ramyeon.
- Hey, we'll get B bibim ramyeon.

579
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,470
- Where is it?
- Gosh, seriously.

580
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,130
Have you lost your mind?

581
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,280
(Yoo Jae Suk,
the model for B bibim ramyeon)

582
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,710
How dare you pick that up in front of me?

583
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,050
Guys, we'll go get some meat.

584
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,250
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Hey, don't get too much meat.

585
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,720
- Let's go, So Min.
- Hello.

586
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,690
Hey, this one is really good, right?

587
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,610
It's just amazing.

588
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,560
My gosh.

589
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,190
You guys all have the palate of a child.

590
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,190
- Hey, stop. That's too much.
- These two too.

591
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,200
- You're not allowed to eat this.
- Haha.

592
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,700
- I love this one.
- Why did you pick so many snacks?

593
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,760
- This one is awesome.
- Hey.

594
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,000
- You mean, this?
- Your sugar level will be so high.

595
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,970
Guys, we won't stay the night there.

596
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,470
So don't buy too much food.

597
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,400
We won't cook rice, will we?

598
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,540
We should cook rice in a pot.

599
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,170
- Will we cook rice?
- Will we?

600
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,570
- Let's get some instant rice.
- Right.

601
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,600
- We don't have to cook it.
- Of course.

602
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,720
Two packs will be enough, right?

603
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,110
I think it's too much.

604
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,310
- Shall we get just one?
- Yes.

605
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,410
Hey, how about some canned ham?
It's good, right?

606
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,350
Suk Jin, don't pick up too many.

607
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,520
Canned ham is a must.

608
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,320
Suk Jin, stop putting any more food
in the cart.

609
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,380
I just put two things in it.

610
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,320
Wait. I want...

611
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,800
Se Chan, we need mushrooms too.

612
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,920
- Let's eat some beef.
- Sure.

613
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,090
- Come over here.
- Let's eat beef.

614
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,940
- Some rib fingers and...
- Boneless short ribs. This one.

615
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,500
- Right. Good. And...
- It looks good.

616
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,940
Don't pick up something to cook
through a lot of work.

617
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,440
We just have to grill beef
and eat it with some salt.

618
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,440
(Beef is good.)

619
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,210
- Put them in the cart.
- We need this.

620
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,310
I just said that because of Jae Suk.

621
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,520
Hide the meat.
Put them under the other stuff.

622
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,870
Jae Suk would complain about it
if he saw it.

623
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,370
Don't let him see it. Flip it over.

624
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,990
Put it on the bottom,
and cover it with the other stuff.

625
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,290
That's good. Cover it.

626
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,460
(Even the tough Jong Kook is worried
about what Jae Suk might say.)

627
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,850
Don't get too much food.

628
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,350
Get just enough food for the day.

629
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,760
We must not waste food.

630
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,120
Hey, we do need some bananas, right?

631
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,360
Guys, we need some bananas, right?

632
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,440
I'll put in the mushroom.

633
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,630
I don't see any cucumbers here.

634
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,660
- Can I get some coffee?
- We don't need cooking oil, right?

635
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,310
No, we don't need that.

636
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,370
Are we going to make some oil sauce?

637
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,780
What are you two doing now?

638
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,750
Why are you going around alone together?

639
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,050
The two younger people are
shopping together. That's all.

640
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,050
But why just the two of you?

641
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,110
(A romance control officer showed up
this time.)

642
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,840
- What's going on?
- There's nothing going on.

643
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,610
- What's your problem?
- Come over here.

644
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,880
- What's going on between you two?
- Se Chan.

645
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,810
(Come over here.)

646
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,460
These are mine. Don't eat them.

647
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,650
All four of them?

648
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,260
You'll eat all four of them?

649
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,420
- We have drinking water, right?
- Are you sure you won't eat this?

650
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,360
I don't see anything we should buy.

651
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,800
(Trainer Kook is very strict
with spending just like Jae Suk.)

652
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,970
What's smoked duck? Let's check it out.

653
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,740
(He showed interest in
high-protein food for the 1st time.)

654
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,440
This will be a good prize.

655
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,250
- Are you getting a razor?
- Can I get this?

656
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,810
Why would you pick up a razor?

657
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,480
This is what I really need.

658
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,050
I'll get a bottle of
windshield washer fluid.

659
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,190
(He's getting daily necessities
for personal items.)

660
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,340
- No.
- Suk Jin, I found diapers.

661
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,760
It says it won't leak.

662
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,420
Se Chan.

663
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,730
- So Min, get whatever you want.
- I want this. The whole set.

664
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,590
Guys, let's pay now.

665
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,590
Okay, Jae Suk.

666
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,470
Let's just order some delivery food
instead of buying all these.

667
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,000
Goodness, they put a lot of snacks
in the cart.

668
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,060
- Have ice cream if you want.
- Okay.

669
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,370
Eating ice cream on a bus
while chatting is fun.

670
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,070
- When we get there,
- Yes.

671
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,510
don't open everything.

672
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,450
- What we don't need is a prize.
- Right. Just in case.

673
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,450
Okay.

674
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,020
Are we going to eat right after we arrive?

675
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,220
It's part of our plan.
Suk Jin will cook for us.

676
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,230
Captain Ji said in the meeting
that he would make...

677
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,990
- cookies for you.
- Really?

678
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,990
- Cookies?
- What?

679
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,090
Is there anything you want to do
for the members,

680
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,530
like cooking?

681
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,320
- There's something I'm so good at.
- What is it?

682
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,040
I make amazing cookies.

683
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,740
- Cookies?
- My cookies are amazing.

684
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
That's so unexpected.

685
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,240
- My cookies are so good.
- Then...

686
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,270
do you make the dough too?

687
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:59,830
I have my own recipe. I use
140g of oat flour, 60g of flour,

688
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,870
and 40g of sugar
although it says to put in 60g.

689
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,640
I make cookies every single day.

690
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,870
- Because everyone likes it.
- Really?

691
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,340
My mother-in-law was so surprised
when she first tried it.

692
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,220
You will make it interesting
to watch, right?

693
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,810
I guess
I'll have to improvise something...

694
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,260
in order to make it interesting.

695
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,690
Don't worry.

696
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,960
I make people laugh so easily these days.

697
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,500
(Captain Ji said he'd make cookies
on the trip to Daeseong-ri.)

698
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,700
He said he would make cookies for you.

699
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,770
- That's right.
- Really?

700
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,330
- What?
- I don't like cookies.

701
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,300
- Just cook some ramyeon instead.
- No.

702
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,860
- I don't like cookies.
- You should try my cookies.

703
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,670
- I don't like cookies.
- I'm good at making cookies.

704
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,740
- So I'm going to make some for you.
- Why would you make cookies?

705
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,710
- He seemed confident.
- But why would he...

706
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,870
- Stop complaining and just eat it.
- We don't want to.

707
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,050
- No, we don't want to.
- You said you made a good ramyeon.

708
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,290
- Why...
- It's a healthy cookie.

709
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,380
- How about ramyeon?
- I'll make oatmeal cookies.

710
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,410
Just eat it.

711
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,560
But we don't have an oven.

712
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,850
- Sorry?
- There's no oven.

713
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,990
- I'll use an air fryer.
- We don't want to eat your cookies.

714
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,730
- You should still eat it.
- I don't want your cookies!

715
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't like cookies.

716
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I hate cookies.

717
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,890
- Cook ramyeon for us instead.
- Why should we eat your cookies?

718
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,300
You will be surprised
and enjoy my cookies.

719
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,800
- Cook ramyeon for us instead.
- Just eat it as your captain says.

720
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,590
- Also...
- My gosh.

721
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,100
I'll teach you how to make it if you want.

722
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,130
- No.
- I don't want to.

723
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,170
Come to my class.

724
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,440
- There will be a cooking class.
- We'll eat ramyeon instead.

725
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,780
- Right. We'll eat it without you.
- We'll eat ramyeon.

726
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,550
- What time is it now?
- We'll grill some meat too.

727
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,720
- Great. That sounds so delicious.
- It's 10:40 a.m.

728
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,250
- I'll eat bibim ramyeon.
- It sounds delicious. Me too.

729
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,250
I'll add some green onions.

730
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,910
- The cooking class begins at 11 a.m.
- Ramyeon with meat.

731
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,110
- I'll take care of everything.
- I won't go.

732
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,350
- I'll be a no-show.
- I refuse.

733
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,690
- No.
- I'll be a no-show.

734
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,290
A no-show? That expression doesn't
suit this situation.

735
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,500
You can be a no-show
if you made a booking.

736
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
- Say you'll boycott his cookies.
- He meant he wouldn't go there.

737
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,860
- I know.
- I'll boycott your cookies.

738
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,330
- You're not allowed to do that.
- Why?

739
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,090
- I'll boycott his cookies.
- Then just one of you should come.

740
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,130
- Just one is okay, right?
- Then I'll go.

741
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,330
- Sorry?
- I'll go.

742
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,100
- You will? Why?
- Yes.

743
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,100
I'll be a no-show...

744
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,310
- if I don't show up, right?
- Correct.

745
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,010
- That's right.
- That's exactly what it means.

746
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,140
- I'll be a no-show.
- Good.

747
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,610
- I'll be a no-show.
- Got a death wish?

748
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,020
- I'd like to book your class.
- He said, "Got a death wish?"

749
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,050
"Got a death wish?"

750
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,290
- Got a death wish?
- My goodness.

751
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,190
- Guys, I see a soccer field.
- I guess this is it.

752
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,790
- I see a basketball court too.
- We're here.

753
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,420
- Nice. We can do everything here.
- Oh, my.

754
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,880
We're going to have so much fun.

755
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,650
It's so nice here.

756
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,260
The weather is good as well.

757
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,530
- It's great.
- Let's play foot volleyball.

758
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,390
We can do that too.
There are so many things we can do here.

759
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,940
It's huge.

760
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,660
- This room looks nice.
- Hey.

761
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,830
It's really nice here.

762
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,540
- Sorry?
- It's so big.

763
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,740
- There's a karaoke machine too.
- There's a lot to do.

764
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,170
We can sing, play basketball,
and do so many other things.

765
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,280
Let's move our stuff inside.

766
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,400
- So Min.
- Yes?

767
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,310
- Come over here.
- Why do you keep calling me?

768
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,520
This is the youngest member's duty.

769
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,580
- Really?
- Yes.

770
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,720
- Jeonsobari.
- Stuff like this...

771
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,230
Let's not waste any minute
and start cooking ramyeon.

772
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,580
That's a good idea.

773
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,230
- So Min.
- I'll get changed.

774
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,350
- Go change your clothes first.
- Why are you calling me this time?

775
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,420
Hurry up and move the boxes.

776
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,820
- It's a modernized hanbok.
- That's right.

777
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,200
It's a modernized hanbok.

778
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,360
Oh, gosh. There's a huge bell out there.

779
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,100
- Can you see the bell outside?
- Yes.

780
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,310
Ring it when you think you've done
enough for one episode.

781
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,400
- Got it.
- I think...

782
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,570
- we can ring it right now.
- You see, usually,

783
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,020
- Yes.
- we play 3 games for 1 episode.

784
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,050
The 1st part is about our lunch.

785
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,670
- We can divide it into three parts.
- And...

786
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,110
we can play a sports game outside,
and then do something else here.

787
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,110
- Exactly.
- Since we're here...

788
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,580
- Captain Ji is over there.
- I mean, the cooking class...

789
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,260
- Captain Ji.
- Right. Go ahead. Tell us.

790
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,090
- He was adamant about his class.
- Let go of me.

791
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,390
- I want to play darts.
- Let's discuss...

792
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,390
- what we should do.
- Right.

793
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,700
- On the whole...
- We don't have to discuss it.

794
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,940
- We're here to have fun. Yes?
- Come on. Captain Ji.

795
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,270
- On the whole...
- Yes.

796
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,940
I mean... Why did you change
your hairstyle?

797
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,440
I got all dolled up.

798
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,310
- But, you see, So Min...
- On a group trip like this...

799
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,540
- So Min.
- Yes?

800
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,310
I'm sorry, but this isn't
a group blind date.

801
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,280
- That's not the case.
- This isn't "The Mate."

802
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,110
- I mean...
- This outfit may remind you of it,

803
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,520
- but this isn't "The Mate."
- You know... It's not like that.

804
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,220
- This isn't a dating show.
- We're on a group trip.

805
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,460
- Why are you trying to find love?
- Does anyone want to eat with me?

806
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,990
(Woman 2 came to find a man to eat with.)

807
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,150
- Anyone?
- All right.

808
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,920
It'll be lunchtime shortly, right?

809
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,500
- Yes.
- We should have lunch.

810
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,390
- How about bibim ramyeon?
- Bibim ramyeon and soupy ramyeon.

811
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,590
- Sounds great.
- I'll...

812
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,200
- I'll grill meat.
- Let's eat it with some meat.

813
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,300
I'll cook the meat.

814
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,770
- Okay. You do that.
- Yes.

815
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,160
The cooking class will be held
in the next room.

816
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,310
Go ahead and do it alone.

817
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,810
- I'd like to book it.
- I have a good idea.

818
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,010
- I'll cook ramyeon.
- I'll help him.

819
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,100
- I'll make bibim ramyeon.
- Let's do it together.

820
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,050
- You make bibim ramyeon, then.
- Who will attend his cooking class?

821
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,340
He will.

822
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,410
- All by himself?
- Yes.

823
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,310
- I don't want you to come.
- Okay. The problem is solved.

824
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,610
- Make sure not to interfere.
- You can't make cookies.

825
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,110
- Jong Kook, cook with him.
- Se Chan.

826
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,990
- Attend my cooking class.
- Grill some chicken breasts.

827
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,080
- Sure. I'll do that.
- Let's move.

828
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,350
- Let's go.
- Okay.

829
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,460
- Guys.
- Yes?

830
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,730
What about my cooking class?

831
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,700
I'll begin the class
when you guys finish eating lunch.

832
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,000
But if I grill meat there...

833
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,590
- We need a pot.
- You should grill it outside.

834
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,830
(For a short period of time
when they're cooking...)

835
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,540
(We'll show you how different
their personalities are.)

836
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,010
I think we could use a frying pan,
don't you think?

837
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,670
- I'll make cookies for you guys.
- A frying pan.

838
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,020
Let's decide how many portions
of ramyeon we'll eat first.

839
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,610
Ramyeon? I want to eat a lot.

840
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,310
- Four packets of bibim ramyeon,
- Four packets?

841
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,720
- and 3 packets of soupy ramyeon.
- We'll need more than 4 packets.

842
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,110
- Four packets are too many.
- It's not enough for us.

843
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,490
- It's too much.
- Four packets are enough.

844
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,990
- What about the soupy one?
- No, it's not enough.

845
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,620
- Let's cook just four packets.
- We'll eat soupy ramyeon too.

846
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,300
Let's finish cooking in 30 minutes.

847
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,150
- Let's do that.
- Pour water into the pot.

848
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,000
Pour 550ml of water
for 1 packet of ramyeon.

849
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,060
- With 550ml of water...
- No, that's not the ideal amount.

850
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,630
- Then pour 500ml for each.
- Okay. Got it.

851
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,310
- Four packets? Pour it four times.
- Yes.

852
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,210
Ji Hyo, pour it four times.

853
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,310
(Ji Hyo is good at cooking ramyeon,
and Jong Kook is bad at it.)

854
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,510
- Should we cook it all together?
- Okay.

855
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,070
- Good job. Okay.
- It's done.

856
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,050
(He drops the lid.)

857
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,110
(He puts in
the whole sachet of seasoning.)

858
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,820
(He's not used to cooking ramyeon.)

859
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:19,000
I'll cook bibim ramyeon.

860
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,000
We didn't buy any cucumbers, right?

861
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
- They didn't have cucumbers.
- I see.

862
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Let's boil some eggs.

863
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
(So Min will boil eggs.)

864
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,770
- Right.
- Don't make the noodles soggy.

865
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,740
So Min, you should put the eggs in
when the water starts boiling.

866
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,440
You're wrong. You should put them in
from the beginning.

867
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,670
- Gosh, seriously.
- Ramyeon...

868
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,840
You should. Or else... Seven minutes
after the water starts boiling.

869
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,220
Exactly 12 minutes
after the water starts boiling.

870
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,910
- Seven minutes to soft boil them.
- For soft-boiled eggs,

871
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,790
- it takes exactly 12 minutes.
- No, 7 minutes.

872
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,310
- No, 12 minutes.
- No, 7 minutes.

873
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,380
- No, 12 minutes.
- In total...

874
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,720
- It takes 12 minutes in total.
- It takes 7 minutes.

875
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,260
- No, 12 minutes.
- No, 7 minutes.

876
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,730
Forget it. Do whatever you want.

877
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,090
Jae Suk, why have you become so stubborn?

878
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,360
Gosh. I'm so annoyed.

879
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,770
(The 2 chefs are adamant
about how they cook eggs.)

880
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,500
Everyone.

881
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,090
(While everyone else is busy,
Captain Ji is wandering around.)

882
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,470
Flour. Where is the mixing bowl?

883
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,400
Where are the mixed nuts?

884
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,170
- I saw it in there, Suk Jin.
- Where?

885
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,950
- Check the fridge.
- Suk Jin.

886
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,910
You've been just walking around
without cooking for so long.

887
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,480
Oh, they're all in here.

888
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,490
The cooking class will begin shortly.

889
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,610
I'll be there.

890
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,610
(He will be a no-show.)

891
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,850
Since you all look busy,
I'll put my class off a little bit.

892
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,420
It will begin a little while later.

893
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,700
I'm announcing it to all of you.

894
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,390
(Staring)

895
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,820
Are you playing house?

896
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,000
(Ji Hyo walks toward the stove
with pepper.)

897
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,270
- Se Chan.
- Yes, Jae Suk.

898
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,510
- Prepare plates for bibim ramyeon.
- Why are you adding pepper?

899
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,810
It makes it tastier.

900
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:38,810
- Really?
- Yes.

901
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,900
- Jae Suk.
- Are you sure?

902
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,310
- Yes. Trust me.
- It's already in the seasoning.

903
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,810
Does pepper make ramyeon tastier?

904
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,570
- Yes, it makes the ramyeon tastier.
- Oh, I see.

905
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,280
- I didn't know that.
- Why didn't you believe me?

906
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,720
- Also...
- It wasn't like that.

907
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,310
- You didn't set the timer, did you?
- I was just curious.

908
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,760
It's easier if you put in
the seasoning from the get-go.

909
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,910
(Thinking hard)

910
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,920
- Jong Kook, it hurts my feelings.
- Did you put it in?

911
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,560
- What do you mean?
- "Why didn't you side with me?"

912
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,920
- Listen. It wasn't like that.
- "Why didn't you side with me?"

913
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,300
Was it wrong of me to ask him
because I didn't know?

914
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,540
That's not the point. When Haha told you,

915
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,770
- you believed him. "Oh, I see."
- "Why didn't you side with me?"

916
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,010
- This is so childish.
- But you didn't believe me.

917
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,010
- Are they a married couple?
- It wasn't like that.

918
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,100
- They're having a lovers' quarrel.
- That wasn't my intention.

919
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
- I was just curious.
- The seasoning is also...

920
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,950
They look like the couples on "The Mate."

921
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,170
- Pardon?
- You and Ji Hyo...

922
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,520
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Come on, Jae Suk.

923
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,380
- Don't say that.
- Aren't your numbers both one?

924
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,850
- What?
- Man 1 and Woman 1.

925
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,820
- That's ridiculous. Gosh.
- Come on.

926
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,790
Ji Hyo, I didn't know that.
Thanks for the tip.

927
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,390
- I'll add pepper...
- I'm so upset, Jong Kook.

928
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,160
- to ramyeon from now on.
- I'm serious.

929
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,660
I'll start cooking the meat!

930
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,770
(In the living room,
Se Chan is ready to cook the meat.)

931
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,360
(Sizzling)

932
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,710
I hear the rain sound.

933
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,540
It smells good.

934
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,040
Bibim ramyeon is ready. Come, everyone.

935
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,740
- Good. Let's eat.
- Hurry up.

936
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,370
- Come here.
- We should eat it with the meat.

937
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,510
Hey, Haha!

938
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,140
We're almost done here too!

939
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,570
(The bibim ramyeon man is impatient.)

940
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,520
- Hurry up!
- We're almost done!

941
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,840
Eat it before the noodles get soggy.

942
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,220
- Let's leave it and eat some.
- Hurry up!

943
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,730
- Okay.
- Let's eat some and come back.

944
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,460
- Let's go!
- Go on without me.

945
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,920
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

946
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,000
- Eat bibim ramyeon with meat.
- Let's eat.

947
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,150
- Go ahead.
- Put it into the pot.

948
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,200
- But the eggs aren't ready yet.
- Good. Put it in.

949
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,000
- Here go sea snails. Hey, So Min.
- Jae Suk.

950
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,300
- That looks good.
- I'm wearing a cooking glove.

951
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,040
(The model of the bibim ramyeon ad
will distribute the food.)

952
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,160
- Now, Suk Jin, try it.
- Yes?

953
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,540
- Se Chan, come over here.
- Okay.

954
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,540
Come here.

955
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,050
Guys, hurry up.

956
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,450
Come here now.

957
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,670
This is...

958
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,780
(You did a great job.)

959
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,790
It's good, right? Isn't it amazing?

960
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,020
(Even the cookie artisan is
impressed by the bibim ramyeon.)

961
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,260
My, it's so good.

962
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,990
Guys, come here and eat with us.

963
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,530
Hurry up and come. Eat up now.

964
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,580
Come here.

965
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,030
Eat the noodles
before they get soggy. Gosh.

966
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,350
Is this some kind of competition?
Why are we in a hurry?

967
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,390
Soupy ramyeon is done too.

968
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,860
- Have some meat.
- This is really good.

969
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,200
(Jae Suk wants them to try
the noodles while they're firm.)

970
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,470
- Hurry up.
- You should've cooked more of it.

971
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,710
We have more packets.

972
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,440
It's really good.

973
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,810
Have a piece of meat with the noodles.

974
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,640
(He starts devouring the food.)

975
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,410
Move. Make way.
Here comes the soupy ramyeon.

976
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,110
Put the meat aside.

977
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,450
- Hey, it's tasty.
- See?

978
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,810
We wouldn't spend much time on food.

979
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,350
We'd finish cooking
and eating quickly and move on.

980
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,990
- Ta-da!
- It looks amazing.

981
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,560
- You guys...
- Why didn't you shoot inserts?

982
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,820
Hurry up and shoot inserts.

983
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,890
- I'll open the lid again.
- Wrap it up quickly.

984
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,000
- It was too tough.
- Okay.

985
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,130
It's expensive.

986
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,600
(The ramyeon with green onion, eggs,
and extra pepper)

987
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,810
- It's so good. I mean it.
- It's good, indeed.

988
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,210
(The soup is refreshing
thanks to the pepper.)

989
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,840
- Ji Hyo, the soup is amazing. Yes.
- Right?

990
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,810
This is so fun. Right?

991
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,490
I'm happy that everyone is enjoying
themselves on the trip I organized.

992
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,790
We're eating here. Quiet down, will you?

993
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,490
(Everyone likes Ji Hyo's pepper recipe.)

994
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,790
The meat is cooked well.

995
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,290
(The beef is being cooked too.)

996
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,290
- Was it okay?
- The meat is tasty.

997
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,760
My, this makes my stress go away.

998
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:47,590
- Guys, try the meat.
- It's so good.

999
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,090
My, it's so tasty.

1000
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,470
This is amazing.

1001
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,890
The meat is incredibly good.

1002
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,710
We're dressed like members
of a fasting club.

1003
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,010
- That's right.
- It's so good.

1004
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,010
They wear clothes like this.

1005
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,210
Without letting the director know...

1006
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,210
(They're having a secret party.)

1007
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,950
And it's nutritionally balanced.
We have meat and everything.

1008
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,910
Oh, right. We have rice too.
Who wants rice?

1009
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:05,950
- It's here.
- Oh, you brought it here.

1010
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,610
- Do you want some?
- No, I won't eat it.

1011
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,050
- What?
- My gosh.

1012
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,310
- What was that?
- That was so unexpected.

1013
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,810
- It was so weird.
- I won't eat it. Who wants it?

1014
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,530
- I asked if anyone wanted it.
- I see.

1015
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,320
- It wasn't for you.
- Suk Jin always...

1016
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,120
puts on an act in front of cameras.

1017
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,920
And I truly believe
that he should stop doing that.

1018
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,800
I ate a lot. It was so good.

1019
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,330
I'm so full.

1020
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,740
It's amazing.

1021
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,510
- Then...
- Eat a piece of meat with it.

1022
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,040
Wait. Now that I've had lunch...

1023
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,900
- But I don't...
- It's not that hot.

1024
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,170
- Jae Suk, do you have plans later?
- Sorry?

1025
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,550
Why are you rushing everything?

1026
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,020
Jae Suk, you don't have any plans
after this, right?

1027
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,140
- Of course, not.
- The green onion is good.

1028
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,310
- I have no plans afterward.
- Right?

1029
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,580
Do you want some strawberries?

1030
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,110
- Will you wash them for us?
- Do you want some?

1031
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,110
Please wash some for us.

1032
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,290
Of course, I'll do that for you.
It's not a big deal.

1033
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,260
- Remove stems, please.
- Of course.

1034
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,000
I really enjoyed it.
But who will do the dishes?

1035
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,390
Let's play rock-paper-scissors
to decide that.

1036
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,270
Let's play a game to choose
the person to do the dishes.

1037
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,470
How about a game of wits?

1038
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,360
Let's not play the game of wits.

1039
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,160
How about this? We point at someone
and say, "You wash the dishes!"

1040
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,710
- I like the idea.
- Just say, "You wash the dishes!"

1041
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,810
- It sounds fun.
- Let's try it. It's a new game.

1042
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,480
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Let's see if it's fun to play.

1043
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,910
Why? All you have to do is say,
"You wash the dishes!"

1044
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,480
- I don't think that's fair.
- Why?

1045
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,020
I know who will be chosen.

1046
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,580
- No way. Why do you think so?
- Who do you think would be picked?

1047
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,380
Well, I think I know
what you're trying to do.

1048
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,690
- I like the idea.
- Right.

1049
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,790
It's quick and easy.

1050
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,790
- Shall we give it a try?
- Yes.

1051
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,790
- One, two, three.
- Yes.

1052
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,300
- You wash the dishes!
- You wash the dishes!

1053
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,770
(Suk Jin's prediction was right.)

1054
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,800
- I knew it.
- Guys.

1055
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,770
- Let's play 3 rounds in total.
- We'll play 3 rounds.

1056
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,770
One, two, three.

1057
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,040
- You wash the dishes!
- You wash the dishes!

1058
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,240
(You wash the dishes!)

1059
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,870
I love seeing you hold a unified front.

1060
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,640
- You.
- You.

1061
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,640
(They only come together
when teasing Captain Ji.)

1062
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:46,980
You wash the dishes.

1063
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,340
(Just then, Jae Suk turns on some music.)

1064
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,520
I love this song.

1065
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:54,020
We don't even get a minute to relax.

1066
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,530
Can't we take a break?

1067
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,290
You're making me dizzy.

1068
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,890
- What's with him?
- Beats me.

1069
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,300
Why can't we like the same music?

1070
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,500
(He moves on
before they finish their meal.)

1071
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,030
Shouldn't there be a break?

1072
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,200
(He moves on
before they finish their meal.)

1073
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,740
- He...
- It's a little sad though.

1074
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,600
I'll be back with clean strawberries.

1075
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,240
Don't forget to cut off the leaves.

1076
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,040
(Captain Ji is in charge of dessert.)

1077
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,400
It's a green onion flute.

1078
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,980
(A green onion flute)

1079
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,250
(He shakes his head.)

1080
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,920
Jae Suk's on form today.

1081
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,250
Can't we rest for at least a minute?

1082
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,610
Jae Suk, please.
Let us take a short break.

1083
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,820
Please sit still.

1084
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,060
Please!

1085
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,230
Jae Suk, let us take a break.

1086
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,500
(He won't stop despite their requests.)

1087
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,460
(They eventually get him to stop.)

1088
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,540
It's been a while since I enjoyed meat.

1089
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,540
What a blast it has been.

1090
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,630
(He got to enjoy worldly flavors.)

1091
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,880
That's what I'm talking about!

1092
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,170
(He got to enjoy worldly flavors.)

1093
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,840
Gosh, I'm full.

1094
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,210
Let me play a song for Jong Kook.

1095
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,020
("Yoo Jae Suk's Drawing Paper")

1096
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,710
No matter how much I think about it

1097
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,750
("No Matter How I Think about It"
by Sweet Sorrow)

1098
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,360
This calls for a bathroom break.

1099
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,560
(Act 2 begins.)

1100
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,820
Jae Suk, let us rest for about a minute.

1101
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,650
Jae Suk, please.

1102
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,270
Let us take a break.

1103
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,070
Give us a break!

1104
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,840
This song doesn't feature a flute.

1105
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,840
He...

1106
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,040
(The flute master can play every song.)

1107
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,130
Why is he on it
when a flute can't be heard?

1108
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,270
(Why is he on it
when a flute can't be heard?)

1109
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,570
I do

1110
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,750
What on earth is that?

1111
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,110
Are you kidding me?

1112
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,480
(Them getting together
seems out of the blue.)

1113
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,610
What is this?

1114
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,560
- Let's drink.
- So Min, are you kidding me?

1115
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,920
(They must've met at a bar.)

1116
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,130
This is out of the blue!

1117
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,630
Must you be so annoying?

1118
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,960
- What is the meaning of this?
- Look at those two.

1119
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,270
- They're hilarious.
- I thought you were Suk Jin.

1120
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,360
This is hilarious.

1121
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,230
(She's unabashed
when it comes to role-playing.)

1122
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,440
- This brings back old memories.
- Why?

1123
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,730
- Really?
- Old memories?

1124
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,730
Yes!

1125
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,860
Then I'll switch it up.

1126
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,540
Nice!

1127
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,710
(Act 3 begins.)

1128
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,710
Jae Suk.

1129
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,270
Let us rest for a minute.

1130
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,540
Please.

1131
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,270
- You're spilling water.
- It's leaking.

1132
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,340
Yoon Eun Hye!

1133
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,480
Yoon Eun Hye!

1134
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,860
(Summoned)

1135
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,420
Darn you!

1136
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,360
(He can't help but call out her name.)

1137
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,420
Only So Min gets the vibe.

1138
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,520
- It's so much fun.
- Right?

1139
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,860
What a blast.

1140
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,130
I love it.

1141
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,230
Can you play a song by Travel Sketch?

1142
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,670
- Travel Sketch?
- What did he say?

1143
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,810
Scotch Blue?

1144
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,500
- What?
- Which song by Scotch Blue?

1145
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,150
- What did he say?
- A song by Scotch Blue.

1146
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,500
I said Travel Sketch!

1147
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,210
- Sorry?
- Travel Sketch!

1148
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,570
He means Scenery of Riding Bicycle.

1149
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,710
Is it Scenery of Riding Bicycle?

1150
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,820
Play the band's song so I can reminisce.

1151
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,980
- Got it.
- Suk Jin,

1152
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,690
- we don't like the same music.
- All right.

1153
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,750
Scenery of Riding Bicycle.

1154
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,980
(He plays a different song.)

1155
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,960
(Bouncing)

1156
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,500
Darn it.

1157
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,690
This isn't what I requested.

1158
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,670
(Jae Suk sticks to songs...)

1159
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,860
(he enjoyed at the roller skating rink.)

1160
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,940
Scenery of Riding Bicycle.

1161
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,110
Scenery of Riding Bicycle!

1162
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,270
(A regular at the roller skating rink)

1163
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,400
(She knows how to sway to the rhythm.)

1164
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,270
- Scenery of Riding Bicycle!
- Scenery of Riding Bicycle!

1165
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,980
(They fool around even though
they're bad at partying.)

1166
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,650
- Scenery of Riding Bicycle!
- I to you, you to me!

1167
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,840
This isn't what I wanted.

1168
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,750
"I to You, You to Me"
by Scenery of Riding Bicycle.

1169
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,610
(Bouncing)

1170
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,420
I used to sway to this song often.

1171
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,290
This brings back memories.

1172
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,750
It was frequently played
at roller skating rinks.

1173
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,230
What about my favorite dance song?

1174
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,420
Amok!

1175
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,020
- This is a good one.
- "Rumors" by Storm.

1176
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,130
- Isn't this good?
- It's good.

1177
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,670
If you can be, be the wind

1178
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,610
- "If you can be."
- Oh, that one.

1179
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,230
So Min, bring it in.

1180
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,940
(The party girl instinctively responds.)

1181
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,400
Can't we digest the food first?

1182
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,670
- Did someone spike your food?
- I'm not kidding when I say...

1183
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,840
- that I'm close to vomiting.
- That's the spirit.

1184
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,960
(She lets it build up.)

1185
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,420
Have some strawberries.

1186
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,090
If you can be

1187
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,020
(Just party!)

1188
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,690
How can I not dance to this?

1189
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,020
But I'm seriously close to vomiting.

1190
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,500
What's with him today?

1191
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,570
- Have a strawberry.
- Thank you.

1192
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,570
A strawberry.

1193
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,860
- Have a strawberry.
- Goodness.

1194
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,960
- Go ahead.
- Is this for us?

1195
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,170
Of course. I washed them all.
Have a strawberry.

1196
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,900
- The strawberry's delicious.
- My head's spinning.

1197
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,070
This is great.

1198
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,320
I can't stop though.

1199
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,650
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

1200
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,480
Can we digest the food first?

1201
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,790
Was something odd in your food?

1202
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,860
- Did someone spike his food?
- His food?

1203
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,650
- I mean...
- He won't let us rest.

1204
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,650
I'm having a blast.

1205
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,860
I request "I to You, You to Me"
by Scenery of Riding Bicycle.

1206
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,320
I'm exhausted,

1207
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,730
- but I can't sit still.
- By SRB?

1208
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,900
- Yes, I'd like to reminisce.
- Sure thing.

1209
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,730
- Suk Jin.
- It rains

1210
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,000
"It rains."

1211
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,860
("I to You, You to Me"
by Scenery of Riding Bicycle)

1212
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,570
This song...

1213
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,540
It brings back memories.

1214
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,150
Seriously?

1215
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,820
Why are you doing this?

1216
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,980
(This scene...)

1217
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,250
He plays along with her.

1218
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,130
(The rain scene from
the movie "The Classic")

1219
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,500
(It must be acid rain
judging by his face melting.)

1220
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,730
He plays along with her.

1221
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,190
(The acid rain
is more toxic than he thought.)

1222
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,340
(The middle-aged men are eating it up.)

1223
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,460
He plays along with her.

1224
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,000
- I to you
- He plays along with her.

1225
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,230
So Min's a beast, isn't she?

1226
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,570
She can role-play every song out there.

1227
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,880
- She can role-play every song.
- No way.

1228
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,920
- This is why I like So Min.
- There's...

1229
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,920
a story behind every song.

1230
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,090
This is why I'm fond of her.

1231
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,710
This song brings me to tears.

1232
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,320
- I'm almost in tears.
- Right?

1233
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,920
Reminiscing

1234
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,560
- You were playing Zo In Sung.
- Right.

1235
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,230
It's from "The Classic."

1236
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,360
- I to you
- Please.

1237
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,690
Throw the green onion away.

1238
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,540
- Throw the green onion away.
- What's with the green onion?

1239
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,900
- Jae Suk...
- Is the green onion the issue?

1240
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,730
- What did he have that we didn't?
- Beats me.

1241
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,630
What?

1242
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,730
(The mic is tossed at him.)

1243
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,400
He took it.

1244
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,400
(He naturally receives
the green onion mic.)

1245
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,480
Seriously?

1246
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,340
(That triggers a lip-sync relay.)

1247
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,920
Pass it to Jong Kook.

1248
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,090
After this line.

1249
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,480
Haha.

1250
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,650
I to you

1251
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,170
(I to you)

1252
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,710
(Instead of dumbbells,
the singer grabs a mic today.)

1253
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,440
Pass it to Ji Hyo.

1254
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,940
(The precious)

1255
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,250
I love it!

1256
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,520
(The lip-sync relay is on point!)

1257
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,540
I love it.

1258
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:32,710
(Without regret,
let us remember it like a painting)

1259
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,150
- The song's over.
- It is.

1260
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,250
And we're done.

1261
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,560
- Next...
- Was this "I Can See Your Voice?"

1262
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,960
The song that has me on my feet.

1263
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,570
Jong Kook, Ji Hyo...

1264
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,690
Ji Hyo, we'll go with you.

1265
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,440
"You in My Blurred Memories."

1266
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,110
By Hyun Jin Young.

1267
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,230
(Jong Kook stands as the song begins.)

1268
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,380
Why can't you sit still to this song?

1269
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,170
(The role-playing expert
starts setting the tone.)

1270
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,070
Trudging around is crucial
in this performance.

1271
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,440
You can't acknowledge the song yet.

1272
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,380
We should look like we don't care.

1273
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,860
He switched over to a dumbbell.

1274
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,710
Be careful not to throw that one.

1275
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,020
Don't throw it.
We won't be able to catch it.

1276
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:12,790
Just know that
we won't be able to catch it.

1277
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,230
Don't throw it.

1278
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,900
- Not yet.
- Is that alcohol you're drinking?

1279
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,000
(The long intro is over
and now the song begins.)

1280
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,440
(Spurt)

1281
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,730
What's the matter with her?

1282
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,210
(Spraying water)

1283
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,230
- What's wrong with you?
- Seriously?

1284
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,900
I mean...

1285
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,980
Why would you shoot water at me?

1286
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,750
Seriously?

1287
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,020
(She does it once again.)

1288
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,380
- Are you kidding me?
- What's your problem?

1289
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,840
What was that?

1290
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,940
- You...
- Nicely done.

1291
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,190
Why are you doing this?

1292
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,020
That's right.

1293
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,190
That's the move.

1294
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,520
(He goes from complaining to dancing.)

1295
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,630
My feet...

1296
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,630
- I'm not kidding.
- Are you all right?

1297
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,690
Shouldn't we ring the bell?

1298
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:47,920
- All right.
- Okay.

1299
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,000
Ji Hyo's next.

1300
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,570
Keep this up and we'll ring the bell.

1301
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,790
We'll ring the bell.

1302
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:55,860
We have enough
for about 40 minutes of the show.

1303
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,480
- Only 40 minutes?
- Are you sure?

1304
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,170
We already have enough
for about 40 minutes.

1305
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,250
- Definitely.
- You know what?

1306
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,400
Let's film enough for two episodes.

1307
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,940
- What?
- Two episodes.

1308
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,380
Let's film enough for two episodes.

1309
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,820
While we're here,
let's film enough for two episodes.

1310
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,020
- At least one and a half.
- Right. One and a half.

1311
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,480
One and a half. Let's not get greedy.

1312
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,560
All right.

1313
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,420
- This is the song Haha chose.
- Which one is it?

1314
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,730
- I'm not messing around.
- Really?

1315
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,230
(Oh!)

1316
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,670
On your feet.

1317
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,270
(The intro that has our hearts pounding)

1318
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,360
On your feet.

1319
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,670
On your feet!

1320
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,000
- The Republic of Korea!
- The Republic of Korea.

1321
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,710
The Republic of Korea, on your feet.

1322
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,400
(We remember the cheers from that day.)

1323
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,540
We can do it!

1324
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,500
We've got this!

1325
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,250
The Republic of Korea!

1326
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,650
For victory

1327
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,290
(Off the rails)

1328
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,480
(A hooligan has entered the room.)

1329
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,560
Unbelievable.

1330
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,730
- For victory
- Hold on a second.

1331
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,590
You look like a prisoner.

1332
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,960
That looks like the rope
used to restrain prisoners.

1333
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:00,400
A rope used to restrain prisoners.

1334
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,460
Get him!

1335
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,360
(Arresting the hooligan has been ordered.)

1336
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,540
Unbelievable.

1337
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,630
Who spiked his food?

1338
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,810
The World Cup takes place this year.

1339
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,570
- Right.
- Yes, in November.

1340
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,320
That rope... You look like a prisoner.

1341
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,840
- Here. Check this out.
- Who's that?

1342
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,610
Can we take a break?

1343
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:19,610
(The prisoner is transported.)

1344
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,250
Look.

1345
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,920
You look like a prisoner.

1346
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,320
Check him out.

1347
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,520
That's the case for everyone.

1348
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,400
(I won't ever disobey the law again.)

1349
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,900
- Can we lie down for a bit?
- We need a break.

1350
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,670
- Exactly.
- Let's take a break.

1351
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,690
- Jae Suk.
- Let's take a break!

1352
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,270
I'm so exhausted. I'm done.

1353
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,670
Let's rest.

1354
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,110
This is the finale.

1355
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,270
Let us rest!

1356
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:41,480
(It's not over yet.)

1357
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,250
Just tell me, Suk Jin.
Should I knock him over or what?

1358
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,210
Knock him over.

1359
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,210
What do you want me to do?

1360
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,290
What should I do?

1361
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:49,840
- What's that?
- You want me to knock you over?

1362
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:54,480
All right, then. For the finale,
let us listen to Chan Hee's...

1363
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,560
- Look at him.
- song that can't stop him.

1364
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,650
A song that can't stop him.

1365
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,320
Let me ask him.
This will be the last song.

1366
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,630
- All right!
- Chan Hee's pick! Great.

1367
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,400
Chan Hee, just tell him already
and get this over with.

1368
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,840
Please choose a ballad.

1369
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,000
- I'm exhausted.
- Me too.

1370
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,400
I can't digest it.
I feel like throwing up.

1371
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,340
I learned jiu-jitsu.
Should I bring him down with a chokehold?

1372
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,360
- Go ahead.
- I can't stand it.

1373
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,130
- Please do.
- Can you calm him down?

1374
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,310
- I should make him pass out.
- I feel like throwing up.

1375
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:15,880
Can someone shut his mouth?

1376
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,380
- So? Did you get his request?
- Did you get it?

1377
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,570
I did.

1378
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,020
- But if this song starts playing,
- We need some rest.

1379
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,380
you shouldn't be behind the camera.

1380
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,320
- Suk Jin.
- You shouldn't.

1381
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,650
It's a song that can't stop you.

1382
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:25,960
Of course. You can't help but dance.

1383
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,420
It can't stop you,
so you should come on out.

1384
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,980
What is this song?

1385
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,480
(What is Chan Hee's immortal song?)

1386
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,520
(It's "In the Bus" by ZaZa.)

1387
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,150
- Bombastic!
- Let's go!

1388
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,770
Bombastic!

1389
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:37,020
This is...

1390
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,570
It's "In the Bus."

1391
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,270
(You can't help but dance to this song.)

1392
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:45,270
Hurry. You must rap.

1393
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,270
(A solo shot on Chan Hee)

1394
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:50,880
There you go.

1395
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:53,670
Chan Hee!

1396
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,420
Chan Hee!

1397
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,150
I say, Kang. You say, Chan Hee.
Kang Chan Hee!

1398
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,190
(Shout out Kang Chan Hee!)

1399
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,920
What is he doing?

1400
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,820
- What are you doing?
- What's he doing?

1401
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,900
- Hey.
- What's wrong with you?

1402
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,130
(A weird mid-aged man
behaves unpredictably.)

1403
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:16,860
- What on earth is wrong with you?
- What?

1404
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,940
I didn't throw it hard.

1405
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,210
He just loves being here.

1406
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,810
He loves that we're on an outing.

1407
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:24,480
Isn't it so nice?
Isn't it nice to be on an outing?

1408
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,670
(Suddenly acting like an idol)

1409
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:29,710
So Min, you need to put on gloves.

1410
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,960
(Laughing)

1411
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,750
(It's been a while since we last
saw her acting as an old-time idol.)

1412
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,250
(Falling)

1413
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,130
(But her age is telling on her.)

1414
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,420
Gosh, that was hilarious.

1415
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,770
That hurt.

1416
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,770
- Jae Suk, let's rest up for real.
- That was hilarious.

1417
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,630
- That was nice.
- Wasn't it hilarious?

1418
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,440
Let's play a slow song.

1419
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,630
A slow song?

1420
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:53,230
Hold on.

1421
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:54,840
Wait. What is this?

1422
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:57,000
Is it really Suk Jin's last day?

1423
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:58,440
Why are you doing this?

1424
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,150
Is that why you brought us here
to make memories?

1425
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,940
Why are you trying to break us off?

1426
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,690
- But at least...
- Don't break us off!

1427
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:06,420
We can't part ways like this.

1428
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,250
Sing with me.

1429
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,360
(A song dedicated to Suk Jin
who is leaving the show)

1430
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,860
(Because he made a slip of the tongue...)

1431
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,900
(during the opening,
he has to say goodbye now.)

1432
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,000
(They hold his hands
as they're not ready to let him go.)

1433
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,070
Everyone, come here. Don't be awkward.

1434
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:25,770
Thank you for your work.

1435
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:27,840
- I learned a lot from you.
- Finally,

1436
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,540
he picked his successor
who was born in 1971.

1437
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:33,650
- And he's leaving us soon.
- I learned a lot from you.

1438
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:34,980
Stay healthy, Suk Jin.

1439
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,610
- "Stay healthy?"
- Stay healthy.

1440
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:39,020
- Good work, Suk Jin.
- Thank you for your hard work.

1441
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:41,750
I'm only sharing this now,

1442
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,150
but Chan Hee asked
if he could be Suk Jin's successor.

1443
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,650
(He'd make a perfect successor
if age was the only condition.)

1444
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:48,770
He went...

1445
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,570
Thank you for everything.

1446
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,460
I will be... What was that?

1447
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,670
I will be... What was that?

1448
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:58,880
(What was that?)

1449
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,270
(Jae Suk ruins the grave moment.)

1450
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:02,480
It was about to reach the climax.

1451
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,250
- I was about to wrap it up.
- That was enough.

1452
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,340
He was immersed in the skit.

1453
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,440
- I was about to wrap it up.
- That was more than enough.

1454
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,040
- We did more than enough.
- We did.

1455
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,090
Let's rest up a little.

1456
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,880
- Let's clean up, and...
- Let's take a five.

1457
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,190
Let's lie down.

1458
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,860
I'm going to take a nap.

1459
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,290
He's such a rascal.

1460
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:22,520
What's wrong with him?

1461
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,900
But Jae Suk's done enough.

1462
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,340
- Right.
- I think he's done enough.

1463
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,340
Are you jumping ropes? What?

1464
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,400
My gosh. Two, three,

1465
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,130
- four...
- Look at him.

1466
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,400
- I guess I can't do that.
- You're still really healthy.

1467
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,210
What? A 50-year-old
can easily pull this off.

1468
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:39,570
Isn't it really nice?

1469
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:40,650
(Showing off his good health
by jumping ropes)

1470
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,190
- He's amazing.
- He really is.

1471
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:43,420
Go for 200.

1472
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,250
Suk Jin will try jumping 200 times!

1473
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:47,790
- He'll go for it.
- It's "Dad's Challenge!"

1474
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:50,650
- "Dad's Challenge!"
- "Dad's Challenge!"

1475
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:53,130
What if I actually jump 200 times?

1476
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:54,420
- What if you can't?
- For real?

1477
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,670
He can't even jump 50 times with this.

1478
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:56,770
It's because of this.

1479
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:57,770
- Fifty times?
- Yes.

1480
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,230
- You want to make a bet?
- A bet on what?

1481
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:00,960
- Doing the dishes.
- Okay.

1482
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,670
- Doing the dishes?
- I think he can easily jump 50.

1483
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,210
No, he'll get stuck for sure.

1484
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:05,980
Let's do it.

1485
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,500
- Let's just stick together.
- Me too.

1486
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,000
It's not easy to jump 50 times
with normal ropes.

1487
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,210
Okay, you guys...

1488
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:12,670
- If it hits the sofa in the back...
- Fifty times.

1489
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,250
Doing the dishes and the cooking class.

1490
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,590
(A bet with doing the dishes
and the cooking class at stake)

1491
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:16,940
We're all on one team.

1492
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,040
You must say, "challenge"
before you start.

1493
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,750
- You do it.
- Here I go.

1494
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:20,750
(Who will be the winner?)

1495
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:21,790
Here I go.

1496
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:23,730
- "Dad's Challenge!"
- Let's clean up the table first.

1497
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,630
- "Dad's Challenge!"
- Let's clean up the table first.

1498
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,630
- No, you don't have to.
- Still...

1499
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:29,790
I feel more stable with it.

1500
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,090
Or should we play a game
to decide who cleans up the table?

1501
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:33,960
(They start cleaning up the table
although Suk Jin said no.)

1502
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,440
- Like this?
- Not even a single person...

1503
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,460
is on my side?

1504
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,230
What is it?

1505
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:40,310
(Warming up)

1506
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,380
I'm kind of losing interest in it.

1507
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,380
Aren't you guys going to watch it?

1508
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,040
Aren't you guys going to watch it?

1509
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,250
- They are...
- Aren't you going to see him jump?

1510
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,980
- This is...
- Should I just do the dishes?

1511
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,290
Yes, let's just do the dishes.

1512
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:54,690
Jae Suk, should I just do the dishes?

1513
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,790
Just tell me how he did later.
I'll go to the restroom.

1514
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,250
I'm losing my will all of a sudden.

1515
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,290
Suk Jin, just forget it.

1516
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:03,960
What are they doing?

1517
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:06,540
Why are they paying no attention?

1518
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,460
- Let's do it.
- Go ahead and try it.

1519
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,900
I'm losing all of my interest.

1520
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,940
I'll sit over here.

1521
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,480
It's getting boring.

1522
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,400
- But I'll have to do it.
- I know.

1523
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,480
Still...

1524
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,980
(Peekaboo)

1525
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,170
(They're all distracted.)

1526
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:20,650
What's up with you?

1527
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:22,440
It's because it's too hot.
I'll put them on later.

1528
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,290
What are you...
Oh, you're jumping ropes. Okay.

1529
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,360
I didn't know what you were up to.

1530
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,090
Gosh, it's making me lose all my will.

1531
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:30,320
Challenge.

1532
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,650
("Dad's Challenge" begins
amid everyone's indifference.)

1533
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,960
(Uninterested)

1534
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,400
That's it.

1535
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,860
How many has he done so far?

1536
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,210
How many have you done?

1537
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:46,770
No one's been counting.

1538
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:49,540
(Amid everyone's indifference,
he's jumped about 20 times.)

1539
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,210
Please count for him.

1540
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,880
- Two, three, four,
- Watch out for the back.

1541
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,820
- five, six, seven, eight,
- Watch out for the back.

1542
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,110
nine... That's forty.

1543
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,520
One, two, three, four, five,

1544
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,290
six, seven, eight...

1545
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:01,290
(Will he succeed in his challenge?)

1546
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,060
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

1547
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,920
(Suk Jin succeeded in his challenge.)

1548
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,770
(Kids, Daddy's done it!)

1549
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,340
(Everyone said it'd be impossible,
but the dad pulled it off.)

1550
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,310
Suk Jin restored his health!

1551
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:20,730
All right. He finally restored it.

1552
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,250
(The dad restored his health.)

1553
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,110
(Smiling)

1554
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,020
- No way.
- That was incredible, Suk Jin.

1555
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,440
A healthy life.

1556
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,210
It was really hard toward the end.
The last two.

1557
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:33,090
You're really amazing. How did you do it?

1558
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:35,210
Look how healthy Suk Jin is.

1559
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:36,860
That's just a grasshopper.

1560
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:39,360
He looks like a master.

1561
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,290
It's so funny, Jae Suk.

1562
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,170
It looks like he'll pull off
a double under.

1563
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:48,360
(A grasshopper master who can
jump around with his skinny legs)

1564
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,570
That was hilarious.

1565
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:52,940
Shall we sing a song?

1566
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,310
No, let's rest up.

1567
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,040
Jae Suk, the weather is nice,

1568
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,570
- so why don't we go outside?
- Shall we do that?

1569
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:58,820
- I want to go out.
- Hey.

1570
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,940
- Let's go out...
- Shall we play foot volleyball?

1571
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,170
- Let's do that!
- Go!

1572
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:02,650
I never lose in foot volleyball.

1573
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:04,480
- Okay.
- I never lose in foot volleyball.

1574
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,790
Look at Suk Jin.

1575
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,960
- Be quiet.
- He's...

1576
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,730
Was his challenge for nothing?

1577
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:14,630
(They only checked his health
through jumping ropes.)

1578
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:16,500
Why is no one talking about it?

1579
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,940
He's just exhausted in the corner.

1580
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:21,190
He's the one who volunteered to do it.

1581
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,860
- We couldn't stop him.
- What is that?

1582
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,540
It was just a battle against himself.

1583
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,380
Let's go, Suk Jin.

1584
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,670
Is there a foot volleyball court?

1585
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,500
- It's right over there.
- Let's go play!

1586
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:31,310
Let's go.

1587
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,820
Haha, let's go.

1588
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:34,340
- I'm in the restroom.
- Hey!

1589
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,150
Haha is pooping.

1590
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,380
Goodness.

1591
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,110
- Hey!
- You pooper!

1592
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,690
- "Pooper?"
- He poops all the time.

1593
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,460
Wait a minute. Where did my bag go?

1594
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,020
Where is my bag?

1595
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,420
Where did my bag go?

1596
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:49,790
Where is my bag?

1597
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:50,820
It hurts so much.

1598
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:52,090
- Is it there?
- What?

1599
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,730
That's mine.

1600
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,460
What?

1601
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,400
(Inside Jae Suk's bag,)

1602
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,630
(there's a key.)

1603
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,650
(Why is there a key in his bag?)

1604
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,150
Gosh, why am I so thirsty?

1605
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:08,840
Myung Jae.

1606
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,380
(He carefully looks around for now.)

1607
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,820
Why aren't you coming out?

1608
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,110
- What is this?
- Like the sunset

1609
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:20,230
(A mysterious key)

1610
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:21,420
Gosh, that was hilarious.

1611
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,770
(Jae Suk got suspicious
after seeing the mysterious key.)

1612
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:31,770
(He begins looking around.)

1613
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,480
Can you please stop Jae Suk?

1614
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,480
Please stop him for at least ten minutes.

1615
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,210
(Meanwhile, the rest of the members
are resting on their own.)

1616
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:42,690
(But he didn't find anything.)

1617
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:44,520
Hey, bring the old man out.

1618
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,420
- Coming.
- Let's hurry up and play.

1619
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:47,980
Gosh, I'm so full.

1620
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,690
(Jae Suk, who's suspicious,
goes outside for now.)

1621
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:52,060
Let's go out.

1622
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,130
(Jae Suk, who's suspicious,
goes outside for now.)

1623
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,190
What? Are these snacks?

1624
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:01,170
(A pile of snacks)

1625
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,040
Why did they get so many snacks?

1626
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:07,130
(He searches here and there
even right before he goes outside.)

1627
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,440
(Jae Suk was searching
through the shoe rack.)

1628
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,440
What is this?

1629
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:23,300
(Right then...)

1630
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,920
(Something is hidden behind them.)

1631
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,790
(A Yoo Jae Suk Box...)

1632
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,090
(hidden on the shoe rack?)

1633
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:35,320
(Warning: Do not open.)

1634
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:38,960
(He quickly covers it for now.)

1635
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,000
What is this?

1636
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,500
Gosh, I'm so full.

1637
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,070
What's that?

1638
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:45,690
(What is that?)

1639
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:46,690
I'm so full.

1640
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,690
(Yoo Jae Suk Box, Warning: Do not open.)

1641
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:48,800
Goodness.

1642
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,880
(A box that says "Do not open")

1643
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,440
(What could be inside the box?)

1644
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,440
(After thinking for a while,)

1645
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,610
(he heads straight to the box
with the key.)

1646
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,790
(He hurriedly tries to open the box.)

1647
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,800
(There's a phone inside?)

1648
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,540
(Jae Suk opened the box
that said, "Do not open.")

1649
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,900
(And there was a phone inside?)

1650
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:32,320
(Right then, it got a text.)

1651
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,520
Because you broke the rule
and opened the box,

1652
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,480
there will be a penalty
at the end of today's race.

1653
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,690
(There will be a penalty
at the end of today's race.)

1654
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:45,000
(They were supposed to have fun
with no missions and penalties.)

1655
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,570
(But as soon as Jae Suk opened the box,)

1656
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:50,690
(a penalty was given.)

1657
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,710
Currently, there's only one person
who will get the penalty,

1658
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,210
and you will pick a penalty ball
to decide who gets the penalty.

1659
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,050
The penalty balls are hidden
all over the premises.

1660
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,820
Five balls among them are hidden
in Fiery Room on the second floor.

1661
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:10,210
Write down the name of the member
you'd like to give a penalty to...

1662
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:12,790
and put it in the box
under the bell outside.

1663
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,920
If someone rings the bell
and the race ends,

1664
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,630
the person to receive the penalty
will be decided...

1665
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:19,320
by picking the penalty ball,

1666
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,070
so you should secretly and quickly
find the penalty balls...

1667
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:25,340
and submit their names
before anyone notices.

1668
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,860
(Find the penalty balls fast
and write down the others' names.)

1669
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:32,000
(They got a penalty for opening a box.)

1670
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,710
(Jae Suk caused trouble by
opening the box out of curiosity.)

1671
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:42,380
(Approaching)

1672
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,980
What are you doing?

1673
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,290
It's just that...

1674
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,590
(Detective Kim smelled something
fishy and came right over.)

1675
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:51,800
- What is that?
- It's nothing.

1676
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,420
Is that so?

1677
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,730
(Laughing awkwardly)

1678
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,500
You came over like a demon.

1679
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,770
- Why are you...
- It's nothing.

1680
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:01,770
They were filming you, so I
thought you were up to something.

1681
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,130
It's nothing.

1682
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,400
- Is that so?
- Yes, it's nothing.

1683
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,610
(Detective Kim gets suspicious
as Jae Suk is being awkward.)

1684
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:08,980
I was wondering what you were up to.

1685
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,800
- It's nothing.
- Right?

1686
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,820
Of course.

1687
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,250
The foot volleyball court
is right next to the building.

1688
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,420
- Really?
- A small one.

1689
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,380
Darn it! This is frustrating.

1690
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,790
(Darn it! This is frustrating.)

1691
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,420
It ruined my mood all at once!

1692
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,420
(I can't believe we got a penalty.)

1693
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:26,300
- What's wrong? Is something up?
- No, it's nothing.

1694
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,300
(Detective Kim approaches him again.)

1695
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,630
It looks like something's going on.

1696
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:30,960
No, it's nothing.

1697
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,690
(Flustered)

1698
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:34,770
- What is it?
- Let's go.

1699
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,800
- Old man.
- Coming!

1700
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,500
Stop playing games and come out already.

1701
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,070
- Suk Jin!
- Jong Kook.

1702
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:43,000
Why didn't you tell me to come out
when you saw me?

1703
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,800
You just met my eyes.

1704
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,170
- Hey, tell her to come out.
- Jong Kook!

1705
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,590
What? Come on out!

1706
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:51,520
Why didn't you invite me out?

1707
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:53,190
- So Min.
- Yes?

1708
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,360
- You should get some rest.
- No.

1709
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,790
So Min, get some rest.

1710
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:59,230
Jong Kook. Can you kick the balls?

1711
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,250
Shall I?

1712
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,520
Here we go.

1713
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,630
(They all gather
at the foot volleyball court.)

1714
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:07,040
- What is that?
- A ball. Let's play with this.

1715
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,960
Let me see. It's...

1716
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,710
What's that?

1717
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:12,500
We can't play with it.
It could hurt your foot.

1718
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,610
(Screaming)

1719
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:15,770
We can't play with that.

1720
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:18,550
- It'll hurt your foot.
- It'll hurt your foot.

1721
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:19,920
I almost sprained my ankle.

1722
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,150
You should use your hands with this.

1723
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:25,980
(What is this?)

1724
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,090
You should use your hands.

1725
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:28,880
That was so cunning.

1726
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,360
- Move!
- So Min, come over here.

1727
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,190
So Min, look.

1728
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:35,860
- Do you have one too?
- What is that?

1729
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,800
It was in my bag. Take a look at yours.

1730
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,090
- Really?
- Yes.

1731
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:41,710
What is this?

1732
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:43,710
(There's a key in everyone's bag?)

1733
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,170
What is this?

1734
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:47,130
- Does everyone have it?
- I bet.

1735
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,900
Jong Kook.

1736
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:51,380
Can you open your bag?
Is there a key in yours?

1737
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:52,570
- What?
- Open it.

1738
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:56,090
- What is this?
- What's this?

1739
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,880
What's wrong? What's going on?
What did you get?

1740
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,110
(The members have smelled
something fishy going on.)

1741
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,150
- What is it?
- Open your bag.

1742
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,190
Do you have one in yours too?

1743
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,960
- In the front.
- Wait a minute. What is this?

1744
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,590
Open it. This one.

1745
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:09,690
- I wasn't thinking about it.
- She has one too.

1746
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:11,300
- What?
- What is this?

1747
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,170
- What's this?
- What's this?

1748
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:14,800
- What is it?
- A key.

1749
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,900
It must be a car key.

1750
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,360
Car keys don't look like this.

1751
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,710
Jae Suk's been acting weird.

1752
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,710
Earlier, Jae Suk was...

1753
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,710
reading a text on the phone...

1754
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,940
- and said, "This is frustrating."
- What is this?

1755
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:28,150
Something's up with Jae Suk.

1756
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:30,380
- It's a mission.
- There's a mission. Darn it.

1757
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,110
- Something's going on.
- Yes, there is.

1758
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:34,090
- Who came up with this?
- Something's up with Jae Suk.

1759
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,460
Jae Suk, you're up to something,
aren't you?

1760
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,880
Since Jae Suk gets flustered
when he gets busted,

1761
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,860
- let's just play.
- Where did your energy go?

1762
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:40,900
- Where did your energy go?
- Just admit it.

1763
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,900
Jae Suk, where did all your energy go?

1764
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,170
- Look at him.
- Where did your energy go?

1765
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:45,460
- He's flustered. Mister!
- Mister!

1766
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,770
Are you flustered?

1767
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:48,570
- Is something going on?
- Where did your energy...

1768
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:51,770
Didn't you blow on
the green onion earlier?

1769
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:53,170
Something's going on!

1770
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,800
- Let's just play.
- Let's play for now.

1771
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,900
Since Jae Suk gets flustered
when he gets busted,

1772
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:57,900
let's just play.

1773
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:00,920
Let's have Se Chan and Haha
on different teams.

1774
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,480
Jong Kook and I
will be on different teams,

1775
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,980
and Suk Jin and Ji Hyo
will be on different teams.

1776
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,210
- Okay.
- That'll do, right?

1777
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,590
Then I'll bet on Jong Kook's team.

1778
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:09,360
- Okay.
- Let's play!

1779
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,750
- Mine!
- That's good.

1780
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,690
- That's great.
- Ji Hyo.

1781
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,800
- Pass it over. That was great.
- Gosh.

1782
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,270
- All right!
- All right!

1783
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,000
Our spy is doing well!

1784
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,040
- All right.
- Okay.

1785
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,340
Hey, I'm not...

1786
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,900
- Let's just play with him for now.
- Hey.

1787
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,110
- I'm not a spy.
- Let's just play.

1788
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:27,110
Haha!

1789
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:28,610
(They resume the game
while keeping watch on the spy.)

1790
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:29,610
- We got it.
- Should I just kick it over?

1791
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:30,880
- Seok Sam!
- No.

1792
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,710
- All right.
- It's out.

1793
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:33,750
It's in.

1794
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,610
(Standing still)

1795
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:36,690
It's in.

1796
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:38,290
You see?

1797
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,250
It's out.

1798
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,690
Hey, why can't you serve?

1799
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:46,400
Hey, be honest. Who's having fun here?

1800
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,000
(Be honest. Who's having fun here?)

1801
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,300
(Who's having fun here?)

1802
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,730
- I can't focus.
- Hey.

1803
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:54,000
We can't focus on the game.

1804
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,110
- This isn't any fun.
- Right.

1805
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:57,960
- Because we're thinking too much.
- Just play it.

1806
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,270
I'm not a spy!

1807
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,610
- It's not fun.
- I can't focus.

1808
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:03,980
- Let's resume.
- I can't focus on the game.

1809
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,880
- What's with the key?
- We can't focus.

1810
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,070
- I know.
- I really want to know.

1811
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,110
- What's with the key?
- It's no fun!

1812
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:09,420
- Give us five minutes.
- I can't focus.

1813
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,340
Give us free time for five minutes.

1814
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,520
- Let us have some free time.
- Then...

1815
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,590
- let's do this.
- Let us have five minutes.

1816
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:15,590
The team that wins five points first...

1817
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:16,750
gets to leave.
The losing team remains here.

1818
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,050
- Okay, let's do that.
- You get to leave.

1819
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:19,960
- That's a great idea. It's set.
- It's set.

1820
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,400
- That's a great idea!
- Isn't it?

1821
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,630
- Okay.
- All right.

1822
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:24,590
The team that gets five points
first can go around.

1823
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:25,590
- Okay.
- Okay.

1824
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,000
I want to win fast and go around.

1825
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,710
Gosh, I'm so rushed. I'm nervous.

1826
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:29,800
- Five points.
- Hurry.

1827
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,860
Let's start.

1828
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,880
(That's how the game with
free time at stake started.)

1829
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:32,880
Nice.

1830
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,880
- Ji Hyo, you should get it.
- Okay.

1831
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,980
- Darn it!
- What was that?

1832
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:40,110
(Tightrope walking on the net)

1833
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:42,610
- What was that?
- We won.

1834
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:43,750
That's it!

1835
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,690
We got it. Great.

1836
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:47,050
Use your head.

1837
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:50,230
- Use your head.
- Hey.

1838
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,250
(A new kind of foot volleyball)

1839
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,360
That went out anyway.

1840
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,050
- Nice!
- Yes!

1841
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,420
- Good. We won.
- Let's go.

1842
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,570
- We'll get going.
- Count the time.

1843
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,960
Start the clock.

1844
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:00,770
- What could it be?
- Get ready.

1845
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:01,800
Go!

1846
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,960
Something we can open with a key?
Isn't this one?

1847
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,130
Make sure to cut it at five minutes sharp.

1848
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:07,440
If they don't come back,
we'll serve right away.

1849
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,550
If they don't come back
after five minutes, we'll serve.

1850
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:12,320
(He's suspicious of Jae Suk.)

1851
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,270
I can't freely enjoy the trip anymore.

1852
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:17,210
I thought we were having
an outing for a change.

1853
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,790
(Suk Jin tries to look for something.)

1854
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:24,320
Gosh, there's nothing.

1855
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,150
There must be nothing here.

1856
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,860
Where could a lock be?

1857
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,300
(The only clue they have
is the key they found.)

1858
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,230
It wouldn't fit this lock, would it?

1859
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:34,230
(It wouldn't fit this lock, would it?)

1860
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,770
- Which one?
- This one.

1861
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:38,130
(They're trying to find the locks
they can open with the key.)

1862
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:39,270
I don't think that'd fit.

1863
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,270
(So Min has no idea either.)

1864
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:42,610
Why did they give us the keys?

1865
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:44,000
(So Min has no idea either.)

1866
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,020
Why is there lighting here?

1867
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:51,380
Why do you think there's lighting here?

1868
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,590
They installed lighting here...

1869
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:57,690
(Detective Kim searches the area as
he finds the lighting suspicious.)

1870
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:00,520
(He spots something.)

1871
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:02,590
("The number of people
who'll get the penalty?")

1872
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:05,170
"The number of people
who'll get the penalty?" Hey!

1873
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:06,900
("The number of people
who'll get the penalty"...)

1874
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,610
(is written on the clock.)

1875
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,540
It's pointing to one o'clock.

1876
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:13,170
(And the clock is pointing
to one o'clock.)

1877
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:16,440
(Jae Suk couldn't resist
the temptation...)

1878
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,980
(and opened the box.)

1879
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:23,710
(A penalty was given right away.)

1880
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:26,520
(Currently, there's only one person
who will get the penalty.)

1881
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,460
There's only one who'll get the penalty?

1882
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,360
(Jong Kook found out about the clock
that shows the number of people...)

1883
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,420
(who will get the penalty.)

1884
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,590
Se Chan.

1885
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:35,690
(who will get the penalty.)

1886
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:36,770
Se Chan.

1887
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:41,730
(Meanwhile, Se Chan is searching
a different place.)

1888
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:54,670
(He takes out a box in the kitchen
like it's the most natural thing.)

1889
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,340
(During the break a moment ago)

1890
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,690
Have some strawberries.

1891
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:01,480
(Se Chan was giving snacks
to the staff members.)

1892
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,880
Do you want anything? Do you want snacks?

1893
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,090
(Do you want anything?
Do you want snacks?)

1894
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:07,650
(He looked for snacks in the kitchen.)

1895
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,590
(His movements became erratic
as if he had found something.)

1896
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:18,630
(Then he took out a box.)

1897
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,070
(Yang Se Chan Box, Warning: Do not open)

1898
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:28,940
(Yang Se Chan Box had the same warning.)

1899
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,610
There is no key.

1900
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:33,480
(There is no key.)

1901
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:38,290
(He revisited the place
after finding the key.)

1902
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,360
(He opens the box.)

1903
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,460
What is this?

1904
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:43,860
(Se Chan secretly opened the box!)

1905
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,000
What is this?

1906
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,730
(Se Chan secretly opened the box!)

1907
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:48,500
Hey, the bell...

1908
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:50,400
There is nothing.

1909
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,230
(He takes the phone inside the box
and hides in a room.)

1910
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:54,670
There is nothing.

1911
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,770
You are the second person...

1912
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:59,480
who broke the rule and opened the box.

1913
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:03,250
Due to the first rule breaker,
the penalty came to be.

1914
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,150
Due to you, the second rule breaker,

1915
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,960
the number of people who will get
the penalty increased to two.

1916
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:12,190
Today, penalty balls will be picked
to decide who gets the penalty.

1917
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:16,320
Five among the hidden penalty balls
are at the commissary.

1918
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,270
(The secret of today's race)

1919
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,040
What is this?

1920
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,900
(All members have a mystery box
at different places.)

1921
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,170
(If you fail to resist temptation...)

1922
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:29,610
(and open the box with the key,)

1923
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:33,880
(the number of people who will get
the penalty goes up.)

1924
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,020
(Submitting the penalty balls
with other members' names...)

1925
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,150
(gives you an advantage in this race.)

1926
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:39,460
(Only Jae Suk and Se Chan
know about this hidden mission.)

1927
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:40,860
This is driving me crazy.

1928
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:43,630
(Only Jae Suk and Se Chan
know about this hidden mission.)

1929
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:45,190
Suk Jin.

1930
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,550
It says "The number of people
who will get the penalty."

1931
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,800
- Where?
- Over there by the cuckoo clock.

1932
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:51,730
- People who will get the penalty.
- The clock

1933
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:53,460
- There is something about this.
- People who will get the penalty.

1934
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,500
People who will get the penalty.

1935
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:56,630
- It's pointing to two o'clock.
- What?

1936
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:58,840
- It was pointing to 1 o'clock.
- It's pointing to 2 o'clock now.

1937
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:01,110
- It's pointing to two o'clock.
- What?

1938
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:03,270
- It was pointing to 1 o'clock.
- It's pointing to 2 o'clock now.

1939
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:08,250
(The clock is pointing to 2 o'clock now.)

1940
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,590
Was it pointing to 1 o'clock?
The hand was at 2 when I saw it.

1941
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:11,710
Did you move the hand?

1942
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:13,860
- The cuckoo comes out.
- Why is the hand at two?

1943
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:16,920
(Se Chan heads over to the clock.)

1944
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,320
- When the cuckoo comes out,
- It's about the number.

1945
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:22,360
it might have the number in its mouth.

1946
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,570
No way. Since the hand is at two,

1947
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:25,730
- the number is 2.
- Is the number 2?

1948
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:26,900
The number must be two.

1949
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,960
- The number of people...
- Hold on.

1950
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,210
The hand moved from 1 to 2
in a matter of minutes...

1951
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:32,940
after Se Chan came to me.

1952
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:34,170
- Really?
- Yes.

1953
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,940
- You...
- What about me?

1954
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,110
You did something.

1955
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:38,250
- Jong Kook.
- What did you do?

1956
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,340
- It's not like that.
- Sit down.

1957
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,670
- Some people will get the penalty.
- Sit down.

1958
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,770
- Why?
- Sit down.

1959
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,210
Listen, Jong Kook.

1960
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,340
Talk. What is this about?

1961
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:47,020
(Se Chan is unsure
how much he should reveal.)

1962
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:48,210
- I will tell you honestly.
- Okay.

1963
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:49,550
- Talk.
- I did find something.

1964
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:51,190
- You found something.
- That's right.

1965
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,690
- You guys need to find it too.
- What do we need to find?

1966
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:53,920
- Tell us what we need to find.
- What is it?

1967
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,920
- What comes with a key? A lock.
- What is it?

1968
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,320
- That's right.
- You guys need to find that lock.

1969
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,690
- But what is it?
- What's inside the lock?

1970
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:02,860
You can decide
if you want to open it or not.

1971
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,000
Just find the lock.

1972
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:05,500
Why is time passing so slowly?

1973
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,710
Why is five minutes so long?

1974
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,400
Why is five minutes so long?

1975
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:11,070
How many minutes passed?
Let's get ready to attack.

1976
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:13,020
All right. You have 30 seconds.

1977
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:14,110
(30 seconds remaining.)

1978
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:17,340
Five among the hidden penalty balls
are at the commissary.

1979
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:20,250
Okay.

1980
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:21,880
This must be a penalty ball.

1981
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,420
(Se Chan found a penalty ball
at the commissary.)

1982
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,130
Ten seconds!

1983
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:27,590
(10 seconds remaining.)

1984
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,670
Why is there a hole?

1985
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,570
(Detective Kim found
a hole for the penalty balls.)

1986
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:37,940
Why is there a hole?

1987
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:39,710
Are we supposed to put something in here?

1988
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:40,730
(Detective Kim found
a hole for the penalty balls.)

1989
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,400
- Let's go.
- Let's begin.

1990
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,750
Se Chan, we will begin.

1991
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,250
- All right.
- Hurry over here.

1992
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:46,520
Hurry over here.

1993
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:48,420
There is nothing.

1994
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,980
There is nothing.

1995
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:50,980
(Se Chan doesn't move away
from the commissary.)

1996
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:53,790
Why is no one coming?

1997
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,960
(No one is coming.)

1998
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,150
- I don't think they are coming.
- They aren't listening.

1999
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:59,250
They should listen.

2000
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:00,900
Why aren't they listening?

2001
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,230
Then why did I wait?

2002
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:05,320
- I don't think they are coming.
- Are you going to ignore the rules?

2003
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:07,460
- I don't think they are coming.
- I am going to leave.

2004
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,460
- I am going to leave too.
- What are you doing?

2005
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:10,670
What are you doing?

2006
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:12,730
What are you doing?

2007
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:16,050
- What is this?
- Only we followed the rules.

2008
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:17,670
(All members began to walk around.)

2009
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:20,270
All right.

2010
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:21,840
Suddenly...

2011
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,550
(Haha and JI Hyo begin
to search the place.)

2012
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:24,940
Did you search here?

2013
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:27,650
I don't know what's going on.

2014
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:29,520
I haven't searched so cluelessly
in a while.

2015
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,650
(Jae Suk gets started with the mission.)

2016
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,900
Five balls among them are hidden
in Fiery Room on the second floor.

2017
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,770
(Fiery Room)

2018
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:42,070
This is nerve-racking.

2019
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:44,000
(He enters the Fiery Room
to find the penalty balls.)

2020
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:53,320
(He acquires 1 penalty ball
upon entering.)

2021
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:56,050
The text said
there are five penalty balls.

2022
01:07:57,590 --> 01:07:59,420
(1 more penalty ball)

2023
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,380
(He finds another one.)

2024
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:03,550
Good.

2025
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:08,360
(Meanwhile, Se Chan...)

2026
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,300
(writes a name on the penalty balls
he found earlier.)

2027
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:17,000
(He put down So Min and Haha's names.)

2028
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,710
(He submitted the penalty balls.)

2029
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:24,400
(They sail through the mission
with the information they gained.)

2030
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,570
Where are the other penalty balls?

2031
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:30,210
(So Min searches the hole
for the penalty balls.)

2032
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:32,560
(What is this?)

2033
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:34,790
Why is there a hole?

2034
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:35,980
(Why is there a hole?)

2035
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,000
Am I supposed to put it in here?

2036
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:41,520
Like this?

2037
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,560
(It's her key!)

2038
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,300
(She drops the key through the hole.)

2039
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:51,360
(Even the production crew
gets startled by her action.)

2040
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:52,430
Is it wrong?

2041
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:55,100
(She made the mistake
of dropping her key.)

2042
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:56,270
There is a hole.

2043
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:59,220
(Thus, she lost
the crucial piece of the race.)

2044
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:01,610
(Meanwhile, Suk Jin)

2045
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:02,810
What is this?

2046
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:06,290
(He found a penalty ball.)

2047
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,810
(He puts it back.)

2048
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:10,890
(It's a complete mess.)

2049
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,890
(Haha is searching the room
on the 2nd floor.)

2050
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,730
(He finds Suk Jin's box.)

2051
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:23,010
(Glancing over)

2052
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,810
(He hides the box
in the guise of his belly fat.)

2053
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:33,570
(Haha hides Suk Jin's box!)

2054
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:35,890
There is a pen.

2055
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,420
- Seriously.
- I think this is...

2056
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,260
Will there be a poll?

2057
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:41,650
(A pen?)

2058
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:42,790
What's going on?

2059
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:44,390
I don't have a clue.

2060
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:45,890
(They stick together and guess
that there might be a poll.)

2061
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,390
Is the hole for the ping pong balls?

2062
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:48,560
That hole?

2063
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,000
I saw ping pong balls earlier.

2064
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,190
- You might be right.
- It's the size of a ping pong ball.

2065
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:53,690
- Right?
- Yes.

2066
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,360
That must be it.
You are supposed to put something.

2067
01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:59,040
You are supposed to put something
like a member's name.

2068
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,400
I saw ping pong balls earlier.

2069
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,680
I see that you are supposed...

2070
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:04,550
- to write names on them.
- Is that it?

2071
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,380
(The two of them make perfect deductions!)

2072
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:08,810
Are we supposed to put
ping pong balls in there?

2073
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:11,550
What should I do?
I put my key in there. Oh, no.

2074
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:13,390
How will I get it out?

2075
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:14,810
(She belatedly gets a reality check.)

2076
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:18,560
(She looks, but the key is
already inside the box.)

2077
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,800
What should I do?

2078
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,190
I need to get my key out.

2079
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,760
I need to get my key out.

2080
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:26,640
There were ping pong balls. I saw them.

2081
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,560
(He finds something.)

2082
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,040
There were ping pong balls.

2083
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:35,810
(He takes out the key from his bag.)

2084
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:38,570
(He takes out the box.)

2085
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:40,810
(However,)

2086
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:44,390
(It doesn't open!)

2087
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:50,020
(It's Song Ji Hyo Box.)

2088
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:51,390
There is a box
that is dedicated to each member.

2089
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:52,690
Suk Jin.

2090
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:54,520
Yoo Jae Suk Box.

2091
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,890
(Suk Jin finds
Yoo Jae Suk Box at the same time.)

2092
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:57,220
Jae Suk opened it.

2093
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,930
There is a box
that is dedicated to each member.

2094
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,430
"Do not open."

2095
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,010
Suk Jin, Jae Suk opened it...

2096
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:05,060
and received a text.

2097
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,180
- A text?
- Then...

2098
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:08,040
- he groaned.
- Really?

2099
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,210
- I guess you shouldn't open it.
- Is that it?

2100
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:13,140
- I guess you shouldn't open it.
- It says "Do not open."

2101
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,310
I won't open it.

2102
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:15,550
Where is Ji Hyo?

2103
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:16,850
(He wants to tell Ji Hyo about her box.)

2104
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:18,110
Where is Ji Hyo?

2105
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:19,890
I found Ji Hyo's box,
so I want to tell her about it.

2106
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:20,920
Where did she go?

2107
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,090
I am here.

2108
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:24,590
Your box is in the room.

2109
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:25,680
(Jong Kook gives her
the location of her box!)

2110
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,460
It's in the room.

2111
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:28,720
(Jong Kook gives her
the location of her box!)

2112
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:30,860
What?

2113
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:33,140
(She finds the box.)

2114
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:38,430
My name is on it.

2115
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,010
(Song Ji Hyo Box, Warning: Do not open)

2116
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:44,880
(The warning says, "Do not open.")

2117
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:49,420
(What will be Ji Hyo's decision?)

2118
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:54,650
(Clicking)

2119
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:58,980
(She opens the box.)

2120
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:04,100
(Ji Hyo ended up opening the box.)

2121
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:06,340
(Thus, the number of people...)

2122
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:07,470
It's a cell phone.

2123
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,430
(who will get the penalty go up by 1.)

2124
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:10,930
Seriously.

2125
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:14,010
- Hey, the number... Suk Jin.
- What?

2126
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:16,050
The number rose to 3.
The clock is pointing to 3 o'clock.

2127
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:17,510
- Is it pointing to three o'clock?
- People who will get the penalty?

2128
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:19,050
(People who will get the penalty?)

2129
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,140
What is this?

2130
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,310
It does say, "The number of people
who will get the penalty."

2131
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:23,390
(The clock is pointing to 3 o'clock.)

2132
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:24,420
What is this?

2133
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:25,960
(Jae Suk found out belatedly...)

2134
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,480
Will three people receive the penalty now?

2135
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,810
(that the number of people...)

2136
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:30,060
This is bad.

2137
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,180
(who will receive the penalty can go up.)

2138
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:33,560
Gosh, this...

2139
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:35,800
If all boxes get opened,
everyone will get a penalty.

2140
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,670
So Min, don't open it.

2141
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,340
Listen.

2142
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,600
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

2143
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,600
Don't open it.

2144
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,040
- Is it better if I don't open it?
- Don't open the box.

2145
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,470
What is it? You know, right?

2146
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,710
- What is it?
- Don't open it.

2147
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:47,100
I know you will open it
if I tell you not to do it.

2148
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,510
- I don't have the box.
- I didn't open mine.

2149
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:49,600
I don't have the key.

2150
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:52,140
- I will write it down. Whatever.
- Suk Jin, don't open it.

2151
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,470
Ji Suk Jin.

2152
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:55,720
I am sure it's a good thing.

2153
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,750
Don't open it.

2154
01:12:56,750 --> 01:13:00,090
(Suk Jin suddenly writes
his name on the ping pong ball!)

2155
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:01,220
Why did you write down your name?

2156
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,460
Just because. I am sure it's a good thing.

2157
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:03,960
Why did you write down your name?

2158
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:06,690
- Just because.
- Aren't these penalty balls?

2159
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:09,260
People whose names are written
will be exempt from the penalty.

2160
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,170
Don't open more locks.

2161
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:12,930
- I won't do it.
- Don't open more locks.

2162
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,140
Is it bad to open it?

2163
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,140
It's bad to open it.

2164
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,310
- I am so curious.
- We can tell them, can't we?

2165
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,930
- Should we tell them?
- We will lose if they open theirs.

2166
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:21,140
- We should tell them.
- Okay.

2167
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:22,340
- Hey.
- Don't open the locks.

2168
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:23,940
- Don't open more locks.
- Why not?

2169
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:25,970
- We shouldn't do that.
- I will tell you.

2170
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:27,610
- If you open the locks,
- The number...

2171
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:29,070
- more people will get the penalty.
- Right?

2172
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:30,420
I knew it.

2173
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,290
- Don't open more locks.
- Stop opening them.

2174
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:34,090
Hold on. How many people opened the locks?

2175
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:35,890
- The hand was at one at first.
- One,

2176
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:37,060
- two...
- You opened it.

2177
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:38,130
Three locks have been opened.

2178
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:40,130
The hand was at one at first.

2179
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:42,430
I am telling you not to open them
because I know the rules.

2180
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:44,100
You should have told us sooner.

2181
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,260
Seriously.

2182
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:47,170
- I didn't know what was happening.
- Why did you hide information?

2183
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:48,860
- All right.
- What are the ping pong balls for?

2184
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,470
- What?
- What are the ping pong balls for?

2185
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:52,900
Are they for an exemption
or receiving the penalty?

2186
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:53,900
- Exemption.
- Exemption.

2187
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:54,900
That's right.

2188
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,270
(They lie right away.)

2189
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:58,440
Exemption? Okay.

2190
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,550
I did the right thing
by writing down my name.

2191
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:01,070
- Exemption?
- Yes.

2192
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:03,010
- Are you sure?
- If you see a ping pong ball,

2193
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:04,850
write down your name.

2194
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:05,920
- Are you certain?
- Yes.

2195
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,220
- I don't think that's the case.
- We can't trust him.

2196
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:08,760
- What are you going to do then?
- We can't trust him.

2197
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,560
- Whom will you trust then?
- We can't trust him.

2198
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,930
- They are for the penalty.
- His reaction is suspicious.

2199
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:14,560
In that case, you should open it.

2200
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,130
- Okay.
- Open it and share information.

2201
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:18,630
- If you open the lock...
- Don't open it.

2202
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:19,730
- Be honest.
- Don't do it.

2203
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:21,470
- Be honest.
- I am too curious.

2204
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:22,710
If you open it...

2205
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:24,540
If you open it,
all of us will receive a penalty.

2206
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,510
- Listen to it.
- The ping pong balls will be null.

2207
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:28,730
- What's inside the box?
- All of us will die!

2208
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:30,710
So whose name do we need to write down?

2209
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:31,810
All of us will die!

2210
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:33,220
- Write down other people's names.
- Don't open the locks.

2211
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,680
Write down other people's names, okay?

2212
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:36,350
Write down other people's names.

2213
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:39,050
- I am too curious.
- If we get hung up on this matter,

2214
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:40,760
- it won't be good. Let's go inside.
- And play the game?

2215
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:41,760
(No way.)

2216
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,850
- Jae Suk, get some rest.
- Hey.

2217
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,680
What kind of noodles did he get?

2218
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,600
- Stop it.
- How could you think of the game?

2219
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,630
Let's have tea time.

2220
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:50,860
- Okay.
- Tea time.

2221
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:52,220
Come inside.

2222
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:55,140
Had you guys stayed still,
no one would have gotten...

2223
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,430
the penalty today.

2224
01:14:57,810 --> 01:14:58,930
Why did you open the box?

2225
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:02,680
There were a key and a box.
We couldn't help but open it.

2226
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,850
- That's right. You were curious.
- There was a warning too!

2227
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:06,270
Where is it?

2228
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:07,440
Gosh.

2229
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:09,050
Seriously.

2230
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,550
I am so curious.

2231
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:14,420
I am at that age
where I am really curious.

2232
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:15,890
- Who?
- Me.

2233
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,350
(While the others are resting,
Haha and Ji Hyo come outside.)

2234
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:19,760
Will you write down Se Chan's name?

2235
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,390
(Haha writes down Se Chan's name
on 2 penalty balls.)

2236
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:23,630
Do you have two?

2237
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,560
I have more.

2238
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,840
Yoo Jae Suk.

2239
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,730
(What's the name on Haha's third ball?)

2240
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:32,600
- I will write down Se Chan's name.
- This is my third ball.

2241
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:35,230
- I have more.
- Really?

2242
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,210
That's incredible.

2243
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:39,470
You should write Se Chan's name.

2244
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:41,640
I will write down your name.

2245
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,720
Haha.

2246
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,110
Haha.

2247
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:45,550
- Don't be like that.
- All right.

2248
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:47,560
- Haha.
- Go and find my box.

2249
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:49,850
- Okay?
- Haha.

2250
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:51,460
I really sound like a thug.

2251
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:53,690
You are such a thug.

2252
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:56,260
- Come on.
- But it was so much fun.

2253
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,360
Ji Hyo.

2254
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,430
- Haha.
- I will write down your name.

2255
01:15:58,430 --> 01:15:59,840
- I am sorry. I will be good.
- Ji Hyo.

2256
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,430
I will be good. I am serious.

2257
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,810
(So Min was searching the barbecue spot.)

2258
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:08,510
(Gasping)

2259
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:14,070
(Seh finally found her box.)

2260
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:16,640
What should I do? I don't have the key.

2261
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,640
I thought I was supposed
to put it in there.

2262
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,390
I will keep it here for a second.

2263
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,510
What should I do?

2264
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:23,260
I can't open it, right?

2265
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,960
Where could my box be?

2266
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,320
(Haha hasn't found his box yet.)

2267
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:31,760
(He looks around the place.)

2268
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,360
(He spots a moving camera.)

2269
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,770
(He communicates with the staff
who is moving the camera.)

2270
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:43,510
(Is this the place?)

2271
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:46,750
(Nodding)

2272
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:49,790
It has been a while, okay?

2273
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:53,150
(He finds a penalty ball.)

2274
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:57,460
(Haha found 6 penalty balls.)

2275
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,060
(Kim Jong Kook)

2276
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:01,190
I wrote down everyone's name.

2277
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:05,500
I am good at finding these balls.
Why can't I find my box?

2278
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,510
(Jae Suk writes something at a corner.)

2279
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:12,600
(He submits two balls.)

2280
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:19,380
(Being the 1st one to open the box,
Jae Suk knows the exact rules.)

2281
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:25,920
(He writes down the members' names
and submits the penalty balls.)

2282
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:28,150
If we ring the bell, the game will end.

2283
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:29,180
Shall we just ring the bell?

2284
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:31,650
- Shall we do it?
- Se Chan is torn about it too.

2285
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:33,600
I think I should write down names
and submit the balls.

2286
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,430
Whose name should I write?
My name or someone else's name?

2287
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:37,760
(Suk Jin is still unsure.)

2288
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,640
I don't know
if I should write down my name.

2289
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:42,470
I don't think I will be able
to resist opening the box.

2290
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:44,010
I want to find my box and open it.

2291
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:45,010
(He is really curious
about the real rules.)

2292
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:49,600
Should I bring Suk Jin's box
and see what happens?

2293
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,680
Whose box?

2294
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:53,880
(Haha brings out
Suk Jin's box he hid before.)

2295
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,940
It holds, right?

2296
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:57,090
- Yes, it does. It's nice.
- Suk Jin, your box is here.

2297
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:58,510
Where? Give it to me.

2298
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:00,350
Let's open it.

2299
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:03,630
- Suk Jin, don't open it.
- Maybe you shouldn't open it.

2300
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,460
Then more people will get the penalty.

2301
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:08,500
- I am serious.
- Suk Jin.

2302
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,130
Aren't you curious?

2303
01:18:10,130 --> 01:18:12,360
I am serious.
More people will get the penalty.

2304
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,970
- Will you open it?
- Yes.

2305
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:15,170
(He is really curious about
what's inside the box.)

2306
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:16,560
I am so curious.

2307
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:18,510
We should go and ring the bell.

2308
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:22,340
Is it bad to open the box?

2309
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:24,440
- Really?
- Ji Hyo, should I keep it locked?

2310
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:28,310
(Suk Jin wants to know
what the ping pong balls are for.)

2311
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:29,350
I am serious, Suk Jin.

2312
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:31,550
Why would you tell me not to open it
when you opened yours?

2313
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:33,650
- Open it then.
- That's right.

2314
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,760
- Open it then.
- That's right.

2315
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,560
(Suk Jin takes out the key.)

2316
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,800
(Haha watches closely
since he is curious as well.)

2317
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,320
- You don't know what will happen.
- Will you really open it?

2318
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,890
Yes, I will.

2319
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:45,500
It's Pandora's Box.

2320
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,100
I want to know the secret
behind the ping pong balls.

2321
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,060
- No!
- Why?

2322
01:18:51,010 --> 01:18:52,810
(No!)

2323
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:54,100
Shut your mouth.

2324
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:55,540
"Shut your mouth?"

2325
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,400
Here comes the royal secret inspector!

2326
01:18:57,570 --> 01:18:59,920
What? That's the mission of the day?

2327
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:04,290
- Will you really open it?
- You shouldn't open it.

2328
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:05,350
- I haven't opened it yet.
- Don't do it.

2329
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:06,810
- You shouldn't open it.
- Why not?

2330
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:08,790
Why is he trying to open it?

2331
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:10,090
He wants to open it.

2332
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,460
- He wants to open it.
- You shouldn't open it.

2333
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:14,720
It's suspicious that you are trying
to keep me from opening it.

2334
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:16,970
- Se Chan...
- Everyone is against it.

2335
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:18,220
- He opened it.
- Gosh!

2336
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:19,690
- Don't open it.
- Se Chan, just ring the bell.

2337
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:21,190
- It's meaningless.
- He is trying to open the box.

2338
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,260
- Don't open it.
- Just ring the bell.

2339
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,060
- It's meaningless.
- He is trying to open the box.

2340
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,100
(Opening)

2341
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:27,600
He opened it.

2342
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,680
(He opened Pandora's Box in the end.)

2343
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:34,440
(The number of people
who will get the penalty)

2344
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:36,640
He opened it.

2345
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,940
(Captain Ji's curiosity
made more people get the penalty.)

2346
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,980
- Can I read it with you?
- There is a text.

2347
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,390
(He gets a reality check.)

2348
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:45,020
Didn't I tell you not to do it?

2349
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:48,190
Even the production crew
wanted you to stop.

2350
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,860
Haha, can you turn back time?

2351
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,060
- I think I can use it once.
- Really?

2352
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:54,360
Say, "The one who turns back time!"

2353
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,360
The one who turns back time!

2354
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:00,070
(Haha's skill allows him
to turn back time by 10 minutes!)

2355
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:01,380
What are you doing?

2356
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:07,770
(The time master's incredible skill
unfolds before their eyes.)

2357
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:09,720
Here comes the royal secret inspector!

2358
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,510
Tie him up right this instant!

2359
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:15,980
It worked.

2360
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,590
(The box goes back to its original spot.)

2361
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:20,930
It worked.

2362
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:22,220
He turned back time.

2363
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:23,930
He is doing something!

2364
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:25,860
- He is doing something!
- He is doing something!

2365
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:27,360
(Did something happen?)

2366
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,000
(The superpower skit ends.)

2367
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,470
- It worked.
- It worked.

2368
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:31,970
(The skit doesn't change the fact
that he opened his box.)

2369
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:33,040
- It worked.
- Shall we ring the bell?

2370
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,640
Shall we play a game outside?

2371
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:35,730
Shall we ring the bell?

2372
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,210
- Ring the bell.
- Shall I do that?

2373
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:38,750
- Ring the bell.
- I will ring it.

2374
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:41,720
(With everyone's agreement,
Se Chan goes to ring the bell.)

2375
01:20:45,310 --> 01:20:47,720
The race has ended.
Please gather around outside.

2376
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,510
- Outside.
- Let's gather around.

2377
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,960
- Everyone.
- Yes.

2378
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:54,220
Since the bell rang,
the race came to an end.

2379
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,690
As some of you found out,

2380
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,730
Captain Ji's last race had a hidden rule.

2381
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:03,340
You were up to decide
whether or not to open the box...

2382
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:06,060
with a warning that said, "Do not open."

2383
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,100
Seriously. Why did you open the box?

2384
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,970
Had all of you resisted temptation,

2385
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:11,810
everyone would have gone home
without receiving the penalty.

2386
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:14,610
It was impossible since we had the key.

2387
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:16,010
Seriously. Stop blaming me.

2388
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:17,680
The box was asking to be opened.

2389
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,050
The opened boxes decided...

2390
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:21,180
how many people will get the penalty.

2391
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:23,980
- Four people will get it.
- Four people will get the penalty.

2392
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:28,850
Inside the box are penalty balls.

2393
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Seriously.

2394
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,820
People whose names got written
are the candidates for the penalty.

2395
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:34,000
I wrote down my name.

2396
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,430
Four penalty balls will be chosen.

2397
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:38,310
Even if the names overlap,
we won't pick more balls.

2398
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,340
- Really?
- Yes.

2399
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:42,070
- Then it isn't too bad.
- I will reveal the names.

2400
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:43,710
- There are 15 balls in total.
- That's a lot.

2401
01:21:43,710 --> 01:21:45,570
That's a lot.

2402
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:47,140
Jong Kook has one ball.

2403
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:48,680
- Who wrote down his name?
- When did it happen?

2404
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:49,890
Jae Suk has one ball.

2405
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:51,220
Who wrote down my name?

2406
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:52,810
- Haha has one ball.
- One?

2407
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:54,790
Se Chan has three balls.

2408
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:56,350
(Yang Se Chan)

2409
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:58,930
- So Min has four balls.
- Why do I have so many?

2410
01:21:58,930 --> 01:22:00,850
- Who wrote down my name?
- You did.

2411
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:01,930
I wrote down my name on one ball only.

2412
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:03,000
Suk Jin has five balls.

2413
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,220
(Ji Suk Jin)

2414
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:06,190
- How about Ji Hyo?
- Ji Hyo has zero balls.

2415
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:07,540
For goodness' sake.

2416
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:09,040
- Hold on.
- Who wrote down my name?

2417
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,600
Who wrote down my name?
How do I have four balls?

2418
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,710
Everyone's name got written
except for Ji Hyo's.

2419
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:13,730
Captain Ji will pick four balls.
Before that,

2420
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:15,180
I will reveal the penalty.

2421
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:17,380
This is the last penalty
during Captain Ji's term.

2422
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:18,380
(The last penalty
during Captain Ji's term)

2423
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:21,350
The weather is nice
and there is a clean valley nearby.

2424
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:23,440
You will go into the valley.

2425
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:24,850
- Go in?
- Hey!

2426
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:25,920
(Go into the valley.)

2427
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,110
(Go into the valley?)

2428
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:29,350
You will go into the valley.

2429
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:30,390
(It has been a while
since a penalty in the wild.)

2430
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:32,020
That's ridiculous.

2431
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:34,890
(The valley is still cold in March.)

2432
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:36,000
What are we doing?

2433
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,820
- Are we getting into the water?
- You're getting into the water.

2434
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,540
- It's too cold.
- That's too harsh.

2435
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:42,430
I have only one pair of underwear.
Is it going to be okay?

2436
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:44,810
(Captain Ji's term will end
with the grand finale penalty.)

2437
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:47,900
All right. Captain Ji,
come on and draw balls.

2438
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:49,730
My goodness. Please.

2439
01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:50,900
Mix them well.

2440
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,850
Suk Jin, just pick your names.

2441
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:54,810
I'm sorry, I opened the box.

2442
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:57,350
- Captain Ji.
- Yes.

2443
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:59,680
- Please.
- I told you not to do it.

2444
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:02,090
- I know.
- All right.

2445
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:06,320
(What's the first name he picks?)

2446
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:08,260
Ji Suk Jin.

2447
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:09,300
Announce the name.

2448
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:14,390
(Who is it among the 6 of them
except for Ji Hyo?)

2449
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:16,260
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Announce the name.

2450
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:18,010
Ji Suk Jin.

2451
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:19,060
(Ji Suk Jin)

2452
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:20,930
(Captain Ji takes the initiative.)

2453
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:22,040
I knew it.

2454
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,710
Captain Ji, thank you.

2455
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:27,350
- One more time!
- One!

2456
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:30,180
- One more time!
- Pick your name four times.

2457
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:32,440
(What's the name
on the second penalty ball?)

2458
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:35,220
(Laughing)

2459
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:36,220
What is it?

2460
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,820
(He can't help but smile.)

2461
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:40,650
Why? What is it?

2462
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:42,430
Ji Suk Jin.

2463
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:44,060
(Ji Suk Jin)

2464
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:47,260
(The captain picked his name again.)

2465
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,860
- I can't believe this.
- One more time!

2466
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,540
- One more time!
- One more time!

2467
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,340
- One more time!
- He's a real captain.

2468
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:56,040
- He's Captain Ji.
- He deserves to be a captain.

2469
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,070
Captain!

2470
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:58,880
- It can't happen four times.
- Captain.

2471
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:00,610
Is it me?

2472
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:02,880
(What's the third name?)

2473
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,480
- I bet it's Ji Suk Jin.
- I don't think so.

2474
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:06,650
- It's Ji Suk Jin.
- Is it me? He just looked at me.

2475
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:08,680
It must be Ji Suk Jin.

2476
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:09,890
Yang Se Chan.

2477
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:11,320
(Yang Se Chan)

2478
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,130
(Se Chan is getting into the water.)

2479
01:24:14,630 --> 01:24:16,930
- I'm so unlucky.
- Se Chan is going into the water.

2480
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:19,670
- Se Chan, one more time!
- The last one.

2481
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,430
This is the last ball.

2482
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:22,430
Se Chan.

2483
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:25,060
It is most likely to be So Min.

2484
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,230
(So Min has the second
largest number of balls.)

2485
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:27,730
I know. I want to run away.

2486
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:29,710
So Min has the biggest number of balls.

2487
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:31,270
- It's you and So Min.
- And me?

2488
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:33,610
We don't know that. We have one ball each.

2489
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:36,510
It has to be Ji Suk Jin.

2490
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:37,680
Captain Ji.

2491
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,140
It would've been funny
if he picked his name four times.

2492
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:41,310
Is it Ji Suk Jin again?

2493
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:43,110
(He bursts into laughter.)

2494
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:45,260
- No way.
- That can't be it.

2495
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:46,800
- No way.
- That's unbelievable.

2496
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,820
- What is it? That can't be it.
- No way.

2497
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:53,390
- Ji Suk Jin.
- I knew it.

2498
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:55,390
- Is it me?
- He completes Running Man.

2499
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:57,900
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Yes!

2500
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:00,340
(The last one to get a penalty
is Jae Suk.)

2501
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:02,570
- He had only one ball.
- He had only one!

2502
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:07,640
(It's Haha who wrote Jae Suk's name.)

2503
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:09,720
- He had only one ball.
- He had only one!

2504
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,290
He had only one ball, and he got picked.

2505
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:12,640
- There was only one ball.
- It was the only ball.

2506
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:13,850
I picked the only ball.

2507
01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:16,630
Yoo Jae Suk completes Running Man.

2508
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:18,520
- This is interesting.
- This is the worst.

2509
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,850
How is this possible?

2510
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:23,220
All right. The three of you will
go to the valley now.

2511
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:24,820
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2512
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:25,820
Can you believe this?

2513
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:28,640
It's so cold. I'll freeze to death.

2514
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:30,840
- We're getting into the water.
- I love it.

2515
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:34,140
Your mind is like water,
and water is like your mind.

2516
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:37,010
- The wind is cold.
- I'll get into the water.

2517
01:25:37,010 --> 01:25:38,010
(They arrive at the valley
with reverent pride.)

2518
01:25:38,010 --> 01:25:40,380
It's the perfect weather
to get into the water.

2519
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:43,050
My gosh. I can't believe this.

2520
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:44,890
- Gosh, this place is...
- Hurry.

2521
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,790
Let's just get this over with.

2522
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:49,110
- I'm sorry, Jae Suk.
- I know.

2523
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:51,220
Why did you open the box?

2524
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:55,130
If we don't do this now,
we won't have another chance.

2525
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:57,130
That's not true. We can do it in summer.

2526
01:25:57,630 --> 01:26:00,140
When else would I get into the water?

2527
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:02,500
You can try it any time.

2528
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,430
Is he leaving?

2529
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:06,260
Go ahead and do it.

2530
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:07,840
What's with the color of the water?

2531
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,140
- But...
- Let's do this.

2532
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:10,510
It's not cold.

2533
01:26:10,510 --> 01:26:12,070
- It will be all right.
- It's not cold.

2534
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:13,420
You can get into the water one by one.

2535
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:14,970
It's cold, isn't it?

2536
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:17,090
- Go ahead and do it.
- This isn't going to work.

2537
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:18,750
- Why?
- It's too cold.

2538
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,350
No. Are you just saying that?

2539
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:22,420
(They start getting into the water.)

2540
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:23,720
My goodness.

2541
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,430
(Groaning)

2542
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:27,060
(Screaming)

2543
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:29,150
- My gosh.
- Go to the middle of the stream.

2544
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:30,600
Running Man forever!

2545
01:26:31,170 --> 01:26:33,260
- He sounds so silly.
- My gosh.

2546
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:34,600
(He tries to finish it
only with his feet in the water.)

2547
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,140
This is so cold.

2548
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:37,230
Hey, Se Chan.

2549
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:39,230
(Se Chan massages his heart
making a fuss.)

2550
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:40,710
Se Chan, you're so cool.

2551
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:45,140
(This isn't like the wild
variety show on other channels.)

2552
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:46,270
(The urban entertainers are
not good with wildness.)

2553
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:47,550
Is it cold?

2554
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:49,940
I can't feel my feet.

2555
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:52,290
You can do this.

2556
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:55,480
(It's time to soak
themselves in the water.)

2557
01:26:55,810 --> 01:26:58,930
One, two, three. Let's do this.

2558
01:26:58,930 --> 01:27:00,320
(Finally soaking in)

2559
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,500
Gosh, it's so cold.

2560
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:04,760
(His vengeance begins.)

2561
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:08,540
(It turns into a water fight
when no one told them to do it.)

2562
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:10,640
Gosh, it's so cold.

2563
01:27:17,350 --> 01:27:18,510
Suk Jin is not going in.

2564
01:27:18,510 --> 01:27:19,900
(The grand retirement ceremony
for Captain Ji)

2565
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:22,750
Suk Jin is not going in.
He's not soaking himself.

2566
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:24,980
- Come here.
- I don't want to.

2567
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:27,480
Se Chan, you're so cool.
Are you all right?

2568
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,420
(We will keep running
with the energy of the stream.)

2569
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:30,680
Okay.

2570
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:31,890
(Captain Ji retires
with the cool water activity.)

2571
01:27:31,890 --> 01:27:33,930
- Well done.
- Great job.

2572
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:35,000
(Captain Ji retires
with the cool water activity.)

2573
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:37,390
(In this world,)

2574
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:40,000
(is there anything
you can't buy with money?)

2575
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:41,840
(You need money...)

2576
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:42,930
(to eat.)

2577
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:45,170
(For a private collection)

2578
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:48,810
(You need money...)

2579
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:50,140
(to be good-looking.)

2580
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:51,510
(Trot yellow)

2581
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:52,510
(Auntie brown)

2582
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:55,270
(Even to become hip,)

2583
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,720
(you need money.)

2584
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,680
This is what I can do for you.

2585
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:00,420
This is so thrilling.

2586
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:02,010
(You're broke.)

2587
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:04,460
(If they spend money recklessly,)

2588
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:06,390
(they will end up becoming a farmhand.)

2589
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:08,150
(The Real-life Fund Management Race)

2590
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:09,960
