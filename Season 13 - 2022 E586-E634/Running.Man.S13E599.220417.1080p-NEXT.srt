1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,750
Hello.

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,890
The weather is nice today.

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,980
Hello.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,080
Hey, you're here. Hi.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,560
Hello.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,560
Gosh, it's been a while
since I came here last time.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,980
- This place is...
- Hello.

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,800
- I come here when I go cycling.
- A convenience store.

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,800
I used to come here a lot.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,270
Are we going to eat ramyeon
at the Han River?

11
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,270
This is where we eat ramyeon.

12
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,860
- Hello.
- Let's eat ramyeon.

13
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,160
- Ramyeon at the Han River.
- This is a place for ramyeon.

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,410
I had breakfast.

15
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,270
- I ate too.
- Where? Banpo?

16
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,630
- Yes.
- My gosh.

17
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,880
- Are we going to sit here?
- Are you in there?

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,380
Are you in there?

19
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,910
(An unwelcome guest shows up.)

20
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,910
It's like a car wash.

21
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,840
- Excuse me.
- Anyone in there?

22
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,340
A table for three.

23
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,910
I'm here too.

24
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,480
- Hey.
- Go in.

25
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,590
This is a car wash.

26
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,380
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

27
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,660
- Hey.
- This is a car wash.

28
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,760
Wash yourself.

29
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,780
Why would he wear something like that?

30
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,420
Bring the camera. This is a car wash.

31
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,160
- It's a car wash.
- A car wash.

32
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,960
Se Chan is all dressed up today.
Why aren't you saying anything?

33
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,420
- Who?
- Don't I look cute?

34
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,440
- This is perfect for the Han River.
- He's dressed up.

35
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,270
You're dressed like a boyfriend's friend.

36
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,010
No, this is what cute boyfriends wear.

37
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,370
- It's called the boyfriend look.
- The boyfriend's friend look.

38
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,600
Se Chan is quite a dresser.

39
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,480
- Did you go to a beauty shop?
- Yes, I did.

40
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,810
- Why?
- That's interesting.

41
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,820
The beauty shop is only
a seven-minute walk from my house.

42
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,240
- But you...
- So did you go to a beauty shop?

43
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,180
Yes. My gosh, Jae Suk!

44
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,540
So did you go to a beauty shop?

45
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,260
(Disheveled hair)

46
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,380
What are you doing? This is...

47
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,930
- I got my hair done.
- It's okay. It looks natural.

48
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,880
- I can't believe this.
- Why? It's nice.

49
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,900
- It looks natural.
- What do you think you're doing?

50
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,150
All right.

51
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,160
- We really wanted to do this.
- It's like stepping on a new shoe.

52
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,370
- I know.
- He's unstoppable.

53
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,960
(Tidying his hair)

54
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,370
Why do you keep
going to a beauty shop these days?

55
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,960
What? Jae Suk, please.

56
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,740
- We have news about Suk Jin.
- What?

57
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,810
What is it?

58
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,510
Seriously?

59
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,710
- Really?
- What?

60
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,820
- But...
- What?

61
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,850
- What's that?
- You?

62
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,980
No way.

63
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,180
- Did you go there?
- Was it on the news?

64
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,180
He attended the wedding.

65
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,350
- What?
- Was it on the news?

66
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,590
- Did you attend the wedding?
- On the news?

67
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,180
(They can't believe their ears.)

68
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,760
Why did you go to Hyun Bin
and Son Ye Jin's wedding?

69
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,100
- "Ji Suk Jin wasn't invited."
- What?

70
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,320
- What?
- What?

71
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,070
- "But he..."
- Did you really go?

72
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,260
- Why?
- Why did you go there?

73
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,320
Why did you go?

74
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,260
- Which one do you know?
- Was it for your YouTube channel?

75
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,370
- Has he lost his mind?
- No way.

76
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,900
Does he know Son Ye Jin's parents?

77
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,430
I didn't know
they were holding a wedding there.

78
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,210
I just went there for work.

79
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,870
- Why did you go?
- It was for work.

80
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,470
- Why would you do that?
- This is embarrassing.

81
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,970
Why did you go there
when you weren't invited?

82
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,180
I know neither of them.

83
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,340
- Does he work at a wedding hall?
- Why did you go then?

84
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,780
- For work.
- What did you do there?

85
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,180
- For work?
- To do a TV show.

86
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,180
- This is really embarrassing.
- I had a shoot there.

87
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,280
You're lying. You went there
to film the wedding.

88
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,750
- Shame on you.
- As if it was a coincidence.

89
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,900
- I'm so sorry.
- Seriously...

90
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,800
- It's funny it was on the news.
- I apologize.

91
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,430
- That's unbelievable.
- "Uninvited Ji Suk Jin."

92
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,770
- That's the worst.
- I just went to work.

93
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,770
The reporters... This is upsetting.

94
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,340
- Why did you go there?
- Hey.

95
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,640
I'm not the kind of person
who sneaks into a stranger's wedding.

96
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,180
- You must've been dressed up.
- Of course.

97
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,810
I bet he was all dressed up.

98
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,120
He just goes around
attending top stars' weddings.

99
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,470
Don't you have any pride?

100
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,470
What did I do?

101
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,280
Why did you go there
when you weren't invited?

102
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,710
- You're Ji Suk Jin of Running Man.
- "Uninvited Ji Suk Jin."

103
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,390
- Hey.
- I'm so upset.

104
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,020
Why did they not invite him?

105
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,990
I went there at 11 a.m.
when the wedding was at 4 p.m.

106
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,860
- Why did you go there so early?
- At 11...

107
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,800
- You should be there at 3:50 p.m.
- What's wrong with you?

108
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,900
- Why did you go so early?
- You're ridiculous.

109
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,690
You must've told your wife this.
"I'm going to the wedding."

110
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,740
"Whose wedding?"
"Son Ye Jin and Hyun Bin."

111
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,370
But you weren't invited.

112
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,430
- That's unbelievable.
- He wasn't invited.

113
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,710
- By the way...
- And he told his manager.

114
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,770
"I need to go to a wedding.
Make a beauty shop appointment."

115
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,080
Seriously.

116
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,470
- Gosh, that's hilarious.
- You're really...

117
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,390
We're at the Han River after a long time.

118
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,990
Today, you will go around
many shops and stores...

119
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,830
spending as much money as you want.

120
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,960
It's called
How Much Do You Want to Spend Race.

121
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,960
You will each choose
one of the debit cards...

122
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,690
in the production crew's names.

123
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,830
I see.

124
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,370
The seven cards have
certain amounts of money...

125
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,840
ranging from 10 dollars to 200 dollars...

126
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,870
in them.

127
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,080
But you will start the race
without figuring out...

128
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,870
the amount of money in your card.

129
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,340
I see.

130
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,580
Now you will number yourselves
by playing a game.

131
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,810
- Then we will pay.
- Yes. Number one goes first.

132
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,390
And you can pay as much as you want.

133
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,120
The last one to go
will have to pay the balance.

134
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
- My goodness.
- What if you are short of money?

135
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,360
Those who go broke
will be a slave right away.

136
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,930
- Oh, no.
- We will have slaves.

137
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,520
A slave will serve the members
in the slave costume.

138
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,930
If you become a slave,
you have to use your own card.

139
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,260
- Really?
- Yes. Do you understand?

140
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,430
- That would be the worst.
- I don't want to go broke.

141
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,000
And the one with the least
amount of money...

142
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,440
will be the winner at the end of the race.

143
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,550
Those who go broke or have more
than ten dollars will get a penalty.

144
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,310
- We can't spend much money.
- Not the one with the most money?

145
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,720
- I see.
- We should spend less money.

146
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,990
I mean, we should spend
a moderate amount of money.

147
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,120
If you have 200 dollars,
you will have to spend...

148
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,680
- quite a lot to win the race.
- That's right.

149
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,820
All right. Now you will pick
the debit cards to use today.

150
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,360
- We never know what to choose.
- I can't tell.

151
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,430
It's from 10 to 200 dollars.

152
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,870
Don't let So Min pick first.

153
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,630
They have names on them.

154
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,540
You should take the head writer's card.

155
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,760
It must have the biggest amount.

156
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,200
(Team producer, head writer,
second producer, second writer)

157
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,630
(Administrative producer,
junior producer, junior writer)

158
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,480
- The team producer's.
- I pick Ju Yong's.

159
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,070
- What about Hyung In's?
- No. I pick Hyung In's.

160
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,550
- You should pick Hyung In.
- I want Ju Yong.

161
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,180
- I pick Bo Pil.
- Hey.

162
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,240
I picked yours.

163
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,580
- Bo Pil.
- Hyung In is in charge of me.

164
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,080
- Ju Yong, are you sure?
- The man of Sunday.

165
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,750
I wonder if there's a twist.

166
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,250
That's the problem.

167
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,250
- Right.
- I bet there's a twist.

168
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,620
- What about Hyung In's?
- I pick Ji Yeon's.

169
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,250
- You should pick Hyung In.
- I want Bo Pil.

170
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,970
Hey. Se Chan picked Ji Yeon's card.

171
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,190
Ji Yeon, I picked you.

172
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,170
Ji Yeon, I picked your card.

173
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,600
(He bets the junior producer's
card has more money.)

174
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,810
Hyung In is...

175
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,430
Ju Yong, I picked you.

176
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,630
(Suk Jin hesitates.)

177
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,940
- I...
- Bo Pil.

178
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,370
(And he picks the junior writer's card.)

179
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,640
I think I picked the wrong one.
The junior writer...

180
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,180
You can't take it back.

181
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,680
- Let me change...
- It must have a lot of money.

182
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
- You think?
- Yes.

183
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,010
Ji Yeon? All right.

184
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,120
Why?

185
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,290
(So Min picks the head writer's card.)

186
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,600
It must have a lot of money.

187
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
- You think?
- I pick Seo Rim.

188
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,950
(Jae Suk is done choosing a card.)

189
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,760
- You each picked a card.
- Yes.

190
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,370
The first place where you will use
your card is the convenience store.

191
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,100
- Do you see the store behind you?
- Yes.

192
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,260
You can pick anything
you want to eat or use...

193
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,830
at the store now.

194
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,610
- I should eat ramyeon.
- Without paying?

195
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,740
- We just put them in a bag?
- I just had breakfast.

196
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,070
- Me too.
- I ate too.

197
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,140
- I'll eat ramyeon.
- That doesn't happen a lot.

198
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,780
I'll eat something sweet.

199
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,510
- I should buy some batteries.
- In the morning...

200
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,720
- Batteries?
- Hey.

201
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,920
- Hey.
- Why would you buy batteries?

202
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,220
- You always buy daily necessities.
- Batteries.

203
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,360
Why would you buy household goods here?

204
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,250
- Why would you buy batteries?
- You'll be rich.

205
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,930
- I will buy a mat.
- Hello.

206
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,060
- Why a mat?
- No reason.

207
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,320
Se Chan, you should buy
some dog food here.

208
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,360
That's a good idea.

209
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

210
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,730
Hello.

211
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,390
It's a convenience store.

212
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,540
Should I eat some ramyeon?

213
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,760
- Let's eat ramyeon.
- I should probably eat ramyeon.

214
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,310
Let's share it.

215
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,700
- Can we cook ramyeon here?
- Cooked ramyeon.

216
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,830
They have everything here.

217
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,000
- So Min
- Where are the eggs?

218
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,370
- Eggs?
- I'll have ramyeon.

219
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,780
I'll eat ramyeon.

220
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,310
- Bombastic.
- Where...

221
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,290
We click well, don't we?

222
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,860
- Yes.
- Yaman.

223
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,490
Yaman. Bombastic.

224
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,530
I should buy a protein bar.

225
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,060
I will buy a box of Band-Aid.

226
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,600
Jae Suk, why would you
buy a daily necessity?

227
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,100
You should buy something to eat.

228
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,170
I'm out of Band-Aids.

229
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,630
That doesn't matter.

230
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,040
My goodness.

231
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,810
Do they sell disposable batteries
for smartphones?

232
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,110
- Suk Jin.
- This is nice.

233
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,480
- Why are you being like this?
- What?

234
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,000
Why do you buy a daily necessity?

235
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,180
It's not like that.

236
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,940
- Hydrogen peroxide.
- Should I buy some batteries?

237
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,850
What? Is this a battery club or what?

238
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,580
The world has become
much easier to live in.

239
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,750
- I will...
- I'll buy these.

240
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,580
(Ramyeon, egg,
sparkling water, pickled radish)

241
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,560
Why are you nitpicking at what I eat?

242
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,120
Milk.

243
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,820
Chopsticks.

244
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,030
- What are you buying?
- I picked chocolate balls.

245
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,540
- And almonds.
- I knew you'd buy them.

246
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,260
I guess you all are having ramyeon.

247
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,930
You're dressed like a kid today,
so you look like a kid.

248
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,180
I do?

249
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,980
I'm 44.

250
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,700
Am I supposed to add
the seasoning at the beginning?

251
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,780
Put them all in together.

252
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,940
- You should add an egg.
- It's boiling.

253
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,240
- You know you should stir it well.
- It looks good.

254
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,790
It's always good to eat ramyeon outside.

255
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,580
- Enjoy.
- Look at this ramyeon.

256
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,320
- I think I made a good choice.
- I know.

257
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,820
The ramyeon does look delicious.

258
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,190
This is amazing.

259
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,190
(The young members of Running Man
start eating ramyeon.)

260
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,530
You have to eat it.

261
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,120
This is really good.

262
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,190
(Amazed)

263
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,110
- This is crazy.
- It's so tasty.

264
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,130
- It's really good.
- Almond. Protein.

265
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,870
- Almonds are good for men.
- Really?

266
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,850
I was going to make
almond cookies for you.

267
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,640
You should've made them.

268
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,850
You can make them today.

269
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,180
- Make them today.
- I'll have some.

270
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,310
- That day...
- I want them too.

271
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,680
I should've had a cooking class.

272
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,810
It would've been great.

273
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,310
- You think?
- I love my cookies.

274
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,980
Who bought this mat?

275
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,090
- Jae Suk bought the mat.
- Why?

276
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,820
- He bought the mat.
- Why?

277
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,590
- You need this at the Han River.
- That's true.

278
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,640
It can also be a fashion accessory.

279
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,730
- Like a bag.
- You can wear it like a bag.

280
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,310
- It's a mat bag.
- You should go like this.

281
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,640
(The Han River fashion)

282
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,730
Wait, Jae Suk.

283
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,510
Why do you need glue at the Han River?

284
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,650
- Why did you buy glue?
- And Band-Aids.

285
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,880
- Why did you buy glue?
- Why?

286
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,650
I need to fix Na Eun's toy.

287
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,610
- He pretends to be a family man.
- My gosh.

288
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,890
- Don't buy household goods here.
- Na Eun's toy is broken.

289
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,520
- I need to fix it.
- My gosh.

290
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,160
You bought it because I bought one.

291
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,500
- You imitated me.
- Why did you buy it?

292
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,900
- Do you...
- I had no time...

293
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,630
- Do you know why he bought glue?
- Why?

294
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,060
To bond with his wife.

295
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,300
(Overreacting)

296
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,960
Go ahead and bond with her.

297
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,670
- Hey.
- Good one, right?

298
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,070
- You're on fire.
- We already have a special bond.

299
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,510
- He says I'm on fire.
- Jae Suk is so funny.

300
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,970
I'm on fire today.

301
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,150
There he goes again.

302
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,110
I'm on fire today.

303
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,610
There he goes again.

304
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,580
Why is he so excited today?

305
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,920
He's like that when we eat.

306
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Have you been taking some herbal medicine?

307
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
No.

308
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,260
You pass out at home
after doing this, right?

309
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,390
- No.
- After making a fuss all day.

310
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,300
I can't rest at home.

311
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,660
- Then again, you have two kids.
- I can't rest.

312
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,060
I had a fight with Ji Ho yesterday.

313
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,640
You did?

314
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,300
(He had a fight with his son.)

315
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,430
- Yes.
- It's funny you fought with him.

316
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,430
- We had a fight.
- How old is he?

317
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,810
Ji Ho is 13.

318
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,640
- Really?
- He's about that age.

319
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,070
- He must be feisty at that age.
- He is feisty.

320
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,110
This is really delicious.

321
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,440
- Everyone.
- Yes.

322
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,650
Now it's time to pay.

323
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,890
- Really?
- I really enjoyed the food.

324
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,850
You spent 99.9 dollars
at this convenience store.

325
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,630
- That's not a lot.
- That's a lot.

326
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,450
- That's a lot.
- You should determine the order.

327
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,530
For what?

328
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,090
The order of payment.

329
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,300
Number one will go first,
and you can pay as much as you want.

330
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,590
- As much as I want?
- Yes.

331
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,170
- That's a good thing.
- It is.

332
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,060
- All right then.
- I want to pay.

333
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,560
Let's play the Game of Wits.

334
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,180
I'm at a disadvantage.

335
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,230
- Why?
- Why are you at a disadvantage?

336
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,070
- Why?
- I'm not good at the game.

337
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,810
What game do you want to play?

338
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,200
Tipcat?

339
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,250
- I like rock-paper-scissors.
- Tipcat?

340
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,940
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- That's not fun.

341
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,210
- Let's play the Game of Wits.
- Rock-paper-scissors is not fun.

342
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,790
I hate those who want to play
rock-paper-scissors in the morning.

343
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,660
- This is really upsetting.
- He's upset.

344
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,320
Is the Game of Wits fun?

345
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,400
You're upset.

346
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,320
I'm sick and tired of the Game of Wits.

347
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,460
- Why are you yelling?
- It's not like that.

348
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,530
- Hey.
- I can't believe this.

349
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,140
There are a lot of guys
doing this at the Han River.

350
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,230
This happens a lot at the Han River.

351
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,360
Why are you yelling?

352
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,600
(They are fighting over a game
while having fun.)

353
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,140
- Jae Suk, let's just...
- Let's play 007 Bang.

354
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,600
- The 007 Bang game?
- The Silent 007 Bang game.

355
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,730
All right. Let's do that.

356
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,200
The one who loses
the game is the last one to go.

357
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,750
- It goes in reverse order.
- Okay.

358
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,920
Silent.

359
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
- Like this.
- Okay.

360
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,050
- You should start like this.
- I'm not supposed to shout, right?

361
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,310
- You should raise your hands.
- Okay.

362
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,520
You should start like this.

363
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,160
Why would we do that? Don't lie to me.

364
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,980
- That's true.
- We have to do this.

365
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,060
- It's a lie.
- That's true.

366
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,000
- How dare you...
- I'm telling you the truth.

367
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,820
- You made a fool of me.
- He's being weird. Are you drunk?

368
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,170
(A drunk man found at the Han River)

369
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,800
- My gosh.
- What are you doing?

370
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,060
I was sitting like this.

371
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,330
Suk Jin is being weird today.

372
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,360
- What's with you?
- Suk Jin.

373
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,470
- This is the rule.
- I'll do this instead.

374
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,930
- I can do anything.
- Just do anything you want.

375
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,440
It starts as I'm done drawing a star.

376
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,280
- Am I the first one to go?
- Yes.

377
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,440
(Zero, zero, seven)

378
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,650
(Bang)

379
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,290
- You should raise your arms.
- He's out.

380
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,890
You should raise your arms.

381
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,290
- He's out.
- You're out.

382
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,720
- You lost.
- Why did you not do it?

383
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,630
- What's wrong with you?
- He's doing this.

384
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,530
- What's with you?
- He's doing this now.

385
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,530
- He's out.
- He's being like this.

386
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,530
What's with you?

387
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,640
- You're out.
- You're out.

388
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,860
He's the first one to pay.

389
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,860
- No, he's the last one.
- The last.

390
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,770
- That was a rehearsal.
- You're the last.

391
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,060
- Jong Kook.
- Me?

392
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,280
- Do it again.
- Me?

393
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,310
This is it.

394
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,100
(Zero, zero, seven)

395
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,970
(Bang)

396
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,250
(Defense succeeded)

397
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,180
(Zero, zero, seven)

398
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,480
(Bang)

399
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,310
- That was late.
- You were late. You're out.

400
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,580
(So Min was late, so she's out.)

401
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,850
Again.

402
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,190
- The five of us are left.
- Got it.

403
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,300
(Zero, zero, seven)

404
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,090
(Bang)

405
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,040
(Zero, zero, seven, bang!)

406
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,010
- I'm dead.
- He's out.

407
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,650
(Haha is out because he pointed
at Suk Jin who was already out.)

408
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,200
- Stay focused.
- What's with you guys?

409
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,250
- He's been dead for a while.
- You're out.

410
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,650
- I lost in the first round.
- Out.

411
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,790
(Number 5, 6, and 7)

412
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,710
- Ji Hyo goes first.
- This is difficult.

413
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,180
(Zero, zero, seven?)

414
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,300
(He points at Se Chan and then himself.)

415
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,770
- You're out.
- What are you doing?

416
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,770
You pointed at me.

417
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,540
- Why did you point at yourself?
- What was that?

418
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,100
- Why did you...
- I was in a hurry.

419
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,640
- What was that?
- I was in a rush.

420
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,470
- Why did you do that?
- What were you doing?

421
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,700
I was in a hurry.

422
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,100
(He feels nervous when he plays games.)

423
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,510
- The three of us are left.
- Three.

424
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,810
- Shall we play rock-paper-scissors?
- Okay.

425
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:25,970
Rock-paper-scissors

426
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,880
Rock-paper-scissors

427
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,080
Okay.

428
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,110
- Spend ten dollars.
- All right then.

429
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,520
Number one goes first.

430
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,920
You can pay as much as you want
among the 99 dollars.

431
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,060
- Spend 10 dollars.
- Pay 10 dollars.

432
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,060
You're the first one to go.
You should pay ten dollars.

433
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,300
Number 1 should pay 10 dollars.

434
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,590
The least amount is 0.1 dollars.

435
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,690
Can I pay 0.1 dollars?

436
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,800
You promised you'd pay ten dollars.

437
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm just asking.

438
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,430
(Se Chan picked
the junior producer's card.)

439
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,830
Gosh today...

440
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,330
I will...

441
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,700
I'll spend all my money.

442
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,010
How much is it in total?

443
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,570
It's 99.9 dollars.

444
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,310
(The total amount is 99.9 dollars.)

445
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,440
(Junior producer, Go Ji Yeon)

446
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,480
(He pays the amount he wants
with the junior producer's card.)

447
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,710
Payment completed.

448
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,390
- Thank you.
- Please remove your card.

449
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,030
- Do I pay here?
- Yes.

450
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,760
(Next up is Jong Kook.)

451
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,400
I'll pay.

452
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,630
Here's my card.

453
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,860
(And Ji Hyo is done making the payment.)

454
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,140
- Who's next?
- Jae Suk.

455
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,190
How much did you pay?

456
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,360
You'll see.

457
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,230
Welcome.

458
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,410
(He checks the balance.)

459
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,780
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

460
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,510
It is 99.6 dollars.

461
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,570
(The balance is 99.6 dollars.)

462
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,210
It's 99.9 dollars.

463
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,610
I'll pay 0.1 dollars.

464
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,650
(Transaction for 0.1 dollars at 25)

465
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,580
I'll pay 0.1 dollars.

466
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,480
Really?

467
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,220
Then I'll pay 0.1 dollars.

468
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,350
It is 99.6 dollars.

469
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,960
(Se Chan, Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo
paid 0.1 dollars each.)

470
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,640
- You guys are so mean.
- Why?

471
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,300
Why?

472
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,830
My goodness.

473
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,960
You know you should
spend some money, right?

474
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,600
- I know. This is the beginning.
- I spent a lot.

475
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,100
(The remaining members are
feeling anxious.)

476
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,600
We don't need to spend too much.

477
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,680
(The second writer, Gang Seo Rim)

478
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,380
I'll pay 0.1 dollars.

479
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,920
(The second writer, Gang Seo Rim)

480
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,840
(Transaction for 0.1 dollars
at 25, Han River Banpo Store 1)

481
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,950
Thank you.

482
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,110
You should spend as much as I did.

483
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,890
You punks.

484
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,630
I know you paid 0.1 dollars.

485
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,090
How much did you pay?

486
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,500
How much is the balance?

487
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,000
It's 99.5 dollars.

488
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,930
Did you say 99.5 dollars?

489
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,830
Is it 99.5 dollars?

490
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,190
(It hardly made a dent
in the total amount.)

491
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,810
Then I'll pay 0.1 dollars as well.

492
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,930
No, I'll pay 0.2 dollars.

493
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,270
(Team producer, Choi Bo Pil)

494
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,380
Hang on.

495
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,570
I don't have to do this.

496
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,880
(Team producer, Choi Bo Pil)

497
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:42,340
(Those who go broke or have more
than ten dollars get a penalty.)

498
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,680
Why did they pay only 0.1 dollars?

499
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,850
Isn't ten dollars the least amount?

500
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,890
- Then I'll pay nine dollars.
- Nine dollars.

501
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,950
(Haha paid almost ten dollars.)

502
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,360
- Payment completed.
- Thank you.

503
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
(Transaction for 9 dollars
at 25, Han River Banpo Store 1)

504
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,770
This is Hyo Im's card.
I'm sure she has 100 dollars.

505
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,140
She's the head writer for a reason.
She must have 100 dollars.

506
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,170
Maybe...

507
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,310
- Hello.
- Hello.

508
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,570
Well...

509
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,880
(Head Writer, Yang Hyo Im)

510
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,650
I'll pay 30 dollars.

511
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,940
- Thirty dollars?
- Yes.

512
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,340
(So Min goes bold from the start.)

513
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,580
- I'll put it in.
- Yes.

514
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,610
(If she doesn't have enough amount,
she'll be the slave immediately.)

515
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,080
I'm sure there's
more than 30 dollars in it.

516
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,580
(Payment in progress,
payment amount: 30 dollars)

517
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,850
- Payment completed.
- Oh, my.

518
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,590
- Please remove your card.
- It's done.

519
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,220
(Transaction for 30 dollars
at 25, Han River Banpo Store 1)

520
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,400
(So Min had more than 30 dollars
in the beginning.)

521
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,060
There's 60 dollars and 50 cents
left to pay.

522
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,770
Thank you.

523
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,200
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

524
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,230
Goodbye.

525
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,010
You shouldn't save too much money either.

526
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,330
Suk Jin, I said I would pay.

527
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,970
Is there a chance
I don't have to spend any money?

528
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:44,970
- Yes.
- Great.

529
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,050
- Suk Jin, I...
- Yes?

530
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,020
I can imagine you in the slave costume.

531
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,650
(His fate depends on the amount
of money on his card.)

532
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,340
- Do slaves talk formerly to us?
- I mean...

533
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,450
Will he be a slave if he goes bankrupt?

534
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,520
Go on, Mr. Slave.

535
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,390
- Slave number one.
- Whose card did you choose?

536
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,760
I picked the youngest writer's card.

537
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:58,950
I see. Well...

538
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,300
Could I become a slave from the start?

539
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,590
Please pay here.

540
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,130
My gosh, those punks.

541
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,220
How much do we have left to pay?

542
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,690
The remaining amount is
60 dollars and 50 cents.

543
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,560
(The amount to pay: 60.5 dollars)

544
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,660
Gosh, seriously.

545
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,210
If it's declined, I'll be a slave.

546
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,210
Right? I have to pay
60 dollars and 50 cents.

547
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,710
Did you say 60 dollars and 50 cents?

548
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,340
Yes, that's the remaining amount.

549
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,840
- Sixty dollars and fifty cents?
- Yes.

550
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,140
(It's time to pay 60.5 dollars,
which will determine his future.)

551
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,280
This is driving me nuts.

552
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,550
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

553
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,690
It could be declined.

554
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,110
Please.

555
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,810
Please.

556
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,530
(Seok Sam is praying solemnly.)

557
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,420
(Insert your card.
Payment amount: 60.5 dollars)

558
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,730
(Youngest Writer, Jang Ye Bin)

559
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,820
Please.

560
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,090
What?

561
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,970
(What could Suk Jin's fate be?)

562
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,470
- Okay.
- Suk Jin, don't cheat.

563
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,630
- Suk Jin must've paid it all.
- Right.

564
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,010
- It's taking him so long.
- I'm sure...

565
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,900
- that he'll dress as a slave.
- Maybe his card has been declined.

566
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,510
- Okay. Whatever happens in life,
- Did it work?

567
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,510
- I should enjoy every moment.
- I guess he won't be a slave.

568
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,510
I bet he's saved.

569
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,570
- That's life.
- I bet it worked.

570
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,720
- Did it work?
- Absolutely.

571
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,780
I bet it worked.

572
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,610
- That's life.
- It worked?

573
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,020
Right? That's life.

574
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,610
- All right, everyone.
- Look. They look so busy now.

575
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,120
They're in such a hurry.

576
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,060
One of them is bringing the costume.
It's crazy.

577
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,590
They're moving around so busily now.

578
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,350
- Suk Jin, are you a slave now?
- The staff members are in a hurry.

579
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,770
- They're preparing the costume.
- Exactly.

580
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,630
- They're all working busily.
- Is this a prank?

581
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,770
- Aren't you a slave?
- No.

582
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,560
- The total was 99.9 dollars.
- Yes.

583
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,070
The amount that was paid
before Suk Jin was...

584
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,670
- thirty-nine point four dollars.
- Really?

585
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,070
- I think So Min spent a lot.
- Right.

586
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,670
- So Min must've spent so much.
- And Suk Jin had to pay...

587
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,810
- sixty dollars and fifty cents.
- I guess So Min paid a big portion.

588
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,190
- Suk Jin's debit card...
- Yes.

589
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,610
(How much did his card have?)

590
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,030
- had ten dollars.
- My gosh.

591
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,290
Oh, no.

592
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,350
(Ye Bin's card was declined
due to insufficient funds.)

593
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,390
- He went broke.
- He's a slave now.

594
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,620
- He's a slave.
- Poor him.

595
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,850
- That's unbelievable.
- He had the one with ten dollars.

596
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,730
- You had only ten dollars, Ye Bin.
- What should we do?

597
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,120
- That means we had more than that.
- Ye Bin.

598
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,390
This is unbelievable.

599
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,540
Please.

600
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,560
(Earlier on)

601
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,660
(Pay)

602
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,660
(Payment in progress)

603
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,670
- Doesn't it work?
- Payment failed.

604
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,170
Please try again.

605
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,370
(The youngest writer's card had
only ten dollars.)

606
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,870
It says you have insufficient funds.

607
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,910
(He came in last in the game
when he had the least amount.)

608
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,410
- That means we had more than that.
- Ye Bin.

609
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,490
This is unbelievable.

610
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,020
- We have our first slave now.
- So Min, I didn't know...

611
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,690
- you'd spend that much.
- I can't believe I picked this one.

612
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,350
- How come he picked that one?
- One hundred dollars?

613
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,120
- He almost switched it to another.
- Right.

614
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,350
- I was going to switch it.
- Only ten dollars.

615
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,560
How did you pick the card
with ten dollars?

616
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,820
How would I know?

617
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,770
I can't believe you picked
the one with ten dollars.

618
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,470
Hey, how could you give
the youngest writer ten dollars?

619
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,600
- That was unexpected.
- Suk Jin, change your clothes.

620
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,770
We'll get going when he's back.

621
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,940
- Seok Sam is a slave. Okay.
- Okay.

622
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,310
He's the slave number one.

623
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,010
- He'll serve us, right?
- Yes.

624
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,510
Hey, Seok Sam.

625
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,910
- I'm not a slave yet.
- That's okay.

626
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,410
Okay. Let's go.

627
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,910
I'm ready. Okay.

628
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,020
Haha has to go number two.

629
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,850
My gosh.

630
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,260
You said it, Haha.

631
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,500
As if she had never used a toilet. Gosh.

632
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,820
- I told you, I have no anus.
- That's a lie.

633
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,300
- My gosh.
- You're a celebrity. Do you poop?

634
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,300
- Of course, I poop.
- Really? I didn't know that.

635
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,160
I've flushed the toilet
because you didn't.

636
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,710
(He got caught.)

637
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,210
I didn't see that coming.

638
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,050
Can you believe this slave?
It's taking him so long.

639
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,510
Seok Sam!

640
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,570
Let's go without him.

641
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,780
The slave hasn't come yet.

642
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,910
Gosh, he's taking too long.

643
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,140
He'll ride a horse to catch up.

644
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,640
- We used to leave him behind.
- But if we do that today,

645
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,580
- he'll get so mad.
- He should walk all the way there.

646
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,650
- Does he seem sensitive today?
- Yes, very much so.

647
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,920
Actually, Suk Jin loses his temper
so often lately.

648
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,150
He seems awfully sensitive today.

649
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,000
- He's going through menopause.
- I think so too.

650
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,460
- He gets hot flashes too.
- Well, I think...

651
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,300
Maybe he simply has diva syndrome.

652
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,830
- DS?
- Right.

653
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,000
- "DS"?
- He acts like a diva.

654
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
- Let's call it DS.
- Okay.

655
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,040
But I feel sorry for him.
I want to be nice to him.

656
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,600
- He might slack off.
- Think about it.

657
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,870
- He went there uninvited.
- Exactly.

658
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,550
That's just...

659
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,070
- It made me feel...
- That was surprising.

660
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,910
- That's sad.
- It's so sad.

661
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,280
- Let's be nice to him.
- Okay.

662
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
- Right. Suk Jin...
- Hey.

663
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,290
He's here.

664
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,250
- He's here.
- Seok Sam.

665
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,380
How dare you?

666
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,170
- Sit here, Seok Sam.
- Yes, my lord.

667
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,710
- Thank you.
- You look better in this costume.

668
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,880
I agree. Suk Jin, you look
more comfortable in it.

669
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,650
Why? We're just role-playing.

670
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,950
- Shouldn't he be polite to us?
- Come on, Suk Jin.

671
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,920
- Haha is right, Suk Jin.
- I just looked.

672
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,220
- Okay. Don't...
- Yes.

673
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,920
- Do not glare at me.
- I just looked. That's all.

674
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,500
- Understood.
- How old are you, Slave?

675
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,000
- Don't do that again.
- I'm 57, my lord.

676
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,230
(Slave Ji is 57 years old.)

677
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,400
"I'm 57, my lord."

678
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,930
- "I'm 57, my lord."
- That's right.

679
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:15,010
Did you pay for getting older faster?

680
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,580
How much money did you spend on it?

681
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,910
Why did you spend so much money
when you had only ten dollars?

682
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,680
It wasn't like that.
I expected you to pay...

683
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,980
a bigger portion than that.

684
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,150
- Seok Jjeon.
- Yes?

685
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,650
- "Seok Jjeon"?
- "Seok Jjeon"?

686
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,980
- Who is Seok Jjeon?
- Seok Jjeon.

687
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,760
- I like that nickname.
- I like it too.

688
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,120
Seok Sam, I'll fix your headband.

689
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,120
- Why did you tie it like this?
- That's so kind of him.

690
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,420
- Indeed.
- He's so nice.

691
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,500
Pull it tightly.

692
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,870
- My gosh.
- Hey.

693
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,110
That makes you feel dizzy.

694
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,660
You start feeling dizzy in ten minutes.

695
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,040
- It does make you feel dizzy.
- Yes.

696
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,280
- It leaves dents on the forehead.
- Oh, dear.

697
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,400
I will try my very best
to keep you all in a good mood.

698
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Until we have another slave.

699
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,910
- Seok Sam.
- Yes, my lord.

700
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,640
Why don't you sing for us
to keep us entertained?

701
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,440
- Let us hear you sing.
- Right. Sing for us.

702
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,520
- All right.
- Seok Sam.

703
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,860
(Look at me)

704
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,120
- Look at me
- How dare you ruin the mood?

705
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,830
- Sing it without using vibrato.
- Sing a K-pop song.

706
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,690
- Sing a K-pop song.
- Slap him in the face.

707
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,160
- Sing a K-pop song.
- The latest songs.

708
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,660
(He starts singing a K-pop song
after getting scolded.)

709
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,510
(I can feel)

710
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,470
- Stop. That's your problem.
- Your warm breath

711
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,080
- Breath
- Exactly.

712
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,280
- He has a bad habit.
- That's your habit.

713
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,750
You must quit doing that to be successful.

714
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,970
- Get rid of that habit, Seok Sam.
- My gosh.

715
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,280
- How dare you sing like that?
- Sing like this. I can

716
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,850
- Slap him in the face.
- Feel

717
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,210
Stop saying that.

718
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,210
(Emotionally exhausted)

719
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,060
I can feel

720
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,520
- I'll try again.
- That's a bad habit.

721
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,650
- That's right.
- Suk Jin with a bad singing habit.

722
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,720
(I can feel)

723
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,760
It's weird.

724
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,600
(Seok Sam can't sing
without his usual singing method.)

725
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,890
It's really weird, my lord.

726
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,460
- I can feel
- "It's really weird, my lord."

727
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,230
- How dare you talk back to us?
- I can feel

728
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,500
Slap him in the face.

729
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,900
- Stop saying that.
- Stop it.

730
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,170
(While Seok Sam keeps
getting slapped in the face...)

731
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,580
(They arrived at the 2nd place,
M personal color center in Gangnam.)

732
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,850
(All the colors in the world
gathered here.)

733
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,910
(What will they do at the 2nd place?)

734
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,290
- Please come this way.
- Okay.

735
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,440
- What's this?
- Seok Sam.

736
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,790
- This is pretty.
- Look at that bag.

737
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,620
- It suits my outfit color, right?
- Yes.

738
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,090
- That's a pretty color.
- Please have a seat.

739
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,920
- That's pretty.
- What's this?

740
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,330
I see a lot of nice T-shirts there.

741
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,030
It seems like we'll have to spend
a lot of money here.

742
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,030
We're here for the second activity,
the personal color test,

743
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,690
which is very popular
with people in their 20s and 30s.

744
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,690
- Really?
- Yes.

745
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,230
Why didn't I know this?
I know all the popular things.

746
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,540
These days, this is a popular place
to go on a date as well.

747
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,110
- A place like this is?
- Really? On a date?

748
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,340
- Yes, to find out the best color...
- That's new.

749
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,470
- Okay. I'll try it until next week.
- Then So Min should sit here.

750
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,210
Go ahead.

751
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,280
(Come over here.)

752
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,290
(Seducing her boyfriend)

753
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,060
- I almost moved to that sofa.
- Hey.

754
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,030
- People around me criticized you.
- You should sit next to her.

755
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,260
- Why?
- They would say,

756
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,300
- "Who is he to keep a distance..."
- They criticized me?

757
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,330
"from So Min?"

758
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,420
- People around me...
- It wasn't like that.

759
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,270
- That's not the case.
- That's not the case.

760
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,890
Se Chan had a girlfriend
when he kept his distance from her.

761
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,660
Really? Then don't you have
a girlfriend now?

762
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,340
- Do you have a girlfriend or not?
- His pronunciation was weird.

763
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,730
- What was that?
- He can't pronounce words properly.

764
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,610
- Answer me. Are you single?
- Suk Jin...

765
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,610
used to be yelled at as he imitated
dialects poorly in a comedy skit.

766
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,520
- Do you have a girlfriend? Tell me.
- I can imagine that.

767
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,080
- No, I don't.
- Do you have a girlfriend or not?

768
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Suk Jin...

769
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,320
- Suk Jin should thank me.
- I don't have a girlfriend.

770
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,710
- Why?
- I introduced him to his wife.

771
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,590
- Exactly.
- Right. He owes you.

772
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,020
I also set him up...

773
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,480
- with his ex-girlfriend.
- What?

774
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,860
- What did you say?
- Did you?

775
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,120
- What are you talking about?
- That's TMI.

776
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,800
- Are we talking about the old days?
- Right.

777
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,960
- Right. I get it.
- It's true. I set him up with her.

778
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,100
You met your ex-girlfriend at a club
because I asked her to join us.

779
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,960
He asked her to join them?

780
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,570
- I can't believe you.
- What?

781
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,840
- Is that true?
- You've crossed the line.

782
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,630
- Why?
- Do you want me to keep going?

783
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,900
- Do you want me to keep going?
- He must know something else.

784
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,550
(Whispering)

785
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,970
I can... What's going on?
Why did you turn around?

786
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,940
- Whenever you guys talk about it,
- What is it? I'm upset.

787
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,970
Haha suddenly becomes so quiet.

788
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,650
- That's so interesting.
- Don't mess with me. I know things.

789
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,360
- That's scary.
- Be careful.

790
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,030
- Be careful.
- I haven't done anything.

791
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,880
- There's nothing wrong with it.
- What?

792
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,450
- That's true.
- Goodness.

793
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,650
You must be good to her.

794
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,830
Jong Kook became quiet too.

795
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,870
- He also...
- They seem to know...

796
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,800
- about each other's past.
- He also...

797
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,270
He just didn't make it official.

798
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,630
I have nothing to hide.

799
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,370
- We never talk about it...
- I have no secrets.

800
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,780
only because you're good at fighting.

801
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,810
(We never talk about it
because you're strong.)

802
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,140
- He might beat you up.
- What?

803
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,970
- That's the only reason.
- That's true.

804
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,170
I'm itching to blurt it out.

805
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,120
Now, let's meet CEO Kang A Ra,
an image consultant...

806
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,320
and a colorist who will help you
find the best colors for you.

807
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,380
CEO Kang A Ra.

808
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,020
- Hello.
- Oh, my. Hello.

809
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,030
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.

810
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,330
Her shoes are so flashy.

811
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,000
- That's unexpected.
- She's in killer heels.

812
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,220
Is this your personal color, Ms. Kang?

813
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,530
- Yes, it is.
- How pretty.

814
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,800
- You got all dolled up.
- Yes, I did.

815
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,160
- Please have a seat.
- Sit down, please.

816
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,700
I invited you all here today
to help you find...

817
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,700
- the best colors for you,
- That's great.

818
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,630
- your personal colors.
- I see.

819
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,170
I didn't know there was a place like this.

820
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,610
Is this a hot place?

821
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,210
I'm planning to make it one.

822
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,250
I'm trying to make it popular.

823
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,020
- That was an honest answer.
- I like that.

824
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,050
- I'm going to make it happen.
- She could've said it was popular.

825
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,820
- I'm sure many will visit here...
- I can't lie.

826
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,860
- after watching this.
- Suddenly,

827
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,120
I'm confused about where I am.

828
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,120
- "Sixth Sense"?
- Is this real or fake?

829
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,480
I got confused as well.

830
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,100
- "Sixth Sense"?
- This place looks...

831
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,060
- Running Man is real.
- Jae Suk,

832
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,160
- don't you think this is fake?
- What?

833
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,600
- No, it's real.
- It all looks fake.

834
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
- It doesn't look real.
- It looks fake somehow.

835
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,690
- I'll give you an introduction.
- Yes.

836
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,430
Here's what a personal color test
is about.

837
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,340
There are colors with yellow tints...

838
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,630
like the sunlight in the afternoon...

839
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,430
and with warm feelings.
They're called warm tone colors.

840
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,610
Warm tone colors?

841
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,050
And there are colors with blue tints...

842
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,350
and cool, refreshing feelings like
the sunlight in the early morning.

843
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,880
- They're called cool tone colors.
- That sounds nice too.

844
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,760
Simply put, people wear...

845
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,620
- gold and silver accessories.
- Yes.

846
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,860
Some people look better with gold
while the others look better...

847
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,030
- with silver.
- I look amazing with gold.

848
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,120
- Oh, you do?
- But you have a cool skin tone.

849
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,600
- Then you should get gold teeth.
- He has a cool skin tone.

850
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,000
(Then you should get gold teeth.)

851
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,130
Why would you go so extreme?

852
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,430
- He said he looked good with gold.
- Gosh, seriously.

853
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,400
First, we're going to find out
if you look better...

854
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,040
- in warm or cold colors.
- Oh, I see.

855
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,140
- Do people do things like this?
- I've never tried this before.

856
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,140
- And then,
- I'm curious.

857
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,440
we'll have a look at different colors...

858
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,410
using fabrics for the test
to find your personal colors.

859
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,620
- It sounds expensive.
- I understand.

860
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,820
- By the way...
- It must cost a lot of money.

861
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,680
How much is the test per person?

862
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,760
- It depends on the type of test.
- The price...

863
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,920
- It starts from 100 dollars.
- What?

864
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,600
- One hundred dollars?
- That's not so bad.

865
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,800
- It's so expensive.
- We'll all become slaves.

866
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,390
- We'll go broke.
- We'll get...

867
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,800
- a discount.
- Of course.

868
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,070
- Oh, we'll get a discount.
- A large group gets a discount.

869
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,010
- The more people,
- Of course, we'll get a discount.

870
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,010
- the bigger discount.
- Of course.

871
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,040
- I'm relieved. If it's 100 dollars,
- Okay.

872
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,250
- we'd go broke.
- We can only spend limited amount.

873
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,970
- We'll all go broke except for two.
- We're on a mission now.

874
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,080
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

875
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,180
- Let's begin. Who will go first?
- Okay. Then...

876
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,980
Shall we start with Se Chan?

877
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,760
- Me?
- Se Chan will go first.

878
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,120
- Please sit here.
- He looks better in warm colors.

879
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,420
You don't look good at all in that color.

880
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,620
You look like you're sick.

881
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,530
- I look good in light colors.
- Now...

882
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,030
- You do look good in light colors.
- Se Chan looks great...

883
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,960
- in vivid colors.
- But I rarely wear such colors.

884
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,070
- He looks good in bright colors.
- He wouldn't look good with gold.

885
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,900
I don't think I've ever thought
about the best color for me.

886
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,130
- I've never thought about it.
- Right.

887
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,780
- I always choose light colors.
- I just pick colors I like.

888
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,750
I like anything that's expensive.

889
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,780
Now, we're going to see
if you look better...

890
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,710
- in warm or cool colors...
- Yes.

891
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,480
- using gold and silver fabrics.
- Okay.

892
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,860
I'll put the gold one in front of him.

893
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,530
If you see his face,
his skin looks more yellowish.

894
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,530
His face looks a little bit sallow.

895
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,530
- His skin looks...
- I mean...

896
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,500
- In that color, he reminds me...
- His face looks a bit yellow.

897
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,130
- of "Comedy Big League".
- As if he had jaundice.

898
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,230
- He looks sallow in gold.
- Right.

899
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,810
He looks like a rockfish
with an edible gold leaf on it.

900
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,630
- As if he'd been constipated,
- A sashimi restaurant...

901
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,640
- his face turns yellow.
- It made his face look sallow.

902
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,440
- Let's try the silver color.
- Let's see.

903
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,790
- It makes his face glow, right?
- He doesn't look too great.

904
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,620
- His face looks so bright now.
- Don't I look like a hairtail?

905
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,120
My reflection in the mirror
totally looks like a hairtail.

906
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,260
I think he must go back to the sea.

907
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,380
- He looks neat...
- I think he looks much better now.

908
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,420
- This one is much better.
- Right.

909
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,000
- His skin looks firmer now as well.
- This is so fascinating.

910
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,390
- You're right. I can see that.
- Right.

911
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,870
You look like a braised mackerel.

912
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,230
- Come on. Did I look better?
- You looked completely different...

913
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,430
- from when you were in gold.
- I looked better in silver?

914
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,930
- I see.
- You do look better in silver.

915
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,160
This is amazing.
I've never done this before.

916
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,340
- Now, we'll look at various colors.
- Yes.

917
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,610
- We'll check four shades of purple.
- I love purple.

918
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,250
- Four shades?
- We'll see four shades of purple.

919
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,640
- Four shades of purple.
- It makes his skin look darker.

920
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,440
- This is light, warm-toned purple.
- Well... I think...

921
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,910
- In this color...
- He doesn't look so great in it.

922
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,520
That's right.
His cheeks look a little bit red.

923
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,620
And I think this color makes
his mustache stand out.

924
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,800
- And his lips...
- Because he looks like a catfish.

925
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,530
He has a mustache like that of a catfish.

926
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,600
- He looks like a fish.
- I don't have a full mustache.

927
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
- He has a face like a catfish.
- This time,

928
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,070
let's try a cool-toned color
that people often wear in summer.

929
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,130
- He looks so neat, right?
- He looks better in it.

930
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,010
- It flatters his skin tone.
- Really?

931
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,700
- In the warm-toned color...
- Hold on a second.

932
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,400
Even before you showed the second color,

933
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,940
you said, "He looks so neat, right?"
You said it as you revealed it.

934
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,350
- You said it as you revealed it.
- I tried to...

935
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,910
- make it sound more convincing.
- I can't see it.

936
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,590
- She made us believe it.
- Exactly.

937
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,320
- I mean, after looking at it...
- She said it before dropping it.

938
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,880
- Right.
- Look. He looks great, right?

939
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,480
- That's exactly what she did.
- Look.

940
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,030
(He looks great, right?)

941
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,920
- Did you see that?
- She said it before it fell down.

942
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,870
- See? I think...
- That's...

943
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,130
- She's like a salesperson.
- She has her own pattern.

944
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,270
- She forced the idea on us.
- I guess...

945
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,870
- She must've done some research.
- She already knew our colors.

946
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,230
- That's my secret.
- She knew once she saw us.

947
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,160
- She was supposed to let us...
- Right.

948
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,540
- think about it before saying that.
- You see,

949
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,970
it's like how hypnosis works.

950
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,510
- He looks better in cool colors...
- Cool colors.

951
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,440
- than in warm colors.
- He looks better in cool colors.

952
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,550
- He's a cool tone guy.
- I see.

953
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,140
- I was wrong about that.
- That is,

954
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,210
he's better with a silver hairtail
than a gold ax.

955
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,590
- This color isn't for him.
- He doesn't look good in it.

956
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,410
- He doesn't look good in it.
- This is a warm-toned, a bit dark,

957
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,980
- elegant color for autumn.
- That doesn't suit him.

958
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,030
- That's right.
- It doesn't suit him.

959
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,530
- It makes his skin look less firm.
- That's right.

960
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,800
- His skin looks rough.
- Next up is a cool-toned color...

961
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,530
for winter, and he looks...

962
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,690
- He looks good in this color.
- It's not bad,

963
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,100
but he looks as if he were
dominated by darkness.

964
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,630
- Dominated by darkness?
- What is she talking about?

965
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,930
- I'm dominated by darkness?
- My gosh.

966
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,170
Hey, you must be possessed
by an evil spirit.

967
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,280
You think I'm possessed by an evil spirit?

968
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,640
- It makes him look that way.
- He's dominated by darkness.

969
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,640
- That color was nice. Indeed.
- It's fascinating.

970
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,870
I see the different looks
that different colors create.

971
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,620
- I see that too.
- It's interesting.

972
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,550
There are various shades of red
used to make lipsticks.

973
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,760
- It doesn't suit him at all.
- He doesn't look good in it.

974
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,830
It makes his face look a little bluish.

975
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,590
- It makes his face look lifeless.
- I think it's not so bad.

976
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,030
- It makes his face looks bluish...
- But...

977
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,060
But he looks so great in this color.

978
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,100
(He looks great in this color.)

979
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,220
Give us some time to think.

980
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,220
- I mean...
- Take a look at him first.

981
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,930
I couldn't even see it.
While I was blinking,

982
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,960
- she dropped it.
- You should look at him first.

983
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,610
- She didn't even see it.
- This is strange.

984
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,230
- I couldn't see it.
- You should look at him first.

985
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,430
- She wouldn't care what we think.
- I mean, this is...

986
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,010
- My goodness.
- It's a cool-toned, summer color.

987
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,400
- It's a cool color.
- He does look great in it though.

988
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,870
- Yes, he does.
- He looks much better in this.

989
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:22,050
Let's try a warm-toned
maple leaf color for autumn.

990
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,640
- He doesn't look great.
- It's a little dark for his skin.

991
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,140
- I think it's not so bad.
- And it makes his face...

992
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,620
- look a little yellow.
- He doesn't look sophisticated.

993
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,060
Now, let's check out this cool color.

994
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,220
He looks more calm and neat.

995
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,420
- You're right. He looks calm.
- He looks better in this one.

996
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,620
That's right.

997
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,260
- You see, Ms. Kang...
- I'm not so sure about it.

998
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,600
says, "That's right"
when we agree with her.

999
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,230
- She won't listen to us.
- When we don't,

1000
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,870
she says, "But rather than this color..."

1001
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,700
She must've done research before we came.

1002
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,340
- Let's compare pastel colors now.
- He looks good in pastel colors.

1003
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,750
Compare how he looks
in these bright colors...

1004
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,050
- and in these light colors.
- That's better.

1005
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,880
- I prefer this one.
- He looks better in this one.

1006
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,620
These colors with higher saturation
are not bad for him...

1007
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,880
You expected us to say
this one was better, right?

1008
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,020
- No, that's not the case.
- I prefer this one.

1009
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,060
- That's not the case.
- She's flustered.

1010
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,060
I prefer this one.

1011
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,620
- Just tell us the answer.
- She's taken aback.

1012
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,150
- Follow my lead.
- Okay.

1013
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,860
- The bright colors...
- She's taken aback.

1014
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,330
- They're not bad. They suit him.
- But...

1015
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,130
But these lighter colors make him
look more sophisticated,

1016
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,010
and make Se Chan's face stand out.

1017
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,070
I agree.

1018
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,770
His face shouldn't stand out too much.

1019
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,040
- My outfit should.
- Exactly.

1020
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,730
I need to draw attention away from
my face.

1021
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,870
- That's what he needs.
- He needs to distract attention.

1022
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,640
Let's add a little gray color
to these colors.

1023
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,350
- Now he looks...
- Oh, no.

1024
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,640
- His face looks darker.
- I don't like that.

1025
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,380
- He looks more sophisticated now.
- His face looks darker.

1026
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,380
(He looks sophisticated?)

1027
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,950
- His face looks darker.
- They're all saying...

1028
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,880
it doesn't suit me, but she claims
it makes me look sophisticated.

1029
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,620
- I thought they were too dusky.
- No, they're not.

1030
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,500
- No?
- The light colors are not bad.

1031
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,530
- He looks amazing in them.
- But with more gray in them,

1032
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,620
- they make him look sophisticated.
- It's nice.

1033
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,070
I think I look better in this.

1034
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,630
- We think this one is better.
- I prefer this one.

1035
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,430
- His facial features look too soft.
- Yes, that's right.

1036
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,630
- Yes. You have a good eye.
- Right?

1037
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,810
- I have a good eye, right?
- But I prefer that one.

1038
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,080
- She's right.
- You look good in light colors too.

1039
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,850
The best color scheme for Se Chan is
the summer mute tone.

1040
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,640
- He's a tender man.
- Mute...

1041
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,280
- A tender man?
- Just like Song Kang.

1042
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,090
- What? Kang?
- Come on. Song Kang?

1043
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,950
- Just like Song Kang...
- You mean, Song Kang Ho, right?

1044
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,980
(You mean, Song Kang Ho, right?)

1045
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,120
- Just like Song Kang,
- He's more like Song Kang Ho.

1046
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,920
- Se Chan is a tender guy.
- I understand.

1047
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,220
- Okay.
- Go back to your seat.

1048
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,120
- Song Kang? You're Yang Kang now.
- Right, Song Kang.

1049
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,420
- Yang Kang.
- Yang Kang.

1050
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,800
Next up is Seok Sam.

1051
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,890
We'll check out different shades
of yellow.

1052
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,130
- It doesn't suit him.
- Not at all.

1053
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,630
- But I like yellow.
- You don't look great in it.

1054
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,340
- But I like this color too.
- You look like you have jaundice.

1055
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,010
- No, it doesn't suit you.
- Let's try a cool-toned color.

1056
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,730
- Gosh.
- It's lighter,

1057
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,550
- His face looks sallow.
- but it makes him look pale.

1058
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,280
- His face looks sallow.
- He looks like he has jaundice.

1059
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,550
We're not trying to find a color
that makes your face look brighter.

1060
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,550
- That's not the point.
- But his face looks sallow.

1061
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,210
This color makes him look less lively.

1062
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,020
- That's true.
- It makes his face look sallow.

1063
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,650
- So this yellow...
- This one makes him look yellow.

1064
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,120
This color makes me look...
That's because it's yellow.

1065
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,720
- That's true, but...
- This makes him look yellow.

1066
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,120
He can't focus on what she says.

1067
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
- He got too excited.
- It makes him look lively.

1068
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,430
He's the type that all teachers hate.

1069
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,870
- You know what I mean, right?
- They don't listen to teachers.

1070
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,630
- Let's move on.
- Let's try a cool color.

1071
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,900
- I don't think...
- This doesn't suit him.

1072
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,510
- He looks like a sick person.
- It doesn't suit me.

1073
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,510
It makes me look older.

1074
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,700
- He looks like a dead person.
- As if he were dying right now.

1075
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,610
- That color...
- It takes his liveliness away.

1076
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,750
- He looks like a dead person?
- I'm not choosing...

1077
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,550
- the color for my shroud.
- I mean, that color...

1078
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,290
- He looks like a dead person?
- This color makes him look lively.

1079
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:13,580
- "A dead person"?
- "A dead person"?

1080
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,620
That's so mean.

1081
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,020
- It's just the color...
- Let's try a bit darker colors...

1082
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,630
- as well.
- It's a sophisticated color though.

1083
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,250
- Yes, it's a sophisticated color.
- There are dress shirts...

1084
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,330
- in this color.
- But it doesn't suit you.

1085
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,400
It doesn't suit you.

1086
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,690
- It doesn't suit you.
- You're forcing the idea on me.

1087
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,900
Maybe I can nail that color.

1088
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,500
- It's not the best color for you.
- Let's...

1089
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,000
Ms. Kang will probably make a scene
after we leave.

1090
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,710
"Gosh, those punks!"

1091
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,040
- "Darn it."
- "They wouldn't stop talking."

1092
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,380
The spring warm-toned colors
suit him best.

1093
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,170
- He looks great in such colors.
- The spring warm-toned colors.

1094
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,850
- Warm colors?
- Yes. Your colors are warm colors.

1095
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,270
- Okay. Great.
- Warm colors.

1096
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,350
- Jae Suk.
- Next up is Jae Suk.

1097
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,020
- Me? I like blue.
- Yes.

1098
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,710
- I like many different colors.
- I see.

1099
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,330
Can you compare gold and silver
as you did for me?

1100
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,480
I look better in silver.

1101
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,690
- You look better in silver.
- Yes.

1102
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,230
- Better than in gold.
- He wouldn't look good in gold.

1103
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,750
- That's not your color.
- Right?

1104
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,630
- It makes his face look green.
- He looks like an alien.

1105
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,400
- He's like Yoda.
- Yes, an alien.

1106
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,540
An alien for sure.

1107
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,170
- It gives me a yellow complexion.
- Like Yoda.

1108
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,630
- Yoda.
- That's a no.

1109
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,170
- Hi, baby octopus.
- I know.

1110
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,210
This is just as weird.

1111
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,580
Where did this baby octopus come from?

1112
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,100
- A hairtail.
- Maybe a cuttlefish.

1113
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,080
- Yoda or baby octopus?
- He's like a baby octopus.

1114
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,880
- This suits him better.
- Yes, silver is better.

1115
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,650
It's better than the first one.

1116
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,350
- Right.
- He only has two choices.

1117
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,880
- Between gold and silver...
- Silver over gold.

1118
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,080
Silver is more my color.

1119
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,810
- This is a color I love.
- Different shades of blue.

1120
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,730
- This is the color you prefer.
- Yes, I love blue.

1121
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,960
- This is a bright aqua blue.
- I don't think this suits me.

1122
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,960
- It gives you a greener complexion.
- Don't voice your opinion.

1123
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,870
- Stop butting in.
- Let her do the talking.

1124
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,630
A summer cool tone...

1125
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,170
- No, this isn't the one.
- This is way better.

1126
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,560
- It's like you washed your face.
- I love it.

1127
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,810
This is the type of color I love.

1128
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,480
- An autumn warm tone.
- No way.

1129
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,600
- He looks dull.
- This isn't the one.

1130
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,440
- A winter cool tone.
- Yes, this one!

1131
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,650
(He loves it.)

1132
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,710
Nice!

1133
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,440
- Ms. Kang hates it though.
- I love it.

1134
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,290
- Check out Ms. Kang.
- A lighter color suits you...

1135
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,150
- as well as this brighter one.
- I love it.

1136
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,230
- Blue seems to suit you.
- Right.

1137
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,250
He's always been fond of blue.

1138
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,630
Blue is my favorite color.

1139
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,020
He likes cheekier colors, doesn't he?

1140
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,600
Let's take a look at this array of colors.

1141
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,790
- Here.
- Brighter colors are for me.

1142
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,730
- Rather than these vivid colors...
- That looks nice.

1143
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,290
A toned-down version of those colors...

1144
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,560
- No way!
- These are better.

1145
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,270
I don't like these.

1146
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,810
- Look at Ms. Kang.
- I hate muted colors.

1147
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,330
I don't like them.

1148
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,650
- Why? They suit you.
- I hate muted colors.

1149
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,270
I tend to stay away from muted colors.

1150
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,810
No way!

1151
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,190
Rather than these vivid colors...

1152
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,750
- I love it.
- It gives you a greener complexion.

1153
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,750
- Sorry?
- A greener complexion.

1154
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,150
Who cares?

1155
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,980
- I just love it.
- He's exhausting.

1156
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,130
She might end up telling him to leave.

1157
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,060
- Muted down colors...
- No, Ms. Kang!

1158
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,130
- They suit you better.
- I hate muted colors.

1159
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,630
She has already made her mind up,
so just accept it.

1160
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,040
- She won't listen.
- It's her way or the highway.

1161
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,310
What about the color black? Would it...

1162
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,960
I don't wear black often.

1163
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,170
- Black...
- Black?

1164
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,900
- It's a sophisticated color.
- It's the color I'm fond of.

1165
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,900
Black is a color
that has a sophisticated vibe to it.

1166
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,980
It doesn't necessarily mean
that Jae Sexy...

1167
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,040
Not him, right?

1168
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,350
It doesn't mean
he has a sophisticated look.

1169
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,420
Black doesn't make you look sophisticated.

1170
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,790
It's just the vibe that black gives off.

1171
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,920
Ms. Kang, are your opinions
based on looks?

1172
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,350
That seems more like it.

1173
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,020
- It depends on one's looks.
- Only the tone should matter!

1174
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,060
- Ms. Kang, you...
- What if Gong Yoo had that on?

1175
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,790
Unbelievable.

1176
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,870
Let's try some patterns.

1177
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:17,540
We'll see why vivid colors suit you more.

1178
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,810
- She's persuading us.
- Rather than...

1179
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,540
clothing with subtle patterns,

1180
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,940
items with distinct patterns
elevate his overall look.

1181
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,350
- That looks good on you.
- Isn't it better?

1182
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,880
- They bring out his features.
- Vivid patterns are for you.

1183
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,420
- A contrasting pattern...
- Checkered isn't my jam.

1184
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,850
Right, and...

1185
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,920
This is the one.

1186
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,560
- I like the stronger pattern.
- Nice.

1187
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:38,420
A contrasting look suits him...

1188
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,350
which is why it's crucial for him
to wear glasses.

1189
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,250
- That was out of concern.
- Can't he take off his glasses?

1190
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,500
- Our looks should be irrelevant!
- Ms. Kang...

1191
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,270
- She keeps mentioning his looks.
- Yes, constantly.

1192
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,940
Why are you snickering back there?

1193
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,210
- Glasses are a must.
- Unbelievable.

1194
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,460
Let's swap out those glasses.

1195
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,770
It's about time you did.

1196
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,310
These are all right.

1197
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,670
- No, you don't look all right?
- You look good.

1198
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,040
I don't look all right?

1199
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,440
He doesn't look all right.

1200
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,150
But these look okay on me.

1201
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,310
- Let me see.
- They're not for you.

1202
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,210
- He likes them.
- But I quite like them.

1203
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,790
Glasses like these bring out
the "Snowpiercer" lady in him.

1204
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,980
- Absolutely.
- These suit you the best.

1205
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,250
It's why I wear them.

1206
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,330
Yes, they certainly do.

1207
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,630
- These suit me.
- What suits him is anything...

1208
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,250
- that provides contrast.
- Of course.

1209
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,130
- How fascinating.
- These are the same.

1210
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,630
There are certain colors that suit you.

1211
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,130
Cool tones suit you...

1212
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,130
and you do well with items
that provide contrast.

1213
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,500
Next up is Haha.

1214
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,730
- Why not?
- Haha's next.

1215
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:26,960
I'm one...

1216
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,580
to enjoy a variety of colors.

1217
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,600
- This intrigues me.
- It's not the same...

1218
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,500
as the colors you like.

1219
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,880
Let's check with these colors first.

1220
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,810
Here are the warmer tones.

1221
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:39,120
Let's compare warm colors to cool colors.

1222
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,560
- He looks sophisticated.
- These are better.

1223
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,580
- These are much better.
- He looks younger.

1224
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,850
He'd eat dung as a dip
if people think it's hip.

1225
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,750
Let's see him with hipster items.

1226
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,500
- Yes, let's see how he looks.
- Here you go.

1227
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,230
- Take this hairpiece for example.
- Sure.

1228
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,690
With hairpieces?

1229
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,730
- Rather than a pastel tone...
- That's just wrong.

1230
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,370
A more...

1231
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,270
- The vibrant one is better.
- Hipster in the house!

1232
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,870
- He's like G-DRAGON!
- This is it!

1233
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,130
- G-DRAGON.
- And not a maltese?

1234
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,270
- No, G-DRAGON.
- This is the one.

1235
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:04,650
- This looks good on you.
- Join me

1236
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,350
- This is the one.
- Gather around

1237
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,620
(Somewhere between G-DRAGON and a maltese)

1238
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,170
- This is the one for you.
- Haha...

1239
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,520
- Maltese Haha.
- Vivid colors suit you more...

1240
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,980
- which is why you look better...
- This is way better.

1241
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,620
- from the left.
- Yes, I can see that.

1242
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,710
It looks good on you.

1243
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,150
It's like a dye job for a pekingese.

1244
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,190
Just a second.

1245
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,630
Let me clip on some more hairpieces.

1246
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,900
(Let me clip on some more.)

1247
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,230
Rather than muted colors like these...

1248
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,290
(Wow...)

1249
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,060
It's like I'm in a dog cafe.

1250
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,370
(It's like I'm in a dog cafe.)

1251
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,370
You've seen photos of maltese dogs, right?

1252
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,040
That's the vibe I'm getting.

1253
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,540
- It's not bad.
- It's not so bad.

1254
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,330
- It's quite all right.
- You look stylish.

1255
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,440
You should wear these like accessories.

1256
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,400
- There you go.
- They aren't bad.

1257
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,920
You look stylish.

1258
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,210
Gosh. That's right. You look great.

1259
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,790
- There you go.
- It's not too bad.

1260
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:46,850
(He suffers from
stage four hipster syndrome.)

1261
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,460
Vivid colors make him look sophisticated.

1262
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,650
- I can't stand him.
- You look good though.

1263
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:51,790
Jong Kook can't stand him.

1264
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,980
I bet you can go out like this.

1265
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,790
I would if this makes me
look young and stylish for sure.

1266
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,520
- Of course you would.
- Would you wear those?

1267
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,130
You're the bomb.

1268
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,500
- Am I the bomb?
- You sure are.

1269
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,670
- You're the bomb.
- Skrr

1270
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,370
- Next up is Jong Kook.
- Kook Jong?

1271
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,560
All right.

1272
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,670
An autumn warm tone
like the colors of leaves.

1273
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,730
This isn't bad.

1274
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,230
- Right? It makes you look elegant.
- Yes. It's a vivid color.

1275
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,650
You look exactly like your mother!

1276
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,980
(You look exactly like your mother!)

1277
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,620
Rather than a brighter color...

1278
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,380
Brighter colors fail to define his angles.

1279
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,710
His face looks flatter.

1280
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,620
A darker shade...

1281
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,350
- The other one's better!
- Exactly.

1282
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,150
- That's what I secretly think.
- I like that one better too.

1283
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,420
- Ms. Kang bit down on her lips.
- That's odd.

1284
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,900
We don't see eye-to-eye on this.

1285
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,060
- It's all right though.
- Personal colors...

1286
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,520
aren't the same as those
that brighten your complexion.

1287
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,900
- She's an expert, you know.
- That she is.

1288
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,540
- Don't let us bother you.
- We should listen to her.

1289
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,870
Deep autumn colors are for you.

1290
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,540
- Deep autumn colors?
- Deep autumn colors.

1291
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,400
- They suit you the best.
- Really?

1292
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
- Ji Hyo, you're up.
- Ms. Song Ji Hyo.

1293
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,810
- But Ji Hyo...
- She looks good in any color.

1294
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,650
- Every color suits her.
- My money's on warm tones.

1295
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,580
I have two shades of purple.
Please look in the mirror.

1296
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,880
This is a warmer shade of purple
with a yellow undertone.

1297
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,920
- Next, we have a cooler tone.
- Is that one better?

1298
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,120
- A cooler shade of purple...
- Is "cool" the right answer?

1299
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,130
- I...
- Got it. The cooler tone.

1300
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,150
Okay. The cooler tone.

1301
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,560
- No, wait.
- Let's go with the cooler tone.

1302
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,650
The cooler tone suits you more.

1303
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,270
- It gives her a reddish tone...
- There's a yellow undertone.

1304
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,230
- It gives her a yellowy complexion.
- Right.

1305
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,730
It gives her
a green undertone as well, but...

1306
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:08,870
(They all cheer at the cooler tone.)

1307
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,460
- This sure suits you more.
- The cooler tone...

1308
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,330
- A cool tone!
- This is better.

1309
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,460
- Cooler tones suit you.
- It gives her a clearer look.

1310
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,170
- A cool tone.
- That's a cooler tone.

1311
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,630
An autumn warm tone...

1312
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:19,250
- makes her look duller.
- This one looks weird on you.

1313
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,020
It creates a shadow on her face as well.

1314
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,380
- This is the one!
- This color suits you as well.

1315
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,620
Ji Hyo's so cool.

1316
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,790
The lighter tone...

1317
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,420
and darker tone both suit her...

1318
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,960
- as long as they are a cooler tone.
- Cooler tones suit you.

1319
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,290
- She looks better with cool tones.
- Okay!

1320
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,290
- Nothing else came to mind.
- Brighter colors suit her too.

1321
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,960
Ji Hyo looks good with cooler tones.
What about So Min?

1322
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,130
- Next up is Jeonsobari.
- Warm?

1323
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,150
I think warmer tones suit me.

1324
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,600
- What's the correct answer?
- Pink...

1325
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,020
- Do warmer colors suit her?
- You two are the same type.

1326
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,170
- Which tone suits me?
- Cooler tones?

1327
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,460
The same as in warmer tones.

1328
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,900
- You're the same type.
- Got it.

1329
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,440
- The same type.
- Right.

1330
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,670
What's the answer?
You should let me know too.

1331
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,330
- Warm tones.
- Warm tones?

1332
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,380
- Let's see.
- What's this?

1333
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,040
- We'll check with pink shades.
- This doesn't suit her.

1334
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,770
- A yellowish pink...
- Is this a warm tone?

1335
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,790
- Coral pink...
- You look incredible!

1336
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,080
- Doesn't it suit her?
- It does!

1337
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,520
- You look incredible.
- This one's for you.

1338
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,850
- It brings out your features.
- It's the one for you.

1339
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,250
But a cooler tone...

1340
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,580
- No way.
- This is just wrong.

1341
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,960
- It's wrong.
- The other one suits her more.

1342
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,600
- This isn't for her.
- It makes her seem paler,

1343
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,520
but brighter colors do seem to suit her.

1344
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,420
- The other one is better.
- It's not bad though.

1345
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,790
- But this is better.
- This is the one.

1346
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:18,170
- It gives her a pinkish complexion.
- Absolutely.

1347
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,330
- Doesn't she seem brighter?
- She sure does.

1348
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,480
- Pink looks good on So Min.
- Right.

1349
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,670
This isn't so bad,

1350
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,940
- but a winter cool tone...
- Oh, dear.

1351
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,400
- That's not the right expression.
- Warmer tones suit her.

1352
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,650
Look sad.

1353
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,880
- Sad?
- Yes, look sad.

1354
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,750
- This one...
- It doesn't suit her.

1355
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,750
It casts a shadow on her face.

1356
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,190
So a bright warm spring tone...

1357
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,290
Warm tones suit me.

1358
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,420
Did she snatch it away?

1359
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,650
Brighter colors...

1360
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,650
- and spring warm colors...
- Unbelievable.

1361
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,020
- A lighter shade.
- She won't even give me a chance.

1362
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,520
If we're not on the same page as her...

1363
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,790
- She won't acknowledge you.
- Lighter shades.

1364
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,690
- To colors that don't suit you...
- She ignores you.

1365
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,060
She told So Min to look sad.

1366
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,100
- We all have our personal colors.
- Mine are warm tones.

1367
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,210
Just like that,

1368
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:56,710
you got to learn your personal colors.

1369
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,770
Please give it up for the expert.

1370
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,350
- Thank you, Ms. Kang.
- Thank you.

1371
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1372
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,810
We had a blast.

1373
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,540
- Someone else will soon be a slave.
- All right.

1374
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,810
You'll now play a game
to see who pays first.

1375
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:06,980
- How much is it?
- How much is it?

1376
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,290
(It's time to pay
for the second activity.)

1377
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,250
At least 300 dollars, right?

1378
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,960
- Or maybe not that much.
- Can we get a discount?

1379
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,960
It was 30 dollars each...

1380
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,230
- What?
- which brings the total to 210.

1381
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,350
A total of 210 dollars?

1382
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:19,900
(A total of 210 dollars)

1383
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,900
- Someone will go bankrupt.
- At least two.

1384
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,370
Here's the game you'll play.

1385
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,900
Now that you know your personal colors,

1386
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,370
you'll split into Team Cool...

1387
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,770
- and Team Warm.
- I'm Team Cool.

1388
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,270
- I'm Team Warm.
- I'm Team Warm.

1389
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,670
- I'm Team Warm.
- Warm.

1390
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:32,270
You'll now play the game.

1391
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:35,480
The four of us
give off a cooler vibe while...

1392
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,080
- We have warm hearts.
- They're dull.

1393
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,750
- Doesn't it seem that way?
- What?

1394
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,020
- Right?
- They can't let go of their anger.

1395
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,020
They lack something.

1396
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,790
Those three hold grudges.

1397
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,730
- Check them out.
- What are you talking about?

1398
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,060
We have a loser,
someone who holds grudges,

1399
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,380
and someone who sulks.

1400
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,400
What do you mean I sulk?

1401
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,730
Here's the game you'll play.

1402
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,270
In this game, we'll see
how knowledgeable you are.

1403
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,630
This is Fact Check Check.

1404
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,000
(Fact Check Check)

1405
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,100
The rules are simple.

1406
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,400
Listen to the keyword...

1407
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,000
and state a fact
that is associated with it.

1408
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,980
- A fact?
- Whatever is a fact.

1409
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,440
- It can be anything.
- Got it.

1410
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,600
Let's say the keyword is Yang Se Chan.

1411
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,480
- "His brother is Yang Se Hyeong."
- Like that?

1412
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,670
- "He's 37."
- That's right.

1413
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:13,120
It can't be something like,
"He's someone I like."

1414
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,210
Right, got it.

1415
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:15,810
- It has to be a fact.
- That won't do.

1416
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,020
Let's stick to the facts.

1417
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:20,150
Anyone who doesn't state a fact...

1418
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,150
- will lose three points.
- Got it.

1419
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,400
I just need to avoid coming in last.

1420
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,520
- We'll start over here.
- Sure.

1421
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:26,920
Cryptocurrency.

1422
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,170
- Cryptocurrency?
- One...

1423
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,940
It uses blockchain technology.

1424
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,230
- Correct.
- Right.

1425
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,670
I haven't purchased any.

1426
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,080
- That won't do.
- That's wrong.

1427
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,000
- Why? But it's true.
- It's not an associated fact.

1428
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,100
- But it's a fact.
- It is, so I'm good.

1429
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,250
You can't say the same thing though.

1430
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,540
I got a 50-percent return.

1431
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,190
- What?
- How is that a fact?

1432
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:49,520
Are you sure it's exactly 50 percent?

1433
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,630
- Please show us proof.
- Got it.

1434
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,850
It's true though.

1435
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,650
- It's true.
- Do you now have 150 percent?

1436
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,100
She invested 500 dollars.

1437
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,100
What? 500 dollars?

1438
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,600
- I invested 500 dollars.
- You got a 50-percent return?

1439
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,670
- You made 250 dollars?
- Yes.

1440
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,130
- Let us see it.
- Sure.

1441
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,370
For real? You made 250 dollars?

1442
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,560
Your rate of return is 56 percent.
It's not a fact.

1443
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,600
- No. Wait. When did it increase?
- It has to be exactly 50 percent.

1444
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,100
- It increased?
- Yes.

1445
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,440
- When did it increase?
- That's a good thing.

1446
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,940
- Sell it already!
- That's good for you.

1447
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,500
- I didn't know.
- Sell it already!

1448
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,150
I checked it with Se Chan
just before the shoot.

1449
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,540
- That's minus three points.
- It increased.

1450
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,650
Oh, my.

1451
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,850
Bitcoin...

1452
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,080
(The given word: Cryptocurrency)

1453
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,190
is the best!

1454
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,210
- Wrong!
- That's minus two points.

1455
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,060
I've never bought Bitcoins.

1456
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,150
- Haha said it earlier.
- I said that.

1457
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:29,330
- When?
- That's minus one point.

1458
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,420
You did?

1459
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,500
All right!

1460
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,600
- Great.
- Jae Suk is in first place.

1461
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,940
- Jong Kook is in second place.
- Jong Kook?

1462
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,130
- Se Chan is in third place.
- Yes.

1463
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:37,370
Ji Hyo is in fourth place.

1464
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:38,560
Haha is in fifth place.

1465
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,960
Suk Jin is in sixth place.

1466
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,210
- And So Min is in seventh place.
- Oh, no.

1467
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,270
- Poor So Min.
- I'm relieved.

1468
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,850
- So Min, goodbye.
- So Min.

1469
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,080
You lost.

1470
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,580
Please pay a little.

1471
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,520
- Gosh, So Min...
- The total cost is 210 dollars.

1472
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,290
The one in first place,
please make your payment.

1473
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,650
We must see when So Min
turns into a slave.

1474
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:55,710
It's important too.

1475
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,730
- So Min will lose for sure.
- Let's pay as little as possible.

1476
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,690
Jong Kook, we must pay
as little as possible.

1477
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,900
- Hello.
- Hello.

1478
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,960
(The first payer, Jae Suk)

1479
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,290
(He's done with his payment.)

1480
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:05,870
- I will make a payment.
- Thank you.

1481
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:08,730
Jong Kook, just pay as much as you can.

1482
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:10,370
I will make a payment.

1483
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:11,830
(Accumulated amount he used: 10 cents)

1484
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,330
(Jong Kook quickly
makes his payment as well.)

1485
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:17,670
So Min, I'll pay about 30 dollars.

1486
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,150
It's better to pay little.

1487
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,650
(Se Chan, Ji Hyo, and Haha finish
paying with a mysterious smile.)

1488
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,080
What's wrong with you?

1489
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,440
Gosh, seriously.

1490
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,290
You know that you have to pay some, right?

1491
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:27,290
Why is that?

1492
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,290
(Sullen)

1493
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,380
I have to pay with my card?

1494
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,060
So Min is worried
that she might become a slave.

1495
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,060
I don't want to be a slave.

1496
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,100
I don't want to be a slave.

1497
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,020
I have to pay with my card?

1498
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,870
- Hello.
- Suk Jin.

1499
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:40,600
Can you please use your money
to pay for it?

1500
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,730
- Suk Jin is using his money.
- Suk Jin, listen.

1501
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:44,960
Why don't we work together? Can you...

1502
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,060
What?

1503
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,130
use your money?

1504
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:49,210
- You want me to pay with my money?
- Yes, I beg you.

1505
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,810
Please, I beg you.

1506
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,100
- It looks like...
- Please, Suk Jin.

1507
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,270
So Min is out shopping
with her father-in-law.

1508
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:56,420
- Why are you making me pay?
- He's like her father-in-law.

1509
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,980
- Please save me this once.
- Suk Jin.

1510
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,520
- You're a slave anyway.
- You should have a slave companion.

1511
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,150
Please save me this once.
You're a slave anyway.

1512
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,350
- Be the hero.
- I know I'm a slave, but...

1513
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,690
- I'll pay you back. I'm serious.
- I'll pay 20 cents.

1514
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:08,830
I'll pay you...

1515
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,020
(So Min fails to win over
Ji the father-in-law.)

1516
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,500
- You should have a slave companion.
- Seok Sam.

1517
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,690
You should pay just ten cents.

1518
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:14,290
How can I pay only ten cents?

1519
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,040
(It's finally time for So Min to pay.)

1520
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,540
You have 199.8 dollars to pay.

1521
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,540
I shouldn't have spent
a lot in the first round.

1522
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,830
She has to pay about 190 dollars.

1523
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:25,100
That'll be over 200 dollars for sure.

1524
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:28,040
I'll pay just ten cents.

1525
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,210
I'll pay only ten cents.

1526
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,020
I'll pay just 50 cents.

1527
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,210
- I'll have to spend it anyway.
- You'll pay 9.2 dollars?

1528
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:35,880
That'll be 9.2 dollars.

1529
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,080
She has to pay for everything.

1530
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,750
- This is so cruel.
- You've gone bankrupt.

1531
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,150
- All right.
- She's gone bankrupt?

1532
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,730
(So Min's gone bankrupt.)

1533
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:45,500
Did you hear that? "You've gone bankrupt."

1534
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,460
(Two players have already
gone bankrupt after two rounds.)

1535
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,690
I've gone bankrupt?

1536
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,500
- It exceeded your limit.
- You brat!

1537
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,270
You guys aren't spending so little.

1538
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,310
You should spend a little.

1539
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:56,580
How dare a slave talk back?

1540
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:59,580
- You spend too little.
- So Min's debit card...

1541
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,480
had 80 dollars at first.

1542
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,650
- That's a lot.
- What happened?

1543
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:03,670
Someone still holds
a card that has 200 dollars.

1544
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:05,520
It's not in odd numbers.

1545
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,120
- It's not.
- But it's close to...

1546
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,580
- She had 80 dollars?
- She did.

1547
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,980
She spent 30 dollars earlier.

1548
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,460
And you couldn't spend any just now.

1549
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,330
I'd have been well off if I survived.

1550
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,380
A hundred dollars?

1551
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,230
This complicates things.

1552
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,270
Someone is holding a card
with 200 dollars.

1553
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,100
So Min had quite a lot of money.

1554
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,690
- Yes, 80 dollars is a lot.
- I'd have been well off.

1555
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,770
Now, So Min's become slave number two.

1556
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,710
After she gets changed,

1557
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:28,080
we'll head to the gukbap place
right in front.

1558
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,330
- All right!
- Sounds great!

1559
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:30,600
I really can't tell now.

1560
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,770
So Min, what a bummer.

1561
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,670
- I just lost in one game.
- Goodness.

1562
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,120
- You weren't that bad.
- So Bal.

1563
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:38,350
- My goodness.
- So Bal, you brat.

1564
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,210
- How dare you...
- How dare you...

1565
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:41,960
- put on a hairband to look cute?
- act like a noblewoman?

1566
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,520
(Cute)

1567
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,580
So Bal.

1568
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,290
Do your best when you serve them.

1569
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,130
When we have concepts like this,
it's always these two.

1570
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,900
- Why is it always us two?
- Why does this always happen?

1571
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:50,920
Why do we always get the worst part?

1572
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,020
I could've done well with 80 dollars.

1573
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,770
- It wasn't bad.
- Yes, you could've done well.

1574
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,500
With 80 dollars,
you had a chance of winning.

1575
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,100
You'd have been okay as long as
you weren't in last place.

1576
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,060
Is there anyone?

1577
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,810
You can't say that.

1578
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:03,710
What did you say?

1579
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:04,850
"You can't say that."

1580
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:08,650
Goodness, you should have
a delicious bowl of beef bone soup.

1581
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:11,190
You two should eat outside on the ground.

1582
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,290
Goodness.

1583
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:13,790
On a cold day like this, we should have...

1584
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:16,520
- a warm bowl of gukbap.
- We should have gukbap.

1585
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,630
Their boiled pork slices must be good.

1586
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:21,060
- So Bal, hurry and go sit inside!
- There's brisket...

1587
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,960
- Please take a seat.
- Go sit inside!

1588
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,230
- Please go ahead and take a seat.
- Please hurry up and sit.

1589
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,520
Go sit inside!

1590
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,960
- I...
- I'm going to eat a lot.

1591
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,870
I will go sit through here.

1592
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:30,630
Why would you go under the table?

1593
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:33,060
- Come here, you slaves.
- Okay, my lord.

1594
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,310
Go sit through there.

1595
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:35,580
Go sit inside!

1596
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,400
Let's have boiled pork slices.

1597
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,000
- He'll spend more than 200 here.
- We'll have boiled pork slices.

1598
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
It'll be over 200 dollars for sure.

1599
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,440
There's a bigger serving
of beef bone soup.

1600
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,690
- I'll have a regular one.
- I'll have a regular one.

1601
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,810
I'll have a regular one too.

1602
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,790
One, two, three...

1603
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:49,620
Four regular servings, and...

1604
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,480
- I'll have a bigger serving.
- Raise your hand for bigger ones.

1605
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,100
Sir, there are different options
for a bigger serving.

1606
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,290
I'll take one that costs 25 dollars.

1607
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,460
All right.

1608
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,520
Jong Kook will have one
that costs 25 dollars.

1609
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,690
We'll have four regular servings...

1610
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:02,270
and 2 big servings that cost 25 dollars.

1611
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:04,440
And we'll have two mid-sized
dishes of boiled pork slices.

1612
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,170
Should I order two mid-sized dishes?

1613
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,440
- Yes, we should.
- We should have two.

1614
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,730
And what is seasoned intestines?

1615
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,770
- No, stop. That's enough.
- Let's have it.

1616
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:12,210
- Seok Sam.
- Yes, my lord.

1617
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,710
Get an extra chair.

1618
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,810
Oh, I...

1619
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,310
- It's like seasoned brisket.
- It's...

1620
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:19,710
- What are you doing, So Min?
- Get a chair!

1621
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:23,420
Hey, second batch.
Get the intestines. No, I mean...

1622
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,690
Can you ask them
to remove the intestines in mine?

1623
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:26,730
- You don't want intestines?
- No.

1624
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,000
All right.

1625
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,500
Can you remove the intestines...

1626
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,790
- in one of the regular servings?
- Seok Sam.

1627
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,900
- Yes, my lord.
- Get a chair!

1628
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,170
- Here's your chair.
- There are no intestines...

1629
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,500
in regular servings.

1630
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,560
- Okay.
- Nice.

1631
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,400
Can you make So Bal do the work too?

1632
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,770
So Bal, get us some broth.

1633
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,600
- Can you give us some water?
- Wait.

1634
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,310
It's nice to see the servers
dressed in hanbok here.

1635
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,420
Their food must be good.

1636
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,520
- They suit the place so well.
- They do.

1637
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,460
Oh, it's run by father and daughter?

1638
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,560
Yes, it is.

1639
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,850
- Is she your daughter-in-law?
- A father-daughter gukbap place.

1640
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,690
You're running it...

1641
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,020
- with your daughter-in-law?
- So Min.

1642
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:05,370
So Min, it's so nice
that we're having many customers.

1643
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,230
- Right, Father.
- Right?

1644
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,000
When will my husband return?

1645
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,960
Your husband is missing.

1646
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:14,980
- Their costumes...
- They suit this place so well.

1647
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,500
They suit gukbap so well.

1648
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,830
- Also,
- Hello.

1649
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:19,880
So Min used to be called Gukbap.

1650
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,900
- You're right.
- Right?

1651
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,980
- You're right.
- Because she mixes her rice...

1652
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,920
in her soup.

1653
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,980
The spring onion kimchi looks so good.

1654
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,750
- She's Jeon Gukbap.
- That's right!

1655
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,520
We make our kimchi
with ingredients from Korea only.

1656
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,350
- My gosh, it looks so good.
- It's really good.

1657
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:33,580
- Yes.
- It looks good.

1658
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,730
You get a dish each.

1659
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,230
- The kimchi...
- It looks so good.

1660
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,730
- You get a dish each.
- We get one dish each?

1661
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:40,000
- Yes, you get one each.
- You should move away now.

1662
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,130
It's a mission.

1663
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,630
- What?
- What's that?

1664
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:45,670
- It's a very simple mission.
- What is this?

1665
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,170
- What is it?
- You'll be doing a challenge...

1666
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,040
that's trending
on a short-form video platform.

1667
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,770
It's Blowing Out Candles with Your Mouth.

1668
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,250
- With our mouths?
- There must be many candles.

1669
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:56,650
You'll put on a mouthpiece and
blow out candles for five seconds.

1670
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,670
(They'll blow out candles for
5 seconds with a mouthpiece on.)

1671
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,120
- With a mouthpiece?
- Wouldn't it be too easy?

1672
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:01,020
- You have to blow out like this.
- Is it hard?

1673
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,120
Who will go first?

1674
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,290
- I'll go first.
- All right.

1675
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,130
- Okay, Frog. You should try it.
- Great.

1676
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,130
Would it be hard? How do I put this on?

1677
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,150
- It's...
- You have to put it on well.

1678
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:13,190
It has an upper and down side.
It says up and down on it.

1679
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:15,940
- She'll turn into a zombie.
- That's it.

1680
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,060
She's turned into a zombie.

1681
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,500
Wait. You did put it on, right?

1682
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,330
I did!

1683
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:23,100
We'll give you five seconds
after you start.

1684
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,130
All right.

1685
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:26,000
- Do I just blow them out like this?
- Yes.

1686
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
- Get ready.
- Hold your hair.

1687
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,920
Set, go.

1688
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,980
(Blowing)

1689
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:36,690
(Here comes Jeon Bool Am.)

1690
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,830
(Breathing out with all her heart)

1691
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,960
- Keep going!
- Keep going!

1692
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,150
- Time's up.
- Time's up.

1693
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:44,650
- No!
- You're done.

1694
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:47,100
- Your turn is over.
- No!

1695
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:48,270
(So Bal's challenge ended
after showing off her lung capacity.)

1696
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:49,440
You did it. You did well.

1697
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,400
- She's good.
- Give me one more chance.

1698
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,730
- That was hilarious!
- Her turn is over!

1699
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:55,500
- Give me one more chance.
- Her turn is over!

1700
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,310
- Can you give me another chance?
- Hold on.

1701
00:52:58,310 --> 00:52:59,810
She's good.

1702
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:01,270
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...

1703
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:02,850
- No!
- Hey.

1704
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,080
She didn't blow out any candles
on that side.

1705
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:05,710
- She blew out 40 candles.
- I blew out a lot.

1706
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:06,880
- She blew out 40 candles.
- You blew out a lot.

1707
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,810
- You have to...
- She blew out everything here.

1708
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,750
- All right.
- You have to keep this in mind.

1709
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,350
- It's not easy.
- Okay, we got it.

1710
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:13,420
It's really not easy.

1711
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,920
Okay, got it.

1712
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,560
Ssaebssaeb.

1713
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,750
(Se Chan is next.)

1714
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:22,540
A champion is going next?

1715
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:23,600
(Here comes the champion
of protruding mouth.)

1716
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,690
Get ready.

1717
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:26,830
Set, go.

1718
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,670
That's great.

1719
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,080
- He blew out everything!
- Time's up!

1720
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,770
He blew out every candle!

1721
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,650
That was really fast.

1722
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,440
- I'm so dizzy.
- All right.

1723
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:38,920
All right. Please count them.

1724
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,580
He blew out a lot.

1725
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,790
There are 15 candles remaining.

1726
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,310
- He blew out 135 candles.
- All right!

1727
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:44,380
(Se Chan blew out 135 candles
just within 5 seconds.)

1728
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:45,750
No matter how much I think

1729
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,020
It's Ji Hyo.

1730
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:48,850
She looks pretty with it.

1731
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:51,130
Ji Hyo, what made you so upset?

1732
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:52,770
Why are you so upset?

1733
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,630
- Make sure to blow them out well.
- Get ready.

1734
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:55,670
- Use all your strength.
- Do a good job.

1735
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:56,690
Let's go.

1736
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,230
Set, go.

1737
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:01,940
She's good.

1738
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,400
- She's pretty good.
- Time's up. Stop.

1739
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,400
Hey, So Min...

1740
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,580
- She did so well.
- So Min is in last place for sure.

1741
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,000
We'll be good as long as
we do better than So Min, right?

1742
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,080
Of course.

1743
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,880
Jae Suk, it's hot. You should be careful.

1744
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,120
- It's hot.
- Ji Hyo blew out 119 candles.

1745
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,750
I think Jong Kook will blow out
all the candles.

1746
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,210
With that on,

1747
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:15,960
- I think he'll be good.
- he looks angry.

1748
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,080
Get ready.

1749
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,850
- He looks really mad.
- Isn't that how he usually looks?

1750
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:20,790
- Just blow them out at once.
- Set, go!

1751
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:21,830
Use your lungs.

1752
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:23,560
Breathe out with your chest.

1753
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:25,460
He's blowing all of them out.

1754
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:27,730
He's blowing all of them out.

1755
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:30,100
(He put out every candle
only after seven breaths.)

1756
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:32,560
(An exhaling firefighter showed off
exceptional lung capacity.)

1757
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,540
I can't believe he blew all of them out.

1758
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,210
- I hate him.
- It'll be on international news.

1759
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,440
I just hate him.

1760
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,770
- That was incredible.
- He's the worst.

1761
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,250
Let's enjoy our meal.

1762
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,420
The staff worked so hard...

1763
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,580
- to prepare this.
- How did he blow all of them out?

1764
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,940
(Regardless of the results,
he secured first place.)

1765
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,080
- I'm done, right?
- Yes.

1766
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:48,690
(The original champion
of protruding mouth goes next.)

1767
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:49,790
- Time's up.
- Time's up.

1768
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:50,920
Wait, that was...

1769
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,060
- Wasn't that too fast?
- No, time is up.

1770
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,330
- What is he doing?
- Time's up.

1771
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,650
What was that?

1772
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:00,290
Hold on. One, two, three, four...

1773
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:01,600
- Well...
- Did you count the ones I blew out?

1774
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:02,770
He blew out about 70 candles.

1775
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,790
- Wait.
- What do you mean?

1776
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:06,630
- He was counting...
- Why did you count half-heartedly?

1777
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:07,830
- He just said a random number.
- Let's move on.

1778
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:08,940
He said, "About 70 candles."

1779
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,670
Why did you count half-heartedly?

1780
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:14,040
You should open your mouth wide.
It's better that way.

1781
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,540
But I think it works better if...

1782
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,850
It's the last member.

1783
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:19,940
You'd think you'd be able to
blow out better that way.

1784
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,020
Haha, you should breathe in first.

1785
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:24,290
Set, go.

1786
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,730
(Throwing up)

1787
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,830
(An unexpected waterfall)

1788
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,790
- Time's up.
- What was that?

1789
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,560
- I mean...
- He just threw up! Darn it.

1790
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,060
- He lost!
- Come on!

1791
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,370
- No.
- That was disgusting.

1792
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:43,310
- Please give me another chance.
- He lost.

1793
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,480
- He lost!
- What was that?

1794
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,170
It was so gross.

1795
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,040
- He spat out so much.
- He lost.

1796
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,040
All right!

1797
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,350
He blew out three candles.

1798
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,120
- He lost.
- Only three candles.

1799
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,420
You're not in last place anymore.

1800
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,080
I'm so relieved.

1801
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:56,690
He blew out 11 candles.

1802
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:57,690
When I play a game like this...

1803
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:59,790
It was so gross. What was that about?

1804
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,100
All right, now. I'll announce the result.

1805
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,400
This won't do.

1806
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:06,420
- How did he...
- No!

1807
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,060
Using a technique didn't work.

1808
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,290
Jong Kook is in first place.

1809
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:12,560
- Se Chan is in second place.
- All right.

1810
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,100
Ji Hyo is in 3rd place,
Jae Suk is in 4th place.

1811
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,730
Suk Jin is in fifth place.

1812
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:18,130
- So Min is in sixth place.
- This is great.

1813
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:20,350
- And Haha is in seventh place.
- How did I lose in this?

1814
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:21,440
- I'm glad.
- You spat out a lot.

1815
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,750
For your information,
the total price is 195 dollars.

1816
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,580
- It's 195 dollars? That's a lot.
- It's 195 dollars.

1817
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:28,150
- It's 195 dollars?
- Yes.

1818
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,520
Gosh, we should spend
some money from this round.

1819
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,690
- Right.
- If we don't spend any...

1820
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:34,560
I'm going to spend about 20 dollars
this time. I mean it.

1821
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,460
It looks so good. Thank you for the food.

1822
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,130
- Let's add sliced green onion.
- It's so soft.

1823
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,190
It'll be so good if you add kimchi in it.

1824
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:42,690
It's really good.

1825
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,000
Their kimchi is so good.

1826
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:45,560
This is delicious.

1827
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,630
(Se Chan is eating
without saying anything.)

1828
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:48,310
I really want to bring my mother here.

1829
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:50,400
There's so much meat in it.

1830
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,540
- They'll spend some this time.
- Right.

1831
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,880
They'll spend some money.
They'll spend about 20 to 30 dollars.

1832
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:56,620
I'm going to spend some too.

1833
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:59,420
- You sure you won't go bankrupt?
- You could spend about 30 dollars.

1834
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,250
- It's time to pay.
- All right.

1835
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,020
It's 195 dollars.

1836
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:06,130
Let's start with Jong Kook.

1837
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:08,600
- All right. I'll pay.
- You must spend a little.

1838
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,290
- I have an amount in mind.
- How much should we spend?

1839
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,830
You know what the problem is?

1840
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:15,440
You might not be able to spend
the money even if you wanted to.

1841
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:18,130
Gosh, I hope what I have in mind is right.
All right.

1842
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:20,560
(Accumulated amount he used: 20 cents)

1843
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,710
I'll pay 20 dollars.

1844
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,080
- Twenty dollars?
- Yes.

1845
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,230
(He bravely pays 20 dollars.)

1846
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:27,210
Will it work? It's 20 dollars.

1847
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:30,920
(Suk Jin's card had 10 dollars.)

1848
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,420
(So Min's card had 80 dollars.)

1849
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:37,520
(Jong Kook was racking his brain.)

1850
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:41,830
(He expects his card to have
an amount between 10 and 80 dollars.)

1851
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,900
Should I spend more than I should?

1852
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,020
- But Ji Yeon's card...
- Jae Suk.

1853
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,690
There can't be only 20 dollars
in mine, right?

1854
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:48,690
- It's because...
- It could be worse.

1855
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,600
I should try spending a lot here.

1856
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
It's going to get really complicated
from now.

1857
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:54,960
Hold on.

1858
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,810
Did it work?

1859
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,130
(He manages to make the payment.)

1860
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,540
- Do you want the receipt?
- Yes.

1861
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,940
- Here.
- Thank you.

1862
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,810
Thank you.

1863
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,250
He must've spent 30 dollars.

1864
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,790
- You must've spent 30 dollars.
- Did you?

1865
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:08,790
It did work.

1866
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:11,620
(It's time for Se Chan,
who only spent 20 cents, to pay.)

1867
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,980
I'll pay...

1868
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:20,370
I'll pay 45 dollars.

1869
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:21,520
(I'll pay 45 dollars.)

1870
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:25,330
(He boldly tries to pay 45 dollars.)

1871
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:28,310
(It'll work only if his card
has more than 50 dollars.)

1872
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,440
Does it work?

1873
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,810
(It'll work only if his card
has more than 50 dollars.)

1874
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:32,850
(He manages to make the payment.)

1875
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:34,210
Thank you.

1876
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,650
(Accumulated amount he used: 45.2 dollars)

1877
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:38,310
Guys, it's so nerve-racking now.

1878
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:39,540
- Right?
- Yes.

1879
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:40,580
Because we're spending some money now.

1880
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:41,790
I paid a lot.

1881
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,150
- Really?
- I paid a lot.

1882
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:44,520
- They'll tell you at the end.
- No.

1883
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,790
I didn't know it had that much.

1884
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:48,380
I'll pay 20 dollars.

1885
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,560
(Accumulated amount she used: 60 cents)

1886
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,920
Wait.

1887
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,500
I can just punch in the numbers now.

1888
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,520
I'll pay only ten dollars.

1889
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,040
Sure.

1890
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,270
(She pays only ten dollars to be safe.)

1891
00:58:58,270 --> 00:58:59,310
(Accumulated amount
she used: 10.6 dollars)

1892
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:01,330
All right, Ji Hyo.

1893
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,380
(Accumulated amount
she used: 10.6 dollars)

1894
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,080
How much should I spend?

1895
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:05,940
How much more do we have to pay?

1896
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,380
(Total cost: 120 dollars)

1897
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,380
(Accumulated amount he used: 20 cents)

1898
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,810
- Are you going next? Or me?
- Jae Suk.

1899
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,310
I'm sure your card
has more than 50 dollars.

1900
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:14,310
Am I going next?

1901
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,460
You won't have a chance
to spend the money on your card.

1902
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:19,830
It's our last course.
This is your last chance.

1903
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:22,230
- We have just one more course?
- Yes.

1904
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,100
Then...

1905
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,460
(How much will Jae Suk pay?)

1906
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,330
Try spending about 48 dollars.

1907
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,330
- Should I?
- Yes.

1908
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:29,540
There could be 50 dollars in your card.

1909
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,330
But what if there's 200 dollars
because I'm unlucky?

1910
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:32,830
With 50 dollars... That could be the case.

1911
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,380
(Accumulated amount he used: 20 cents)

1912
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,210
I'll pay 55 dollars.

1913
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:51,930
(Jae Suk tried paying 55 dollars.)

1914
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,760
Did it work?

1915
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:55,760
(Is there more than 60 dollars
in Jae Suk's card?)

1916
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,800
Did it go through?

1917
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,030
(It did go through!)

1918
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:00,070
(Accumulated amount he used: 55.2 dollars)

1919
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:01,140
Thank you.

1920
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:05,430
(He's paid the most so far.)

1921
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,240
Jae Suk's card went through.

1922
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,700
We have no idea though.
How much did you pay?

1923
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,570
- Wait. He's...
- He's paid quite a lot.

1924
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:12,680
- No, he... Where's the receipt?
- Did it go through?

1925
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:13,970
I'll go and check...

1926
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,910
- and tell you how much is left.
- Jae Suk, your card went through?

1927
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:17,410
He must've gone bankrupt. Oh, really?

1928
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,510
- It went through?
- He said he'd pay quite a lot.

1929
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:21,450
Jae Suk, right now...

1930
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:22,820
(His head is spinning
as he might have 200 dollars.)

1931
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,530
- This is...
- You have 200 dollars.

1932
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,160
- You must have 200 dollars.
- Jae Suk, I also think...

1933
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,260
How much more do we have to pay?

1934
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:29,430
It went through very smoothly.

1935
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:32,390
This is the balance?
We have only this much left?

1936
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:33,890
You guys spent a lot.

1937
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:35,860
We have only this much left?

1938
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:38,030
Suk Jin, pay at least ten cents.

1939
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:41,010
Suk Jin, you shouldn't let
Haha spend his money.

1940
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,200
You shouldn't make him use his money.

1941
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,800
That could be a good strategy.

1942
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,880
No, he could have 20 dollars.

1943
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,570
No, we should spend as much as we can.

1944
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,780
No.

1945
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,110
He just doesn't want to use his money.

1946
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:51,180
(He just doesn't want to use his money.)

1947
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,910
Suk Jin uses a debit card.

1948
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:57,320
- He uses a debit card?
- Yes.

1949
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:59,590
His wife gives him 100 dollars a week.

1950
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,590
And he uses a charge card
for his transportation.

1951
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,890
Wasn't he born in 1966?

1952
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,990
He was born in 1966,
but he uses only 100 dollars a week?

1953
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,570
- He can ride the subway for free.
- You guys are such liars.

1954
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:09,200
He can ride the subway for free?

1955
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,240
(Seok Sam is playing a slave
when he's a senior member.)

1956
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,510
- He can ride the subway for free?
- Everything is free for him.

1957
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:14,880
If it's all free,
then 100 dollars is a lot.

1958
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,070
- Of course.
- I do have to pay for subway.

1959
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,070
- I have to pay to ride the subway.
- How much more do we have to pay?

1960
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:19,340
Isn't it free for you to use bathhouses?

1961
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,610
- No, it's not.
- A couple of times a month.

1962
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,110
- So Min. Leave ten cents.
- I...

1963
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:24,890
I paid five dollars.

1964
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,110
How much more do we have to pay?

1965
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:29,010
(The remaining amount is 60 dollars.)

1966
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,180
(So Min pays with her own money.)

1967
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,860
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1968
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,860
(So Min pays with her own money.)

1969
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:38,800
(It's finally Haha's turn.)

1970
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:42,800
I'll be paying the rest.
How much is there?

1971
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,840
- Nothing.
- There's nothing left?

1972
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,240
- It's over.
- Is this allowed?

1973
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,510
I paid for it all.

1974
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:50,070
- Why did you...
- Is this allowed?

1975
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:51,200
(So Min stripped Haha
of his chance to pay.)

1976
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,510
Yes, it's allowed!
So Min paid with her own money.

1977
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,320
- I paid the rest.
- So Min...

1978
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,910
- She's indeed amazing.
- So Min did it again.

1979
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:58,010
How much did you spend?

1980
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:59,720
- She spent 60 dollars.
- I paid the rest.

1981
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,610
Why did you do that?
Why did you rob me of a chance?

1982
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:04,090
Why? I treated you to a meal.

1983
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,450
- You must be glad.
- The slaves...

1984
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:06,780
are making it hard to predict.

1985
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:08,660
- Maybe it's better this way.
- I can't be too sure.

1986
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:09,700
Not making him use his money
could be a strategy.

1987
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,070
I happily treated you all to a meal.

1988
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:14,990
So that's that.
Let's move to the next course.

1989
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:16,590
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1990
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:18,410
I think this is all based on luck.

1991
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:20,070
It's based on luck.

1992
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:23,610
Everyone. This is the last course.

1993
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:26,570
We prepared a mission
for your facial health.

1994
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:28,240
Facial health? It must have
something to do with our faces.

1995
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,090
If you think some of your members...

1996
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:35,450
need to fix their faces,
pick two members...

1997
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:37,050
and text their names to me.

1998
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:38,930
Gosh. But this is...

1999
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:40,050
- I...
- I...

2000
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:43,050
Don't do it. Please don't do it.

2001
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,660
You guys know that
there is no point in picking me, right?

2002
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,570
Simply put, we need to pick
a member with a messed-up face.

2003
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:49,090
- We need to send a text to Bo Pil?
- This is so...

2004
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:50,930
- I sent it already.
- You want a text or a message?

2005
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:52,910
- It doesn't matter.
- It was really easy to pick.

2006
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:54,700
Me too. It reminded me of two members.

2007
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:55,800
Me too.

2008
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,880
Don't consider our jaw area.

2009
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,970
- I'm done.
- I sent the text.

2010
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,720
I'm not going to vote.

2011
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,010
"I'm not going to vote?"

2012
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:05,510
Jae Suk, just write your name.

2013
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:07,720
It's you, Jae Suk.

2014
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,320
Gosh.

2015
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,320
All right. We're set.

2016
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,320
We're set?

2017
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,890
- You easily picked the two members.
- Yes.

2018
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:16,260
- It's so annoying.
- It's Jae Suk and Se Chan.

2019
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,320
(Jae Suk and Se Chan)

2020
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,200
- I didn't even think twice.
- Why did you pick...

2021
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,590
- Protruded Brothers?
- Come on.

2022
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:21,930
It's so annoying.

2023
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:23,930
Can you push
their protruding mouths back in?

2024
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:26,200
- Jae Suk, did you write my name?
- Yes.

2025
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,430
I wrote yours too.

2026
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:28,570
(Yangsebari, Jeonsobari)

2027
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:29,970
- I wrote your name too.
- It's hilarious.

2028
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:31,550
It's always those two.

2029
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:34,200
- How upsetting.
- This alley...

2030
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,820
It's the alley I often come to.

2031
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:37,110
It's Apgujeong.

2032
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:39,720
Maybe it's that one.

2033
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,110
- Which one?
- Loco.

2034
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,160
This one.

2035
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,720
- What do you mean by Loco?
- It's Loco.

2036
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,130
He said he was going to
serve in the military.

2037
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,390
- He got discharged already, right?
- Loco is cute.

2038
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:50,160
- Is he younger than you?
- He is.

2039
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,760
Loco is very diligent.

2040
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,990
He's really nice too.

2041
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:55,390
- Right.
- Loco is really nice.

2042
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:57,090
It's rare to see a guy like him.

2043
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:58,660
I want to try living like Loco.

2044
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:00,200
- How?
- He is cute.

2045
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:01,430
- Seokco.
- He is cool.

2046
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:02,910
He is a hip-hop musician.

2047
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:05,880
Being a hip-hop musician is good
only if you are successful.

2048
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,340
Why do you think he won't be successful?

2049
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:10,820
When people get started with something,

2050
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:14,050
I don't tell them to become
as successful as they can be.

2051
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,410
I recommend...

2052
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:18,260
that they make a satisfactory living
without reaching the top.

2053
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,450
- Suk Jin, right?
- Yes.

2054
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,390
- His life is tranquil.
- His life is tranquil.

2055
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,630
- His life is tranquil.
- It's quite comfortable...

2056
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:23,950
to live like me.

2057
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:25,530
You might not know this,

2058
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,470
- but he is working toward the top.
- That's not true.

2059
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,200
- Is he working toward the top?
- Suk Jin is greedy.

2060
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,700
- Suk Jin is greedy.
- No, I am not.

2061
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:32,360
- Seriously.
- He is ambitious.

2062
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,660
I didn't think he was greedy.

2063
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,300
But I realized that I was wrong
at the Entertainment Awards.

2064
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,410
- I realized that he was greedy.
- He is greedy.

2065
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,740
I let go of my greed a long time ago.

2066
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,740
It's the situation
that makes people greedy.

2067
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,910
- I agree.
- I let go of my greed.

2068
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:43,950
I had it when I was young.

2069
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:45,340
- It's because he can see the top.
- That's right.

2070
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,240
- That's why he is greedy.
- Think about it.

2071
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,990
- That's not true.
- You are so close to the top.

2072
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:50,050
That's not true.

2073
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:51,550
The Grand Award goes to...

2074
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:53,550
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Ji Suk Jin.

2075
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,200
I never thought
a day like this would come.

2076
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:57,430
That came out automatically.

2077
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:59,160
- You should start crying.
- You shouldn't think...

2078
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:00,970
that you know all about life.

2079
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:02,700
Once you hit the age of 50,
you will know what happiness is.

2080
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:03,700
- Why?
- Really?

2081
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:04,930
- You were over 50 then.
- Back then,

2082
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:06,530
- weren't you in your 50s?
- You haven't reached that stage.

2083
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:08,930
- I feel so bad for you.
- Why?

2084
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:10,430
It's stressful to be at the top.

2085
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:11,880
- I am very happy.
- He is happy.

2086
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,380
Suk Jin, have you been at the top?

2087
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,780
Seriously. Have you been at the top?

2088
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,280
I haven't, so I could be wrong.

2089
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,390
- He is crying.
- It's the life you don't know,

2090
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:21,090
so you shouldn't talk about it
so callously.

2091
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:22,550
- That's right.
- It's the life you don't know.

2092
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:25,320
He puts in a lot of energy
to stay at the top.

2093
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,550
- It might give him happiness.
- That's right.

2094
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:29,930
- You don't know what it's like.
- Of course not.

2095
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:31,130
I don't know, okay?

2096
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,300
He is happy.

2097
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,530
I don't know, okay?
The thing about happiness is...

2098
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,340
Suk Jin, you are getting beaten up.

2099
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,200
- Am I getting beaten up?
- Yes.

2100
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,260
That's not what I think.

2101
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,380
I think we are having a proper discussion.

2102
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:43,780
- You are bleeding.
- Is this a discussion?

2103
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:44,970
You are bleeding.

2104
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:46,780
- In any case...
- You think...

2105
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,340
- people at the top...
- Look at him.

2106
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,340
He keeps trying to wrap things up.

2107
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:51,610
- "In any case..."
- So...

2108
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:53,320
- listen to me.
- People at the top...

2109
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,450
Hey!

2110
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,610
Listen to me!

2111
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:57,660
(He ends up shouting.)

2112
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,090
- In any case...
- We have arrived.

2113
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:00,390
- All right.
- Okay.

2114
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:02,050
- Hey!
- One, two, three.

2115
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,390
Okay.

2116
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:05,200
In any case, I had fun.

2117
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,720
(Seok Sam is a good man
who puts up with the younger ones.)

2118
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,800
Suk Jin.

2119
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,180
- A moment ago,
- Okay.

2120
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:17,910
you had a poll to pick the two members...

2121
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,800
- who need facial correction.
- They really need it.

2122
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:23,970
Thus, Jae Suk and Se Chan
will receive a facial massage.

2123
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:25,140
- Of course.
- Everyone voted for them.

2124
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:26,590
- But...
- They have many problems.

2125
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,410
for entertainment,

2126
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:29,780
they will receive the massage...

2127
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:31,860
and give it to another member each.

2128
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:33,220
- What?
- Okay.

2129
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,260
You can pick from the remaining members.

2130
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:35,800
- We can deliver what we've felt.
- That's right.

2131
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:38,030
- I don't need it.
- Why did we vote for them?

2132
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:39,890
- That's good.
- We picked the two vindictive ones.

2133
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:41,360
You know, our bodies are aching too.

2134
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,260
Why do you need to give us
a facial massage?

2135
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:44,840
You need a facial massage too.

2136
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,260
I guess our faces look that bad.

2137
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,640
- For goodness' sake.
- Stick your mouth back inside.

2138
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,840
- Jae Suk, why don't you go first?
- Me?

2139
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,680
- It's the order of ugliness.
- Stick your mouth back inside.

2140
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,070
I don't need it.

2141
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:54,970
- I don't need a facial massage.
- Why do you think that?

2142
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:56,680
- You need it.
- It should be your priority.

2143
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,990
How will it go?

2144
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:59,280
Gosh!

2145
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:01,110
Gosh!

2146
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:04,390
He looks so ugly.

2147
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:05,450
So that's how it goes.

2148
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:07,130
- To become handsome...
- It hurts.

2149
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:08,760
- To become handsome, endure it.
- Stay still.

2150
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,630
- Endure it for beauty.
- You should endure it.

2151
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:11,760
That's right.

2152
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,220
- Isn't it too forceful?
- Does it hurt that badly?

2153
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,260
(Screaming)

2154
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:16,360
He isn't faking it.

2155
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,140
- He isn't faking it.
- Stay still.

2156
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,300
You look so ugly.

2157
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,640
I am sorry, but can I take a photo?

2158
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:22,880
Stop it!

2159
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,800
(It's an entertaining sight.)

2160
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:26,840
These photos are so bad.

2161
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:29,220
- Seriously.
- Stop.

2162
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,840
They look like
they got processed with an app.

2163
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:33,890
His face became puffy.

2164
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:34,910
- Seriously.
- Hey.

2165
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:37,610
- Your face became puffy.
- You became handsome.

2166
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:39,590
- Your skin is firm now.
- You became handsome.

2167
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:40,990
- Let me see your face.
- Your wrinkles are gone.

2168
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:44,050
- Hey.
- Your face looks fatter.

2169
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:45,970
- It's as if you got stung by a bee.
- You look handsome.

2170
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:47,200
Jae Suk, you look handsome.

2171
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:49,260
Gosh, it hurts.

2172
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:51,070
(Then comes Se Chan
with his extraordinary jaws.)

2173
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,660
Why do his jaws look like that?

2174
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,780
(His oral structure is unique.)

2175
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,200
- It hurts.
- Look at that.

2176
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,640
Why do his jaws look like that?

2177
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:00,280
- It hurts.
- Really?

2178
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:01,570
Here.

2179
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:03,610
(So Min's camera)

2180
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,950
(Focusing)

2181
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:07,220
You should try it.

2182
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:09,950
Look at that.

2183
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:11,360
That's your boyfriend.

2184
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,780
So Min.

2185
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:14,050
That's your boyfriend.

2186
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:15,450
You are filming him with passion.

2187
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:16,950
Why is the camera so close to me?

2188
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:18,030
(Reporter Jeon found an exclusive item.)

2189
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:19,260
It hurts so much. I am in tears.

2190
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:20,800
- So Min. That's your boyfriend.
- It's his belly.

2191
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,030
(She gets a celebrity's belly on camera.)

2192
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:23,240
It's his belly.

2193
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,430
(The Pouty Mouth Brothers' show
ends in success.)

2194
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:26,660
You are becoming handsome.

2195
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:29,470
Please pick a member each.

2196
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:31,200
- I pick Suk Jin.
- Seok... Can we pick the same one?

2197
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,510
- One person is enough.
- You should pick someone else.

2198
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:34,050
- We can't pick the same one.
- In that case,

2199
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,380
I pick So Min.

2200
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:36,680
Why?

2201
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,390
- Why would you pick me?
- It's going to be funny.

2202
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,980
- Why would you pick me?
- I pick So Min.

2203
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:43,090
- I don't need a facial massage.
- Let me sanitize my hands first.

2204
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:44,310
I need to sanitize my hands too.

2205
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:45,890
I don't need it.

2206
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:47,820
Seriously.

2207
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:50,600
Why did he suddenly pick me?

2208
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,660
I sanitized my hands.

2209
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,190
- Don't lie down like that.
- Okay.

2210
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:54,430
Let's put your hair here.

2211
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:55,970
- I see.
- That's the basic step.

2212
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:57,360
- You know well.
- Yes.

2213
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:59,400
- I will see what your face is like.
- Okay.

2214
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,770
That wasn't an exaggerated reaction.

2215
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:02,680
Your face is asymmetrical.

2216
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:04,340
Do you chew with your left side?

2217
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,850
This side is bigger.

2218
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,380
- Which side?
- This side.

2219
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,810
(Twitching)

2220
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,380
This side is bigger.

2221
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,890
- Which side?
- This side.

2222
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:13,050
(Giggling)

2223
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:14,550
The two sides are different.

2224
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:16,980
I am not massaging hard.

2225
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:18,230
It hurts.

2226
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:19,760
- It's about to hurt.
- He isn't massaging hard.

2227
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,520
- I am not massaging hard.
- No, he isn't.

2228
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,320
- The right side hurts.
- I knew it.

2229
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,400
Let's film her face.

2230
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,930
Here comes the double chin.

2231
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:28,970
It's this side.

2232
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,660
Press hard.

2233
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:32,060
Press hard.

2234
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:35,030
Press hard.

2235
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:40,400
(It looks like she is crying.)

2236
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,440
- Gyata.
- Smile.

2237
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,020
- Smile.
- Isn't that Gyata?

2238
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:44,520
- That's good.
- Gyata.

2239
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,720
Gyata from
"Demetan Croaker, The Boy Frog."

2240
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,650
Keep going.

2241
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:50,110
- Isn't that Gyata?
- Close your mouth.

2242
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:51,820
- You look pretty.
- Do I look okay?

2243
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,730
- You look great.
- She looks like a duck.

2244
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:56,560
- Isn't that Gyata?
- No.

2245
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,730
- It hurts there.
- That's why you need a massage.

2246
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:00,320
- It feels good.
- It feels good, right?

2247
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,490
It feels good, right?

2248
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:03,990
- Let's see Gyata.
- Let's see Gyata.

2249
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:05,660
- Gyata.
- Gyata.

2250
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,840
- All right.
- Okay.

2251
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:08,730
- All right.
- Okay.

2252
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,230
It feels good.

2253
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:11,680
(Croak)

2254
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:13,440
- It feels good, right?
- It feels good.

2255
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,350
Shouldn't a massage lift up the skin?

2256
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,480
- Why are you pulling it down?
- Stop it.

2257
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,610
When she wakes up...

2258
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:22,810
- Stop it.
- I will make a smiley face.

2259
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:25,260
- A smiley face.
- I will make a smiley face.

2260
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,350
When she wakes up...

2261
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,690
Her face...

2262
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:31,190
Her skin stretches well.
It's as if her skin is rubber.

2263
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:33,600
Seriously. Why is her skin so thin?

2264
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,840
Her skin is thin.

2265
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,140
- It feels good.
- It feels good, right?

2266
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,270
- All right.
- Pull my head upward.

2267
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:39,510
- Upward?
- Stretch my neck. Yes.

2268
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,660
Yes.

2269
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:42,700
- It's refreshing. Don't pull them.
- I will pull your feet too.

2270
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:43,940
- Don't pull them.
- One, two, three.

2271
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:45,900
One, two, three.

2272
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:47,940
I am sorry,
but isn't this an execution method?

2273
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,220
Seriously.

2274
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:50,440
Isn't this an execution method?

2275
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:52,520
- Learn how to do it first.
- Okay.

2276
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,240
- He knows what to do.
- That's not how you do it.

2277
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:56,310
I am revving up.

2278
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:57,810
- Mr. Yang.
- Yes?

2279
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:59,520
What's wrong with his face?

2280
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,230
- If you look at his nose,
- Okay.

2281
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:03,520
- it's too big.
- Massage the inside of his nose.

2282
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,470
His nostrils are sized differently.

2283
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:08,130
They will come last.
They will be the finale.

2284
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:10,060
They will come last.

2285
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:13,030
I think he breathes more
with his right nostril.

2286
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:14,030
I know.

2287
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,480
It hurts.

2288
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:17,840
Here.

2289
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:19,600
Would you hold his legs?

2290
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,940
- Sir.
- Stay still.

2291
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:23,180
- What are you doing?
- Don't do that.

2292
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,550
He can't take it.

2293
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:25,890
(Slapping)

2294
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,760
(He slaps Se Chan
because he can't stand the pain.)

2295
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:30,220
What was that?

2296
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:32,590
It hurt so much.

2297
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:33,780
What was that?

2298
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:34,950
I will do it lightly this time.

2299
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:38,230
Now, we need to decide on
the order of payment.

2300
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:40,100
(It's time to decide on
the last order of payment.)

2301
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,430
(They have a match of withstanding pain.)

2302
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:42,770
- Ouch.
- She is done.

2303
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:46,140
Done.

2304
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,200
(Most of them get eliminated in 1 second.)

2305
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:49,900
Thus,

2306
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,680
Jong Kook will go 1st place.
So Min will go 2nd place.

2307
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,440
Haha will go 3rd place.
Se Chan will go 4th place.

2308
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,310
Suk Jin will go 5th place.
Ji Hyo will go 6th place.

2309
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:58,740
- And Jae Suk will go seventh.
- I am the last one.

2310
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:01,980
It cost 400 dollars to rent this place.

2311
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,720
- Why is it so expensive?
- It cost 400 dollars.

2312
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,390
- Did you say 400 dollars?
- Yes.

2313
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,780
- It's so expensive.
- The last one will pay the rest.

2314
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:09,730
It's so expensive. It's 400 dollars.

2315
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:11,300
So Min planned...

2316
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:12,860
to keep everyone from paying...

2317
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,990
- by paying the total.
- That's right.

2318
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:16,400
- The total is 400 dollars.
- I can't pay 400 dollars.

2319
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,140
- No, you can't.
- It's too expensive.

2320
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:19,440
- It can't be helped.
- I will give it a go.

2321
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,810
I should pay a big sum.

2322
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:22,980
- I should spend 100 dollars.
- We should spend money.

2323
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:25,380
- I will spend money this time.
- It's time to do that.

2324
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:27,070
Okay.

2325
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:28,310
Jong Kook will go first.

2326
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:29,980
(They need to guess their balance
and use it as much as possible.)

2327
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:32,110
- I don't have a clue.
- Jae Suk, think about it.

2328
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,520
I will give you a hint.

2329
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,760
There are three members who have...

2330
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,220
over 100 dollars.

2331
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:38,930
- Three?
- Three.

2332
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:40,780
As for the 2 members
who have less than 100 dollars,

2333
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:42,730
their balances are
between 10 and 80 dollars.

2334
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:45,230
- Between 10 and 80 dollars?
- That's right.

2335
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:47,190
- There are two such members.
- How much do I have left?

2336
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:48,900
Then there are 3 members
who have over 100 dollars.

2337
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:52,010
(2 people: Between 10 and 80 dollars
3 people: Over 100 dollars)

2338
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:54,100
You need to figure out
if you have over 100 dollars...

2339
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:59,440
- or less than 80 dollars.
- Okay.

2340
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,150
Did I have 30 or 50 dollars?

2341
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,850
There are two such members.

2342
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,410
I think I had 30 or 50 dollars.

2343
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,890
Really?

2344
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:09,850
(Jong Kook thinks
he had 30 or 50 dollars.)

2345
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,890
I used 20.2 dollars, right?

2346
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:13,230
(Total amount used: 20.2 dollars)

2347
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:14,430
I used 20.2 dollars.

2348
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:15,950
It's my head.

2349
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:17,820
Let's say I had 30 dollars.

2350
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,600
Okay. Let's say I had 30 dollars.

2351
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,300
(He guesses his original balance
to be 30 dollars.)

2352
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:27,840
I will pay 9.7 dollars.

2353
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:32,200
(It's his plan to leave behind 10 cents.)

2354
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,770
(He succeeds in making the payment!)

2355
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:37,270
All right. Thank you.

2356
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:39,740
- Go, So Min.
- So Bal, it's your turn.

2357
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,150
- Jong Kook, you made the payment.
- Yes.

2358
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:42,220
So Min.

2359
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:44,480
She wanted to pay the total.

2360
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:46,820
What's the remaining amount?

2361
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:49,400
- It's 390.3 dollars.
- What?

2362
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,350
- It's 390.3 dollars.
- It's about 390 dollars.

2363
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,300
They won't give you back the money.

2364
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,440
No, we won't.

2365
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,660
Then she wouldn't pay the total.

2366
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:58,510
Don't give it back.
It won't be fun otherwise.

2367
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:01,100
- They won't give it back.
- So Min won't use a lot of money.

2368
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:02,380
It would be a waste.

2369
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:05,050
- Spend just a little bit.
- Other people need to pay too.

2370
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,940
I can use this much money for you guys.

2371
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,720
- Don't do that.
- She will use ten cents.

2372
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,810
- Will you pay the total?
- So Min, it doesn't matter.

2373
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,480
She will use ten cents.

2374
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:18,060
(What will be So Min's choice?)

2375
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:21,480
In that case, I will pay 300 dollars.

2376
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:25,930
(She pays 300 dollars.)

2377
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,300
I will get the penalty.

2378
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,140
(She uses her own money
to make more people suffer.)

2379
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:34,310
Thank you.

2380
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:37,100
Regardless of the result,

2381
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,100
- I expressed my love.
- Okay.

2382
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,180
I expressed my love.

2383
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:42,220
Did you spend a lot of money?

2384
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:43,720
That's bad.

2385
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:46,980
How much did I start with?
Did I have 200 dollars?

2386
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:51,760
Jae Suk and I might have started
with 200 dollars.

2387
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,020
Did you say 20.2 dollars?

2388
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,260
- Yes.
- The two of us.

2389
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:57,150
We nearly spent 50 dollars.

2390
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:58,190
(How much did Haha's card
originally have?)

2391
01:14:58,190 --> 01:14:59,470
What's the remaining amount?

2392
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:01,320
What's wrong with you?

2393
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,360
- It's 90.3 dollars.
- What?

2394
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,560
(The remaining amount is 90.3 dollars.)

2395
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:09,070
(Total amount used: 18.2 dollars)

2396
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:10,600
(How much money
did the team producer's card have?)

2397
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,380
(Total amount used: 18.2 dollars)

2398
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,050
He is a coward,
so he won't use a lot of money.

2399
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:17,180
- I am
- Hey, coward.

2400
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,110
A coward

2401
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:22,590
- He won't spend a lot.
- No.

2402
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:23,690
He won't spend a lot.

2403
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:24,780
I will pay 90.2 dollars.

2404
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:25,890
- Did you say 90.2 dollars?
- Yes.

2405
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:29,990
(It's his plan to use over 100 dollars.)

2406
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:32,060
(Haha takes a risk.)

2407
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,100
Okay.

2408
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:38,100
(If he had less than 100 dollars,
he will go bankrupt.)

2409
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,530
(The payment went through!)

2410
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:47,180
(Total amount used: 108.4 dollars)

2411
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:49,350
Thank you.
How did this payment go through?

2412
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:50,550
(Total amount used: 108.4 dollars)

2413
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:53,050
How much did I originally have?

2414
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:54,220
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

2415
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:55,450
It's still not my turn yet.

2416
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:56,650
(Haha is worried about the balance.)

2417
01:15:56,650 --> 01:16:00,230
(It's Se Chan's turn
before Jae Suk and Ji Hyo.)

2418
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:02,100
I wonder how much remains.

2419
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,100
What's the remaining amount?

2420
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:04,600
It's ten cents.

2421
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,770
- What?
- It's ten cents.

2422
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:07,690
(The remaining amount is only 10 cents.)

2423
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:10,860
I don't know who is responsible,
but this is insane. Are you serious?

2424
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:12,900
What's the remaining amount?

2425
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,010
(Everyone found out
about the tiny amount.)

2426
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:16,230
Is the remaining amount ten cents?

2427
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:17,880
- Jae Suk.
- What's the remaining amount?

2428
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,310
I will pay that much.

2429
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:20,700
- Please use this card.
- Okay.

2430
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:23,610
Jae Suk. Who went before me?

2431
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:24,850
- Earlier...
- It's her.

2432
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:25,890
- This is insane.
- No, it isn't.

2433
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:27,480
- What?
- You paid a big amount, right?

2434
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:28,950
I will go and tell you.

2435
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:30,950
- There is no need to go.
- Why? Did the total get paid?

2436
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:32,150
I paid the remaining amount.

2437
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:34,190
- What is this?
- It's over.

2438
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:35,950
How much did you pay?

2439
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:37,950
- I didn't pay that much.
- How much did you pay?

2440
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:39,470
Why did you ruin the game?

2441
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:42,400
- I mean...
- After eating gukbap...

2442
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,270
You should have let us enjoy
the nerve-racking moment.

2443
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:47,030
It would have been better
had more people gone bankrupt.

2444
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:49,980
- I just wanted to show my love.
- That's ridiculous.

2445
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:52,310
- I mean...
- There are other ways to do it.

2446
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:55,180
- Why did you do it on the show?
- You ruined the game.

2447
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:56,880
You could have bought us a meal
after the shoot.

2448
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,850
Why did you show your love
while the cameras are running?

2449
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:01,090
Why did you do it
while the cameras are running?

2450
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:02,780
Do it when the cameras are turned off.

2451
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,450
We have to figure out the rankings
from the remaining balances.

2452
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:06,890
- Let's see what happens.
- Let's go.

2453
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:08,690
- I just wanted...
- All right.

2454
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:09,730
I know you meant well.

2455
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:10,800
The total amount got paid off...

2456
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,020
in four payments.

2457
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,490
It happened in four payments.

2458
01:17:14,490 --> 01:17:17,230
If your remaining balance
is over ten dollars,

2459
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:20,160
you will become a candidate
for the penalty...

2460
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,570
- along with the slaves.
- I should have used more money.

2461
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:24,770
- Jae Suk.
- Yes.

2462
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:25,770
(Jae Suk's balance gets announced first.)

2463
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:28,070
- How much did he use?
- He used 55.2 dollars.

2464
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:30,880
- He used a lot.
- I used a lot for gukbap.

2465
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,910
If he originally had 80 dollars...

2466
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:33,910
(If he originally had 60 dollars,)

2467
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:35,020
(he will be exempt from the penalty.)

2468
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:37,280
He used 55.2 dollars.

2469
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:40,730
I will reveal
the amount of money that was...

2470
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,400
- in the second writer's card.
- How much was it?

2471
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,100
(Second writer)

2472
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,320
It's 120 dollars.

2473
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,300
(120 dollars)

2474
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,190
You planned to use 50 dollars this time.

2475
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:51,100
- That was his plan.
- You planned to use 50 dollars.

2476
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,440
(So Min, the slave, kept him
from making the last payment.)

2477
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,700
The remaining balance is 64.8 dollars.

2478
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,480
- You planned to use 50 dollars.
- That's right.

2479
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,980
I have a chance.

2480
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:00,400
- Jae Suk failed.
- Good job.

2481
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,350
- Suk Jin, you went bankrupt.
- Yes.

2482
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:05,480
- Up next is Haha.
- Haha.

2483
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:06,740
- I am curious.
- How much did he use?

2484
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:10,560
Haha used 108.4 dollars.

2485
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,950
(Haha used 108.4 dollars.)

2486
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,930
- In my card...
- How much was there?

2487
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:16,430
Choi Bo Pil. There was 200 dollars, right?

2488
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:18,100
(If he originally had 110 dollars,
he will be exempt!)

2489
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:19,990
There was 190 dollars.

2490
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:22,400
- There was 190 dollars?
- I did better.

2491
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,730
- Someone else had 200 dollars.
- Seriously.

2492
01:18:23,730 --> 01:18:25,400
You must have 200 dollars.

2493
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,840
He will be a candidate
since 81.6 dollars remains.

2494
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,030
I chose the junior producer's card.

2495
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:32,070
Hold on.

2496
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:33,810
- Se Chan,
- You didn't twist it.

2497
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:35,380
you have the junior producer's card.

2498
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:36,380
Yes.

2499
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:39,590
You used 45.3 dollars.

2500
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:41,190
I bet he had 60 or 70 dollars.

2501
01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:42,560
I bet he had 50 dollars.

2502
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,090
I will reveal the original amount.

2503
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:45,520
I bet it's 60 dollars.

2504
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,850
(Junior producer)

2505
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:49,100
It's 200 dollars.

2506
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,930
(200 dollars!)

2507
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,730
Were you rich?

2508
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,940
You should have told me so.

2509
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:56,990
(The junior producer was richer
than they expected.)

2510
01:18:56,990 --> 01:18:58,030
It's impossible to guess.

2511
01:18:58,030 --> 01:18:59,730
The remaining balance is 154.7 dollars.

2512
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:01,940
- Ji Yeon is the youngest.
- Ji Yeon.

2513
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:03,600
I was going to pick Ji Yeon's card.

2514
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,700
Seriously.

2515
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,350
Ji Hyo is up next.

2516
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:08,910
- Ji Hyo must be...
- I picked Ju Yong's card.

2517
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:11,110
You used
the administrative producer's card.

2518
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:14,590
You used 10.6 dollars.

2519
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:15,780
Maybe there was 20 dollars.

2520
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:17,090
Seriously.

2521
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:19,350
- That would be incredible.
- Ju Yong's card.

2522
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:20,690
(If she originally had 20 dollars,
she will be exempt.)

2523
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:24,400
(How much money was on
the administrative producer's card?)

2524
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,190
(Administrative producer)

2525
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:28,730
There was 60 dollars.

2526
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,490
(Ji Hyo becomes a candidate
since 49.4 dollars remains.)

2527
01:19:30,490 --> 01:19:32,060
Jong Kook is up next.

2528
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:33,200
How much did he use?

2529
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,510
- He used 29.9 dollars.
- Okay.

2530
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:40,550
How much was
on the second producer's card?

2531
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:42,050
I had a guess.

2532
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:44,740
Hyung In wouldn't have a lot...

2533
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:46,020
since he spends too much on himself.

2534
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,190
He has the YOLO mentality.

2535
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:48,760
How much was on Hyung In's card?

2536
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,780
(If he originally had 30 dollars,
he will be exempt.)

2537
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:51,810
(Second producer)

2538
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:53,820
- There was 30 dollars.
- See?

2539
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:55,190
I guessed the exact amount.

2540
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,300
The remaining balance is ten cents.

2541
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:57,820
Ten cents?

2542
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:59,230
Is the remaining balance ten cents?

2543
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:01,470
I thought he would go bankrupt.

2544
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:02,470
(Detective Kim can even guess
the original balance.)

2545
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:04,730
The junior producer carries 200 dollars.

2546
01:20:04,730 --> 01:20:07,840
Why does the junior writer carry
ten dollars?

2547
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,180
- Seriously.
- What is up with that?

2548
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,440
It's unfair.

2549
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:13,740
The original amount was 30 dollars.

2550
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:16,810
So there are six candidates
for the penalty.

2551
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:19,110
- Unbelievable.
- We will play the Pirate Roulette.

2552
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:20,150
This is the worst.

2553
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,550
The penalty of the day...

2554
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,560
suits the name,
How Much Do You Want to Spend Race.

2555
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:26,950
While wearing the slave's outfit
and pillory,

2556
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:29,760
buy something at a nearby store
with your own card.

2557
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,430
(Buy something at a nearby store
with your own card.)

2558
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:32,430
(Gangnamdaero will be crowded.)

2559
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:34,660
- It will be so annoying.
- It will be so embarrassing.

2560
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:36,530
A pillory?

2561
01:20:36,530 --> 01:20:37,660
That's the worst.

2562
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:40,360
- That's the worst.
- That's the most annoying penalty.

2563
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,770
This is my neighborhood.

2564
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:43,340
- Seriously.
- This is your neighborhood.

2565
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:44,840
Even better.

2566
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,480
The member who was the closest
will go first.

2567
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,100
Ji Hyo, stick in a sword.

2568
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,980
I just need to avoid the penalty.

2569
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:53,280
- That's right.
- Will one person get the penalty?

2570
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,310
Yes.

2571
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:55,760
Jae Suk.

2572
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,950
I hope it pops out.

2573
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:57,980
I can't get the penalty.

2574
01:20:57,980 --> 01:20:59,820
Jae Suk is lucky these days.

2575
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:01,820
(WIll he prove that he is unlucky?)

2576
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:02,820
Send it flying in one go.

2577
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,300
Jae Suk is lucky these days.

2578
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:06,970
I hope it pops out.

2579
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:08,940
(Safe)

2580
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:11,400
- Thank goodness.
- Next.

2581
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,400
(It's Haha's turn.)

2582
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,660
- Haha.
- I hope he gets it.

2583
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,900
- I hope he gets it.
- Come on.

2584
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,180
Go.

2585
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:17,680
- Se Chan.
- Is it my turn?

2586
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:18,730
Se Chan, let's go.

2587
01:21:19,190 --> 01:21:21,560
- Boombastic!
- He might get the penalty.

2588
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,480
Let's do this.

2589
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,400
(3 people avoided the penalty.)

2590
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:28,150
(Will he avoid it as well?)

2591
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:29,310
Skrr

2592
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:03,180
- So Min.
- Skrr

2593
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:04,180
(Safe)

2594
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:05,390
So Min.

2595
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:06,920
- She must be nervous.
- So Bal, it's your turn.

2596
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,630
(Next comes the slave
who used over 300 dollars.)

2597
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:10,980
- It will be funny if she gets it.
- Gukbap.

2598
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:12,600
She used a lot of money too.

2599
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,190
- She used a lot of money.
- She used a lot of money.

2600
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,300
(Will she get the penalty as well?)

2601
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:17,890
- So Bal, go.
- She used a lot of money.

2602
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:20,140
(Safe)

2603
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,890
Okay. Suk Jin.

2604
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:23,670
- So Bal.
- Seok Sam.

2605
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,430
- He is wearing the outfit.
- He is wearing the outfit.

2606
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:27,880
- He can go right away.
- He is wearing the outfit.

2607
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,640
- He can go right after the shoot.
- Go.

2608
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,010
- Go.
- Let's slate.

2609
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:33,180
- Let's go.
- Let's slate.

2610
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:35,780
(Will he get the penalty?)

2611
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:37,220
Let's go.

2612
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,730
(Safe)

2613
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:45,090
Another round.

2614
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:46,260
This is bad.

2615
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:48,300
I think it will be me.

2616
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:49,320
Oh, no.

2617
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:51,060
- I am nervous.
- Ji Hyo, let's go.

2618
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:52,270
Slave.

2619
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:54,100
It's your turn.

2620
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:55,860
- Go.
- Go.

2621
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:56,970
Okay.

2622
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:58,640
- Okay. Boombastic!
- All right. Let's go.

2623
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,530
- Boombastic!
- Boombastic!

2624
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:02,680
(Quite a lot of knives are stuck already.)

2625
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:05,380
(She is highly likely to get a penalty.)

2626
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,050
- It will pop out this time.
- Let's go, So Min.

2627
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:08,140
(What about this time?)

2628
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,640
(She's safe again.)

2629
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:12,050
Darn it.

2630
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:13,460
(Darn it.)

2631
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:15,560
Let's go, Seok Sam.
You are wearing the costume already.

2632
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:18,650
(It's Seok Sam's turn again.)

2633
01:23:18,650 --> 01:23:20,390
- Let me help you.
- Arirang

2634
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:21,460
This is really...

2635
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:22,520
I'll make up my mind.

2636
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:24,730
I'll choose the one that catches my eyes.

2637
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:28,390
I can't choose 1 of the remaining 3.

2638
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:30,100
(Nervous)

2639
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:32,430
I see three slots.

2640
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:33,840
- This is driving me crazy.
- That was funny.

2641
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,100
- I don't know which one to pick.
- Just pick.

2642
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:37,850
- Go ahead.
- Left or right. Which one?

2643
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:40,520
All right. I think this is it. Okay.

2644
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,680
Gosh, this is crazy.

2645
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,480
- Okay.
- There are only a few left.

2646
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:44,940
- It's Ji Hyo.
- This is so thrilling.

2647
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:47,020
- Ji Hyo, you are funny.
- You have to do this.

2648
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:49,180
Ji Hyo, go ahead and do it.
There are only a few left.

2649
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:50,280
(Pirate Roulette is more thrilling
than ever before the worst penalty.)

2650
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:54,690
(Ji Hyo hasn't been so lucky lately.)

2651
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:58,800
- Stick it in.
- Yes!

2652
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,470
(Song Ji Hyo gets the penalty.)

2653
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:05,010
There are only three slots left.

2654
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:07,010
- It's done!
- Yes!

2655
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:08,100
My goodness.

2656
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:10,550
- Boombastic!
- I've survived.

2657
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:13,310
- Put on the slave costume.
- Oh, dear.

2658
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:15,810
All right. And...

2659
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:16,850
"And?"

2660
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:20,260
I bet it's someone's birthday. In March...

2661
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:21,310
Who would it be?

2662
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:23,260
It's my birthday.

2663
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:24,680
Right. It's So Min's birthday.

2664
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:26,350
You don't have to do this though.

2665
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:28,320
- This is what we always do.
- Is it your birthday?

2666
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,230
- That's...
- Happy birthday to you

2667
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:32,530
(Happy birthday.)

2668
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,640
(Thank you.)

2669
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:38,900
- So Min, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

2670
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:40,930
(The junior writer
gives her the birthday cake.)

2671
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:42,640
Make a wish and blow out the candles.

2672
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:43,740
- Did you make a wish?
- Yes.

2673
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:46,270
Yes. I hope Running Man
will be more popular.

2674
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,420
- Thank you.
- The smoke went to her.

2675
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,020
- The smoke went straight to her.
- She just breathed it in.

2676
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:55,350
It went straight to her.

2677
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:57,150
She inhaled the smoke.

2678
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:59,520
Why would you do that?

2679
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,760
- She must be upset.
- I bet she's mad.

2680
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,730
- She seems very upset.
- Go wash your face.

2681
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:06,170
Do you know how she looked
as she turned around?

2682
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,030
- She was startled.
- Why did you do that?

2683
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:10,030
(After the writer got humiliated...)

2684
01:25:10,030 --> 01:25:12,030
(Song Ji Hyo, the sinner shows up.)

2685
01:25:12,030 --> 01:25:13,810
Do you want me to go out
looking like this?

2686
01:25:14,270 --> 01:25:16,440
I can't believe this.

2687
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:19,680
This is so embarrassing.

2688
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:26,460
(The sinner crash-landed
in the middle of Gangnam.)

2689
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:29,430
(The good citizens are
surprised to see her.)

2690
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:30,850
- Look at her.
- I can't believe this.

2691
01:25:30,850 --> 01:25:32,230
It's Song Ji Hyo.

2692
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:36,390
(She tries to avoid people by instinct.)

2693
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:39,800
(She gets into a nearby store.)

2694
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,340
Hello.

2695
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:46,310
I didn't know there would be people.

2696
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,570
I need to buy sanitizing wipes.

2697
01:25:49,570 --> 01:25:51,050
(She hurriedly picks up what she sees.)

2698
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:55,920
Hello. Can I buy this one?

2699
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:59,560
(Cumbersome)

2700
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:04,260
(Please hurry.)

2701
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,930
(1 second seems like 10 minutes.)

2702
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:12,100
(The clerk is also feeling anxious.)

2703
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:13,930
Payment completed.

2704
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:16,060
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

2705
01:26:16,530 --> 01:26:17,900
Bye.

2706
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,730
(She completes her mission
feeling humiliated.)

2707
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:22,940
(Hello, viewers.)

2708
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,210
(Thank you for letting us...)

2709
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:25,310
(celebrate our 200th episode.)

2710
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:26,850
(We'd like to thank...)

2711
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:28,570
(our viewers.)

2712
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,350
(Until the 600th episode,)

2713
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:32,280
(our viewers have...)

2714
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,650
(always been with us.)

2715
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:34,760
(Of the viewers)

2716
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:35,760
(For the viewers)

2717
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:36,960
(By the viewers)

2718
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,960
(With Viewers Special)

2719
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,850
(What's your secret
for your strong mentality?)

2720
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:42,970
(0 percent offense)

2721
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:44,130
(You didn't mean to hit me
for real, right?)

2722
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:45,360
(Flinching)

2723
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:48,470
(Painful past)

2724
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:51,100
(Painful consolation)

2725
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,480
(It's completely different.)

2726
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,400
(A preview of the future Running Man)

2727
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,050
(And...)

2728
01:26:58,050 --> 01:27:00,310
(From the beginning to the end
of Running Man)

2729
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:02,020
(A new challenge...)

2730
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:03,310
(for the viewers)

2731
01:27:04,810 --> 01:27:07,520
(With Viewers)
