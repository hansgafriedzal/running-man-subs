1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,170
The weather is nice today.
We shouldn't be working here.

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,890
We have to go to Gangnam.
This isn't just right.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,000
The weather is so nice today. Hello.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,760
- It's spring.
- The weather is lovely these days.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,080
It looks like you two are
in different seasons.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,070
- What?
- Totally different seasons.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,640
This is perfect for this season.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,620
- It's just too soon.
- You must be cold.

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,410
- Is it cold? No, it's...
- Yes.

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,480
Hello.

12
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,980
- My goodness. I'm...
- Nice to meet you.

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,160
(Mr. Baby Octopus enters.)

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,430
- Gosh, this is...
- Oh, dear.

15
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,900
- Good, Se Chan.
- We should go to Gangnam.

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,900
You look good, Se Chan.

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,900
I'm going to Gangnam today.

18
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,900
Suk Jin.

19
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,060
I'm really scared of Dong Hoon.

20
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,160
- Hello.
- Is this "The Outlaws" or what?

21
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,040
- Hey.
- My goodness.

22
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,540
- You look nice.
- Are you from "Harry Potter?"

23
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,800
You tucked your shirt
into the pants.

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,340
- Sure.
- Hey.

25
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,870
- You are quite dressed up.
- It looks perfect.

26
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,240
Se Chan, you look nice.

27
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,870
- Next week is our 600th episode.
- Really?

28
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,810
- So I'd like to ask you a favor.
- What?

29
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,660
Ji Hyo and Se Chan came up
with this idea the other day.

30
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,990
We'd like you to put on your best outfits
without your stylists' help.

31
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,090
Something you want to show off.

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,290
- Ji Hyo. Seriously this is...
- It's like the medicine commercial.

33
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,570
- Is this what you wear?
- Hey.

34
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,900
- Are you sure?
- This is mine.

35
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,100
By the way,
I know the shoes aren't yours.

36
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,370
So Min, this isn't
how you usually look.

37
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,370
- They are not your shoes.
- Why are you lying?

38
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,960
Except for the shoes,
they all are mine.

39
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,770
- Seriously, I'm wearing my clothes.
- These are...

40
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,630
- I'm...
- You are just obvious.

41
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,150
This is totally me. This is...

42
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,150
And I can tell these are yours.

43
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,350
Right. This is me.

44
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,770
- You bought it in LA, right?
- Yes, this is me.

45
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,150
- I bought it in LA.
- Biggie.

46
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,590
- I got it in LA.
- Your shoes look new.

47
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,090
They are new.
I took them out for today.

48
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,820
- Really?
- To match the colors.

49
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,090
- To show my sincerity.
- So you did smarten yourself up.

50
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,680
- Of course.
- He did.

51
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,990
- This shirt is...
- He smartened himself up.

52
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,650
- Look at his watch.
- I'm wearing a watch.

53
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,430
- I saw that.
- I'm even wearing a watch.

54
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,460
- This is real.
- For a special occasion.

55
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,070
- He's serious about this.
- He's dressed up.

56
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,100
Take a look at Suk Jin.

57
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,430
- What?
- He's wearing something expensive.

58
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,600
Don't do that.

59
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,660
- What is it? Let me see.
- Look.

60
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,240
You're not supposed to look closely.

61
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,630
- Don't do that.
- That's a designer brand.

62
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,150
He says we should glimpse at it.

63
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,710
Right. You shouldn't
look closely at it.

64
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,380
Comedians like things
with big logos like that.

65
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,680
- Right.
- That's what comedians do.

66
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
- Brand-name goods...
- Obviously...

67
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,440
- They like brand-name goods.
- Hey, that's so tacky.

68
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,990
This is Gucci, this is Burberry,
and these are Louis Vuitton.

69
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,490
- That's so cool.
- This is crazy.

70
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,300
- Hello.
- This is crazy.

71
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,360
You're not dressed up.

72
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,900
No, this is fashion.

73
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,590
That has nothing to do with fashion.
You're supposed to be dressed up.

74
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,900
I bought these myself.

75
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,560
- Did you buy them?
- I bought them.

76
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,210
You must have something else.
Why are you dressed like this?

77
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,270
I think that's neat.

78
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,710
- This is perfect.
- It's not bad.

79
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,080
- You two look good together.
- Suk Jin.

80
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,800
- What is this?
- Let go of it.

81
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,000
Hey! Stop it!

82
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,520
- He does it with expensive clothes.
- This is expensive!

83
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,810
(It's an expensive shirt.)

84
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,420
(The collar is stretched out.)

85
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,310
- What is this yellowish thing?
- Hey, this is Gucci.

86
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,650
Hey, this is Gucci.

87
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,900
- What is this...
- It's all stretched out.

88
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,430
This is so upsetting.

89
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,270
This is an expensive shirt.

90
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,900
- What is this yellowish thing?
- Let go of it.

91
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,670
- What is this yellowish thing?
- Hey!

92
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,530
- Why are you wearing...
- It doesn't have to be expensive.

93
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,530
Why are you doing this?

94
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,430
- He's got a lot of business cards.
- This is Louis Vuitton.

95
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,900
- Let go of it.
- Suk Jin.

96
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,030
Just put them back in.

97
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,150
- Suk Jin.
- In Suk Jin bag...

98
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,110
Real estate agents, bankers...

99
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,810
They all are business cards.

100
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,180
- Give me that.
- Suk Jin.

101
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,050
- I mean...
- Why are you doing this?

102
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,180
By the way,
you don't wear things like these.

103
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,990
- He's right.
- Right. You look scary.

104
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,280
What is this watch?

105
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,780
- My goodness.
- This is so...

106
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,300
- You don't usually look like this.
- What's with this watch?

107
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,620
- And, seriously...
- Why would you...

108
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,830
- He doesn't wear things like that.
- You know these are mine.

109
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,060
I think he is...

110
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,110
He is always harassed
by fashion trends.

111
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,930
- Exactly.
- Harassed?

112
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,870
- Am I a fugitive or what?
- Why are you so obsessed?

113
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,870
I'm harassed.

114
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,470
He's harassed by being hip.

115
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,150
On a stand-up comedy show,

116
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,080
lame thugs are always
dressed like this.

117
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,580
- Thugs who are bad at fighting.
- Exactly.

118
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,490
- I know.
- They look exactly like him.

119
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,620
- They just don't get it.
- And there's Ji Hyo.

120
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,930
She looks really hip these days.

121
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,460
- A fashion leader.
- Right.

122
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,590
When I went abroad
in this dress before,

123
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,300
- Jong Kook told me this.
- What did he say?

124
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,400
- Are you trying to pick up a man?
- My gosh.

125
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,900
- Jong Kook.
- Did I see this dress before?

126
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,900
Did I see it before?

127
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,490
- Yes, you did.
- This is why...

128
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,560
you need to set your mind on this.

129
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,460
- Why do you...
- He shakes her up.

130
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,770
- Why do you keep shaking her up?
- Gosh.

131
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,710
The pepper meme is going viral now.

132
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,770
- I know.
- Right.

133
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,770
The black pepper thing.

134
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,920
- Right.
- Since the episode...

135
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,770
You didn't listen to me.

136
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,780
When she added pepper,

137
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,980
- I was just curious...
- That's enough.

138
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,280
- Aren't I right?
- You are right.

139
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,780
- I was just curious.
- Look at them.

140
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,780
- They even have similar looks.
- No.

141
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,480
- Don't let them stick together.
- I was just asking a question.

142
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,150
- Separate them.
- That's just awkward.

143
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,400
- By the way,
- What?

144
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,830
I don't want you to do anything...

145
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,200
that makes people
wonder about your relationship.

146
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,360
We don't make people wonder.

147
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,810
You're the one
who makes people wonder.

148
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,600
It's you who always starts it.

149
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,510
She added pepper, and I got curious.
So I just asked a question.

150
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,770
- You wondered why.
- The thing is,

151
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,250
it seemed like something was
going on between you two.

152
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,380
- And people noticed it.
- Nothing's going on.

153
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,470
- We need to add vinegar.
- That's why we had a fight.

154
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,390
- Let's say it was someone else.
- I sent him a text...

155
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,410
even after the shoot.
"Why do you not trust me?"

156
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,060
- Seriously?
- Let's say it was So Min.

157
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,090
She added pepper.

158
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,280
I'd ask, "Do you add pepper in here?"
What's wrong with that?

159
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,920
It's good for your health.

160
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,650
(It's good for your health.)

161
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,360
What was that?

162
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,570
- What's that?
- Why are you weighing in?

163
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,570
That doesn't seem weird.

164
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,500
It wouldn't have been strange
if it was So Min.

165
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,270
- She's really funny.
- Why do you keep doing this?

166
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,840
- Why is it okay with her?
- But...

167
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,010
So Min can play along
with all kinds of love jokes.

168
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,510
- That's true.
- I can do it even when you yell.

169
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,270
- She can.
- Even if you swear at me.

170
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,340
You should have some ground rules.

171
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,080
- So Min is enthusiastic.
- That's nice.

172
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,750
You all are dressed up nicely
to celebrate our 600th episode.

173
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,190
That's a lie.

174
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,520
Honestly, I think you all look nice.

175
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,590
Should we go somewhere nice today?

176
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,520
- I don't want to hang out with you.
- Let's just go.

177
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,060
- Where are we going?
- I'll give it to you.

178
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,090
- Seriously?
- Yes.

179
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,460
- When? Today?
- He loves it.

180
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,720
- Today?
- No.

181
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,350
- In two years.
- My gosh.

182
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,130
- That's...
- Suk Jin.

183
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,500
When the logo wears off,

184
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,400
- then he will give you this.
- You are so mean.

185
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,900
Just wait two years.

186
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,600
- And it will be yours.
- Okay. I will wait.

187
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,900
Look at Se Chan.

188
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,840
It looks like he's putting up
a singing beggar show...

189
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,600
to celebrate the 20th anniversary
of his debut.

190
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,250
Look at him.
He plays along with the joke.

191
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,410
- He's good.
- Today, Se Chan is...

192
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,390
- giving a solo performance.
- Look at him.

193
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,540
It's his solo performance.

194
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,780
- You look terrible today.
- And he's Se Chan's manager.

195
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,560
No. I really like my outfit.

196
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,920
- Stop it.
- The singing beggar show.

197
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,150
- Seriously...
- Hey, you are...

198
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,260
- It's hot, but I should be patient.
- There's a butterfly.

199
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,330
- Butterfly.
- Follow it. There it goes.

200
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,200
- Go.
- Follow the butterfly.

201
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,400
Keep following it.

202
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,530
- So Min, go.
- She's gone.

203
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,940
So Min, you should go.

204
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,270
- You should go.
- That's nice.

205
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,400
So this is our 600th episode.

206
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,580
It's been a really long time.

207
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,310
- Sure.
- That's a lot.

208
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,710
It's been so long.

209
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,040
And this is unprecedented in Korea.

210
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,390
So we prepared a cake
to thank you guys.

211
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,350
- A cake?
- My gosh.

212
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,560
- All right.
- It's pretty.

213
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,150
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

214
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,560
- It says it's the 600th episode.
- Thank you.

215
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,900
- So it's been about ten years.
- Take a photo of it.

216
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,290
- Jong Kook.
- Do we need to sing?

217
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,460
- Is this Ji Hyo?
- They look like us.

218
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,090
It even has my double chin.

219
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,160
(The cookies have the detailed
features of the members.)

220
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,840
- Actually, this is...
- You know what?

221
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,640
A total of 600 episodes
means 12 years.

222
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,810
- Exactly.
- Did you say 12 years?

223
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,970
- It's been a long time.
- It's unbelievable.

224
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,040
I'm so touched.

225
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,340
This is amazing.

226
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,600
Of course.

227
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,340
- Thank you.
- We owe it all to our viewers...

228
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,780
- who always support us...
- Exactly.

229
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,980
and the production crew
who always helps us.

230
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,260
There are many staff members
like Chan Hee who've been...

231
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,720
- with us the whole time.
- Exactly.

232
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,000
And I'd like to thank our members.

233
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,400
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

234
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,090
- Congratulations.
- Thank you all for your hard work.

235
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,770
- Thank you.
- This is really nice.

236
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,790
Our show will continue.

237
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,010
All right. Let's blow out
the candles together.

238
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,710
- Thank you so much.
- One, two, three.

239
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,210
(Congratulations
on the 600th episode.)

240
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,250
- There have been 600 episodes.
- It's been a really long time.

241
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,340
- This is amazing.
- The 600th episode.

242
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,610
- This is pretty.
- It's been so long.

243
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,820
Today, to celebrate
our 600th episode, we will have...

244
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,840
With Viewers Race where we will
do things with our viewers.

245
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,190
- What is it?
- With our viewers?

246
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,390
The race will have
Part 1 and Part 2.

247
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,830
In each part, we will have one
candidate for a winner and a loser.

248
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,960
So there will be 2 candidates for
a winner and another 2 for a loser.

249
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,290
And 1 of these 2 will each be
a winner and a loser.

250
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,230
Let me tell you about
the privilege of the winner.

251
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,440
You can send a coffee truck...

252
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,210
to any place you want
in Running Man's name.

253
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,440
- Okay.
- That sounds nice.

254
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,380
And today, we'd like to donate money
to charities for good causes...

255
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,150
- after a long time.
- I see.

256
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,820
And we will do it
in the winner's name.

257
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,090
The amount of the donation
depends on what you do today.

258
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,390
You can save up to 10,000 dollars,
so I'd like you to try your best.

259
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,630
We should give it our best shot.

260
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,790
All right. Let's move to...

261
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,290
- the venue for Part One then.
- Shall we?

262
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,920
- Let's go.
- All right.

263
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,200
Let's go.

264
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,160
The weather is getting hotter.

265
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,530
This is really nice.

266
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,310
I want to try this fishcake.

267
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,440
It tastes really good.

268
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,540
I like the fishcake.

269
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,580
(They have all kinds of snacks
set out on the table.)

270
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,780
- This is good.
- It's tasty.

271
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,970
(It's coffee and snacks
from the fans of Running Man.)

272
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,050
It's delicious.

273
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,710
- This is a race with our viewers.
- Okay.

274
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,350
While you enjoy the snacks
from our viewers and fans,

275
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,920
I will explain
the rules for Part One.

276
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,690
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

277
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,190
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the snacks.

278
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,530
Those who already checked
our social media might know this.

279
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,490
Via our Instagram and YouTube channels,
we've been getting...

280
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,230
questions about Running Man
and the members since March.

281
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,210
Actually, we've never had...

282
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,340
such a Q and A session
in the last 600 episodes.

283
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,470
- Seriously?
- That sounds nice.

284
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,610
Questions about us.

285
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,780
Will it be fun?

286
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,820
- That's the problem.
- I'm not sure.

287
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,950
We have to make this fun.

288
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,190
- It doesn't have to be funny.
- Seriously?

289
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,560
We just want your honest answers.

290
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,820
So is this like an interview?

291
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,930
On our Instagram,

292
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,590
we got 12,568 comments.

293
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,460
On our YouTube channel,
we got 4,682 comments.

294
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,960
So there are about 17,250 questions.

295
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,360
(About 17,000 questions)

296
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,410
I heard Suk Jin used
the macroinstruction.

297
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,230
- Did you do that?
- Is that true?

298
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,440
- I heard that's what you did.
- That's not true.

299
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,310
Among them, we picked out
the most frequently asked questions.

300
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,340
It must've been hard.

301
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,050
So we have 30 questions now.

302
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,840
How did you pick them out?

303
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,640
- It must've been tough.
- And the 30 questions are...

304
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,160
in the balloons behind you.

305
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,060
- That's brilliant.
- Hey.

306
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,590
- This is like a fan meeting.
- I know.

307
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,160
You will pop a balloon you want...

308
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,930
and read the question
in the balloon.

309
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,800
And the person who is questioned
will give an honest answer.

310
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,340
If you do that, you will save
6,000 dollars for the donation.

311
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,710
- My gosh.
- Oh, dear.

312
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,000
Isn't that too easy?

313
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,310
Are we getting 6,000 dollars
just by doing that?

314
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,870
That's suspicious.

315
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,000
This is a good thing.

316
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,140
Once the Q and A session is over,

317
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,610
the members will take a vote
on the person...

318
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,380
- who gave the most honest answer.
- There must be something.

319
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,960
And the person will be
a candidate for a winner.

320
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,790
And a candidate for a loser...

321
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,190
will be decided by the crew members.

322
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,330
(The candidate for a loser will be
decided by the crew members.)

323
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,590
- Honestly, Suk Jin is...
- Honest answers?

324
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,330
- I can give honest answers.
- Seriously,

325
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,760
- he's leading a fake life.
- That's not true.

326
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,170
- Fake.
- I'm honest.

327
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,340
- He can be on "Incredible Moment."
- Or on "Surprise Mystery TV."

328
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,630
- The fake life.
- I'm ready to tell the truth.

329
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,280
Now you can pop the balloons.

330
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,780
This part will make up about
30 to 40 minutes of the airtime.

331
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,100
So we need about eight questions.

332
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,680
- I see.
- Hang on.

333
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,950
You just told us to do it at ease,
but why would you bring that up?

334
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,190
- That means...
- That's a lot of pressure.

335
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,510
I feel suffocated.

336
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,480
That means we need to make this fun.

337
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,750
It means the same.

338
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,090
Why do you give us such guidelines
all of a sudden?

339
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,530
Just tell us to make it fun.

340
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,830
That's a lot of pressure.

341
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,390
Don't worry about the airtime.

342
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,460
- So Min.
- It's like...

343
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,930
You already said 30 to 40 minutes.

344
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,200
Actually, the youngest members...

345
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,460
don't care much about airtime.

346
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,600
- It's not so...
- They don't care a lot about it.

347
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,440
They don't bear
much of the responsibility.

348
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,000
- But the older members...
- It's good to be the youngest.

349
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,310
- I feel a lot of pressure.
- You do?

350
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,100
They treat me differently
after the shoot.

351
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,340
- Why?
- What do you mean?

352
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,740
After the shoot, I usually say,
"Thank you for today. Goodbye."

353
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,710
When I do something fun,

354
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,950
the head writer comes to me
and says,

355
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,250
- "So Min, great job today."
- Does she say things like that?

356
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,350
"So Min, you are
the treasure of Running Man."

357
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,090
But when I'm not so funny...

358
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,620
I say thank you,
she just walks past me.

359
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,160
"Hey, Jae Suk."
She talks to someone else.

360
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,430
She doesn't even look at me.

361
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,340
- Hyo Im.
- You shouldn't be like that.

362
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,670
Hyo Im, that's what you do
before you know it.

363
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,670
Ji Hyo, did Hyo Im
ever come to you...

364
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,810
and say that you did a great job?

365
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,500
She doesn't even know
whom you are talking about now.

366
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,410
There she is.

367
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,610
- That's Hyo Im.
- I know who she is.

368
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,580
That's Hyo Im. There she is.

369
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,820
- "That's Hyo Im."
- "That's her."

370
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,060
Ji Hyo, I forgot to ask you
our official question.

371
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,210
What did you do yesterday?

372
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,610
I stayed at home.

373
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,590
(I stayed at home.)

374
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,030
We need a screenshot of this.
"I stayed at home."

375
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,250
I'm collecting them.

376
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,170
Is the door to your place
locked up from the outside?

377
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,300
- Someone else locks it up?
- No.

378
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,720
"Ji Hyo, what did you do today?"

379
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,090
"I stayed at home."

380
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,860
We can make it into a group song.

381
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,100
I'm sorry. This is yours,
but I just drank it.

382
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,440
It's okay. It's no big deal.

383
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,810
- What was that?
- What are they doing?

384
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,230
- Why are you two so close?
- Go ahead and drink it.

385
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,970
You're being nice to him
because he's a good fighter.

386
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,410
- What?
- Because he's strong...

387
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,340
- Hey.
- I just like him.

388
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,970
- That means I'm a good friend.
- He's a good friend.

389
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,190
And he and I have been working
together for the longest time.

390
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,250
- What do you mean?
- Since "X-Man".

391
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,510
Don't be ridiculous.

392
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,690
What about
"Live and Enjoy Together"?

393
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,930
Right. There was
"Live and Enjoy Together".

394
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,660
Look at him.

395
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,750
(2001, "Star Survival:
Live and Enjoy Together")

396
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,090
(I won't get hurt
even if something hits my head.)

397
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,960
(I need to protect my head.)

398
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,700
(Do you still fight?)

399
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,040
- Sure.
- Okay.

400
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,340
(I've missed you.)

401
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,360
(Jae Suk.)

402
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,810
Look at him.

403
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,740
- The fan meeting.
- "Live and Enjoy Together".

404
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,000
- You hosted my fan meeting.
- Hey.

405
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,210
I'm glad you brought that up.

406
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,280
You stared at me
with those snake eyes.

407
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,110
- Snake eyes.
- At my fan meeting...

408
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,250
You got 500 to 1,000 dollars
like this.

409
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,290
"Oh, dear."

410
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,560
Was it 1,000 dollars?
You got paid a lot.

411
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,890
- "Thank you so much."
- That's very generous.

412
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,220
I looked at it in the mirror.

413
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,030
- He was like this.
- Back then, his pay was...

414
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,960
only 300 to 500 dollars.

415
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,540
Why would you talk
about my pay from back then?

416
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,810
- I know.
- That was his pay.

417
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,070
He got the money like this.

418
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,940
- Hey. I made the best...
- I want questions like this today.

419
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,000
- I made the best use of the money.
- I know.

420
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,050
- This is the real friendship.
- I know.

421
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,740
(That's how
their friendship started.)

422
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,780
- Do you want me to pop it first?
- Okay.

423
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,380
- The beggar goes first.
- Se Chan.

424
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,160
So Min, your outfit is really...

425
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,480
What about the black one?
I bet it's for Jong Kook.

426
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,830
That doesn't include...

427
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,960
- Gosh, I'm startled.
- That's loud.

428
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,060
- Let's read it.
- I'm startled.

429
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,390
Here.

430
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,760
We have a question.

431
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,170
- Okay.
- I will read it.

432
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,070
Black.

433
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,340
(They have to give honest
answers to any questions.)

434
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,470
"Jae Suk knows all there is to know
about his colleagues' social media."

435
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,270
- Does he have a secret account?
- "Does he..."

436
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,330
"have a secret account
that he uses to spy on others?"

437
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,110
- That's what I thought.
- That's right.

438
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,870
- I want to know.
- I never thought about this.

439
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,670
- I bet he has one.
- The question is...

440
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,140
- very sharp.
- To check others' accounts.

441
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,380
- To spy on others.
- The thing is,

442
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,200
I don't need an account.

443
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,120
- You can see it everywhere.
- That's true.

444
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,990
But sometimes you know things
that weren't reported in the media.

445
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,310
A lot of fans post...

446
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,150
- such information online.
- Fans do that?

447
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,390
- Where do you get the information?
- On YouTube?

448
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,860
A forum and some other websites.

449
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,030
- You mean, an internet forum?
- Which forum do you often visit?

450
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,500
- It's...
- He meets people at a nearby cafe.

451
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,690
The owner of the cafe
I go to as a regular...

452
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,920
- That person tells you?
- tells me recent celebrity news.

453
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,600
But sometimes he knows
too much details...

454
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,430
- that's hard to find out that way.
- That's right.

455
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,560
I get tipped off.

456
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,930
- I'm not going to tell you who.
- Who tips you off?

457
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,780
- A celebrity or a staff member?
- Who tips you off?

458
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,280
- It could be a staff member...
- Exactly.

459
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,010
or one of the people around you.

460
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,120
- You mean, our fellow entertainer?
- I get it. It's Sae Ho, right?

461
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,410
- One of our fellow entertainers.
- Cho Sae Ho, right?

462
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,650
- It could be Sae Ho.
- It must be Sae Ho.

463
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,810
I also deliver the information I got
to some other people.

464
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,120
- I see.
- Some tell me funny stories.

465
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,950
- Right.
- I mean, he knows everything.

466
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,230
- True.
- There's nothing he doesn't know.

467
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,050
You can get information easily
on YouTube these days.

468
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,050
That's true.

469
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,690
- They share information on YouTube.
- That's true.

470
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,900
- They share everything.
- That's right.

471
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,770
The fans upload videos
about the information they gathered.

472
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,160
- Why are you not on social media?
- Social media...

473
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,010
I can't think of any reasons
to be on social media.

474
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,740
- Jae Suk, I have a question.
- Go ahead.

475
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,330
When we take a photo together,
I want to upload the photo.

476
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,700
Do you want me to ask you first?
Or can I just upload it?

477
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,780
- You can just upload it.
- Come on.

478
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,980
- Wouldn't you mind?
- I wouldn't mind.

479
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,480
- That's a promise.
- Sure.

480
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,990
- Then I'll upload whatever I want.
- Okay. Like what?

481
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,120
- Something embarrassing?
- No.

482
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,720
- It's not like that.
- I know what it is.

483
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,950
- Oh, I think I know too.
- The extreme close-up shots?

484
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,030
- Where he looks like a monkfish.
- No, that's not it.

485
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,360
- So Min, you meant that one, right?
- No. His photos in general.

486
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,500
- When I have a photo of you...
- Then ask me before you upload it.

487
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,770
- Show me first.
- Every time?

488
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,100
I'd like you
to ask for my permission.

489
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,690
I have some photos of So Min too.

490
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,330
- No. You can't upload those.
- She didn't let me.

491
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,530
- She said no.
- Those are too embarrassing.

492
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,830
Why didn't you let him?

493
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,030
- I dressed as Yondu.
- Let me reveal the photos.

494
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,900
They were taken before my face was
painted blue. It's embarrassing.

495
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,280
I have a few photos of Suk Jin.

496
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
- You can upload them.
- I have his photos too.

497
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,850
- I don't mind.
- The ones where you're sleeping.

498
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,280
- I...
- Except for those.

499
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,280
- I have photos of him sleeping too.
- Really?

500
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,750
- Where I look spaced out, right?
- I have a few as well.

501
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,410
- I have photos of him sleeping.
- That's embarrassing.

502
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,890
Can I upload a photo of you smoking
an electronic cigarette?

503
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,910
- No, you can't.
- The one...

504
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,490
- I have photos of him smoking too.
- On my social media.

505
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,730
Please don't upload such photos.

506
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,760
What about the one
where Jong Kook's nipples show?

507
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,230
That's okay. Such photos of me are
already all over the internet.

508
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,770
- You don't mind?
- No, I don't mind.

509
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,400
- I can share your photos, right?
- Right.

510
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,930
My photos?
Where will you upload them?

511
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,740
I'll put them on the bulletin board
in my apartment building.

512
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,470
- Why would you...
- Because I'm not on social media.

513
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,510
- Will you print them out?
- Why would you do that?

514
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,010
- Yes. "My fellow residents."
- I like that idea.

515
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,570
- "Look at these funny photos."
- That's a great idea.

516
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,310
- "Have a nice day."
- People would love it.

517
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,120
- On the one in the elevator.
- Exactly.

518
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,250
- I love the idea.
- Just open a social media account.

519
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,150
I mean, you're a top show host.

520
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,990
- Share your daily life...
- But that's...

521
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,230
- up to Jae Suk.
- Why would I do that for him?

522
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,650
I'd have to keep posting my photos.
But I don't like taking selfies.

523
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,690
Then why do you not use
a messenger app?

524
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,000
- That's a hassle.
- Many don't use it including her.

525
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,430
- When you sign up for it,
- That's right.

526
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,690
the contact numbers on my phone
would be on the list.

527
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,060
- I'd get a lot of welcome messages.
- But that's...

528
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,370
- Not necessarily.
- That's not true.

529
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,910
- You can turn off notifications.
- That's not true.

530
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,140
- I don't like meaningless chats.
- Exactly.

531
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,680
- What do you mean?
- Also, in a group chat room,

532
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,340
- you get hundreds of messages.
- What I'm saying is... Yes.

533
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,540
It's fun to talk in a group chat
from time to time.

534
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,040
- It's fun.
- I wouldn't give up the rest...

535
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,720
- for that brief moment.
- Absolutely.

536
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,110
- I like your comment. It's logical.
- Jae Suk, I mean...

537
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,490
- Everyone else uses the messenger.
- They're excited.

538
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,530
Exactly.

539
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,160
- Honestly, one of the reasons...
- I understand.

540
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,960
I don't want to
join your group chat is...

541
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,700
- Haha.
- Why?

542
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,970
(Haha is 1 of the reasons I don't
want to join your group chat.)

543
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,090
- Why?
- He sends photos of him eating.

544
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,130
- You mean, he acts up?
- He does that.

545
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,170
- He acts up.
- Yes, he does.

546
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,800
(This is the members' group chat.)

547
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,780
- And he films himself drinking too.
- Jae Suk.

548
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,450
"I had a drink."

549
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,980
(He makes a vlog video
and sends it in the group chat.)

550
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,870
- "I had a drink."
- That's true.

551
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,340
- I hate it when he does that.
- Jae Suk.

552
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,640
Do you know
how lonely I feel at home?

553
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,490
Do you know how comforting it is?

554
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,280
- I agree.
- It helped us while quarantining.

555
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,730
- True.
- I don't want to know what he eats.

556
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,460
- But Jae Suk.
- It got you through a hard time.

557
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,050
- Yes, you're right.
- How did you know that?

558
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,320
I heard. So Min and many others
told me about it.

559
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,560
- I didn't tell him that.
- Oh, I see.

560
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,740
- You told me.
- No, I didn't.

561
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,360
Based on what he said,
she badmouthed me.

562
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,600
- No, I didn't.
- You told me.

563
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,830
- How could you?
- Oh, no. So Min, I'm sorry.

564
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,330
- She's his spy.
- No, that's not true.

565
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,830
- Gosh, you spy.
- It's our private group chat.

566
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,450
- You asked me to send that photo.
- I'm done with it.

567
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,950
- I'll leave that chat room.
- So Min, I'm sorry.

568
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,540
- Let's open a new one without her.
- Leave our chat room.

569
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,780
- Without her.
- Let's open a new one.

570
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,310
- We let you join us. How could you?
- Let's open one without her.

571
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,520
- Listen. Having a group chat...
- You shouldn't do that.

572
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,080
- isn't all good.
- How could you?

573
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,530
- You guys ignore my messages.
- We're not like you.

574
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,270
- This is why I don't use it.
- You guys ignore my messages.

575
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,390
- That's not true.
- He...

576
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,290
- Jong Kook often leaves me on read.
- This is why.

577
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,560
- When did I ignore your message?
- He leaves me on read.

578
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,510
Haha has more than ten group chats.

579
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,830
- He opens a new one too often.
- That's my specialty.

580
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,100
- Don't act up.
- Right.

581
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,180
That's not what it's about.
That's me being friendly.

582
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,280
- No, you act up all the time.
- That's right.

583
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,410
- Why do you call it acting up?
- Gosh.

584
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,980
When Haha invites me
to parties like his birthday party,

585
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,690
there's something he always does.
Jung Jun Ha does it too.

586
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,340
- He invites friends individually.
- Really?

587
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,550
- "Hey, come join my party."
- I see.

588
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,730
- You'd meet people you don't know.
- "You don't mind, do you?"

589
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,690
Exactly. "You don't mind, do you?"
I meet people I don't know.

590
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,890
- It's uncomfortable.
- It's really uncomfortable.

591
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,730
And he leaves before I leave.

592
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,500
That's because I'm drunk.

593
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,360
- Why would he leave early?
- Because I'm drunk.

594
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,940
He gathered all those people
who didn't know one another.

595
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,210
- And he claims...
- You can make friends with them.

596
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,510
I wouldn't introduce bad people
to you, would I?

597
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,240
- That's not all.
- It's nice to meet good people.

598
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,240
He claims
that they're all good people.

599
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,800
- It's not like I get jealous.
- It's really uncomfortable.

600
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,010
- I don't get jealous.
- Here's what's ridiculous.

601
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,520
- So we became friends through Haha.
- Okay.

602
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,540
We developed friendships
and kept in touch with each other.

603
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,280
One day, I asked Haha,
"Why don't you see him anymore?"

604
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,850
He said, "He's a jerk."

605
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,930
- That's true.
- I mean, seriously.

606
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,260
- He does that.
- It's ridiculous.

607
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,460
- He introduced us to each other.
- That's true.

608
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,790
- And we became close friends.
- Right?

609
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,890
- But he cut ties with that friend.
- That's right.

610
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,470
- He ended the friendship alone.
- Haha, come on.

611
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,560
- My gosh.
- I didn't know he was a jerk.

612
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,530
I was fooled by him too.

613
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,830
- You should be comforting me.
- Calm down.

614
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,750
- I didn't know. I'm a victim too.
- How can you call yourself human?

615
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,070
- I'm a victim too.
- How can you call yourself human?

616
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,840
You're supposed to be comforting me.

617
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,180
- I was just speechless.
- Haha does that.

618
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,490
- I was dumbfounded.
- Jae Suk.

619
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,840
- That's a good point.
- It's true.

620
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,780
- I know.
- That's a good point.

621
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,050
- It's fun to have a video chat.
- Yes, it's really fun.

622
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,930
But you always leave So Min out
during a video chat.

623
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,500
- We should open a new group chat.
- Why would you do that?

624
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,550
- Let her join the chat.
- But that's...

625
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,030
She always calls me
after a video chat with you guys.

626
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:31,700
"I just had a video chat with them.
I was left out again."

627
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,330
- That's not true.
- She sounded quite upset.

628
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,130
So Min is always the last person
left on the screen.

629
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,010
- Stop...
- Everyone else leaves,

630
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,480
and So Min's face is left alone
on the screen.

631
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,220
Then she leaves with a long face.

632
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,680
- She's always the last person left.
- True.

633
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,340
- Hey, So Min.
- She's left alone in the end.

634
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,840
That's why I told you,

635
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,850
"Why don't you leave the chat room
if no one talks to you?"

636
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,690
But it's so fun. I love it.

637
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,190
- You open a chat room next time.
- Right.

638
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,960
You can invite us all this evening.
We'll join the chat.

639
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,760
- I'm not available this evening.
- Why?

640
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,560
- I have to look after my kids.
- Okay.

641
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,270
- I'm busy.
- I should go to the gym.

642
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,590
- Okay. Let's do it next week.
- Next week, it is.

643
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,970
- Let's do it next week.
- Next week, it is.

644
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,510
It's been decided.
We'll do it next week.

645
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,770
- Not today.
- Why?

646
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,800
- They can't make it today.
- Right.

647
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,870
We'll do it next week.

648
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,300
- There is another question.
- What is it?

649
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,980
- Well...
- You answered only one question?

650
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,370
- My answer is...
- What's your answer?

651
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,490
- On social media...
- You're not on social media.

652
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,380
- I don't have a secret account.
- No secret social media account.

653
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,920
It'd be okay if you started
just one account.

654
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,120
- Well, it's not...
- Just to visit others' accounts.

655
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,890
- Shall I? All right.
- You can see how others are doing.

656
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,320
- I understand.
- So we can talk about it next week.

657
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't have a secret account
or use a messenger app.

658
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,060
- Okay.
- Will you keep it that way?

659
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,790
- I'm not planning to do it for now.
- Okay.

660
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,210
- All right.
- Here goes the next question.

661
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,010
- It's a question for Ji-rasoni.
- Me?

662
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,210
"You're everyone's target
in almost every episode."

663
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,250
"Tell me how you keep your mind
stronger than titanium."

664
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,490
(ID: Yoo Jin Ho, Mr. Ji-rasoni,
how do you keep your mind strong?)

665
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,960
- I'm curious about that too.
- He's a superhero.

666
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,850
- "Stronger than titanium."
- He's stronger than titanium.

667
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,820
He keeps his mind strong.

668
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,500
- "Stronger than titanium."
- To be honest, I don't know...

669
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,550
- what makes people think that way.
- He has healing power.

670
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,530
- Many people ask me that question.
- I see.

671
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,670
It's not just my fans.
Even my friends said,

672
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,240
"Don't you feel offended?
Teach them a lesson."

673
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,470
- Some said things like that.
- Your friends said that?

674
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,130
- Yes, my friends said that.
- It must be Kim Yong Man.

675
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,530
- Yong Man...
- "That made me upset."

676
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,070
- and Soo Yong.
- Oh, I see.

677
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,220
- No, they're not TV celebrities.
- Are they non-celebrities?

678
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,640
- "Hey, when they're rude to you..."
- Suk Jin.

679
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,810
Invite them to the set sometime.

680
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,810
- Invite your friends here.
- Right. Invite them here.

681
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,850
His non-celebrity friends.

682
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,760
They would be sweating buckets
while watching us.

683
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,030
They'd say,
"They're disrespectful to you."

684
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,820
- "How could they be so rude?"
- Really?

685
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,970
Then I tell them it's not like that.

686
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,530
- Some people don't understand.
- That's right.

687
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,030
And I understand
what they're worried about.

688
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,560
- But we just joke around.
- That's right.

689
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,290
- I have my role to play.
- Absolutely.

690
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,130
- When you joke around with me,
- Of course.

691
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,710
- my role on the show stands out.
- Exactly.

692
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,410
That's what I believe.
I often tell you in the restroom.

693
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,680
- Tell me what?
- "You can go further."

694
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,250
- Right. Yes, you do.
- I often tell him that.

695
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,840
- Yes. We're different in real life.
- Yes. That's why...

696
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,880
it's not so hard for me
to stay mentally strong.

697
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,250
- We shouldn't do that off-camera.
- Of course.

698
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,260
- Exactly.
- We would never do that.

699
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,520
- We'd never be rude to him.
- I would gather you all up.

700
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,660
- Right.
- Absolutely.

701
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,820
- I would. But I wonder...
- Yes?

702
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,820
if you guys would come to see me
as I say?

703
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,730
- Of course, we would.
- I don't think you would.

704
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,230
- Let's say I'm upset at you guys.
- Of course, we would.

705
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,700
- Se Chan.
- Yes, Suk Jin.

706
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,000
- I'm really upset.
- I see.

707
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,470
- You guys crossed the line today.
- I understand.

708
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,740
- Tell everyone to gather tonight.
- Right.

709
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,940
Tonight doesn't work for me.
I have plans. I'm sorry.

710
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,480
Really? Then would next week
work for you?

711
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,280
I have a shoot next week.
I'll let you know.

712
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,570
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

713
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:31,420
- I'll see you then.
- Okay.

714
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,580
- Okay.
- Of course.

715
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,580
I don't think you'd gather.

716
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,990
But still, there must be times
when you lose your temper...

717
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,220
- during a shoot.
- Right.

718
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,190
- I'm sure it happens.
- It happens once in a while.

719
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,960
- Just once in a while.
- Like when?

720
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,160
- I don't remember.
- Okay.

721
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,030
- When I hit you with a foam bat...
- He wouldn't have been upset.

722
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,820
- When So Min hit me,
- Yes.

723
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,560
If I expressed how upset it made me
as a percentage,

724
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,410
- it was zero percent.
- It didn't make you upset at all?

725
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,470
- Really?
- I wasn't upset at all.

726
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,630
It's because you didn't hit me
because you wanted to hurt me.

727
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,010
Right?

728
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,540
You didn't hit me
because you wanted to hurt me.

729
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,310
(Feeling guilty)

730
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,750
- Did she want to hit me? A little?
- Just a little bit.

731
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,810
- I get it. This must be his secret.
- Just a little bit?

732
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,460
This is how he stays
mentally strong.

733
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,730
- I see that now.
- She wanted to hit me?

734
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,550
- A little. She's a human after all.
- You could see that?

735
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,590
- A little bit?
- Of course.

736
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,850
- He keeps fooling himself...
- I didn't know that.

737
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,270
- like that.
- It's because you're cheeky.

738
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,790
I see. Because I'm cheeky?

739
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,790
- I see.
- He keeps calm.

740
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,830
- He maintains his cool.
- Exactly.

741
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,470
- I wasn't upset at all.
- But you were upset...

742
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,600
About what?

743
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,070
- when we selected the president.
- Oh, right.

744
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,870
- He got a little upset then.
- You mean, the captain?

745
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,600
- Yes, the captain.
- He sulked.

746
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,520
(While voting to choose the captain
that no one wanted to become...)

747
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,220
(Everyone voted for Suk Jin.)

748
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,990
(I'm too busy for this.)

749
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,230
(I have shoots all week.)

750
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:54,200
(Suk Jin was genuinely upset
as he was going to get all votes.)

751
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,290
"I have a shoot in the morning."

752
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,800
(And then they began the voting.)

753
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:04,240
(Although it was edited out,
Suk Jin got almost all the votes.)

754
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,410
(Why am I always the one
who is chosen for things like this?)

755
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,110
(Suk Jin thought it was unfair
that they always chose Suk Jin.)

756
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,370
(Then let's vote again.
We won't discuss it this time.)

757
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:14,380
(They decided to vote again,
so the 1st voting was edited out.)

758
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,190
(As a result of the re-vote...)

759
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,490
(Suk Jin won again.)

760
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,660
We should toss him.

761
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:26,890
(Sae Ho used all the ballots he had
to vote for Suk Jin again.)

762
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,440
(Glaring)

763
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,710
(This is why Sae Ho was
on pins and needles after the vote.)

764
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,370
(But Captain Ji accepted it shortly
and served out his term happily.)

765
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,910
- I got upset, which was edited out.
- He was upset.

766
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,040
I was genuinely upset.

767
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,140
- I know.
- Exactly.

768
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,680
- I was upset then.
- You said nothing made you upset.

769
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,190
- That part was edited out.
- You said nothing made you upset.

770
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,580
- Was he really upset?
- What made me upset was...

771
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,280
that it seemed that you guys chose
me for things like that every time.

772
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,690
- That's why I got upset.
- You're still upset.

773
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,690
- I was upset then.
- Of course.

774
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,050
But you said nothing made you upset.

775
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,200
- Exactly.
- Come on.

776
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,160
Everyone gets upset
from time to time.

777
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,090
- You're upset right now.
- I'm a human.

778
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,320
(Everyone gets upset
from time to time. I'm a human.)

779
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,170
(He ended up losing his temper.)

780
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,500
- I'm a living thing that can think.
- I mean...

781
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,330
Then you shouldn't have said
you'd never get upset.

782
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,910
- Calm down.
- It's not like that.

783
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,410
- You were like this. "It was..."
- You shouldn't have said...

784
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,570
"zero percent."

785
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,680
- It wasn't upset at her.
- You said you wouldn't get upset.

786
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,980
- But I lost my temper then.
- I see.

787
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,780
- It hurt your feelings.
- That's right.

788
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,380
"Whenever we do things like this,
it's always me, Kwang Soo,"

789
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,660
- "him, or her."
- You should never have said it.

790
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,430
- That's right.
- You shouldn't have promised it.

791
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,760
- Gosh. Why you little...
- I never say anything like that.

792
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,120
(Making a fist)

793
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
- He's upset again.
- He's upset.

794
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,290
What are you going to do next?

795
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,560
- What do you mean?
- What's your next move?

796
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,030
- To him? What do you mean?
- Yes.

797
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,770
- Was that it?
- You made a fist.

798
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,170
- What's next?
- Right. And then what will you do?

799
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,060
- What will you do next?
- I'll get along well with him.

800
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,060
(I'll get along well with him.)

801
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,270
I'll get along well with him.

802
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,180
- Because we're just joking around.
- That's right.

803
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,340
- Absolutely.
- We're just joking around.

804
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,570
- Each of us is...
- That was good.

805
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,780
- As Suk Jin said, we're humans.
- That's right.

806
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,020
- Yes. I lose my temper sometimes.
- It happens.

807
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,880
When the viewers watch the show,

808
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,550
some of them might think
it's too mean.

809
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,780
- That's understandable.
- But...

810
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,430
- We all love one another.
- Of course.

811
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,760
- We respect one another. Yes.
- We trust one another.

812
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,700
Also, each of us has
a different role to play...

813
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,170
- in a certain situation.
- That's right.

814
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,130
- Yes. I'm fine with it.
- We hope you understand us.

815
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,770
- So Min, you pick one this time.
- How about the yellow one?

816
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,570
- Pick the blue one.
- The green one.

817
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,630
- The green one.
- I pick the light green one.

818
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,680
Pop the light green one
since you dressed as Yondu.

819
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,300
So Min, don't throw it.
Just poke it.

820
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,070
I can't believe she struck
a cute pose for doing that.

821
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,070
(I can't believe she struck
a cute pose for doing that.)

822
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,310
You saw that too.

823
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,690
- I must say, So Min is...
- She's amazing.

824
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,690
- She's amazing.
- She's incredible.

825
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,020
- Indeed.
- So Min is...

826
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,930
- a talented entertainer.
- I agree.

827
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,080
- She's perfect for variety shows.
- She's a jewel.

828
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,390
- She's a jewel in the showbiz.
- She's cut out for this.

829
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,500
"Se Chan, when you won
the Top Excellence Award last year,"

830
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,430
"you cried,
and that broke my heart."

831
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,500
"I'm curious about the mindset
you have on set these days."

832
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,860
(ID: Lc42, I'm curious about
the mindset you have on set.)

833
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,560
- Every week... It's funny...
- That's a hard question.

834
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,100
(The mindset he has on set
every week...)

835
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,980
- It's funny...
- It's a difficult question.

836
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,140
- It's difficult.
- You can just...

837
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,780
- tell him how you honestly feel.
- Give him an honest answer.

838
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,110
- Be honest.
- Right. Be honest.

839
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:59,070
From my first day on the show
until now,

840
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,020
I haven't been at ease
on the day before the shoot.

841
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,690
- I see.
- It's still the same now.

842
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,780
- Even now?
- And...

843
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,690
Last night, I couldn't fall asleep,

844
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,090
thinking, "Is the role I play
on the show the best I can do?"

845
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,170
- Of course, it is.
- I always...

846
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,030
- think hard...
- We were told to dress nicely.

847
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,910
But you dressed like that
to look funny, right?

848
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,560
- No, that's not it.
- With that logic,

849
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,740
- you look funnier than him.
- That's not what I'm saying, Haha.

850
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,630
- I tried to...
- You look really funny.

851
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:28,250
I tried my best to dress in a way
that would suit the concept.

852
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,110
- I tried several outfits yesterday.
- Right.

853
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,580
I didn't just pick
a nice outfit I had.

854
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,080
I tried to choose fashion items
that could make you guys...

855
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,380
- Of course.
- want to comment on them.

856
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,280
- Really?
- I always think hard before I come.

857
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,280
- I understand.
- Actually, So Min and Se Chan...

858
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,500
- joined Running Man 5 years ago.
- It's been 5 years.

859
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,700
Oh, my. It's been five years.

860
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,060
When Se Chan and So Min
joined the team,

861
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,290
- it wasn't easy for them.
- Of course.

862
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,510
Especially because the other members
had been doing this for many years.

863
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,530
- That's right.
- It must've been hard.

864
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:58,210
- It's really hard to get settled.
- Indeed.

865
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,280
- Of course.
- It's hard.

866
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,280
- It's really hard.
- You see...

867
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,680
If I had to tell you
about the hardest time...

868
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,040
I felt as if I had done nothing...

869
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,380
on a weekend variety show.

870
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,190
I didn't look funny
even when I watched it on TV.

871
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,960
But when we finished the shoot,
you guys told me, "Good job."

872
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,120
On my way back home, I felt...

873
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,230
- so stressed out.
- He must've been under pressure.

874
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,770
- Of course, you felt burdened.
- I wasn't sure if I'd done well.

875
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,790
I went through a really hard time
emotionally.

876
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,790
- Really?
- Yes.

877
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,590
We said you had done well
because you had done well.

878
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,600
- And above all...
- That's right.

879
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,410
- It means, "You should do better."
- For you to settle in...

880
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,740
(It means, "You should do better.")

881
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,210
- Suk Jin just said quietly...
- Yes.

882
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,570
- We meant that he had done well.
- Yes.

883
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,280
- He said, "You should do better."
- But he wanted him to do better.

884
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,990
- My gosh.
- It was to motivate him...

885
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,990
- to do better as well.
- I'll do better.

886
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,420
- I didn't mean it that way.
- Not me.

887
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,160
- I meant it as a compliment.
- Me too.

888
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,850
You wanted him to do better too.
Be honest with me.

889
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,160
- No, I didn't.
- Be honest with me.

890
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,590
- I'm being honest.
- Hey.

891
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,890
- Be honest.
- I didn't mean it that way.

892
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,960
- I never meant it that way.
- Suk Jin.

893
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,430
- You know what I mean.
- This is the 600th episode.

894
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,590
- It's not like that. Se Chan.
- Did you really mean it like that?

895
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,590
- I didn't.
- I'm serious.

896
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,390
- I never thought that way.
- When he was struggling...

897
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,860
Hey, why are you all over the couch,
you punk?

898
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,940
(Hey, why are you
all over the couch, you punk?)

899
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,780
(Why are you all over the couch?)

900
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,870
"Why are you all over the couch?"

901
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,540
Come on, Suk Jin. What was that?

902
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,980
- Sit up straight.
- I mean, this is our 600th episode.

903
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,780
- Choose your words carefully.
- Why do you always yell at me?

904
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,180
- Gosh, seriously.
- You meant to quit because of me.

905
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,080
I'm shocked that he meant,
"You should do better than this."

906
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,580
I thought he might be discouraged.
It was like, "You can do better."

907
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,160
- "You did well."
- No.

908
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,580
- That's not what you meant.
- "You should do better than this."

909
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,690
You meant it that way too.

910
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,700
- No, I didn't.
- Just admit it so we can move on.

911
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,700
- You put pressure on him.
- You see, I...

912
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,770
- You know I always say...
- "You should do better than this."

913
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,860
- Yes.
- I realized something...

914
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,330
- since I've done many shows...
- That's what showbiz is like.

915
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,830
- with a group of people as a team.
- Right.

916
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,100
- Some people need more time.
- Of course.

917
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,600
And I'm that type of person.

918
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,210
It took me nine years to establish
myself as an entertainer.

919
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,480
- You'd been unknown for so long.
- So...

920
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,300
- That's right.
- When you're unsure about yourself,

921
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,780
your colleagues' cheerful words
keep you going,

922
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,020
- and help you get used to it.
- True.

923
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,280
You become relaxed over time,
and the time comes...

924
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,760
- for you to perform at your best.
- Absolutely.

925
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,690
And you don't know
how long it could take.

926
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,990
- That's true.
- You see,

927
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,960
people had high expectations of him
since he was a comedian,

928
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,760
he was afraid he might not live up
to the expectations just as he said,

929
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,200
- and he needed time to overcome it.
- That's right.

930
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,170
In the beginning,
Se Chan got a lot of criticism.

931
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:07,300
"Who is he? How can he be paid
for doing that?"

932
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,830
- The viewers left harsh comments.
- Hey.

933
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,070
(Who is he?)

934
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,140
(How can he be paid for doing that?)

935
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,920
(What?)

936
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:20,310
- Hold on a second.
- Jae Suk.

937
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,190
- Hold on a second.
- Jae Suk.

938
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,380
(Rolling)

939
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,930
- Jae Suk, I'm leaving.
- I can't believe him.

940
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,850
- What was that?
- Jae Suk.

941
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,390
- Calm down.
- How much do I owe you?

942
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,930
I'll give you back the money.
How much?

943
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,270
- Okay.
- I'll pay it and leave.

944
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,530
Jae Suk, I'll pay it and leave.

945
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,060
- How could you hurt his feelings?
- I'll give them back the money.

946
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,300
- Hang on.
- What did you just say?

947
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,280
- That was so mean.
- Hey, what was that?

948
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,300
- You've crossed the line.
- I...

949
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,280
- I'm sorry.
- How could he say such a thing?

950
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,210
- I'm sorry.
- Gosh, seriously.

951
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,680
- I'll give them back the money.
- It's okay.

952
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,870
- I'll give them back the money.
- Let it go.

953
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,420
- Jae Suk, I'll give it back.
- I'm sorry.

954
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,840
- That was so mean.
- I'll give them back the money.

955
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,050
- You've crossed the line.
- Let's all sit down.

956
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,020
- This is our 600th episode.
- Sit down.

957
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,230
- Hey.
- Sit down.

958
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,190
- Anyway...
- "How can he be paid?"

959
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,390
(My head hurts.)

960
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,230
- All right.
- Let me wrap it up.

961
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,890
- Go ahead.
- There was nothing behind me.

962
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,200
- Ji Hyo, why didn't you tell me?
- Jae Suk, I grabbed you,

963
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,170
- but you fell anyway.
- There was nothing behind me.

964
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,670
Anyway, I think you should give back
the amount for two years, right?

965
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:18,910
No, I think it should be the amount
for three and a half years.

966
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,280
If so, I would have to give back
the amount for seven years.

967
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,780
What I was trying to say was...

968
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,840
There's more? Aren't you done?

969
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,310
- In the end, as we all expected,
- Yes.

970
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,020
- That's right.
- Se Chan did an excellent job.

971
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,260
- He's doing great even now.
- It just took him some time.

972
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,960
You know, Se Chan...

973
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,390
blended into the team so well,
and he's doing great now.

974
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,160
The same goes for So Min.
What are you doing?

975
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,890
I'm going to pop another balloon.

976
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,000
(I'm going to pop another balloon.)

977
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,060
He's not finished yet.

978
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,200
- Goodness.
- We should let Se Chan finish it.

979
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,940
I'd like to applaud
the cast members...

980
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,710
for helping the two of them
blend into the team.

981
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,630
- It's because... To be honest,
- That's random.

982
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,480
- in the showbiz,
- Yes.

983
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,040
a lot of people act mean
toward a new member.

984
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,750
- You were the worst.
- You were the worst.

985
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,980
You were the meanest of all.

986
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,990
You're the worst, Suk Jin.

987
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,780
- When I said hello to him,
- He was the worst, right?

988
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,760
he said hi halfheartedly
without even looking at me.

989
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,490
- "Okay."
- I mean, seriously...

990
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,960
- People might think that's true.
- At least we had each other.

991
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,430
- We could rely on each other.
- I relied on So Min greatly.

992
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,230
- If it hadn't been for him...
- It would've been harder.

993
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,500
- Indeed.
- That's why...

994
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,560
I want to say something.
It's the same for you, Suk Jin.

995
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,440
- Right. I had a hard time too.
- When he just joined the show,

996
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,800
people said, "Fire him
from the show. What's his problem?"

997
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,940
(When he first joined the show,
people said he should be fired.)

998
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,630
- He went extreme again.
- Calm down.

999
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,980
- Please sit down.
- What's wrong with him?

1000
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,780
- I don't know. Please sit.
- I have no idea.

1001
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,920
- "How can he get paid for that?"
- There must be more.

1002
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,380
- You're the first one to hear that.
- Let go.

1003
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,990
- I'm the first member to hear that.
- "He should leave the show."

1004
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,380
- "He should leave the show."
- And...

1005
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,420
- "Give your juniors a chance."
- Exactly.

1006
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,850
But Suk Jin overcame it
and pulled it off in the end.

1007
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,850
That's right. It doesn't work
without Suk Jin now.

1008
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,500
- Right. We can't do it without him.
- Exactly.

1009
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,670
- We can't even talk to one another.
- The same goes for everyone.

1010
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,390
Right. It's so nice
to have an honest conversation.

1011
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,330
- We should do this once in a while.
- Of course.

1012
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,800
That's why we were all happy...

1013
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,530
- when he won the award.
- It made me want to cry.

1014
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,910
- We applauded so excitedly.
- We were so excited for him.

1015
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,870
We're celebrating our 600th episode.

1016
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,140
- It's been 12 years.
- It's been 12 years.

1017
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,280
- This is crazy.
- But it's not that our show...

1018
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,640
has always been getting
so much attention...

1019
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,020
- for the past 12 years.
- It's hard to believe.

1020
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,190
- That's right.
- Yes.

1021
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,380
- They joined us during a hard time.
- Indeed.

1022
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,490
- They went through a lot.
- Indeed.

1023
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,390
- Let's thank our youngest members.
- Right.

1024
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,120
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1025
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,600
- Thank you. I love you.
- I love you.

1026
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,930
- I love you all.
- We're grateful to you two.

1027
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,160
Start crying now.

1028
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,160
I might start crying.

1029
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,870
- I teared up a little.
- Right?

1030
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,310
- I feel like crying.
- We owe it all to you two.

1031
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,560
- Ji Hyo will pop another balloon.
- Me?

1032
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,580
- Good.
- Okay.

1033
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,470
We needed to have
a conversation like this.

1034
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,010
- I wish we were having a drink.
- We're all being so honest.

1035
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,280
- You see...
- You want a drink?

1036
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,240
- Let's do that tonight.
- So Min.

1037
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,910
- We're shooting a show.
- Right.

1038
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,640
- We can have a deeper conversation.
- Right.

1039
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,180
"Have you ever gone easy on someone
during a game?"

1040
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,180
- Go easy on someone?
- What?

1041
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,490
- Well...
- Of course.

1042
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,220
- Of course.
- To be honest, yes.

1043
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,830
- I have.
- In a game.

1044
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,700
I'm sure people have cut me
a lot of slack.

1045
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,870
I doubt I was ever the one giving.

1046
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,030
- The same goes for me as well.
- Me too.

1047
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,700
We all went easy on others
at some point.

1048
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,790
I'm sure it's the same for everyone.

1049
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,930
Going easy on someone
might not sound fair.

1050
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,600
It's more like giving them time.

1051
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,580
- It's more like this.
- We give them time.

1052
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,310
We know someone's a spy,

1053
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,850
but revealing it too early
would only kill the show.

1054
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,540
- That has been the case for me.
- Of course.

1055
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,410
But no one orders us to do so.

1056
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,080
- It's an unspoken rule.
- That's right.

1057
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,620
- To make a better show.
- But...

1058
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,290
Jong Kook never cuts anyone slack.

1059
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,060
(Glaring)

1060
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,830
This is him going easy on us.

1061
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,060
"I know who it is. It's Jae Suk."

1062
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,620
- He...
- Hold on a second.

1063
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,490
Couldn't you tell
that I was being generous?

1064
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,700
During lunch.

1065
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,970
(Episode 597: During lunch,
the Mafia had to be arrested.)

1066
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,640
(Mafia)

1067
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,280
(Okay, I got it.)

1068
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:42,780
(Rather than cutting Jae Suk slack,
he kept cornering him.)

1069
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,180
(After saying that...)

1070
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Enjoy your meal.

1071
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,620
- The Mafia is in this team.
- Which team?

1072
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,180
- This one. The red team.
- Why?

1073
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,450
- Just enjoy your lunch.
- Why us?

1074
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,560
(After suffocating the Mafia,)

1075
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,120
(he claims that he cut
Jae Suk some slack.)

1076
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,720
- But...
- He let it slide for a few rounds.

1077
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,600
Couldn't you tell
that I was being generous?

1078
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,890
- You told us to enjoy our meal.
- Exactly.

1079
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,760
I told you two to enjoy your meal.

1080
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,160
- This is cutting us slack?
- "Don't say anything to them."

1081
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,600
- "Don't pressure them."
- This is him cutting us slack?

1082
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,660
- "Enjoy your meal."
- "Don't bother guessing."

1083
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,700
- I mean...
- But...

1084
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,040
- It's stressing me out.
- "Dig in, guys."

1085
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,140
- That's cutting us slack?
- Of course.

1086
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,640
- The stress.
- You have no idea.

1087
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,370
- Did I keep on deducting?
- Unbelievable.

1088
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,100
There's something you can do
when you're chosen to play the spy.

1089
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,540
- What is it?
- Team up with Jong Kook.

1090
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,220
- Once he believes someone...
- Yes, that's true.

1091
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,540
He never doubts someone he trusts.

1092
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,040
- You're spot on.
- That's a weakness of his.

1093
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,560
He protects that person.

1094
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,060
- Right.
- That's right.

1095
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,790
That's something I easily fall for.

1096
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,620
I tried playing him like that
a few times...

1097
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,160
and ended up in the doghouse
for about a month.

1098
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,430
(Things were awkward between us
for a month.)

1099
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,470
"You...
How could you of all people..."

1100
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,870
- I remember.
- Our business wasn't doing well.

1101
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:39,200
You know how it was like
during the early days.

1102
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,010
- I...
- Ji Hyo, go ahead.

1103
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,430
- Right, I remember.
- At first,

1104
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,930
I was in his inner circle,

1105
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,810
but we fought because of it.

1106
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,040
- For real?
- No.

1107
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,450
- No, but it upset him.
- Do you remember...

1108
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,080
the one with Hades?

1109
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,240
Yes, the chairs.

1110
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,910
(Episode 463.
They received the same mission.)

1111
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:02,850
(They played games thinking
they were on the same side.)

1112
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:06,030
(Jong Kook betrayed her.)

1113
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:09,700
(Jong Kook turned out to be
a double agent.)

1114
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,870
(Ji Hyo was deceived
by Jong Kook...)

1115
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,430
(and the betrayal hit Ji Hyo hard.)

1116
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,140
I didn't think of it
as a huge betrayal.

1117
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,810
Besides, we do
what we're told to do.

1118
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,080
That's not all.

1119
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,040
During the next game,

1120
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,740
I told him a lie
saying I couldn't trust him...

1121
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,120
and that set him off.

1122
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,950
It's because you kept saying it.

1123
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,450
You kept saying
that you couldn't trust me.

1124
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:34,620
I only said that
because I couldn't trust you.

1125
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,930
Is this another pepper incident?

1126
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,530
- I mean...
- Hold on.

1127
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,620
- That's not it.
- The pepper couple.

1128
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,970
They're so spicy! The pepper couple!

1129
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,370
- Pepper!
- Whatever.

1130
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,870
- They're so spicy as always!
- Fine. I'm the one to blame.

1131
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,430
I'll apologize, okay?

1132
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,830
It's why I said I'd buy you
a big TV if you get married.

1133
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,470
- Suk Jin, just stay put.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1134
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,410
Get one yourself if you can.

1135
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,010
Are you done talking?

1136
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,450
- What?
- Why are you asking?

1137
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,720
There's something I still remember.

1138
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,290
Do you remember
the Sherlock Holmes episode?

1139
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,290
Yes, of course.

1140
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,740
During the Sherlock Holmes episode,

1141
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,890
I remember...

1142
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:04,950
- Is this any good?
- It is.

1143
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,010
Yes, of course.

1144
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,330
(Quietly)

1145
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,620
- Is this any good?
- It is.

1146
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,620
I'd like one, then.

1147
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,330
Thanks.

1148
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,200
Try one.

1149
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,330
- Suk Jin, I'm all ears.
- This one's better.

1150
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,040
I'm all ears, so go ahead.

1151
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,370
- I'm laughing, aren't I?
- Suk Jin...

1152
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,910
Just know that I'm slightly annoyed.

1153
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,470
(Just know that
I'm slightly annoyed.)

1154
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,640
Sometimes, I laugh excessively.

1155
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,280
That's when I'm annoyed.

1156
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,040
- Suk Jin, I'm all ears.
- Have you had a bite?

1157
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,740
Forget it.
I'm not in the mood anymore.

1158
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,910
- Go ahead.
- No, it's not funny anymore.

1159
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,950
Dig in.

1160
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,120
- Just tell us.
- Go on.

1161
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,260
- The Sherlock Holmes episode.
- The Sherlock Holmes episode.

1162
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,990
Tell us about
the Sherlock Holmes episode.

1163
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,720
- Go ahead.
- No, eat in peace.

1164
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,430
Can you speak up
when you're told to do so?

1165
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,100
You're not the only one
who wants to talk.

1166
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,290
I'm at about 20 percent.

1167
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,530
- Are you slightly annoyed?
- Yes.

1168
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,890
Anyway,
during the Sherlock Holmes episode,

1169
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,040
I badly wanted the mission
to be a success.

1170
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,200
- You know the feeling, right?
- We were on a ferry.

1171
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,700
- You know how it is.
- Of course we do.

1172
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,870
I was this close
to completing my mission...

1173
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,100
- when Jong Kook came running.
- That's right.

1174
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,510
He found my name
written in one of the books.

1175
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,140
When he was about
to eliminate me, I said this.

1176
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,240
It was probably edited out,
but I said...

1177
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,080
"Jong Kook, can't you let me
complete my mission today?"

1178
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,760
(Jong Kook, can't you let me
complete my mission today?)

1179
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,060
- That's what I said.
- Did you?

1180
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,720
- In the most desperate tone.
- I see.

1181
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,120
Do you remember that?
I bet you don't.

1182
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,390
Were you trying to be funny?

1183
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,790
No, I wasn't joking at all.

1184
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,490
I desperately wanted to succeed.
You get that feeling sometimes.

1185
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,260
Jong Kook was like, "Really?"

1186
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,200
I thought he was going
to let me win,

1187
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,330
but he removed my name tag.

1188
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,700
(He immediately removed
Suk Jin's name tag.)

1189
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,930
- After saying, "Really?"...
- How professional of him.

1190
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,100
(Episode 79)

1191
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:36,140
(Jong Kook confronted Suk Jin
when he was close to succeeding.)

1192
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,740
(He must've asked Jong Kook
to let him win right about now.)

1193
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,240
(Removed)

1194
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,220
(Jong Kook showed no mercy though.)

1195
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,680
(Seok Sam was eliminated
after begging for mercy.)

1196
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,390
It's hard for the camera
to capture such nuances.

1197
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,030
- That's right.
- Anyway, that's what happened.

1198
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,330
I was serious
when I asked him to let me win.

1199
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,490
There's actually something
I'd like to say.

1200
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,640
It's about the Name Tag Elimination.

1201
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,910
- Because it gets physical...
- Exactly.

1202
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,930
- You can't help but get emotional.
- I know.

1203
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,410
- Don't you agree?
- Of course.

1204
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,680
Yes, it gets emotional.

1205
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,470
It's a physically challenging game.

1206
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,600
It doesn't show on camera, but...

1207
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,180
I don't mean that
there were any altercations,

1208
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,220
but it can get upsetting at times.

1209
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,350
- It's like this.
- It's like ssireum in a way.

1210
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,910
You'd be surprised
by how physical it gets.

1211
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,910
It's why we had to stay fit...

1212
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,660
during the early episodes.

1213
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,760
We've mentioned this often,

1214
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,350
but the show's in its 12th year.

1215
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,370
The reason...

1216
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:30,240
we don't play Name Tag Elimination
isn't because we've aged.

1217
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,430
The game entailed
a lot of injuries too.

1218
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,830
- Right.
- Yes, many got injured.

1219
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,040
For over a decade, we have played...

1220
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,080
- so many variations of the game.
- Exactly.

1221
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,470
The staff is trying...

1222
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,910
to come up with something new,
but it's easier said than done.

1223
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:44,540
It's hard to come up
with a new variation of it.

1224
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,010
So...

1225
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,310
I don't know
if the viewers will see this,

1226
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,790
but the staff came up
with a variation once...

1227
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:55,450
because many viewers commented
that they wanted to see it.

1228
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,990
- It resulted in a drop in ratings.
- Right.

1229
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,290
Although you asked for it,

1230
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,700
- you didn't watch it.
- They didn't.

1231
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,990
- Exactly.
- You asked, but that was it.

1232
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,260
It's like my YouTube channel.

1233
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,790
My subscribers
don't want to watch my videos.

1234
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,640
It's the same.

1235
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,870
Weird, isn't it?

1236
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,510
I'm not saying
we're done with Name Tag Elimination,

1237
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,080
but I'd like to point out...

1238
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,240
that not playing the game
has nothing to do with our age.

1239
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,740
- And...
- That's not the case.

1240
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,540
- No, it's not.
- It's not an age thing.

1241
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,990
- Of course not.
- To be honest,

1242
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,680
we can still compete
with young K-pop idol singers.

1243
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,120
- Of course.
- Right?

1244
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,220
In our spin-off series,
I don't get eliminated...

1245
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,220
even when two of them
come at me. Why?

1246
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,450
Because I'm the boss.

1247
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,850
They can't remove my name tag.

1248
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,030
(Bald kid with superpowers)

1249
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,970
- I'm not kidding.
- Haha's strong, you know.

1250
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,490
- I've grabbed him before and...
- I'm like a beast.

1251
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:37,890
- Yes, you're strong.
- We know how to play the game.

1252
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:38,970
I'll give you that.

1253
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,930
Could Haha have gone easy
on Jong Kook for 12 years?

1254
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:44,310
- I have a bone to pick with you.
- What is it?

1255
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:47,240
Whenever she plays a spy,
she stays in character...

1256
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,680
- off-camera.
- That's right.

1257
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,310
She does.

1258
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,540
- And that...
- Didn't you...

1259
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,850
The betrayal hit me hard.

1260
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,510
What other choice do I have...

1261
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,390
when I need to fool someone
who has been at this for ten years?

1262
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,490
That's the only way.

1263
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,760
I was upset over
what she did as well.

1264
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,060
- It was part of her strategy.
- She hit her chest saying...

1265
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,830
- "It really isn't me!"
- Yes, that!

1266
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,220
- With tears brimming.
- Right.

1267
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,930
I tell her I get it...

1268
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:11,390
and write someone else's name down
only to see her do this.

1269
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,740
(Smirking)

1270
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,240
And she does this
to the crane camera.

1271
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,260
And from behind, we're like...

1272
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:19,010
(The betrayal!)

1273
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,140
And then she tells me...

1274
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,870
to be a professional about it.

1275
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,950
- Just you wait and see.
- Exactly.

1276
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,850
You have no idea how...

1277
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,740
Guess who I learned it from?

1278
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,350
It's horrible to play the spy.

1279
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,660
The spy...

1280
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,010
- The spy...
- It's my least favorite role.

1281
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,220
- Exactly.
- Me too.

1282
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,620
- You're playing the main role.
- It's bothersome.

1283
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,430
- But the pressure...
- This is what troubles us...

1284
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,850
when we have to play spies.

1285
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,030
- The other members...
- We can tell.

1286
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,430
They easily catch
the subtle behavioral differences.

1287
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,390
- So playing the spy...
- We can easily tell.

1288
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,240
That makes it hard for us
to play a spy.

1289
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,600
- Se Chan, choose a balloon.
- I've already done it.

1290
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,010
- Then Suk Jin.
- I'll...

1291
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,240
(It's the oldest brother's turn.)

1292
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,740
- What about a yellow one?
- A yellow one?

1293
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,370
- Get closer to it.
- It can be any one of them.

1294
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,970
Why else were we given a dart?

1295
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:58,810
- You need to pick the paper up.
- Get over there.

1296
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,290
(He hits 2 with 1 dart.)

1297
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,220
(He kills the mood by
popping two balloons.)

1298
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,450
What's the matter with you?

1299
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,760
I called dibs on the one behind it.

1300
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,080
It's all because
you were bothersome.

1301
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,290
Unbelievable.

1302
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,620
I get to choose, don't I?

1303
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,220
- I mean...
- The viewers...

1304
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:14,030
shouldn't chide us
for being too harsh on Suk Jin.

1305
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,390
Try playing a game
with him sometime.

1306
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,490
Learn it firsthand.

1307
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:18,760
You need to experience it.

1308
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,410
- It's a breath of fresh air.
- Get a taste of Suk Jin.

1309
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,660
- Get a taste of Suk Jin.
- You don't get to see...

1310
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,510
what he does to kill the mood.

1311
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,180
- Aren't I awesome?
- It's why parents...

1312
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,580
- caned their children.
- See it for yourself.

1313
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,780
He kills the mood?

1314
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,180
Yes, he kills the mood.

1315
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,910
"What names are the other's
numbers saved under?"

1316
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:37,410
- Gosh.
- In my case,

1317
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:39,010
Se Chan's number
is under Yangsebari.

1318
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,220
Me too. Yangsebari.

1319
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,890
- In my case...
- Ssaebssaeb for me.

1320
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,390
- What about you?
- Yang Sechani.

1321
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,620
For me, it's Yang Se Chan.

1322
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,830
- Yang Se Chan?
- That's cold.

1323
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,200
(Just Yang Se Chan)

1324
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,290
- Yang Se Chan?
- That's cold.

1325
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:50,060
- That's cold.
- It's Yang Sechani for me.

1326
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,600
- Me too.
- Yang Se Chan.

1327
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:54,010
- Jeon So Min.
- That's cold.

1328
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,640
- Kook Jong for Jong Kook.
- Kim Jong Kook...

1329
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,200
- Trainer Kook.
- The younger.

1330
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,910
- The younger?
- For me, it's...

1331
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,600
Is there a Kim Jong Kook
who's older than you?

1332
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,100
Yes, and I get confused at times.

1333
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,910
Yoo Jae Suk for Jae Suk.

1334
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,080
Song Ji Hyo and Haha.

1335
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,290
Unbelievable.

1336
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:08,680
How is this not business for him?

1337
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,010
There are no words of affection.

1338
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,950
That is what's written
on our name tags.

1339
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,010
You're right!

1340
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,390
But...

1341
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,620
In Jong Kook's case...

1342
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,760
You're the worst.

1343
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,700
Apart from
"The younger Kim Jong Kook,"

1344
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,870
- it's just your names.
- For those who I'm close to,

1345
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,220
I always stick to nicknames.

1346
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,160
- It's Ho Sae Carlos for Sae Ho.
- Carlos?

1347
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,740
Jeonsobari,

1348
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,310
Kook Jong,

1349
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,830
Zoned-out Ji Hyo, and Heehee.

1350
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,830
Heehee...

1351
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,080
He keeps calling me Heehee.

1352
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,080
What about me?

1353
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,640
Yangsebari for Se Chan.

1354
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,410
The feeble Ji Seok Sam.

1355
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,620
That's too long.

1356
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,780
(The feeble Ji Seok Sam)

1357
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,140
- No wonder you called me that.
- Right.

1358
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,350
- The feeble Ji Seok Sam.
- The feeble Ji Seok Sam.

1359
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:44,560
"Bixby, call
the feeble Ji Seok Sam."

1360
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,790
"All right. I'll connect you to
the feeble Ji Seok Sam."

1361
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,080
I saved you with that name for that.

1362
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,430
- How did you save us on your phone?
- I saved them a long time ago.

1363
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:54,220
I saved Haha as Haha.

1364
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,870
I saved Ji Hyo, Jae Suk,

1365
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,830
and Suk Jin with their names.

1366
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:00,160
As for Jong Kook,
I saved him as Romantic Punch.

1367
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,260
- I must save him with that.
- I understand.

1368
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,600
Why did you name him that?

1369
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,200
I bet you remember.

1370
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,850
- We made nicknames for each other.
- Right, I do.

1371
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:10,950
I thought Romantic Punch...

1372
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,970
- made Jong Kook sound really cool.
- It does sound cool.

1373
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,080
- So I...
- They neutralize each other.

1374
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,040
- So I saved him as Romantic Punch.
- I see. Romantic Punch.

1375
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,580
- I like that.
- Right? Romantic Punch.

1376
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,310
- How did you save us, Ji Hyo?
- Right. I'm curious.

1377
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,330
- I'm curious to know.
- I'm curious too.

1378
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:21,660
I saved Se Chan by Yang Sechani.

1379
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,890
Big Brother Suk Jin,

1380
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,330
Ms. Jeon So Min,

1381
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:26,890
- Miss?
- Ms. Jeon So Min?

1382
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,600
- That's understandable.
- That sounds distant.

1383
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,970
- Ms. Jeon So Min.
- What else?

1384
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,100
Brother Kim Jong Kook.

1385
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,810
Big Brother Jae Suk
and Big Brother Haha.

1386
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:38,180
Why did you save everyone else
as Big Brother except Jong Kook?

1387
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,930
- You're right.
- You saved me as Brother Jong Kook.

1388
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,350
- That's funny.
- You even included his surname.

1389
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:43,850
Did I save you
as Big Brother as well?

1390
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:46,040
- I bet you did.
- No, I bet it's just Brother.

1391
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,950
They mean the same thing.

1392
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,790
I'll save him as Brother Pepper.

1393
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,290
(Brother Pepper)

1394
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,560
- That sounds good.
- Brother Pepper.

1395
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,580
They're so spicy!

1396
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,080
- The pepper couple!
- Pepper!

1397
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,580
Just save me as Brother Pepper.

1398
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,620
Brother Pepper sounds good.

1399
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,830
- What about you, So Bal?
- I save Haha as Prince Haha.

1400
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:02,220
- My goodness. Why is that?
- Why did you save him as Prince?

1401
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,160
- I saved Ji Hyo as Jeoktoma.
- Jeoktoma?

1402
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,890
- Jeoktoma? That sounds about right.
- I recently changed yours.

1403
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:07,560
- To what?
- It was Big Brother Yoo Jae Suk,

1404
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,740
but I changed it
to Big Brother Yoo Frivolous.

1405
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,870
Big Brother Yoo Frivolous?

1406
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:11,640
- I like it.
- It sounds off.

1407
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,510
- And I save him as Brother X.
- What about me?

1408
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:14,540
- Brother X?
- Why Brother X though?

1409
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,640
- It suits him.
- Because he has that image.

1410
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,870
- He's a mysterious friend.
- I do have that vibe.

1411
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:20,310
- He's reliable, that's why.
- I had that vibe in school.

1412
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,950
As for Suk Jin, I saved him
as Whatever Seok Sam.

1413
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,660
- Whatever Seok Sam?
- I saved him as Whatever Seok Sam.

1414
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,950
(Whatever Seok Sam)

1415
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,530
- It suits him.
- Whatever Seok Sam.

1416
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,330
- Whatever Seok Sam.
- He's Ssaebssaeb.

1417
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,450
- Whatever Seok Sam is hilarious.
- Whatever Seok Sam.

1418
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:33,100
- Whatever Seok Sam is...
- Whatever Seok Sam!

1419
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,720
- You recently changed the name.
- I did.

1420
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,140
It sounds like a menu.
Three Whatever Seok Sam, please.

1421
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,660
Here are three Whatever Seok Sam.

1422
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,640
Three Whatever Seok Sam Combo,
please.

1423
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,970
What did you save us as, Jong Kook?

1424
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,430
For Haha, it's Ha Donghooni.

1425
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,600
Yang Sechani,

1426
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,010
- Jeon Somini.
- Jeon Somini?

1427
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,370
- Ji Seokjini?
- Ji Seokjini?

1428
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:50,370
(You saved me as Ji Seokjini?)

1429
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,040
- Jeon Somini.
- Jeon Somini?

1430
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,290
(He just saved Suk Jin by his name
when he's older?)

1431
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:55,490
Ji Seokjini.

1432
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,850
- Tell me.
- He saved Jae Suk as Yoo Jaeseoki.

1433
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,760
- No.
- "Genie."

1434
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,160
- I saved him as Brother Suk Jin.
- Brother Suk Jin.

1435
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,060
As for Jae Suk...

1436
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,390
- It's not "Younger Bro", is it?
- No, it's not.

1437
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:09,930
- I saved him as Jae Seuk.
- Oh, Jae Seuk?

1438
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:11,040
- What about her?
- What about Ji Hyo?

1439
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,200
- She's saved as Zoned-out.
- Zoned-out?

1440
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,490
- That's it?
- Just Zoned-out?

1441
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:14,510
- It's just 1 word?
- It's just 1 word?

1442
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:16,330
- Isn't there more?
- Like what?

1443
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,410
Lovely...

1444
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:18,600
Isn't there more?

1445
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,510
(The romance fan teases Jong Kook
with his life at stake.)

1446
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,780
- A heart after Zoned-out?
- Like what?

1447
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,240
- Yes, a heart after Zoned-out.
- Gosh, I'm dying to say it.

1448
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,040
My Heart Will Be Bruised
If I Don't See You.

1449
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,140
(My Heart Will Be Bruised
If I Don't See You)

1450
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,490
My Heart Will Be Bruised
If I Don't See You.

1451
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,220
(It looks like he's willing
to risk his life today as well.)

1452
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:33,490
That's...

1453
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:35,560
(It's the last question.)

1454
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,580
This is so fun.

1455
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,760
"Now that Running Man
is at its 600th episode,"

1456
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,600
"how would you like
the show to go on?"

1457
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,700
It's a difficult question.

1458
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,990
I couldn't even imagine that we'd
make it to the 600th episode.

1459
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,430
- We couldn't.
- I never thought it'd be possible.

1460
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,410
- I couldn't imagine it either.
- I actually saw the end of it too.

1461
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,780
Many talked about the show
getting canceled in our first year.

1462
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,910
We must mention this.

1463
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:55,680
The YouTube clips of our show
started garnering popularity.

1464
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,640
- A collection of funny moments.
- The memes.

1465
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,040
- That's when it became popular?
- The memes.

1466
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,080
I don't know who edited
all our clips,

1467
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,290
but we should meet them
and show our gratitude.

1468
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:07,620
- They were really witty.
- They only collected funny scenes.

1469
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,930
- Right.
- The viewers went,

1470
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:10,490
"Seeing a collection of it,
Running Man seems pretty fun."

1471
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:12,850
They said it was hilarious.
And we got to see their reactions too.

1472
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:16,470
We learned
what the viewers found most fun.

1473
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,930
- We applied those in our shows.
- It gave us directions.

1474
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,510
It did give us directions.

1475
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:23,200
I like that we try new approaches.

1476
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,080
But I wish we could show
the mature chemistry...

1477
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:29,370
that a show with 600 episodes
and 10 years of experience can.

1478
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:32,280
I wish our show looks less set up.

1479
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,410
It could be even rougher.

1480
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,540
And the viewers could think,

1481
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,580
"They can say such things
because it's Running Man."

1482
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,010
"It's only possible
because it's Running Man."

1483
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:40,390
I mentioned this
during the meetings,

1484
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:43,430
but I think all the content we make
is original.

1485
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:45,030
I don't think we must do missions...

1486
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,490
- or have twists.
- Whatever we do?

1487
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,120
And that there should be spies.

1488
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,870
We could open a business if we want.

1489
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,470
Then it'd be the same
as the other show.

1490
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:53,910
Are you talking about
"Unexpected Business?"

1491
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,010
- No, it's not that.
- Then you should meet up...

1492
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:57,040
with Producer Na Yeong Seok.

1493
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,870
You want to be
on "Grandpas over Flowers?"

1494
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,700
I told you that whatever we do
will be original.

1495
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,740
You want to be
on "Grandpas over Flowers?"

1496
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,410
Actually, I want to make a complaint
to the "Infinite Challenge" team.

1497
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,040
- So suddenly?
- I suddenly had that thought.

1498
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,010
- It's canceled.
- The old "Infinite Challenge?"

1499
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,910
I'm sorry if this might offend
the fans of "Infinite Challenge."

1500
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:13,680
The show
lasted over a decade, right?

1501
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,890
- It did.
- They tried different challenges...

1502
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,450
- every week.
- We did all sorts of things.

1503
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:18,950
They did all they could on a show.

1504
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,430
In a way, Running Man...

1505
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:22,830
- is suffering because of them.
- I'm sorry,

1506
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,390
but you said everything we do
will be original.

1507
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:25,640
This is why I brought it up.

1508
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,160
So instead of coming up
with new content... I mean we could,

1509
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,910
but with "Infinite Challenge"...

1510
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:32,080
You want to copy their ideas?

1511
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,640
You want to copy their ideas?

1512
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,850
You want to steal their ideas?

1513
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,910
You're saying we only need
to change the names, right?

1514
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:38,950
So in conclusion...

1515
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,010
You want to copy them?

1516
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,490
In other words,
he wants to plagiarize them.

1517
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,120
Please take back your words.

1518
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,260
- He wants to copy them!
- Please take back your words.

1519
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,120
You mean you want to
plagiarize them.

1520
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,850
I'll take back my words
and put them back in here.

1521
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,220
How did he get dragged into this?

1522
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:51,600
He said he wanted to copy them.

1523
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,790
But "Infinite Challenge"...
To be honest,

1524
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,870
you guys did everything
so there's nothing new to try.

1525
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:58,640
- I'm sure there's more.
- That's not true.

1526
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,140
We could change it up a little
and use their ideas.

1527
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,280
What do you think, Ji Hyo?

1528
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,200
Our show's been going on
for 12 years, right?

1529
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:10,740
If you think about it,
we've done everything we could.

1530
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,810
Are you saying
we should quit the show?

1531
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,680
I thought
that's what she was saying.

1532
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,810
She suddenly went,

1533
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,720
- "We've been working for 12 years."
- "We've done everything we could."

1534
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,680
"Maybe it's for the best
if we stop here."

1535
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,160
If you think about it,
we've done everything.

1536
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,160
So the production crew...

1537
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,200
- must suffer a lot...
- I agree.

1538
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,620
in their meetings every week.

1539
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,890
- Of course.
- They're really amazing.

1540
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:33,060
- Our production crew.
- That's what I often think.

1541
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,810
If we were to come up
with new items,

1542
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,470
I can't think of any.

1543
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,350
So the production crew...

1544
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,350
- She's saying...
- Just say you're out of ideas.

1545
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:45,010
- She just beat around the bush...
- She beat around the bush.

1546
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:47,290
to say that she can't
think of any new ideas.

1547
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:49,010
- But I have pride in our show.
- Seriously...

1548
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:50,790
- It's a game variety show...
- That's right.

1549
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:52,810
It's the only one in Korea.

1550
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:55,120
I agree with what Haha said.

1551
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,950
We must continue
the game variety show...

1552
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:00,100
- That's our pride.
- and make opportunities for others.

1553
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,490
It's not that we're only
maintaining our places.

1554
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:04,160
I'm sure our show
can expand the horizon...

1555
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,060
and more variety show stars
should be born...

1556
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,140
so that the world of variety shows
can grow.

1557
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,080
That must be why a game variety show
must continue.

1558
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,280
We'll work hard
to make every episode...

1559
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,370
with our production crew
with that mindset.

1560
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:24,760
Part One ended with sincere
answers from the members.

1561
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,120
- It's already over?
- Yes.

1562
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,830
- Yes.
- So you've secured 6,000 dollars.

1563
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:31,160
(They secured 6,000 dollars
for donation.)

1564
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,560
Of course we should.

1565
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:36,060
It's time to pick the winner
of Part One.

1566
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,430
Actually, it must be hard to pick
the winner...

1567
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:38,830
since everyone was sincere.

1568
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,240
But you must pick
the best member among yourselves.

1569
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,930
- Who should I pick?
- It's so hard to pick one.

1570
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:44,700
We did prepare ballots.

1571
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,970
Let's just spin a roulette.
This is meaningless.

1572
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,640
Why don't you just
spin a roulette for us?

1573
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,310
- Everyone answered sincerely.
- That's right.

1574
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:51,580
Then play rock-paper-scissors
and decide.

1575
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,640
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1576
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,350
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- But Suk Jin wasn't sincere.

1577
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:56,410
That's true.
Suk Jin wasn't sincere.

1578
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:58,160
I was sincere!
What's wrong with you?

1579
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,160
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
Suk Jin, you should join too.

1580
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,490
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

1581
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:03,560
- Come on.
- The three of them won.

1582
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,830
Rock-paper-scissors

1583
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,430
- Rock-paper-scissors
- All right!

1584
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,490
(Seok Sam wins.)

1585
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:09,620
What was that?

1586
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:11,760
He was the most...

1587
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,160
Right.

1588
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,040
The favorite of Part One
is Suk Jin.

1589
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,580
(The favorite to win Part 1
is Suk Jin.)

1590
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,640
It's time to pick
the candidate to receive a penalty.

1591
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,140
It could be a hard decision,
but the staff members...

1592
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,310
will stick the face of the member
on a panel and show it.

1593
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,640
- What if the favorite to win...
- They could get the penalty.

1594
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,790
It doesn't matter. They can overlap.

1595
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:31,310
- That could happen.
- That could happen.

1596
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:32,390
That could happen.

1597
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:33,890
Everyone, please stick their faces.

1598
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:37,290
(The vote begins.)

1599
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:39,790
- Everyone is like...
- Let's see.

1600
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:41,930
They're all looking for Suk Jin's face.

1601
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,100
They're all working hard to find it.

1602
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,990
They're all like,
"Which one is Suk Jin's?"

1603
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,790
"Where is Suk Jin's face?"

1604
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,240
You're all looking
for Suk Jin's face.

1605
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,830
You're all looking for him.

1606
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:52,910
- They're all looking for him.
- Don't say such things.

1607
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:54,180
They're like,
"Where is Suk Jin's face?"

1608
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,870
- They're all looking for him.
- Why would you say such things?

1609
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:57,310
- "Where is Suk Jin's face?"
- They all love Suk Jin so much.

1610
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:59,120
- Why would you say that?
- They were all like...

1611
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,350
- "Where is Suk Jin's face?"
- We're just saying things...

1612
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:01,540
that we heard.

1613
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,080
- It's hilarious.
- It'd be funny.

1614
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,660
They all agreed to pick honestly.

1615
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,680
Of course.

1616
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,580
- Please be honest.
- Show us who you picked.

1617
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,790
In 1, 2, 3.

1618
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:12,990
It's Suk Jin.

1619
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,830
(They all picked Suk Jin.)

1620
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,060
(Suk Jin's face is everywhere.)

1621
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,430
It's Suk Jin!

1622
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:18,990
- It's an overwhelming result.
- So many of you picked me.

1623
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:20,200
They all picked Suk Jin.

1624
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:21,810
Are you all here
to create his fan club?

1625
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,200
- I know.
- I guess I'm...

1626
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,310
- So many picked Suk Jin.
- It looks like many of them...

1627
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:25,430
picked me.

1628
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,780
Suk Jin is the winner
and loser of Part One.

1629
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,950
Thank you!

1630
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,370
- You can take it all!
- I'm truly grateful.

1631
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:32,350
It's like having his wish come true.

1632
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:33,850
He's taking all the airtime
for the 600th episode.

1633
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:35,410
- He's the hottest one here.
- He's a greedy one.

1634
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:37,140
- He's so popular.
- I'm jealous though.

1635
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,660
- He's greedy.
- It's time for Part Two.

1636
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,430
Let's gather again
after getting changed.

1637
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:42,760
- Okay!
- Okay!

1638
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,030
(Now it's time to enjoy Part 2,
which will be more exciting.)

1639
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:49,120
(Running Man)

1640
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:50,620
Gosh, this is nice.

1641
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,540
There's a panel.

1642
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,990
- What is it?
- You're right.

1643
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,310
- What could it be?
- Why...

1644
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,310
- Why are you wearing hanbok?
- Why am I the only one in hanbok?

1645
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,430
Why is she wearing hanbok alone?

1646
00:53:58,430 --> 00:53:59,510
I have no idea!

1647
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:01,540
- They suddenly told me to wear it!
- Is it a mission or what?

1648
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,410
- It's not New Year's.
- You're a spy, aren't you?

1649
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,040
- You're a spy.
- No, I'm not!

1650
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,450
Why is So Min wearing hanbok?

1651
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:09,010
I went inside to change,
but they told me to wear this.

1652
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:11,890
There's a reason
why she's wearing hanbok.

1653
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:15,060
I told you earlier that this episode
would be joined by the viewers.

1654
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,220
They not only left comments...

1655
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,490
but also gave us outstanding ideas.

1656
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,530
Ideas?

1657
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,660
We picked the one that was
most recommended.

1658
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,540
We thought it'd be nice
to give it a try.

1659
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,060
- Is that so?
- We screen-captured the comment.

1660
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,060
- What is it?
- Is that so?

1661
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,310
Let's see.

1662
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,410
What could it be?

1663
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:36,680
(The idea from a viewer
that was most recommended)

1664
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,110
"I want to see the members..."

1665
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,280
"acting differently
from the usual image they have."

1666
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,490
"Jae Suk
who brags about his wealth,"

1667
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,430
- "Se Chan who goes to SNU,"
- Gosh.

1668
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:45,930
- "super popular Ji Hyo,"
- "Super popular Ji Hyo."

1669
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:47,550
"a paper-doll-like Jong Kook,"

1670
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,720
"So Min with courtesy in hanbok,"

1671
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,930
"Suk Jin who is interested
in the members,"

1672
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:54,030
"and Haha who loves
Running Man the most."

1673
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:56,630
- I do love Running Man the most!
- "And Haha..."

1674
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:00,530
(Haha who loves Running Man
the most is brought back.)

1675
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,630
They want us to act differently
from the usual image we have!

1676
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,570
Username yuws!
How could you say that?

1677
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:07,450
- You're quite witty.
- This is...

1678
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:09,570
- I love this show the most!
- This is really difficult.

1679
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:11,220
Jae Suk who brags about his wealth?

1680
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,590
Jae Suk who brags about his wealth.

1681
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:13,680
- The number of likes...
- I like it.

1682
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,920
It received 8,800 likes
when we screen-captured that.

1683
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:18,050
"Se Chan who goes to SNU?"

1684
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,820
- SNU? That's impossible.
- This is incredible.

1685
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,030
Let me give you
an additional explanation.

1686
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:23,700
You'll be carrying out
the missions in Part Two...

1687
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,530
with the theme that was
assigned to each one of you.

1688
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:29,300
As for Jae Suk,
you can just show off your wealth.

1689
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,740
- Okay.
- It doesn't sound easy.

1690
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:31,840
As for Ji Hyo,

1691
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,400
you're the most popular member
and the leader of this group.

1692
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:38,200
- You're the most popular one here.
- The brightest one.

1693
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,800
- You have to lead everything.
- You need to talk a lot too.

1694
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,450
- You need to act silly too.
- Something like, "Quiet, everyone."

1695
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:43,240
- A super popular one.
- She'll be hosting the meeting.

1696
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,550
- That's right.
- Use trending expressions also.

1697
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,720
- You must appeal your hip side.
- "Let's get started."

1698
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,950
Let's get started. Bombastic!

1699
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:53,130
(Acting like a popular kid)

1700
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:54,930
- That's it.
- You need to say it faster.

1701
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:56,820
You must listen to what Ji Hyo says.

1702
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,700
- Skrr
- Respect!

1703
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,970
All right, now. Bombastic!

1704
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:02,340
- Hey.
- This isn't how it goes?

1705
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,570
It sounds like you're pressing us.

1706
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:06,030
- Don't say that.
- As for Se Chan,

1707
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,740
he's always scholarly,

1708
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,840
- and...
- You're telling him to keep quiet.

1709
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,650
he uses many big vocabs.

1710
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:11,950
You want me to use
four-letter idioms, right?

1711
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,300
This is the most difficult mission
for Se Chan.

1712
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,680
I have a question.

1713
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,880
They're telling me
that I have no courtesy, right?

1714
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,920
I'm not sure what they intended
to tell you.

1715
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,320
You can't speak in that tone.

1716
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,680
- Oh, okay.
- You can't speak in that tone.

1717
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,780
Bombastic.

1718
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,420
- She's a girl with courtesy.
- Bombastic.

1719
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,430
(Modest)

1720
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:26,380
Let's all work hard for this mission
as per the idiom, hyeongseoljigong.

1721
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,700
So in Part Two,

1722
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,700
you can increase the donation
to 10,000 dollars through missions.

1723
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:31,720
Is that so?

1724
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,260
You must remain in character
that you were given...

1725
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,800
while carrying out the missions,

1726
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,900
and you'll pick the best
and worst members afterward.

1727
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,360
That will decide the winner
and a member who'll get a penalty.

1728
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,570
Goodness,
you planned this really well.

1729
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:43,340
I bet "How Do You Play?"
couldn't even come up with such a theme.

1730
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,150
"How Do You Play?", you're just...

1731
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:47,150
Running Man is indeed the best.

1732
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:49,150
Running Man is way better
than "How Do You Play?"

1733
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:50,920
- Bombastic!
- Bombastic!

1734
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,650
- What does that even mean?
- What does it mean?

1735
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,820
- It's just an expression.
- The first mission...

1736
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:57,860
- Yes?
- is Captain Ji's cooking class...

1737
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,630
that the viewers wanted to see
the most.

1738
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:00,800
- Yes!
- Gosh.

1739
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,760
(Captain Ji's cooking class)

1740
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,220
(The reason they're holding
his cooking class for episode 600)

1741
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:11,200
(Captain Ji proposed to hold
a class and make cookies.)

1742
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,930
(But he was met with strong resistance,
so it was canceled.)

1743
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,450
(But he continued
to show his love for cookies.)

1744
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:18,680
(Why won't they hold the cooking class?
I want to see it.)

1745
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,680
(It's a shame that you didn't
show Captain Ji's cooking class.)

1746
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,950
(The viewers strongly supported
Suk Jin's cooking class.)

1747
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:28,420
(So the cooking class
was miraculously brought back.)

1748
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:30,590
- Hey.
- I love it.

1749
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:33,530
No! We shouldn't do it
for the sake of Running Man.

1750
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:36,860
Suk Jin's talent will show itself,
as per the idiom, nangjungjichu.

1751
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,070
- Just do it if they tell you to.
- I love it.

1752
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:40,930
- Don't push me.
- Don't you want to see it? Hey!

1753
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:42,340
Don't push me, Suk Jin.

1754
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,670
- Why you little punk...
- Don't push me.

1755
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,840
- Seriously...
- Why is he so violent?

1756
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,240
- Hey!
- Come on, Suk Jin.

1757
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,240
Stay out of this, will you?

1758
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,970
You might dislocate my shoulder
at this rate!

1759
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:54,050
(So Min gives a big bow
out of nowhere.)

1760
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:55,570
(She expresses her regret
with a big bow.)

1761
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:57,780
There you go. She's so polite.

1762
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,550
Your remark has a hidden meaning,
as per the idiom, unjungyugol.

1763
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,110
Is that how you use it?

1764
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,130
All right. You'll make 1,000 dollars
from making cookies.

1765
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:05,860
That means we'll just give you
1,000 dollars if you make cookies.

1766
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,220
- Mr. Producer?
- Yes?

1767
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,220
The 1,000 dollars...

1768
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,800
(Scoffing)

1769
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,220
- I don't know.
- Will you pay for it?

1770
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,130
- What about 1,000 dollars?
- I mean...

1771
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:15,340
Do we have to do this
just for 1,000 dollars?

1772
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:18,070
Must we watch
Suk Jin's cooking class?

1773
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:20,030
Can't you just pay them
to edit this out?

1774
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,800
- Gosh.
- Let's just have fun.

1775
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,200
- I do not want to attend it.
- Please spend your money.

1776
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,700
I think 20,000 dollars will do.

1777
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,450
Must we watch
Suk Jin's cooking class?

1778
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:29,510
- Do we have to?
- Everyone, gather up!

1779
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,950
Hey! Hold on!

1780
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,380
Se Chan is going to...

1781
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,220
spell the word, "cookie."

1782
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,320
All right!

1783
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,680
Cookie?

1784
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,550
- It's simple!
- Go ahead.

1785
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,030
Tell us the spelling
of "cookie" first.

1786
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:44,300
- It must begin with a C.
- That's right.

1787
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,820
- So it's C...
- C!

1788
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,030
- O!
- O!

1789
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:48,030
Oh, yes.

1790
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:49,760
- K!
- It's a K already?

1791
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,240
- That's not right!
- Okay, let's sit!

1792
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,630
Okay! He's so funny.

1793
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,030
- My gosh.
- You should be knowledgeable...

1794
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:57,950
- to make jokes.
- Guys, bombastic.

1795
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:00,200
I hate learning things the most.

1796
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,820
The viewers really wanted
to see the cooking class.

1797
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:04,280
Really? You wanted to see
my cooking class?

1798
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,840
Everyone, please wear your mask.

1799
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,420
Wear your mask
as you'll make cookies too.

1800
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,490
There's a bib too.

1801
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:11,950
Here's the thing about cookies.

1802
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:14,630
The reason I began making them...

1803
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:16,990
- Guys, bombastic!
- Don't tell us such things.

1804
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:18,720
Just shut your mouth
and teach us how to make it.

1805
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,030
- You want me to shut my mouth?
- It's like nakhwayusu!

1806
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:23,130
- Why would he mention his wife?
- I don't even know what it means.

1807
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:25,110
- How do I put this on?
- All right.

1808
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,570
How do I...

1809
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,340
He can't even put on an apron.
How will he teach us?

1810
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,700
- Jong Kook!
- Yes!

1811
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,400
Come here and put this on for me.

1812
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,840
- I'm supposed to be the weak one.
- How do I put this on?

1813
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,720
- That's right.
- Just put it on for me.

1814
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,840
- You want me to beat you?
- But I'm not a pushover.

1815
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,380
- How do I put this on?
- This?

1816
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,680
Put it on me. How do I do it?
Isn't it weird?

1817
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,320
- You should just...
- How do I put this on?

1818
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,700
- Is this how it's done?
- Give it to me.

1819
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:48,720
How do I...

1820
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,530
- That's it. That's how you do it.
- Like this?

1821
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:51,930
- Hey.
- Is this how you do it?

1822
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:53,430
- It's too much.
- I'm not sure.

1823
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:55,200
- Why you little...
- All right. How do I do it?

1824
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,430
- It's strange.
- How did you put yours on, Ji Hyo?

1825
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:59,570
You must square C
and subtract from it.

1826
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,510
- Square C and subtract from it.
- Square C and subtract from it?

1827
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:03,700
Then subtract its square root.

1828
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,740
- Subtract the square root of C.
- How do I put this on?

1829
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:06,800
Then you'll get the value of X.

1830
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,050
- Oh, the value of X?
- You need to subtract it.

1831
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:10,610
Since it's the square root
of B plus...

1832
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:11,920
So that's how it works.

1833
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,920
(The math genius' formula
was of great help.)

1834
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,610
Everyone, follow after me.
There's a scale in front of you, right?

1835
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,630
- Yes.
- Turn that on.

1836
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:19,130
- How do I turn it on?
- Put that on before turning it on.

1837
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:23,130
Make the weight into 0g
by putting the beaker on.

1838
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:26,130
Get the oatmeal powder. Guys!

1839
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,860
- Hey!
- Yes?

1840
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,970
- Add the oatmeal powder.
- When? Now?

1841
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:33,110
Yes, just add it now.
Just follow along.

1842
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,740
Press the on button.

1843
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,240
- Do I press it?
- Press it.

1844
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,450
- Also...
- Make it into 0g.

1845
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,680
What does he want us
to do with the oatmeal powder?

1846
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,650
Wait a minute. This isn't right.

1847
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:45,610
- This is hard.
- This is only 140g?

1848
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:46,740
That's 140g?

1849
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,420
- How big is this? It's 5kg.
- It is 140g.

1850
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,930
It is 140g.
It's filled up to the line.

1851
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:53,050
- How much do you want us to add?
- Add 140g of oatmeal powder.

1852
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,700
How come it's only this much?
It's strange.

1853
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,130
- Gosh, Suk Jin...
- Suk Jin, look what happened.

1854
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:57,760
This is my 140g.

1855
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,200
- What's going on?
- What?

1856
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,130
Only the beaker alone is over 100g.

1857
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,700
- No, it can't be.
- How do I do it?

1858
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:04,800
He doesn't know anything.

1859
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,470
What are we supposed to add to this?

1860
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,300
- The thing is...
- To this?

1861
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,130
- What do you want us to add?
- How troublesome.

1862
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:11,340
Are you all following?

1863
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,800
- No, not yet.
- No, I'm not following.

1864
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,450
(A dogmatic class that
no one can follow)

1865
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:18,490
Why are we shooting
a video for YouTube...

1866
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:20,110
when we haven't secured
enough airtime?

1867
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,220
Hey, this isn't for YouTube.

1868
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,220
What do we do now?

1869
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,650
- Mix it like this.
- Is this supposed to be granola?

1870
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:27,030
- Like this?
- Do it like this.

1871
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:28,820
You'll be surprised by what you see.

1872
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,930
(The students of a class making cookies
they'll be surprised to see)

1873
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:31,970
- You'll be surprised?
- Are you done?

1874
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:32,970
You'll be surprised by it.

1875
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:35,430
- You'll be surprised by its taste.
- We'll be surprised?

1876
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:37,630
Hey, it'll be incredible.

1877
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,240
I forgot to add sugar!

1878
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,670
- Sorry?
- Bo Pil.

1879
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:42,570
I'm telling you this
out of my love for Running Man.

1880
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:43,800
Let's just come up
with something new.

1881
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,900
(Let's just come up
with something new.)

1882
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,180
I can't stand it anymore!

1883
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,110
I can't let
Running Man go down like this!

1884
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,780
Quit this already.

1885
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:53,050
If you love Running Man,
quit the cooking class.

1886
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:55,490
All right. You should mix it.

1887
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:58,380
(They're done making cookies.)

1888
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,720
(We quickly edited out
the cooking class...)

1889
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,950
(out of love for Running Man.)

1890
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,930
We're playing a game.

1891
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,220
Is it human bowling?

1892
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,530
- I know.
- Do we have to jump...

1893
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:10,070
- and hit the pins?
- This is new.

1894
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:11,760
- Is it soft?
- It is.

1895
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,900
I'm not good at games like this.

1896
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,880
Everyone.
This is the 2nd mission of Part 2.

1897
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,970
Every member has to complete
the same mission.

1898
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,180
It's called
Comfort from Being Motionless.

1899
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,610
(Second mission,
Comfort from Being Motionless)

1900
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,840
You'll each give it a go.

1901
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,920
You'll land after you jump.

1902
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,050
You need to have more than
seven pins intact in total.

1903
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:33,780
- Seven pins?
- You'll get an extra 1,000 dollars...

1904
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:35,430
if you leave seven pins intact.

1905
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,630
If you fail,
you'll lose 1,000 dollars.

1906
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:40,430
- But it's hard.
- Do we get only one chance?

1907
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:42,340
Yes, you can go only one time.

1908
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,200
So each one of us
can knock down only one.

1909
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,630
- That's right.
- Is this even possible?

1910
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:47,070
Won't all of them be knocked down?

1911
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:48,880
- Would you like to practice?
- They'll all be knocked down.

1912
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,700
- We should land far.
- Let's practice.

1913
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,470
Comfort from Being Motionless.

1914
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,780
- So this is how it goes?
- This is how it goes.

1915
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,070
- But they all get knocked down.
- With both your feet and hands.

1916
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:59,450
- This isn't easy.
- You shouldn't make them fall.

1917
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:01,510
- Let's all practice.
- Let's give it a go.

1918
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:02,510
(It's time for Suk Jin's practice.)

1919
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:04,530
We should jump from there.

1920
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,930
No!

1921
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:07,030
(Falling)

1922
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:08,930
(They're all knocked down.)

1923
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:10,550
- That's just...
- Suk Jin.

1924
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:12,970
- You were meant to make them fall.
- That was...

1925
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:14,670
Give it a go.

1926
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:15,930
(Jong Kook goes next.)

1927
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,700
- My gosh.
- He made all of them fall.

1928
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,700
This isn't easy at all.

1929
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,700
(It's a difficult mission
for Jong Kook as well.)

1930
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,740
Here we go.

1931
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:25,840
Wouldn't it be better
to do it barefoot?

1932
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:28,280
- No.
- Hey, you punk!

1933
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,450
No, you can't do that.

1934
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:31,180
Hey, do you do this
on "How Do You Play?" as well?

1935
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:33,490
Do you have a death wish?

1936
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:35,380
- What did you say?
- Do you have a death wish?

1937
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,420
(Do you have a death wish?)

1938
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:39,180
Oh, right. I forgot.

1939
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,450
(He can't get used
to being a weakling.)

1940
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:42,990
So Min.

1941
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,030
- She is so polite.
- How is she so polite?

1942
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:46,700
- My goodness.
- She is incredible.

1943
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:47,970
She is so ladylike.

1944
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:49,860
Which family is that lady from?

1945
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:51,430
I feel like I am jumping
into the Insangsu Sea.

1946
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,570
Will you be able
to jump in that skirt?

1947
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:54,570
(Shim Chong who is jumping
into the Indangsu Sea)

1948
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:55,680
I guess it doesn't matter.

1949
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,400
- She is so polite.
- I guess it doesn't matter.

1950
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,300
My goodness.

1951
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:02,450
- All right.
- All right.

1952
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,220
I landed very lightly.

1953
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,820
- Se Chan, give it a go.
- I landed very lightly.

1954
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:09,260
He is strong
when his feet are on the ground.

1955
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,090
- Okay.
- You should have succeeded.

1956
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:15,400
- I got the hang of it.
- Don't land on one foot.

1957
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,150
- Land on two feet.
- That would be better.

1958
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,070
You need to land at the end.

1959
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:20,760
- Gently.
- You need to land gently.

1960
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:21,990
Put your hands on the mattress
after you land.

1961
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,530
Gently.

1962
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:28,570
(They finally succeed
in saving 3 bowling pins.)

1963
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:30,530
- He is good.
- That's how you do it.

1964
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:32,340
People who are good at this
should go first.

1965
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,180
- Let's do our best.
- Let's practice one time each.

1966
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:35,240
Let's give it a go.

1967
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,340
(Suk Jin practices
to keep the momentum going.)

1968
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,420
Gently.

1969
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,010
Not bad.

1970
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:44,650
- I saved one.
- All right.

1971
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,820
- I think we will succeed.
- We will be able to save seven.

1972
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,950
Boombastic, give it a go.

1973
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:49,130
Boombastic.

1974
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:51,530
She will do better.

1975
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:53,170
You...

1976
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,360
- Can't you jump?
- What was that?

1977
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,260
She is a popular member indeed.

1978
01:04:58,030 --> 01:04:59,170
- It seems like...
- That was an original method.

1979
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:00,970
she can't move her body
as she wants.

1980
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:02,380
It's better to land on two feet.

1981
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:03,680
I got the hang of it.

1982
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,150
So seven bowling pins in total
need to remain standing.

1983
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:07,700
There you go.

1984
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,680
(A clean success)

1985
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:12,720
- Grasshopper.
- There you go.

1986
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,110
That's how you do it.

1987
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,590
(Grasshopper got the hang of it.)

1988
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,720
- He is really good.
- He is good.

1989
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,820
- He is really good.
- You do this at home, right?

1990
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,630
- Just keep 1 standing.
- It's my 1st time.

1991
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,900
Just keep one standing?

1992
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:24,200
Let's do five.

1993
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:26,800
They asked us to do seven
since they underestimated us.

1994
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:28,300
- It's easier to do 5.
- Is it easier to do 5?

1995
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:30,260
- That's right.
- So it's harder to do more.

1996
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,030
- We need to keep them standing.
- This is confusing.

1997
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:34,430
- Say that you will do 10.
- Let's do 10.

1998
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:37,110
All right. Jae Suk should go first.

1999
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,700
Jae Suk is really good.

2000
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,340
- We need to save seven or more.
- Yes. Jae Suk, go ahead.

2001
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:42,740
- Let's do a cheer.
- Let's go.

2002
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:43,970
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2003
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:45,220
- Let's go.
- Ji Hyo, go first.

2004
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:46,680
- Give it a go.
- Here comes the popular member.

2005
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:48,150
- Boombastic.
- Boombastic.

2006
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:49,260
Skrr

2007
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:50,760
Skrr

2008
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,990
Gosh, I am scared. I am nervous.

2009
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,260
- Don't be scared.
- Land on two feet.

2010
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,300
Go.

2011
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,300
(Ji Hyo didn't succeed once
during practice.)

2012
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,430
You can jump over it.

2013
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,820
She failed.

2014
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:01,360
- What?
- That's it.

2015
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:02,990
She failed.

2016
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:04,400
- What?
- That's it.

2017
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:06,430
- All right. There you go, Ji Hyo.
- Three.

2018
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:07,970
(She succeeded in saving 3!)

2019
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:09,400
(Ji Hyo saved 3 from the start!)

2020
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,840
- Three.
- There you go, Ji Hyo.

2021
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,340
- She did well.
- Three.

2022
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:14,200
- Three. She saved many pins.
- Three.

2023
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,610
- You did well, Ji Hyo.
- You succeeded.

2024
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:17,470
- It will end soon.
- It will end soon.

2025
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,950
- Jae Suk, let's end it.
- Do it.

2026
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:21,920
There is no need to prolong it.
So Min.

2027
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,320
- So Min.
- So Min.

2028
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,760
- Will I be able to do it?
- You can even bow, So Min.

2029
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:25,930
- Really?
- Yes.

2030
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:27,990
- Don't be pressured.
- We are good at this.

2031
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:29,090
(The current number of pins)

2032
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:30,900
Land gently.
There you go. That's it.

2033
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,670
(She isn't very athletic.
Will she succeed this time?)

2034
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:36,490
Land gently.
There you go. That's it.

2035
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:37,930
Well done.

2036
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:39,130
- It wasn't easy to jump.
- Good.

2037
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:40,670
- Good job.
- Good job.

2038
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,130
It won't work
if you land on one foot.

2039
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,340
You saved three so far.

2040
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:45,070
Should I go next?

2041
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,150
Okay. Should I go next?

2042
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:47,900
He got this.

2043
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:49,840
He got this.

2044
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:52,280
All right.

2045
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,650
(He totally failed.)

2046
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,260
(Jong Kook failed in the end.)

2047
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:57,260
- He failed.
- I couldn't land gently.

2048
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:59,490
Jong Kook is definitely strong.

2049
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:01,530
- Suk Jin, let's finish it.
- Seok Sam.

2050
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,930
- Suk Jin, finish it.
- Okay. This is nothing.

2051
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:06,530
Will it end if Suk Jin saves five?

2052
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:07,700
It will end.

2053
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:09,430
Should I save five?

2054
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:11,800
I think he will succeed.

2055
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,700
(Suk Jin did pretty well
during practice.)

2056
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,610
(How will he do this time?)

2057
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:17,930
He landed too strongly.

2058
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:20,700
He succeeded.

2059
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:22,740
It's okay.

2060
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,740
- He succeeded.
- Two.

2061
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,420
- Did he succeed?
- He saved two pins.

2062
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:28,260
- Is it over?
- We need to save two more.

2063
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:29,880
- How many?
- Two more.

2064
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:31,180
We are in trouble.

2065
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,490
- We have Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk.

2066
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:33,860
- We have Jae Suk.
- Yes. Jae Suk will succeed.

2067
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:35,590
- All right.
- Gosh.

2068
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:38,490
- Two pins remain.
- You should finish it.

2069
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:40,320
I will have to try it
and see what happens.

2070
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,070
- You will succeed.
- You will succeed.

2071
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,090
- It won't be easy.
- I think you will succeed.

2072
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,110
- You will succeed.
- Do it with seriousness.

2073
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:47,300
(It has been a while
since he became an ace member.)

2074
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,400
Do it with seriousness.

2075
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,510
(Will he succeed and live up
to people's expectations?)

2076
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:53,700
Why did you do that?

2077
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:57,110
(Falling)

2078
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:58,110
- No way.
- For goodness' sake.

2079
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,380
You always tremble
when you receive the spotlight.

2080
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,680
- Why were you so nervous?
- Why did you do that?

2081
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,180
- What was that?
- You did well before.

2082
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:04,880
- You succeeded earlier.
- You did so well before.

2083
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,680
You always act like this
when you receive the spotlight.

2084
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,260
- You failed.
- Why were you so nervous?

2085
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:10,150
- Hey.
- I didn't say, "Here I go."

2086
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,700
Two remaining members
need to save three pins.

2087
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:14,030
Se Chan and Haha,
you need to succeed.

2088
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:15,530
- I will go.
- They can do it.

2089
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:17,360
Save one each.

2090
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,900
- Yes.
- This puts pressure on them.

2091
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:20,430
This puts pressure on them indeed.

2092
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:22,430
- Jump gently.
- Jump gently.

2093
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:24,340
- Jump gently.
- Gently.

2094
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,900
Jump like a frog.

2095
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,070
I think he will succeed.

2096
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,180
- Jump like a frog.
- I think he will succeed.

2097
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:32,550
Two pins?

2098
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:34,110
(Did he save 2 pins?)

2099
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,560
Two pins?

2100
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:37,810
- Gosh.
- One.

2101
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:38,930
(He saved 1 pin.)

2102
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,850
- Haha.
- What now?

2103
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,760
Haha needs to save two or more.

2104
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,300
- You need to save 2.
- Haha needs to save 2.

2105
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,670
- Do it out of love for the show.
- Love for Running Man.

2106
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:48,190
- Dream is watching.
- Hey.

2107
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,770
- Haha, save 2.
- Save 2.

2108
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:51,170
- Do it out of love for the show.
- Now is your moment.

2109
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,700
- Dream is watching.
- Two or more.

2110
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,670
You just need to save one or more.

2111
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:56,230
Okay. One or more.

2112
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,440
- One?
- Save one.

2113
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,940
- One or more.
- Let's go.

2114
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:00,850
- Show us your true love.
- That's right, Haha.

2115
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:01,940
Let's go.

2116
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:03,270
- True love for Running Man.
- Show us how much you love it.

2117
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:04,440
- That's right.
- Please.

2118
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,610
I love it the most.

2119
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,220
It's the most precious.

2120
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:09,390
Look at him. He is so serious.

2121
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:10,650
What are you saying?

2122
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,760
- He loves it the most.
- I love Running Man.

2123
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,980
(I love Running Man!)

2124
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:15,730
Give me a break.

2125
01:09:15,730 --> 01:09:18,730
(Will he be able to prove
his love for Running Man?)

2126
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:19,820
Gently.

2127
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:25,100
(He just needs to save one!)

2128
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:27,060
Gently.

2129
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:36,110
(It's a strike.)

2130
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:44,980
- That was so funny.
- Your love for the show...

2131
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,190
- crumbled.
- Hey.

2132
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:50,060
I thought you had succeeded,

2133
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,600
but the last one swayed and fell.

2134
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,270
- They fell like dominoes.
- It was so funny.

2135
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:55,360
It was so funny.

2136
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,530
- We were so close.
- All right.

2137
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:59,730
- You don't love the show.
- We were so close.

2138
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:01,360
- I love it.
- It was so funny.

2139
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,310
- It was like a cartoon.
- It was so funny.

2140
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:06,070
In any case, you failed.
It's time for the last mission.

2141
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:07,740
- It's too bad.
- Before we do that,

2142
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:10,020
please pick a member
who represents Running Man.

2143
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,140
- A representative?
- Yes.

2144
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,480
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk.

2145
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,110
- Why me?
- Just do it.

2146
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:16,480
- It's you.
- It's easier that way.

2147
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,480
Let's begin the next mission.

2148
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,520
- Okay.
- Okay.

2149
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,780
- The representative.
- What does the position involve?

2150
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:22,730
- It probably isn't a good thing.
- I agree.

2151
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,230
- That's why I picked Jae Suk.
- I know.

2152
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,770
What does the position involve?

2153
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:28,390
Do we need to play table tennis?

2154
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,190
- I love table tennis.
- Table tennis?

2155
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:31,300
I love table tennis.

2156
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:33,560
- Suk Jin, you are good.
- Of course.

2157
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,230
- The cookies are ready.
- Really?

2158
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:37,900
- Really?
- Let's eat cookies.

2159
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,310
- Will they be tasty?
- You made them.

2160
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:42,350
Taste them.

2161
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:44,140
Let's try them.

2162
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:47,350
Be honest and tell us
how the cookies taste.

2163
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:49,350
- This is mine. A person.
- They smell like...

2164
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:50,850
- fried chicken.
- Mine disappeared.

2165
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:53,430
- They smell like fried chicken.
- Mine disappeared.

2166
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:54,930
They are supposed to cool down.

2167
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:56,350
- Mine is crooked.
- Is this mine?

2168
01:10:56,730 --> 01:10:57,850
Let's eat.

2169
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,600
- Here.
- They are supposed to cool down.

2170
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,770
Why is it so bitter?

2171
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,470
It's hot.

2172
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:09,400
- What is this?
- What is this?

2173
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,070
(Everyone expresses the taste
with a grimace.)

2174
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:12,240
- The taste...
- Why is it bitter?

2175
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:15,140
Everyone, I understand how you feel.

2176
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:17,180
- I think it tastes a bit bad too.
- It tastes like...

2177
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,980
- burnt puffed rice.
- I think it's burnt.

2178
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:21,240
You said your mother-in-law
asked you where you bought it.

2179
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,760
She loves it.
But it needs to cool down first.

2180
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:25,560
- It's bad because it's hot.
- It tastes horrible.

2181
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,650
It tastes bad.

2182
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:30,100
- Who would eat this?
- It didn't come out well, but...

2183
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,300
- It's the smell.
- It's too bitter.

2184
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,520
I won't eat it.

2185
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,390
I am sorry. I will put them aside.

2186
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,270
- I am sorry.
- I want to eat more.

2187
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:38,400
I think these cookies are delicious.

2188
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,140
- You won't eat more, right?
- Seriously.

2189
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:41,680
- They taste incredible.
- You won't eat more, right?

2190
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,030
- They are healthy cookies.
- They taste bad.

2191
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,640
All right.

2192
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:47,380
Is it going to end like this?

2193
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:49,480
Is it going to end like this?

2194
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,240
- It's okay.
- I can't believe it.

2195
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:52,690
I know you secretly think
that they are tasty.

2196
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:55,890
All right. With this mission,

2197
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:58,280
you can win 2,000 dollars
for donation.

2198
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,630
- Okay.
- That's great.

2199
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:01,150
- It's the last mission.
- Okay.

2200
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,350
The representative,
Jae Suk is the key to this mission.

2201
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:06,430
It's Fly Like a Butterfly
and Sting Like a Bee.

2202
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:07,490
(Fly Like a Butterfly
and Sting Like a Bee)

2203
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:08,670
Hit a ping pong ball...

2204
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:11,470
and blow out the candle
that is at the end of the table.

2205
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,010
- It will be hard.
- How am I supposed to do that?

2206
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:15,730
- He gets multiple tries, right?
- It will be hard.

2207
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:18,230
You will have enough time
to practice.

2208
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,350
Say "Here I go" before you begin.

2209
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:23,610
The number of ping pong balls
Jae Suk will receive...

2210
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:25,440
- depends on other members.
- Why?

2211
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:28,110
Other members
will stand on the stage...

2212
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:31,260
and hit the ball once each
in a relay.

2213
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,060
The number of times they succeed
will be the number of balls.

2214
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:34,430
You need to hit the ball
in succession.

2215
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:35,760
Where?

2216
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,850
The stage.

2217
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:38,230
This isn't the stage.

2218
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:39,600
- That's the stage.
- We will each hold a racket...

2219
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,690
- and go, "1, 2, 3."
- Jae Suk.

2220
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:41,840
- Yes.
- I got it.

2221
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,670
- Not like that.
- Jae Suk, hit this.

2222
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,810
- This is the last mission.
- Hit this.

2223
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:47,200
- Here is the thing.
- Hit the hand.

2224
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,380
- Hit this.
- This is the last mission.

2225
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:49,900
- Here is the thing.
- Hit the hand.

2226
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:51,510
You did it.

2227
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:53,010
- Here is the thing.
- Hit the hand.

2228
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:54,200
(Bullseye)

2229
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,720
You did it. That's how you do it.

2230
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,770
Do it again.

2231
01:12:57,610 --> 01:12:59,690
It will be amazing
if you succeed right away.

2232
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,350
No. It was too strong.

2233
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:02,980
(The candle appears.)

2234
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:05,390
- That's the height.
- It will be too hard.

2235
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:06,850
Send the ball here.

2236
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:08,490
You did it. You will succeed.

2237
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,100
Send the ball here.

2238
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:11,490
You did it. You will succeed.

2239
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:12,560
(He hits the target at once.)

2240
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,060
It counts if you hit the candle
and have it go out.

2241
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:15,360
Shake it.

2242
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:22,770
(He begins to practice
with the lit-up candle.)

2243
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,690
Gosh.

2244
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:35,980
This is too hard.

2245
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:37,780
Six.

2246
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,950
(It's the master level
of difficulty.)

2247
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:42,630
Gosh.

2248
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:44,100
This is too hard.

2249
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:46,990
(He keeps missing.)

2250
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:48,190
Send the ball here.

2251
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,470
(Suk Jin comes to help.)

2252
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:51,360
All right.

2253
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,010
(Faltering)

2254
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,070
The flame will go out
if the ball brushes past it.

2255
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,680
- I think Jae Suk is nervous.
- Hit it lightly.

2256
01:13:58,680 --> 01:13:59,850
Broaden the range.

2257
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,640
There you go. Hit it like that.

2258
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,110
- I don't think it will work.
- It will be hard.

2259
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:05,590
- The candle is too small.
- Keep trying.

2260
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:08,420
(The ping pong ball keeps going
to different places.)

2261
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:09,610
- Jae Suk.
- It isn't working.

2262
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,890
It's okay. You will find the aim.

2263
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:14,450
There you go. Find the aim that way.

2264
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,800
(Despite dozens of practice rounds,
he hasn't put out the candle once.)

2265
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,860
Wait.

2266
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,440
I feel like I am training
with my coach before the Olympics.

2267
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:29,570
Come on. You can do it.

2268
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,180
You can do it, Jae Suk.
Send the ball here.

2269
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,180
(It's like a training center.)

2270
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,350
Here.

2271
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:38,070
That was too hard.

2272
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:40,480
- Hold on.
- That was too high.

2273
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:42,780
Imagine hitting my face.

2274
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:45,760
(Coach Ji has
a unique training method.)

2275
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,260
(Ouch!)

2276
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:48,950
Suk Jin, it's working.

2277
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:52,170
Imagine hitting my nose.

2278
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,600
(The ball brushed
against the flame.)

2279
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,560
There you go.

2280
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:00,230
There you go. You are getting there.

2281
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:02,010
(Coach Ji's training method
is effective.)

2282
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:06,100
(The ball hits the candle.)

2283
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:07,740
It came at my nose.

2284
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:10,850
(Thanks to Coach Ji,
he starts to get the hang of it.)

2285
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:11,920
You are almost there.

2286
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,310
I am getting there.

2287
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:17,260
I am getting there.

2288
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:18,390
You got this.

2289
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:21,480
Let's do it here.

2290
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:22,890
Pick up the balls.

2291
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:24,650
Okay. Let's pick up the balls.

2292
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,190
- Pick up the balls.
- Pick them up.

2293
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:29,390
(The members come and support him.)

2294
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:30,490
It's a ruckus.

2295
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:32,060
You got this.

2296
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,510
Let's try again.

2297
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,700
(Charging complete)

2298
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,270
Why don't you hold it with one hand?

2299
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:39,440
- Okay.
- This is hard.

2300
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,310
- It isn't easy.
- Think about the beginning.

2301
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:43,110
I am trying.

2302
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,110
- If he succeeds by chance...
- It hit the candle.

2303
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:47,520
The flame should have gone out.

2304
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,150
- It might not work.
- You are right.

2305
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:50,720
Seriously.

2306
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:53,320
(It touches the flame slightly.)

2307
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,490
It touched the flame two times.

2308
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,490
It doesn't go out
even when it's hit by the ball.

2309
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:02,270
- Seriously.
- It needs to hit the wicker.

2310
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:03,600
It needs to hit the wicker.

2311
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,860
It hit the candle.

2312
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,140
- It still didn't go out.
- Seriously.

2313
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:07,440
It needs to hit the wicker.

2314
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,140
(The ball hit the tip of the candle.)

2315
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:10,180
It hit the candle.

2316
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:11,480
- It still didn't go out.
- Seriously.

2317
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,940
I guess it needs to press the flame.

2318
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,440
- You did it.
- It went out.

2319
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:22,760
(The candle went out
for the first time.)

2320
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,420
That doesn't count.

2321
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:25,820
- Doesn't it count?
- It counts.

2322
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:27,280
- It counts.
- It counts.

2323
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,350
I guess you need to hit the body.

2324
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:30,600
- Hit the body.
- Yes.

2325
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,100
Hit the end of the body.

2326
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,170
You need to tip it over.

2327
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:35,020
Hit the end.

2328
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:36,440
Hit the body.

2329
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:39,730
(Blowing)

2330
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:41,940
It went out.

2331
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:44,140
(The two kids joke around,
but Jae Suk stays serious.)

2332
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,810
- It went out.
- There you go.

2333
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:51,110
(He succeeds again!)

2334
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:52,590
There you go. That's how you do it.

2335
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:54,740
- All right.
- Give it a go. I bet you can do it.

2336
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,150
- You can do it.
- That's right.

2337
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:58,060
I think you can do it.

2338
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,520
- It hit the candle.
- There you go.

2339
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,930
Aim for the end. There you go.

2340
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:04,260
It hit the wicker just now.

2341
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:05,630
You got this.

2342
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,190
That's good. You got this.

2343
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:10,340
- Jae Suk, let's give it a go.
- You are nearly there.

2344
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,140
Shall we decide on
the number of balls now?

2345
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:14,310
- Let's do that.
- We can keep going, right?

2346
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:15,400
That's right.

2347
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,770
Give me as many balls as you can.

2348
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:18,310
Say, "Here we go."

2349
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,880
- Let's go.
- One, two, three.

2350
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,020
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

2351
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,050
- Go.
- All right.

2352
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:24,310
- Go 1st?
- Why don't you go 1st?

2353
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:26,050
- Haha.
- Keep your racket flat.

2354
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:27,090
- Keep it flat.
- Do you want to go first?

2355
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:28,760
- Go first.
- Keep your racket flat.

2356
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:29,760
- So Min.
- There you go.

2357
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:30,780
- That's it.
- Okay.

2358
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:33,450
- How do I do it?
- Send it up.

2359
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:34,820
- Just send it up.
- Send it up.

2360
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:35,930
Send it up.

2361
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:37,230
- Don't try to pass it.
- Send it up.

2362
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:38,490
There you go.

2363
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,390
- Don't try to pass it.
- Send it up.

2364
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:41,670
(Ji Hyo, So Min,)

2365
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:43,170
(Jong Kook, Suk Jin)

2366
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:44,470
- Okay.
- Six. Take it.

2367
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:46,310
- Take it.
- Seven.

2368
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:47,340
- Anyone.
- Eight.

2369
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:48,360
(They hit it 8 times.)

2370
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,640
That's good.

2371
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,880
(Ji Hyo,)

2372
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:52,880
(So Min,)

2373
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,550
(Jong Kook, Suk Jin, Haha)

2374
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:57,350
(It's Suk Jin's turn.)

2375
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:58,440
It's my turn.

2376
01:17:58,570 --> 01:17:59,590
Stop.

2377
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:00,640
It was my turn.

2378
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:02,760
(The relay ends
because of Se Chan's mistake.)

2379
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,590
- It was my turn. You hit it twice.
- It was Suk Jin's turn.

2380
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:06,230
- I saved it.
- You have 11 attempts.

2381
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:07,690
You have 11 attempts.

2382
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:08,800
- All right.
- Eleven attempts.

2383
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,320
You have 11 attempts.

2384
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,350
- Eleven?
- Yes.

2385
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:12,670
Eleven isn't half bad.

2386
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:14,470
- We did well.
- That's right. We did well.

2387
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:17,560
We should have hit it
at least 40 times.

2388
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,640
Once you yell out, "Here I go,"
you can't practice.

2389
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,030
Jae Suk is serious.

2390
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,980
(The representative of Running Man,
Jae Suk is serious.)

2391
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:25,030
Good luck, Jae Suk.

2392
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:26,200
Eleven attempts.

2393
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,310
Good luck.

2394
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:28,600
Jae Suk, let's go.

2395
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:30,640
Jae Suk, let's go.

2396
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,420
- Let's go!
- The viewers are watching.

2397
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:34,720
Jae Suk, let's go.

2398
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,150
- Go slow.
- Send the ball here.

2399
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:37,310
We will move everything.

2400
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:38,930
It will be hard.

2401
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:41,950
Jae Suk, go slow.
There is no reason to go fast.

2402
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:45,130
- There is the rhythm.
- I think he will succeed.

2403
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:46,230
Good.

2404
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:49,640
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2405
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:52,670
- Let's go.
- The candle is shorter now.

2406
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:53,860
That's right.

2407
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:55,380
Maybe it was better
when it was longer.

2408
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,030
All right.

2409
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:59,050
Just aim for the body.

2410
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:00,200
Put out the flame.

2411
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,550
- Here I go.
- Okay.

2412
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:03,140
- He might succeed right away.
- Let's go.

2413
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:04,940
You never know.
He might succeed right away.

2414
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:06,740
(Jae Suk has 11 attempts.)

2415
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:08,480
(It's time for this first attempt.)

2416
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,810
Just hit it roughly.

2417
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:18,190
- It was close.
- You got this.

2418
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:20,230
- It was close.
- You got this.

2419
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:21,730
- The first attempt.
- See?

2420
01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:22,970
He can do it.

2421
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:23,970
You are nearly there.

2422
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:25,340
(He moves on to the second attempt.)

2423
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:28,140
There you go. It's okay.

2424
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:29,400
- You have many attempts left.
- You only tried twice.

2425
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,600
It needs to come here.

2426
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,400
Stop it. Don't pressure him.

2427
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:34,270
It's okay.

2428
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,440
It isn't okay.

2429
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:37,920
Good.

2430
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,090
There you go.

2431
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:41,980
(The ball brushed
against the top of the candle.)

2432
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:43,090
- It was so close.
- That's how you do it.

2433
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:44,350
You are nearly there.

2434
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:46,650
You didn't succeed
because the candle is shorter now.

2435
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:48,230
It's shorter now.

2436
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:50,300
I am becoming nervous now.

2437
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:51,600
You got this.

2438
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,300
With you here,
it feels like the Olympics.

2439
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:55,670
- The Olympics.
- The medal ceremony.

2440
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:57,690
(Jae Suk looks like
he is playing in the Olympics.)

2441
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:00,470
Give it a go.

2442
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:04,730
- It's okay. You are nearly there.
- Not there.

2443
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,180
Take your aim.

2444
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:07,880
- Keep going.
- Go.

2445
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,610
- You have six attempts left.
- Go.

2446
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:11,270
- Don't send it to the same spot.
- What's up with you?

2447
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:13,190
(He used up half
of the given attempts.)

2448
01:20:13,190 --> 01:20:15,590
- It keeps going to the same spot.
- What is she doing?

2449
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:17,060
Is she praying?

2450
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,260
What is she doing?

2451
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:21,060
(I pray for his success.)

2452
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:23,100
I didn't die, okay?

2453
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,300
- Please help Jae Suk succeed.
- I think...

2454
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,730
- that kept you from succeeding.
- I pray...

2455
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:28,890
that Jae Suk will hit the candle.

2456
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:30,560
(Please help Jae Suk succeed.)

2457
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:33,340
Why don't we do the same training?
Aim for my face.

2458
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:34,940
Why don't we do the same training?

2459
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:37,200
(He uses his face as the target.)

2460
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:39,350
Six attempts left.

2461
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:40,440
(He has 6 attempts left.)

2462
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,980
I wouldn't be disappointed
if he hadn't succeeded before.

2463
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:43,680
But he succeeded twice before.

2464
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:45,940
That was close.

2465
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:46,980
(He hits the 6th ball.)

2466
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:49,560
That was close.

2467
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,430
- Okay.
- It hit the candle.

2468
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:56,020
- Okay.
- It hit the candle.

2469
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:57,650
- It did, right?
- Yes. It hit the candle.

2470
01:20:57,650 --> 01:20:59,490
(It's the 7th attempt.)

2471
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:04,060
Okay.

2472
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:07,400
It hit the candle.

2473
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,400
(It was close.)

2474
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:10,730
- Keep going.
- Keep going.

2475
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:12,480
- Keep going.
- Let's go.

2476
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,770
Let's go.

2477
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:15,570
The eighth attempt.

2478
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,270
Let's go.

2479
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:20,690
- The eighth attempt.
- It's off now.

2480
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:22,280
He got the hang of it.

2481
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:24,310
All right.

2482
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:28,450
(It hit the candle!)

2483
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,930
(Will the candle go off?)

2484
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:34,970
- All right.
- He did it!

2485
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:36,860
- All right.
- He did it!

2486
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:39,030
(It went off!)

2487
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:43,570
(It's a success.)

2488
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,100
(We did it.)

2489
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,100
(The confetti falls in celebration.)

2490
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:49,420
Jae Suk.

2491
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:50,850
What was that?

2492
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:52,190
This is Running Man.

2493
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:54,190
We are Running Man.

2494
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:56,450
Wax dripped on me. It was so hot.

2495
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:58,190
Running Man!

2496
01:21:58,190 --> 01:22:01,890
(They shine the most
when they are together.)

2497
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,990
Running Man doesn't disappoint!

2498
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:06,100
He did it!

2499
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:08,690
It went off.

2500
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:10,690
It was a very difficult mission.

2501
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:12,970
- Seriously.
- You did it.

2502
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:14,010
(Mr. Game Man achieved a feat
for the 600th episode.)

2503
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:18,200
Since Jae Suk succeeded
to complete the mission,

2504
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:21,240
a total of 8,000 dollars
will be donated.

2505
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:22,420
(The total will be 8,000 dollars.)

2506
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:24,770
(They did it together.)

2507
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:25,810
That's a lot.

2508
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:31,020
Vote for the best members
of Part Two.

2509
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:32,110
I pick Ji Hyo.

2510
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:33,260
- Ji Hyo.
- In terms of achievements.

2511
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:34,780
- Ji Hyo.
- She kept saying, "Boombastic".

2512
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:35,890
- Me too.
- That's right.

2513
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:37,850
(Ms. Boombastic
lifted up everyone's spirits.)

2514
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:39,990
The winning candidate
for Part Two is Ji Hyo.

2515
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:41,100
- Okay.
- You did it.

2516
01:22:41,470 --> 01:22:43,190
- And...
- Boombastic.

2517
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:45,470
the worst member of Part Two...

2518
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:48,400
who didn't do much
will be picked by the staff members.

2519
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,730
- Okay.
- Haha.

2520
01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:51,640
- Haha.
- Suk Jin.

2521
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:53,180
It's Haha.

2522
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:54,480
Haha got over 11 votes.

2523
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,440
- The worst member is Haha.
- Haha.

2524
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:58,480
Haha.

2525
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,140
- Hehe. Hoho.
- I tried so hard.

2526
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:03,150
The two candidates for victory are
Suk Jin and Ji Hyo.

2527
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:06,230
The two candidates for a penalty are
Suk Jin and Haha.

2528
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:08,930
- Suk Jin is everywhere.
- I am in both things.

2529
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:10,950
The names are written at the bottom.

2530
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,670
The member who gets picked
will be the winner.

2531
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:15,670
Okay.

2532
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,010
The winner will have
the honor of being the main donor...

2533
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:22,510
and the privilege of sending
a coffee truck anywhere.

2534
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,010
That's incredible.

2535
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:25,180
- That's a nice privilege.
- I am jealous.

2536
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:26,310
(The winner will be picked first.)

2537
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:27,570
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

2538
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:30,480
- Get ready.
- Okay.

2539
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,920
This is fun.

2540
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,720
(The draw begins.)

2541
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:37,190
- Go.
- It's going down.

2542
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:38,190
Let's go.

2543
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:39,320
- It's Suk Jin.
- It's going down.

2544
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,130
- Go.
- It's going down.

2545
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:42,150
Let's go.

2546
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:44,800
- It's Suk Jin.
- It's going down.

2547
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,320
(Is Seok Sam getting lucky
after a long time?)

2548
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,320
(Or Ji Hyo?)

2549
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,970
- It's me.
- Suk Jin? Ji Hyo?

2550
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:52,530
(Ji Hyo, Suk Jin)

2551
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:54,510
(Making a sharp turn)

2552
01:23:54,510 --> 01:23:57,030
(Ji Hyo, Suk Jin)

2553
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:58,700
- It's Ji Hyo.
- My gosh.

2554
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,050
(Ji Hyo wins.)

2555
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:01,270
How is this possible?

2556
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:03,520
- It's no surprise.
- I can't believe this.

2557
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,610
- Ji Hyo is the winner.
- Boombastic!

2558
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:06,850
Skrr

2559
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:08,050
I expected to win.

2560
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:09,090
Gosh, Ji Hyo.

2561
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:10,890
I can never beat you.

2562
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:13,060
Now we will decide the loser.

2563
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:15,230
- Put Haha's name on Ji Hyo's spot.
- Okay.

2564
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,520
Suk Jin wouldn't...

2565
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,600
- get the penalty, would he?
- What if it's me?

2566
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,190
No way. It can't be Suk Jin.

2567
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:21,390
All right.

2568
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,670
- That's so cruel.
- The loser will get a penalty.

2569
01:24:23,670 --> 01:24:25,100
Let me tell you what the penalty is.

2570
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:26,140
- Okay.
- What is it?

2571
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,970
I said there would be a penalty,
but it's something honorable.

2572
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:30,140
- What?
- What is it?

2573
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:34,100
To our viewers who have supported us
for the past 600 episodes,

2574
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:37,720
you will write a thank you letter
on behalf of our members.

2575
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:38,770
(Writing a thank you letter)

2576
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,390
- Oh, dear.
- Gosh.

2577
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:43,090
How long? A sheet of paper?

2578
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:46,980
We'd like you to write
a thank you letter with gratitude.

2579
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:48,630
- Suk Jin hates it.
- That's his least favorite thing.

2580
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:50,490
- It is a real penalty.
- You should be grateful.

2581
01:24:50,490 --> 01:24:52,860
- Actually...
- We are always grateful.

2582
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:54,800
- I'd love to write a letter.
- He has bad luck.

2583
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,030
But I have no luck with this.

2584
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:59,170
- I'd love to write a letter.
- Me too.

2585
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:00,510
- Left and right.
- Let's do this.

2586
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:02,600
- Okay.
- I bet Suk Jin will lose.

2587
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:06,100
- It's Haha.
- I bet Suk Jin will lose.

2588
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:09,240
It's Haha.
No, it shouldn't go that way.

2589
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:10,920
Hey.

2590
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:14,480
(Haha, Suk Jin)

2591
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,020
(The loser is Ji Suk Jin.)

2592
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:18,650
It's Haha.
No, it shouldn't go that way.

2593
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:22,800
(One-way street)

2594
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:25,650
This is unbelievable.

2595
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:27,490
- It never went this way.
- It's unbelievable.

2596
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:28,990
- I know.
- Why did it go that way?

2597
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:30,190
Isn't it supposed...

2598
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:31,560
- to go back and forth?
- This is unbelievable.

2599
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,440
It wouldn't go the other way.

2600
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,200
- It refused to move.
- I can't believe this.

2601
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,510
- This is for you.
- Did you set this up?

2602
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:39,510
- Do you have a button or something?
- The ball did a great job.

2603
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:40,640
Does the ball have a magnet on it?

2604
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:42,350
This is impossible.

2605
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:43,720
We could do 600 episodes
thanks to Suk Jin.

2606
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,740
Tell them how grateful we are.

2607
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:47,940
- And my feelings.
- Your feelings...

2608
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:48,980
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2609
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:50,850
Thank you.

2610
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:53,950
(Everyone left for the day.)

2611
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:55,930
- Please.
- This isn't enough.

2612
01:25:56,430 --> 01:25:59,600
I'd need more sheets.
I'll just write down how I feel.

2613
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:07,270
Gosh, I'm getting
a little emotional.

2614
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:10,700
It feels strange. The 600th episode.

2615
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,810
(It feels strange.
The 600th episode.)

2616
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:23,280
(He writes a letter to the viewers
on behalf of the members.)

2617
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,260
(First of all, I'm grateful
that I can write this letter...)

2618
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:28,520
(to our viewers
on behalf of the members.)

2619
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:31,950
(We wouldn't have been
able to come this far...)

2620
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:37,800
(without the help, love, and
affection of our viewers.)

2621
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:42,010
(I can't thank you enough for
having loved and supported us...)

2622
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:45,700
(when we don't deserve any of that.)

2623
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:52,110
(I'm not sure
how much further we can go,)

2624
01:26:52,110 --> 01:26:55,720
(but this might be in the 8th inning
of a baseball game...)

2625
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:59,320
(or 30 minutes into
the second half of a soccer game.)

2626
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:02,280
(The members and production crew
will try their best...)

2627
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:04,990
(to make a show that gives you
the best laughter. Thank you.)

2628
01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:07,600
(The oldest member
of Running Man, Ji Suk Jin)

2629
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:08,860
We are so cool.

2630
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:11,440
(With Suk Jin's warm heart,)

2631
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,170
(the money that
the members saved today...)

2632
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:14,360
(have been donated
to children from low-income.)

2633
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:18,510
The real deal
shows up at the last moment.

2634
01:27:18,510 --> 01:27:20,680
(The powerful punch
with the burning taste)

2635
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:22,550
(Fighters are here
to challenge him.)

2636
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:24,420
(Byeon Woo Seok, Joo Woo Jae,
Park Gyeong Hye)

2637
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,740
(In the fierce fight,)

2638
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:28,610
(the first thing
you need to win over...)

2639
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:31,110
(is yourself!)

2640
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:33,060
(In any circumstance,)

2641
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:35,650
(you should never be
consumed with anger.)

2642
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:36,760
(It's possible for Woo Jae.)

2643
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:39,690
(Your female friend?
That female friend!)

2644
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:42,300
(It's time to keep a lid on your anger.)

2645
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,860
(The objectives are clear.)

2646
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,940
(To become the Running Monster Master
in this section,)

2647
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:52,810
(they have to come up
with a decisive move.)

2648
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:56,640
(Who will be the winner
of this awful fistfight?)

2649
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:59,180
(The Decisive Punch)
