1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,170
This place is so pretty.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,970
The floor is covered
with artificial turf.

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,140
This is so lovely. It's pretty.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,640
When I see artificial turf...

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,240
What's so pretty?

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,550
- Do you want to play soccer?
- This is pretty.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,120
- There's a boxing game machine.
- Hello.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,170
- A boxing game machine.
- Hello.

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,390
This place is so pretty.

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,960
- This is...
- I should put my weight on it.

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,120
(While Seok Sam shows off
his weak power...)

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,920
(Doing a photoshoot alone)

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,800
- What is she doing now?
- My gosh.

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,120
- She can't help it.
- You know there's a camera.

15
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,660
That means they want me to do this.

16
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,540
- My gosh.
- I guess you're right.

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,510
This is embarrassing.

18
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,370
- But she's...
- Take a look at this.

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,610
(The May issue of Frog Magazine)

20
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,800
Hello.

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,620
- Hello.
- Hug me

22
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,870
Hello.

23
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,010
- Then do this.
- Hello.

24
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,480
One, two, and go.

25
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,510
- What is this?
- One, two, and go.

26
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,410
- Good.
- She's exercising...

27
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,050
- with her father-in-law.
- Take a look at this.

28
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,790
- It shows scores.
- Look at this.

29
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,950
Someone already tried this.

30
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,020
- What's that?
- I guess we have guests.

31
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,020
Right. Three guests.

32
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,790
Samseong-dong Nuclear Punch,
954 points. That's high.

33
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,600
- Banpo-dong Cyanide.
- Cyanide.

34
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,240
- "Is Jong Kook strong?"
- "Is Jong Kook strong?"

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
The person who wrote this
will get a good scolding.

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,510
And there's Baby.

37
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,510
(Someone left a trace
provoking the members.)

38
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,740
There's Banpo-dong Cyanide.

39
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,210
Who is Baby?

40
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,930
- What's this?
- The one who wrote cyanide...

41
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,880
- must be funny.
- Exactly.

42
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,120
- Someone funny.
- Someone who likes to make jokes.

43
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,210
This one must be someone
who likes to make people laugh.

44
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,150
- It must be a comedian.
- You should give it a try.

45
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,520
It will be amazing if Jong Kook
gets a lower score than me.

46
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,490
If my score is higher
than Jong Kook's,

47
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,380
that means I'm strong, right?

48
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,550
I think so.

49
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,130
- Why don't you give it a try?
- Who?

50
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,130
"Those with a powerful punch
may try this and check the score."

51
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,630
- Who wants to go first?
- Do you want me to try?

52
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,630
Jamwon-dong Honey Punch goes first.

53
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,330
Jamwon-dong Honey Punch.

54
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,130
- Jamwon-dong Honey Punch.
- Suyu-ri Honey Punch.

55
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,570
- Honey Punch.
- Suyu-ri Honey Punch goes first.

56
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,330
Let's say Jamwon-dong Hellraiser.

57
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,830
- No. Jamwon-dong...
- Hellraiser.

58
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,300
- You're number four.
- Hellraiser.

59
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,770
- It's an old movie.
- This is too low.

60
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,100
- All right. Suyu-ri.
- Isn't it too low?

61
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,210
Suyu-ri Honey Punch.

62
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,570
I should put my weight on this.

63
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,880
Sweet Fist.

64
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,880
- I'll go like this.
- Your punch tastes sweet.

65
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,960
Here I go.

66
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,490
All right. Jamwon-dong Honey Punch.

67
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,130
- Oh, dear.
- Gosh.

68
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,290
- Seriously...
- That's too weak.

69
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,630
- You are healthy.
- I missed it.

70
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,390
- That's too weak.
- I hit the corner of it.

71
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,130
That was weak, but it's 800 points.

72
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,600
- What is it, 800 points?
- It should be a lot lower.

73
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,390
- It's 800.
- I touched the corner.

74
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,410
- Let me try it again.
- This is very generous.

75
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,410
Hang on.

76
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,200
He's been practicing it. He is...

77
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,700
- Haha recently started boxing.
- He's into boxing.

78
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,880
MMA.

79
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,510
- Right. You should try it.
- You can do this.

80
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,380
- He says...
- No. You do it.

81
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,610
He says he has a powerful punch.

82
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,640
That's what the coach said.

83
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,290
- What?
- My punch might kill someone.

84
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,060
- Okay. Go ahead and try it.
- Just do it.

85
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,590
Mapo... Mapo One-Month Punch,
you do it.

86
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,590
What's One-Month Punch?

87
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,920
- You started boxing a month ago.
- It's been a month.

88
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,500
Why would you say that?

89
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,690
I want something cool.

90
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,920
Your nickname is One Month.

91
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,070
I'm Sleep Punch.

92
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,070
You're Hip Punch.

93
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,420
- You like to be hip. Hip Punch.
- It's Hip Punch.

94
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,130

- Hip Punch.
- That doesn't matter.

96
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,660
He's been doing MMA.

97
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,480
- Good.
- You look hip. Nice.

98
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,230
- Go ahead and do it.
- Look at him.

99
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,600
- Just do it.
- All right.

100
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,510
- Gosh, look at that.
- Look at his steps.

101
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,070
That's cute.

102
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,720
You're wearing baggy pants.

103
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,790
- What?
- It's like he's wearing a diaper.

104
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,590
- He's wearing a diaper.
- That's unique.

105
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,910
- It looks like a diaper.
- He's wearing a diaper.

106
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,690
- I need to warm up before...
- It's a diaper.

107
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,230
- My gosh.
- That was really weak.

108
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,290
It was loud though.

109
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,130
- It's 874.
- Is that it?

110
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,230
Ji Hyo must be stronger than that.

111
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,470
What's Ji Hyo's nickname?
What do you want?

112
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,660
- I like Sleep Hip Punch.
- I...

113
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,730
Mapo Homebody.

114
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,810
Homebody?

115
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,230

- Mapo Homebody.

116
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,630
- Homebody Punch.

117
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,200
It says Homebody Jeoktoma.

118
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,310
Homebody Jeoktoma?

119
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,600
- Homebody Jeoktoma.
- She wrote Homebody Jeoktoma.

120
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,820
She's Jeoktoma, but she doesn't run.

121
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,280
She never goes out of her house.

122
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,720
She never goes out. She's home.

123
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,850
Homebody Jeoktoma.

124
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,290
- Come on.
- Gosh.

125
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,130
- That's as weak as Suk Jin's.
- Don't pretend to be weak.

126
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,130
You'd get Suk Jin's score.

127
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,760
- It's 732.
- Why are you pretending to be weak?

128
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,290
What's my nickname?
Do you have any ideas?

129
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,290
You live in Yongsan, right?

130
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,630
What about Yongsan Tutu?
You look like Tutu.

131
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,940
- Really?
- Yongsan Frog.

132
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,040
- Yongsan Frog.
- Yongsan Frog.

133
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,570
- Yongsan Frog.
- I'll go with Yongsan Frog.

134
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,380
- Yongsan Frog.
- Yongsan Frog.

135
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,130
Go. That looks good, So Min.

136
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,880
You should grab a marker pen.

137
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,540
- Yongsan Frog.
- You might get hurt.

138
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,850
- You'll get 300 points.
- Yongsan Frog, go.

139
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,070
Ribbit.

140
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,410
- Ribbit.
- My gosh.

141
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,410
(She throws a strong punch
with all her energy.)

142
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,590
- That was loud.
- You got it right.

143
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,730
- It was powerful.
- I'm sure it's high.

144
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,750
- It's out.
- It's 841.

145
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,920
(841 points)

146
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,290
(Yongsan Frog: 841 points)

147
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,030
- I got 800.
- It's higher than Suk Jin's.

148
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,120
- Let me try it again.
- No.

149
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,400
- I hit...
- You get to try only once.

150
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,290
- I touched the corner of it.
- It's over.

151
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,800
- My score is too low.
- It's my turn.

152
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Jae Suk.

153
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,410
Hang on. You're Apgujeong...

154
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,780
- Apgujeong...
- Apgujeong Ugly Face.

155
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,150
- Apgujeong Idiot.
- Apgujeong Yoda.

156
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,450
- Idiot.
- Baby Octopus.

157
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,610
Apgujeong Baby Octopus.

158
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,950
- Hey.
- Apgujeong Baby Octopus?

159
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,220
- Apgu... Apgujeong Minion.
- Snout Thumbtack.

160
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,610
- Apgu... What?
- Snout Thumbtack.

161
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,610
Snout Thumbtack?

162
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,410
What about Apgujeong Smashed Face?

163
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,550
Apgujeong Smashed Face.

164
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,420
- Smashed Face?
- Smashed Face

165
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,030
- Apgujeong Smashed Face.
- That sounds great.

166
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,030
- Smashed Face.

167
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,030
- Apgujeong Smashed Face?
- Nice.

168
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,730
- I like Smashed Face.
- That sounds great.

169
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,730
What about Face Doctor?

170
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,770
- It sounds intense.
- Okay.

171
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,560
I'll get you a great nickname.

172
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,040
Apgujeong Smashed Face.

173
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,340
- All right.
- Let's go.

174
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,040
- I love Yongsan Frog.
- Gosh.

175
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,150
- It must be high.
- Gosh.

176
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,170
- That was nice.
- He used both hands.

177
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,170
I hit it right.

178
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,410
- He put his weight on it.
- It must be high.

179
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,110
- This is about his pride.
- It's 939.

180
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,410
- My gosh.
- That's high.

181
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,790
- It's 939.
- You're second place.

182
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,550
- That was so close.
- Let me try.

183
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,910
- You did well.
- You're second place.

184
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,790
- It went well.
- Banpo-dong Cyanide is doomed.

185
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,660
- Look at that.
- How could it be so high?

186
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,420
What do you mean?
It's lower than before.

187
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,830
It's 700, Suk Jin.

188
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,920
Let me try.

189
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,700
This is strange.

190
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,040
It's my turn.

191
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,970
I can do better than this.

192
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,770
- That's so close.
- I should show them something.

193
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,600
- This is...
- Se Chan is strong.

194
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,800
- Seriously...
- Here comes Itaewon Boombastic.

195
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,410
- The truth is...
- He's quite heavy.

196
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,580
- Good.
- He must be strong.

197
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,670
Bang.

198
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,910
(How strong is Se Chan's punch?)

199
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,520
My goodness. Excuse me.

200
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,290
(The prankster is back.)

201
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,520
- Excuse me.
- That's nice.

202
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,810
- Why?
- Mr. Smashed Face, move over.

203
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,180
Be careful.
You shouldn't have worn that.

204
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,620
- That's right.
- Now he can't do it right.

205
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,050
It must bother him.
He can't do it right.

206
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,700
(Groaning)

207
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,840
- Excuse me!
- He can't do it right.

208
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,340
- Excuse me!
- Just do it.

209
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,730
- Mr. Smashed Face!
- Punch it.

210
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,600
- It can be dangerous.
- Okay. Just punch it.

211
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
- It was going well.
- Okay.

212
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,980
- Go ahead and do it.
- This is thrilling.

213
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,040
- My gosh.
- Do it again.

214
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,410
It will be about 300.

215
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,000
Gosh, Jae Suk. That wasn't good.

216
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,720
- It did affect him.
- That was good. Why?

217
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,780
- It's 926.
- It's 926.

218
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,810
- It's 926.
- That's high.

219
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,810
I want to try it again.

220
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,180
- I want to punch it again.
- What's Jong Kook's name?

221
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,250
- Secret Jjujju?
- Go with Jjujju.

222
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,790
Gosh, this is...

223
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,230
This is about his pride.

224
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,330
- Not really.
- All right.

225
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,230
- It's not about my pride.
- What's Jong Kook's nickname?

226
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,970
- Secret Jjujju.
- It can't be Secret Jjujju.

227
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,100
It should be Jjijji.

228
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,230
- Secret Jjijji.
- It sounds too small.

229
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,990
- Muscular pig.
- Should I punch it like this?

230
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,640
- What about Eun Hye Punch?
- Darn it.

231
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,430
(What about Eun Hye Punch?)

232
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,210
- I like Eun Hye Punch.
- I mean, Blessed Punch.

233
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,670
It means Blessed Punch.

234
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,080
- What's wrong?
- Don't do it.

235
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,540
- You're being sensitive.
- He's...

236
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,040
- I'm not sensitive.
- What...

237
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,590
- He's just unbelievable.
- Eun Hye Punch?

238
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,610
Blessed Punch.

239
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,910
Why do you have to say that?

240
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,680
- Your punch is blessed.
- Exactly.

241
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,790
- That's different.
- Go with Eun Hye Punch.

242
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,680
- He's honored.
- What?

243
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,330
- Glory Punch.
- Exactly.

244
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,490
- I mean...
- Glory Kim.

245
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,750
- My gosh.
- Why do you have to...

246
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,920
It doesn't have to be Eun Hye.

247
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,330
It means blessed.

248
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,930
- Eun Hye Punch.
- Glory Punch.

249
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,290
- Isn't that nice?
- He's strange.

250
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,640
- Glory Punch.
- Glory Punch.

251
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,860
I like Eun Hye Punch.

252
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,040
- I can't understand him.
- Good. Eun Hye Punch.

253
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,340
- This is...
- This is romantic.

254
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,140
(Swinging)

255
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,650
- This is romantic.
- Great. Look at that.

256
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,220
The main character appears last.

257
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,580
You go like this.

258
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,540
- This is the ending.
- All right.

259
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,950
Jong Kook, you are legally
throwing a punch today.

260
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,410
It has to be higher than 954.

261
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,810
- This is...
- He's doing this legally.

262
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,030
- My goodness.
- Oh, dear.

263
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,030
I wonder how...

264
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,230
(Thump)

265
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,420
I wonder how...

266
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,420
- Good.
- He looks like King Kong.

267
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,560
I don't think it's high.

268
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,140
It must be high. It's 961.

269
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,900
- My gosh.
- He's first place.

270
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,300
(He wins 1st place.)

271
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,580
- He's number one.
- He's first place.

272
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,600
- I want to do it again.
- Me too.

273
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,850
- Those who want to try again...
- Me.

274
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,600
(Give me two dollars.)

275
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,650
- Give me two dollars.
- Why?

276
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,220
- Why?
- I will wire the money.

277
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,280
- Pay two dollars.
- I will.

278
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,590
- I'll wire the money.
- Pay it now.

279
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,610
- I'll pay.
- Bring the money.

280
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,980
- I will pay.
- This is ridiculous.

281
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,180
Can you pay for me?

282
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,720
- I'll pay.
- Pay 10 dollars for 5 people.

283
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,460
- I'll pay 10 dollars.
- Give me 10 dollars.

284
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,160
I'll pay ten dollars. Here.

285
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,750
(He puts his glasses in
as a pledge.)

286
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,730
Is it the pledge?

287
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,470
- I'll pay. My gosh.
- Okay.

288
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,290
All right. This will be
your new record.

289
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,730
- Okay. I'll go with this.
- Okay.

290
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,470
- I have to do this right.
- You have only one chance.

291
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,040
I bet this will be lower.

292
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,080
- You have only one chance.
- I have to do this right.

293
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,580
I want more than 900 points.

294
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,140
- It's over.
- Oh, no.

295
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,350
It's over.

296
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,280
- It's 196.
- Oh, dear.

297
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,780
- Hey!
- It's 196.

298
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,190
I want to try it again.

299
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,750
Suk Jin, try it again.
Take off your clothes.

300
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,060
- One more try.
- Try it again.

301
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,460
- Try again. Take this off.
- Pay the money.

302
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,890
- You have only one chance.
- You can do this.

303
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,200
You get only one chance.

304
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,470
All right.

305
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,940
We have the results
of the Decisive Punch.

306
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,630
And we have the ranking on the wall.

307
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,570
The three people
with the lowest scores will...

308
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,370
- choose their captains.
- Captains?

309
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,350
Yes. You can choose
one of the blue names.

310
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,810
- Those three?
- Yes.

311
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,980
- Captain?
- I see.

312
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,920
All right. I will...

313
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,380
- Which one do you want?
- Which one?

314
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,820
- Samseong-dong Nuclear Punch.
- Okay.

315
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,590
- Nuclear Punch sounds good.
- Samseong-dong Nuclear Punch.

316
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,230
- Next.
- Jeoktoma.

317
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,330
I will...

318
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,190
choose the one
who said "Is Jong Kook strong?"

319
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,330
- Okay.
- I see.

320
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,620
You should choose Baby.

321
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,390
No, I want the strongest one.

322
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,230
- Nuclear Punch?
- Nuclear Punch.

323
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,390
Nuclear Punch.

324
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,260
Here. Is Jong Kook strong?

325
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,030
I should show him how strong I am.

326
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,840
All right. You're done
choosing your teams.

327
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,680
- So let's bring in the captains.
- Okay.

328
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,180
The three guests with decisive
punches, please come on out.

329
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,240
Who are they?

330
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,480
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

331
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,980
- My gosh.
- Hey.

332
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,690
Hey.

333
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,350
- Hey.
- Baby?

334
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,190
(The ghost who follows Kim Go Eun
around in "Guardian")

335
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,100
(She's a scene-stealer
with her distinctive acting.)

336
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,440
(Park Gyeong Hye showed impressive
acting in "Escape from Mogadishu".)

337
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,840
(He was Park Bo Gum's friend
in "Record of Youth".)

338
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,580
(Actor Byeon Woo Seok also showed
great acting in a historical drama.)

339
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,450
- Hello.
- Hello.

340
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,450
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

341
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,550
- Hey.
- Hi.

342
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,720
- Baby?
- Hey.

343
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,320
- Is he Woo Jae?
- What?

344
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,980
- Is he Yoon Seok?
- It's Woo Jae.

345
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,320
- Hey.
- Woo Jae.

346
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,510
(Joo Woo Jae,
the paper doll shows up.)

347
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,620
It's Woo Jae.

348
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,330
We finally meet.

349
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,020
- Hello.
- Hello.

350
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,120
- It's so good to see you.
- Hey.

351
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,860
- Hello.
- What's your name?

352
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,940
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

353
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,030
You're Nuclear Punch. All right.

354
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,810
- Is that you?
- Is Jong Kook strong?

355
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,870
- You said that?
- Hey, you are...

356
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,340
The production crew...

357
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,480
It's just a nickname.

358
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,850
Write down your nicknames.

359
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,550
And we will decide the ranking.

360
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,580
I'll go with "Is Jong Kook Strong?"

361
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,550
Is Jong Kook Strong?

362
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,690
It has to be like that.

363
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,190
Hey, you are...

364
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,460
The production crew...

365
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,850
- It's just a nickname.
- Come here.

366
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,090
Come here. You're a guest.

367
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,520
Why are you here again?

368
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,990
Are you here as a manager or what?

369
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,360
- Why did you come?
- For "The Manager?"

370
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,600
- He's with me.
- Model...

371
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,600
- Woo Jae, is your jacket rusty?
- What?

372
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,730
- A rusty jacket?
- This is...

373
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,170
Woo Jae...

374
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,170
- was here before.
- Right.

375
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,500
We don't have to introduce him.

376
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,630
Actually, Woo Jae is...

377
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,100
You should at least introduce me.

378
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,900
- I must say we made him popular.
- That's true.

379
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,350
- We made him popular.
- Sure.

380
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,770
- It's true we made you famous.
- Isn't that true?

381
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,950
- We made Woo Jae famous.
- Right.

382
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,240
- You have to admit it.
- Is that right?

383
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,650
- You got more followers, right?
- After I was on this show,

384
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,820
- a lot of people asked me.
- What?

385
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,020
"Are you sure
you were a fashion model?"

386
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,350
I don't want to explain the details,
so I just say no.

387
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,350
I see.

388
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,760
Woo Jae, are you
close to other models?

389
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,930
What are you good at?

390
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,990
Do you have a group chat room?

391
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,260
I'm the bond
who glues them together.

392
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,630
He's like a comedian
in the world of models.

393
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,340
Exactly. Now I get it.

394
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,770
- He's like Kwang Soo.
- He's Kwang Soo.

395
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,230
- People would believe it.
- A comedian of actors.

396
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,600
We haven't talked about Kwang Soo
in a while.

397
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,400
- This is how tall people look.
- Right.

398
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,370
- Exactly.
- He's really tall.

399
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,110
- Right. He's really tall.
- He looks so cool.

400
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,110
Wait. So Min is...

401
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,750
So Min is stepping forward again.

402
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,690
- So Min.
- Stay right here.

403
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,590
- You can stand here.
- She weighs in again.

404
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,600
So Min was...

405
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,860
- She usually stays here.
- She took a step forward.

406
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,300
But she was standing here today.

407
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,490
- She has that smile again.
- Stand here.

408
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,260
- That smile. Look.
- Stand here.

409
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,360
Stand there.

410
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,500
- It's all right.
- It's not like that.

411
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,710
You can stay here.

412
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,480
Don't be like that.
It makes him uncomfortable.

413
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,310
You are very tall.

414
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,550
- She's taller than you thought.
- Right.

415
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,220
She has that smile again.

416
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,580
I can tell you one thing for sure.

417
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,240
She's not interested in Woo Jae.

418
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,550
It's not Woo Jae.

419
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,090
- It's not Woo Jae.
- Woo Jae, it's nice to see you!

420
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,480
- It's definitely not Woo Jae.
- Woo Jae is...

421
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,520
So Min looks excited again.

422
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,560
The three guests have
something in common.

423
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,350
- What?
- They are close friends.

424
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,520
- Really?
- Yes.

425
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,260
And they each have a decisive punch.

426
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,860
- I see.
- Like what?

427
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,730
As you know, Gyeong Hye has done...

428
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,500
a lot of dramas and movies.

429
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,530
- She's a scene-stealer.
- She was on "Guardian".

430
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,940
- That's right.
- She was a scene-stealer.

431
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,640
- You know "Guardian".
- She was in the drama.

432
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,740
Woo Seok also has a decisive punch.

433
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,920
- What is it?
- He was on "Record of Youth".

434
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,950
"Record of Youth".
I loved the drama.

435
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,010
Thank you.

436
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,010
- Right.
- Park Bo Gum's friend.

437
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,560
Woo Jae also has a decisive punch.

438
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,820
- It's Running Man.
- Running Man.

439
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,280
It's Running Man.

440
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,750
Woo Jae's major work is Running Man.

441
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,690
- It's Running Man.
- We raised you.

442
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,230
- I must have something good.
- Woo Jae has done...

443
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,860
many TV shows and fashion shows,

444
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,330
- It's not "Love Naggers".
- but his major work is...

445
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,890
Did you do some research on me?

446
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,100
- We did.
- What made you famous...

447
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,310
- It's us who made you famous.
- We did our research.

448
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,940
- I see.
- First,

449
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,940
let's talk about Gyeong Hye.

450
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,710
- This is your first time here.
- Right.

451
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,000
How are you feeling?

452
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,010
Thank you so much
for having me here.

453
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,010
I really love this show.

454
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,420
Is your nickname Baby?

455
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,640
- Yes.
- Why?

456
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,750
I just want to look cute.

457
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,120
- You're cute.
- You're cute.

458
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,560
- You've lovely.
- Gyeong Hye.

459
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,960
Is there anyone whom you look like?

460
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,560
- No.
- Not at all?

461
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,670
Actually, there's one,
but I can't tell you.

462
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,430
- Just tell us.
- Who is it?

463
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,490
- From a distance, at a glance...
- Who is it?

464
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,100
- At a slight glance...
- It's for us to judge.

465
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,770
I'm so nervous
that I forgot the name.

466
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,600
- Benedict Cumberbatch?
- No.

467
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,450
It's not him.

468
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,100
- I'm excited.
- By the way,

469
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,770
you act like Park Na Rae.

470
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,350
That's right.

471
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,480
(They look alike in a way.)

472
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,280
- I love Na Rae. I'm a fan.
- Oh, dear.

473
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,690
- She looks a little like her.
- I'm a big fan.

474
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,110
And we have Byeon Woo Seok
from "Record of Youth".

475
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,830
- He's handsome.
- He looks great.

476
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,600
He's really good-looking.

477
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,070
All I can see is the back
of So Min's head now.

478
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,760
She never looks back.

479
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,570
- My gosh.
- Anyway, Woo Seok,

480
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,230
what did people say when you told
them you'd be on Running Man?

481
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,360
Did you ask Woo Jae anything?

482
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,940
I was a little nervous,
so I asked Woo Jae.

483
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,270
I thought he'd tell me what to do...

484
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,350
- And give you advice?
- and give me advice.

485
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,480
But he didn't say anything.

486
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,950
- "Just be yourself."
- How would I give you advice...

487
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,820
when I don't know what to do?

488
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,350
Woo Jae doesn't know
what to do here.

489
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,250
- That's what I heard.
- I couldn't say anything last time.

490
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,620
They are really mean
toward outsiders.

491
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,560
I watched...

492
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,620
the official YouTube channel of SBS.
They uploaded a video of me.

493
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,300
It shows how mean
you guys were to me.

494
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,360
- Hey, that's love.
- I was on the thumbnail.

495
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,130
- We did it out of love.
- That means we care about you.

496
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,170
- I was on the thumbnail.
- It means we care.

497
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,360
How could you...

498
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,900
I mean I was flattered.

499
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,980
- I loved it.
- We weren't being mean.

500
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,080
I found it friendly.

501
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,580
Your major work is Running Man.

502
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,450
- Honestly.
- Sure. It's Running Han.

503
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,980
- Okay.
- All right.

504
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,180
- He's...
- He is good-looking.

505
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,380
- They all say that.
- You must be popular.

506
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,090
You are popular
with girls, aren't you?

507
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,820
- Not really.
- Seriously?

508
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,460
Is that because of your personality?

509
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,960
- My personality?
- Yes.

510
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,520
- I have a pretty good personality.
- I see.

511
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,490
"A pretty good personality?"

512
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,730
He's humorous.

513
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,070
- We don't usually say that.
- He's so funny.

514
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,300
"A pretty good personality."

515
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,700
He's really funny.

516
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,530
"A pretty good personality."

517
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,630
(His words make her
laugh her head off.)

518
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,600
She even stomps her feet.
Look how she responds.

519
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,310
- What's with her?
- He's so funny.

520
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,480
- He's the best.
- She's really annoying.

521
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,010
She even stomps her feet.
Look how she responds.

522
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,720
- Hey.
- Look at her.

523
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,190
Take a look at Woo Seok's shoulders.

524
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,980
A bag would never
slide down his shoulders.

525
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,920
- I hate it.
- I want to have his shoulders.

526
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,980
He's got broad shoulders.

527
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,780
- I want to live with his body.
- They're broad.

528
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,150
Woo Jae's shoulders aren't
that broad for his height.

529
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,520
It's like Woo Jae
doesn't have shoulders.

530
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,700
- What?
- You've got no shoulders.

531
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,800
- And he has flat buttocks.
- That's right.

532
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,970
There you go again.

533
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,260
I don't have anything.

534
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,810
- Woo Jae looks so pale today.
- What I have...

535
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,000
Did you not sleep last night?

536
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,710
- Woo Jae looks so pale today.
- What I have...

537
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,810
Did you not sleep last night?

538
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,630
Now she's one of them. I mean...

539
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,210
- Did you get some sleep?
- They're like twin buildings.

540
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,310
While he's complete,

541
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,870
- Woo Jae only has pillars.
- Poor construction.

542
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,050
Why does your skin
look so horrible today?

543
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,690
- His face...
- He looks off-color.

544
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,550
Hey, you look sick.

545
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,460
- You should get a liver test.
- Seriously, you look awful.

546
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,220
- Did you rehearse this or what?
- No.

547
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,330
- You're sick, aren't you?
- We're serious.

548
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,690
- Just go ahead and cry.
- We're saying this for your sake.

549
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,600
If you're sick, you can go home.
It's all right.

550
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,730
I'll go home later.

551
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,570
You will soon get jaundice.

552
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,230
- That's enough.
- It's so...

553
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,030
- You went too far with it.
- His face is...

554
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,230
I got a lot of diseases
because of him.

555
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,130
Woo Jae, you'll get sick.

556
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,070
- He looks awful.
- He needs to get more calcium.

557
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,500
- You...
- He probably has a liver problem.

558
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,310
- What?
- Just play along with him.

559
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,710
- Come here.
- I'm not sick.

560
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,550
- Come here.
- Let me tell you about the race.

561
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,680
Today, we have three guests...

562
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,590
who left a deep impression on
viewers with their decisive punches.

563
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,450
So this is called
The Decisive Punch Race.

564
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,590
- I see.
- Punch.

565
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,190
Collecting bread stickers
is popular these days.

566
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,250
- Right.
- That's true.

567
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,690
- Right.
- The seal stickers.

568
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,400
We made special stickers for you.

569
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,870
And we put them...

570
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,590
- in the bread package randomly.
- Really?

571
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,940
We have 300 packages of bread today.

572
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,330
- That's a lot.
- We have 300 packages?

573
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,500
And there are
ten different kinds of stickers.

574
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,730
Each team will win bread
after a mission.

575
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:30,500
The team that collects all ten kinds
of stickers wins the race.

576
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,380
(The team that collects all ten
kinds of stickers wins the race.)

577
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,270
(Winner)

578
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,580
Make sure your team collects
the ten different kinds of stickers.

579
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,480
I'll give you the Runningdex.

580
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,050
- Runningdex?
- We have the Runningdex.

581
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,480
- What's that?
- This is like the Pokedex?

582
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,750
We will do this.

583
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,250
- All right, Woo Jae.
- My strategy worked.

584
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,930
I see. You provoked me.

585
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,060
I knew Jong Kook
would pick this nickname.

586
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,200
(He got Jong Kook
for his team as he planned.)

587
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,170
- Are we a team of 4?
- We are 4.

588
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,370
This is awkward.

589
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,170
Don't tease me.

590
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,110
- But the team...
- Yes?

591
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,330
- that has Suk Jin always loses.
- That's not true.

592
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,480
- Don't worry.
- We have Jae Suk.

593
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,110
- You have me.
- Can I talk casually to you?

594
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,450
Sure. Please.

595
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,070
- Can I do the same?
- Of course.

596
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,120
Look at So Min.

597
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,480
She's not working.

598
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,540
What?

599
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,040
- Do you like cheesy girls?
- Sorry?

600
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,220
- Very much so.
- I see.

601
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,480
(Really?)

602
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,050
(The cheesy girl is smiling
from ear to ear.)

603
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,400
- That's great.
- She's elated.

604
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,870
- Your hair looks nice today.
- Finally, this day has come.

605
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,090
- Tuck your hair behind your ears.
- It looks pretty.

606
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,700
- Try to look pretty.
- There you go.

607
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,990
- Her hair looks great.
- She looks so happy.

608
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,140
- She's unbelievably consistent.
- Are you happy?

609
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,910
- He's good with words too.
- He made her day.

610
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,530
She's smiling so happily.

611
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,040
- The two of them don't seem...
- Not at all.

612
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,000
I'll do everything I can
to make it happen.

613
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,380
I'll try to make it romantic
somehow.

614
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,280
We'll be like a comedy duo.

615
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,920
I don't know why,
but she reminds me of Na Rae.

616
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,810
- She looks like her from afar.
- We're like a comedy duo.

617
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,520
- A comedy duo.
- I'll do my best to play Cupid.

618
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,020
She feels like one of us.
They look great together.

619
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,510
Now, each team will choose bread.

620
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,080
Based on the teams' average scores,
the team in 1st place gets 7,

621
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,720
- We get 7.
- the team in 2nd place gets 5,

622
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,660
and the team in 3rd place gets 3.

623
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,080
The team
with the highest average score is...

624
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,080
(Which team got the highest score
and will get 7 pieces of bread?)

625
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,250
The team
with the highest average score is...

626
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,560
- I bet it's us.
- Team Gyeong Hye.

627
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,900
(Team Gyeong Hye with an average score
of 894 points placed 1st.)

628
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,290
- How?
- We got the highest score.

629
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,000
- Team Woo Jae placed second.
- This is exciting.

630
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,330
- We placed second?
- Yes.

631
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,110
- He and I got similar scores.
- We...

632
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,270
Yes. Your team placed second.

633
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,680
- We placed 2nd.
- And Team Woo Seok placed 3rd.

634
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,710
- Why are we in 3rd place?
- You placed 3rd.

635
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,150
I really wanted to have that bread.

636
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,450
- Let's eat some bread.
- Oh, my.

637
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,080
- It's real bread.
- It looks delicious.

638
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,890
I see a sticker on each of them.

639
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,080
This is fascinating.

640
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,550
- We'll start with the winning team.
- Okay. Go ahead.

641
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,280
You can choose
seven pieces from them.

642
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,820
- Seven pieces?
- Come, Baby. Pick our bread.

643
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,250
I like this one.
This is my favorite.

644
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,490
- Pick one.
- Okay.

645
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,520
I like the red bean flavor.

646
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,200
Take out the stickers
and reveal them right away.

647
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,230
- Right now?
- Okay.

648
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,230
What could it be?

649
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,970
- Which one did you get?
- It looks delicious.

650
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,260
It's not good to pick
the same image. What is it?

651
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,570
(What could be the 1st Runningmon
they picked?)

652
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,110
(Team Gyeong Hye will reveal
their Runningmon stickers.)

653
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,420
It's hard to get a good one.

654
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,480
(They got 2 Woojaemon stickers.)

655
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,740
- Is it our turn?
- I want soboro bread.

656
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,620
Is it Woojaemon?

657
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,250
- You can pick three pieces.
- It's Jaeseokmon.

658
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,390
Oh, good.

659
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,480
(Team Gyeong Hye got
Jaeseokmon and Woojaemon.)

660
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,630
I got another Jaeseokmon sticker. Darn.

661
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,930
I got a Jihyomon sticker.

662
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,230
Jihyomon? We got three so far.

663
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,590
Hey, I got a different one.

664
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,900
- I got Sominmon.
- It's Sominmon.

665
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,930
(They've found Sominmon as well.)

666
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,020
- What is it?
- I got this one.

667
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,400
- I see an orange color.
- Then what about...

668
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,140
- It's Jongkookmon.
- It's Jongkookmon.

669
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,870
We've collected
five different stickers.

670
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,170
(Team Gyeong Hye has collected
5 stickers so far.)

671
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,480
It's Jihyomon. Darn it.

672
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,770
(They already have Jihyomon.)

673
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,270
- That's right.
- My, this is awesome.

674
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,910
(Team Gyeong Hye got 5 stickers.
What about Team Woo Seok?)

675
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,270
- Hey, I got a different one.
- What?

676
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,480
- I...
- It's Sominmon.

677
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,810
I picked myself.

678
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,240
- It's Jaeseokmon.
- It's Jaeseokmon.

679
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,540
- Sominmon.
- I'm the only one left.

680
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,960
- We picked ourselves.
- Woo Seok, what did you get?

681
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,420
- Oh, it's Gyeonghyemon.
- Gyeonghyemon.

682
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,420
- Okay.
- Gyeonghyemon.

683
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,520
We got all different stickers.

684
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,890
- Put them in the almanac.
- Okay.

685
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,590
Sominmon.

686
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,160
- Which one is it? Is it Locust?
- It's Jaeseokmon.

687
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,250
Jaeseokmon.

688
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,790
Gosh, it's Jaeseokmon. Darn.

689
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,870
- Wait. What is this?
- What is it?

690
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,090
- What is it?
- This one is Jaeseokmon too.

691
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,530
- What is it? I don't see the name.
- What is this?

692
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,670
- I like bread.
- It's Woojaemon.

693
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,300
- It's Woojaemon.
- This one is Sechanmon.

694
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,940
- Woo Jae is a mantis.
- Woo Jae, you are...

695
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,880
- I'm a mantis?
- We picked different stickers.

696
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,640
That's a relief.
We didn't pick the same one, right?

697
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,650
They're all different.
Check that one too.

698
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,880
We'll begin the first mission
after you change your clothes.

699
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,340
- Okay.
- Got it.

700
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,980
(So Min is
sitting far away from Woo Seok.)

701
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,420
So Min, sit here.

702
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,920
- It's okay. Please sit there.
- I want to sit here.

703
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,390
- I'm comfortable here too.
- Come on.

704
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,890
- Stop it, Suk Jin.
- Come and sit here.

705
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,320
- You guys...
- Why don't you sit there?

706
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,290
You guys always ruin everything.

707
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,590
- Just mind your own business.
- I can't believe you.

708
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,170
- I really want to...
- Mind your own business, will you?

709
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,790
I want to lean back here.

710
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,230
There's no backrest here.

711
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,260
- Please just leave me alone.
- I want to lean back.

712
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,910
You're telling us to leave you be,
but you asked him about his age.

713
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,980
- He has long arms and legs.
- How old are you, Woo Seok?

714
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,510
- How old are you?
- I'm 32.

715
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,080
- I was born in 1991.
- You're older than I thought.

716
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,150
What did you say?

717
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,480
What do you mean by that?

718
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,050
- You two don't have a big age gap?
- I think that's the case.

719
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,190
- So Min.
- "You're older than I thought."

720
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,780
Well, that's what Jong Kook thinks.

721
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,390
- Did she try to impress him?
- Yes.

722
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,630
- No.
- I see. Okay.

723
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,750
Do you have a girlfriend?

724
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,820
- Right?
- No, I don't.

725
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,520
Of course, he says
he doesn't have a girlfriend.

726
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,930
- What is it?
- He doesn't have a girlfriend.

727
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,170
- It was so funny.
- That's none of my business.

728
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,230
(Smiling)

729
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,410
My gosh. He won't stop it.

730
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,480
Please let me focus on my work.

731
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,110
If you keep going on like this...

732
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,950
I'm just messing with you.
Hey, I'm just joking around.

733
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,210
- I can do that.
- That'd be great.

734
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,680
- I'm just joking around.
- Okay.

735
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,120
I told him
that I was just joking around.

736
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
(Suk Jin told So Min right away.)

737
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,160
Hey, by the way, So Min,
why not Woo Jae?

738
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,580
- Woo Jae...
- I think he's attractive.

739
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,520
- Of course, he's fabulous.
- There's no man like him.

740
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,460
- But if you're this skinny,
- Yes?

741
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,520
you should have a health check-up
as soon as possible.

742
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,490
- Woo Jae, that could be a sign.
- You should have a check-up.

743
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,140
- I think...
- You look pale today.

744
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,370
- That could be a sign.
- you have a gallbladder problem.

745
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,330
- They said my makeup looks good.
- It's either your gallbladder...

746
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,640
Or you can apply some BB cream.

747
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,330
- His face looks grayish, right?
- Right, he looks...

748
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,270
Woo Jae, let us know
if you don't feel well.

749
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:49,220
- You might be calcium deficient.
- Your skin looks rough.

750
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,450
- Maybe he's right.
- Woo Jae, you got dark circles.

751
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,280
- Well... I'm healthy.
- He had dark circles last time too.

752
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,840
- I don't get sick often.
- Did he?

753
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,550
- We'll begin the first mission.
- Okay.

754
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,020
Lately, there's been much debate
over many topics...

755
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,630
such as perilla leaf
and padded jackets.

756
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,790
That's true.

757
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:09,760
The first mission where you will
debate over new topics is...

758
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,290
I Even Thought of a Tragic End.

759
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,800
(The 1st mission of the race:
I Even Thought of a Tragic End)

760
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,210
It's a line from
"Guardian: The Lonely and Great God."

761
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,880
- We love debating.
- It's a line from the drama.

762
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,910
- Oh, right.
- "It'll be a tragic end."

763
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,810
After sharing your opinions
on one topic,

764
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:28,080
each of you will decide
if you think it's okay or not,

765
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,280
- and raise the signboard.
- We'll talk about the topic, right?

766
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,860
The staff members will hear
your opinions and make a conclusion.

767
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,290
- I see.
- Only the members...

768
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,460
with the same conclusion as
the majority of us will get points.

769
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,700
- Thank you.
- Okay.

770
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:40,930
- Thank you.
- That's great.

771
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,260
We'll give you the first topic.

772
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,260
After that, you will come up with
topics to debate over.

773
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,730
The first topic is...
Could you reveal it, please?

774
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,030
(The 1st topic will be revealed.)

775
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,480
One, two, three.

776
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,340
(My lover met my friend secretly
to prepare a party for me.)

777
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,410
- "My lover met..."
- "My lover met my friend..."

778
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,270
"to prepare our one-year dating
anniversary party." No.

779
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,980
(My lover met my friend secretly
for a month...)

780
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,690
(to prepare our 1 year dating
anniversary party.)

781
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,280
- That's not okay.
- That's not okay.

782
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,660
- It's okay.
- Here you go.

783
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,720
- I think it's okay.
- It's okay.

784
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,460
- No. Unacceptable.
- No.

785
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,020
- That's nonsense.
- They met for a month.

786
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,090
No.

787
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,790
(Thinking)

788
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:15,370
To prepare a party?
I hate the idea already.

789
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,730
- Don't think from your perspective.
- I hate surprises.

790
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,140
A few times would be understandable.
But a month is not acceptable.

791
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,110
- Something can happen.
- A month?

792
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,110
- A month is too long.
- Not just one day?

793
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,210
It must be a very big party.

794
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,650
A month is not acceptable.

795
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,950
- They'd rehearse everything. No.
- Of course.

796
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,450
- I'll explain the situation.
- Okay.

797
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,080
It may change our thoughts.

798
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,690
"On the one-year dating anniversary
with my boyfriend,"

799
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,510
"my boyfriend invited me
to a luxury hotel."

800
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,550
He booked a hotel room?

801
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,550
A hotel?

802
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,930
"I opened the door with excitement."

803
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,520
"The room was decorated
in a way that I like."

804
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,590
"My boyfriend showed up with a gift
saying he wanted to surprise me."

805
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,370
"When I was tearing up,
my friend showed up..."

806
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,560
"with a cake with candles on it
to congratulate us."

807
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,770
- Her friend shouldn't be there.
- That's ridiculous.

808
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,230
(The friend showed up with a cake.)

809
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,570
- She shouldn't be there.
- That's ridiculous.

810
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,950
- Her friend shouldn't be there.
- Why would they be in a hotel room?

811
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,240
- Why would they be there together?
- Calm down.

812
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,010
- Isn't that a little inappropriate?
- That's ridiculous.

813
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,840
- Both of them are weird.
- Hold on.

814
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,080
Let me read the rest.

815
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,660
- Gosh, seriously.
- "It turns out the two of them..."

816
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,310
"have been contacting each other
over the past month..."

817
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,780
- "to prepare the party secretly."
- Nonsense.

818
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,780
This is unacceptable.

819
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,230
- This is too much.
- There must be another reason.

820
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,260
If they met just one day,
it would be so nice.

821
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,400
- Exactly. It'd be nice.
- That's right.

822
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,730
- But for a month...
- Why would it take so long?

823
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,940
- A month is long enough...
- But they didn't meet every day.

824
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,200
for a man and a woman
to get attached to each other.

825
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,330
- It's totally unacceptable.
- A month is too long...

826
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,500
based on what most people would
think about it.

827
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,070
- A month is too long.
- That's too much.

828
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,910
- But they wouldn't talk every day.
- How big could a party be?

829
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,300
They would meet once a week,

830
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,040
- four times in that month.
- No, I don't think so.

831
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,120
- They'd meet every day.
- They spent a month.

832
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,810
- A month is too long.
- They could fall in love.

833
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,220
- It's not a really big party.
- Think about it.

834
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,460
Can't you see what will happen
after that?

835
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,510
He'll call her friend and say,

836
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,160
"Thank you for your help.
My girlfriend loved it."

837
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,230
"I'd like to treat you
to a nice meal."

838
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,490
- With his girlfriend too.
- Right.

839
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,090
- That's not right.
- If they prepared it for a month,

840
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,260
one of them would end up crying.

841
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,590
One of them would cry
after the party. Don't you think so?

842
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,470
It seems that no one here
trusts other people.

843
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,730
(It seems that no one here
trusts other people.)

844
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,410
- I mean...
- What did you just say about us?

845
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,210
We don't trust others?

846
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,570
- We do trust other people.
- You're too naive.

847
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,270
- That's right.
- You should trust them.

848
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,950
I understand
they had good intentions,

849
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,420
- but a month is too long.
- You'll know when you find the one.

850
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,280
Hang on. This shows
our different relationship statuses.

851
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,810
- The anxious ones talk a lot.
- It's not acceptable.

852
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,050
They shouldn't meet up
without letting her know.

853
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,250
Absolutely not.

854
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,820
- That's not okay.
- It's not okay.

855
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,930
- You see, he spent a month...
- Exactly. I agree.

856
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,820
- preparing it for his girlfriend.
- Yes.

857
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,400
- He did it for his girlfriend.
- Right.

858
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,760
- So I think it's understandable.
- But...

859
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,230
- I think it is.
- Do you think it's good for her?

860
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,910
- He did it...
- Then...

861
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,300
- Woo Seok, imagine this.
- Oh, I guess...

862
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,410
it's because he's handsome.

863
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,770
- It's because he's handsome.
- Let's say...

864
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,770
- Let's say...
- That's why he's confident.

865
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,480
- Suk Jin, don't say that.
- It's true.

866
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,720
Clearly, you don't know
how a debate works. Just be quiet.

867
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,770
He told him to be quiet.

868
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,810
He told him to be quiet
during a debate.

869
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,890
- Gosh.
- You should listen to others too.

870
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,360
You're the only one who's talking.

871
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,930
I'm trying to ask Woo Seok
a question.

872
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,630
I'm going to give him a situation.

873
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,020
Let's say you have a girlfriend.
She meets your best friend...

874
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,090
- Like Woo Jae?
- She meets Woo Jae...

875
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,560
It's okay if it's Woo Jae.

876
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,140
- Woo Jae is not a good example.
- I would understand.

877
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,410
(He wouldn't even worry about them.)

878
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,670
- Think of someone attractive.
- Someone popular.

879
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,730
Okay. It's not Woo Jae.

880
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,770
- I'll think of someone else.
- Someone else but Woo Jae.

881
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,710
- Hey.
- Think of someone more handsome.

882
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,180
- I'm irresistible.
- Someone else but Woo Jae.

883
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,910
- You could lose your girlfriend.
- Someone else but Woo Jae.

884
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,070
How about him? The popular...

885
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,310
How about Park Bo Gum?
They co-starred in a drama.

886
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,920
No, not Bo Gum. What was his name?

887
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,010
- Who?
- It can be me.

888
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,010
- Nam Joo Hyuk.
- Not you. Right, Joo Hyuk.

889
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,720
- Nam Joo Hyuk?
- Yes, Joo Hyuk.

890
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,810
- Nam Joo Hyuk again?
- Joo Hyuk.

891
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,860
- Nam Joo Hyuk. Good.
- Joo Hyuk.

892
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,960
- He and Joo Hyuk seem close.
- Joo Hyuk is popular.

893
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,360
- I saw them at the gym.
- Please leave Nam Joo Hyuk...

894
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,160
- and Jang Ki Yong out.
- Joo Hyuk...

895
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,990
- You're tearing up...
- It's Joo Hyuk.

896
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,370
- as your girlfriend surprises you.
- See? It's weird.

897
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,700
- Then Joo Hyun suddenly shows up.
- Right.

898
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,260
"Congratulations, Woo Seok.
I helped her prepare this party."

899
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,730
- How would you feel?
- All day long.

900
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,940
They're wearing comfortable clothes.

901
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,640
It wouldn't be so easy...
What kind of clothes?

902
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,380
- Very comfortable...
- They're wearing pajamas.

903
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,300
- They're wearing pajamas?
- Yes.

904
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,950
(Pajamas?)

905
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,680
Why would they be wearing pajamas?

906
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,310
- Isn't that over the top?
- They're wearing pajamas?

907
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,690
- They're wearing casual outfits.
- A bathrobe.

908
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,840
- They're wearing...
- Revealing clothes.

909
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,220
- bathrobes.
- They're wearing revealing clothes.

910
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,480
- Joo Hyuk is wearing a bathrobe?
- Yes.

911
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,580
And then Joo Hyuk tells you,

912
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,020
"Hey, your girlfriend did more work
than I did."

913
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,090
(Hey, your girlfriend did more work
than I did.)

914
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,990
- That's not okay.
- I would be so upset.

915
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:07,990
- That's not okay.
- That would...

916
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,170
make Woo Seok the third wheel.

917
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,790
I would feel like
I'm the third wheel.

918
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,910
- But still...
- Would you be okay with that?

919
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,910
- But it's Joo Hyuk.
- Would it be okay?

920
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,800
- He has so much pride.
- But it's Joo Hyuk.

921
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,300
I think he's simply
very understanding.

922
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,710
- To be honest...
- Think more about it.

923
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,070
- Woo Seok is amazing.
- Let's give him time to think.

924
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,310
What about you, Woo Jae?

925
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,010
- He's more of an expert than me.
- What do you think?

926
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,080
- Imagine the situation.
- Woo Jae, be honest with us.

927
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,810
- Don't lie to us.
- Woo Jae, how would you feel?

928
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,550
- Did Woo Seok say it's okay?
- Yes.

929
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,920
I think it's okay.

930
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,430
- That's his inferiority complex.
- Why?

931
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,820
- You don't think it's okay.
- That's his inferiority complex.

932
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,200
- Who's my friend?
- Well...

933
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,700
- Joo Hyuk.
- It's Nam Joo Hyuk.

934
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,900
Please stop talking about him.

935
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,760
Jong Kook,
I won't bring Yoon Eun Hye up.

936
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,300
That's not the same.
What are you talking about?

937
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,970
What if it's Woo Seok?

938
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,680
How many of us think it's okay?

939
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,730
I don't think I can understand that.

940
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,270
- Of course, you can't accept it.
- It's because...

941
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,570
- I think it might be okay.
- It doesn't matter...

942
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,220
who my friend is.
They've been meeting for a month...

943
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,310
- at a hotel.
- That's right.

944
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,310
They met at a hotel.
And imagine what could happen.

945
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,580
- It's just crazy.
- They wouldn't write it down.

946
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,660
- They would rehearse it.
- Yes.

947
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,730
- "Can you walk toward me?"
- Exactly.

948
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,190
- "I'll stand here."
- Yes.

949
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,930
- They would rehearse it.
- Of course.

950
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:13,260
You know how actors immerse
themselves in their characters...

951
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,090
- while acting, right?
- Right. It's not acceptable.

952
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,990
- I think...
- I think Ji Hyo would understand.

953
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,290
- No.
- Really?

954
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,610
- During the month,
- Right.

955
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,210
my boyfriend and my friend...

956
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,830
- would talk a lot on the phone.
- Right.

957
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,300
- They would share...
- They'd talk a lot together.

958
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,000
- their feelings.
- A month is too long.

959
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,740
I think that one of them would
develop feelings for the other.

960
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,010
- "How should I kiss her?"
- That's right.

961
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,190
- "Should I tilt my head this way?"
- Exactly.

962
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,810
- No way.
- They wouldn't go that far.

963
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,920
- I don't think so.
- No way.

964
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,190
They could do that.

965
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,550
I'm just saying
that it could happen.

966
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,660
- Definitely.
- No way.

967
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,490
But they would talk about me
the whole time.

968
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,050
So I think it'd be okay.

969
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,430
- No.
- That's exactly what I think.

970
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,560
- It's okay.
- Would you be okay with it?

971
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,670
I'd be totally okay with it.

972
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,990
- Are you serious?
- Hold on.

973
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,790
- Hey, do you really think so?
- You'd be okay with it?

974
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,440
- Or is it because Woo Seok said so?
- No.

975
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,410
- Woo Seok, do you think it's okay?
- She'd never be okay with it.

976
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,410
I don't think you'd be okay with it.

977
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,800
- My friend just helped him...
- She'd never be.

978
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,570
- show his love for me.
- But do you think...

979
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,680
- that they really need a month?
- Five hours would be enough.

980
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,010
Even a set for "Let's Go! Dream Team"
can be built in a week.

981
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,720
Even by a bunch of nobodies.

982
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,580
So I haven't seen my girlfriend
in a month?

983
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,810
- No.
- You met her.

984
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,860
- She met him while dating you.
- Right.

985
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,960
That's even worse.
She met him secretly and met me too.

986
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
- No.
- But Woo Jae...

987
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,520
- This is what I hate about this.
- You see...

988
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,900
On such a happy day,

989
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,400
he made me...

990
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,590
- have negative thoughts.
- Exactly.

991
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,900
- That's wrong.
- I agree. That's the key point.

992
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,940
- Exactly.
- I'm sorry, but stop being angry.

993
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,670
- It makes me so angry.
- But I think...

994
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,410
- Why are you so angry?
- You see...

995
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,440
- Let's say you walk into the room.
- Yes.

996
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,210
And you see Suk Jin...

997
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,000
behind your girlfriend.
Would you be angry?

998
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,380
- Wouldn't that be okay?
- Suk Jin helped your girlfriend.

999
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,220
I wouldn't be angry
if it was Suk Jin.

1000
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,450
- I wouldn't be upset if it's you.
- If it's Suk Jin...

1001
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,450
I wouldn't be angry if it's him.

1002
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,810
- I'd be okay with it if it's you.
- Right.

1003
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,810
There are three people here
that wouldn't make me upset.

1004
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,130
- You wouldn't be angry.
- You, Jae Suk, and Suk Jin.

1005
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,860
I think it depends on
who the friend is.

1006
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,290
- Even if...
- I'd be happy if he does it for me.

1007
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,730
Even if Suk Jin shows up topless,
I wouldn't feel anything.

1008
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,090
That would be totally fine with me.

1009
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,440
- Honestly, I wouldn't be upset.
- Of course.

1010
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,490
- If it's Suk Jin...
- Right?

1011
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,710
I wouldn't be upset
if it's Se Chan either.

1012
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,370
I guess we've come to a conclusion.

1013
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,270
- Yes.
- We've come to a conclusion.

1014
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,710
- Now please...
- Shall we raise the board now?

1015
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,610
- Each of you, decide individually.
- Each of us?

1016
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:10,540
Okay. Ready. One, two, three.

1017
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,740
- It's not okay.
- It's not okay.

1018
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,190
- You said it was okay.
- Three.

1019
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,220
(Everyone thinks
that it's not okay.)

1020
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,450
(So Min and Woo Seok were convinced
in the end.)

1021
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,080
- Why... And Woo Seok too?
- I changed my mind.

1022
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,960
I mean,
I think that a month is too long.

1023
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,930
- Exactly. It's too long.
- I think it's too much.

1024
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,980
- Everyone thinks it's not okay.
- Yes.

1025
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,200
The majority of the staff members
concluded that it was okay.

1026
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,520
- So all of you got a point.
- Yes.

1027
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,670
And Team Woo Seok is taking the lead
because they have four members.

1028
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,090
- Okay.
- Good. Okay.

1029
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,830
- I see. That's how this works.
- I'm glad she changed her mind.

1030
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,910
We can catch up.

1031
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,210
Now, we'll begin the second round.

1032
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,940
You will come up with
a debatable situation...

1033
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,480
- Should we write on the board?
- just like this.

1034
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,680
- Oh, like that?
- I see.

1035
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,650
It'd be helpful if you guys could
share your experiences.

1036
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,720
Would a true story work too?

1037
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
(Would a true story work too?)

1038
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,120
- Of course.
- Do you have an idea?

1039
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
A story just popped into my head.

1040
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,660
- So Min is like a dating expert.
- Because of this,

1041
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,080
I had a really big fight
with my ex-boyfriend.

1042
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,230
- Tell us.
- All right.

1043
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,280
- What happened? Tell us.
- I'll just tell you.

1044
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,490
It happened when I was in my 20s.
One night,

1045
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,660
my boyfriend said...

1046
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,170
that he was hanging out
with his female friend.

1047
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,700
- Go on.
- And...

1048
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,790
my boyfriend didn't have a car
back then.

1049
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,900
Was he alone with her?

1050
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,530
- No, with a group of friends.
- I see.

1051
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,640
Since they were going the same way,

1052
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,140
his female friend gave him a ride.

1053
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,770
And my boyfriend said
he would pick me up...

1054
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:17,120
and drive me home on the way
because it was getting late.

1055
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
So I said, "Okay."
I knew his female friend too.

1056
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,010
I had met her once or twice,
and he'd told me about her a lot.

1057
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:24,010
My boyfriend and his female friend
came to pick me up.

1058
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,930
- He sat in the passenger seat.
- Right.

1059
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,660
His female friend drove,
and I sat in the back seat.

1060
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,250
I lived in Ilsan back then,

1061
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,060
- and he lived in Sangam-dong.
- Okay.

1062
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,400
- When we arrived at my house,
- Yes.

1063
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,410
I expected my boyfriend
to get out of the car.

1064
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,410
- But he didn't get out.
- I see.

1065
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,800
- That's weird.
- Then he said...

1066
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,000
(So Min's boyfriend said goodbye
to her while sitting in the car.)

1067
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,800
- "So Min, go home safely."
- Yes.

1068
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,150
- He went home in that car.
- It wouldn't have been a problem...

1069
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,220
if he had sat in the passenger seat
on the way to his house.

1070
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,540
- But it wasn't like that.
- Yes.

1071
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,550
They switched the seats
so he could drive.

1072
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,280
And his female friend...

1073
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,630
(So Min's boyfriend suddenly moved
to the driving seat.)

1074
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,730
- That's upsetting.
- His female friend...

1075
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,290
- sat next to him...
- That's...

1076
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,520
- in the passenger seat.
- That's ridiculous.

1077
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,400
- She sat in the passenger seat.
- My gosh.

1078
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,940
- Isn't that too weird?
- That's...

1079
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,090
- In the passenger seat.
- That's ridiculous.

1080
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,300
- She sat in the passenger seat.
- Are you...

1081
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,300
- Are you sure...
- I was... Yes?

1082
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,410
- Are you sure you two were dating?
- It's understandable.

1083
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,070
Yes. My gosh.

1084
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,110
I just thought...

1085
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,540
- Of course, they were together.
- It wasn't like that.

1086
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,270
- Maybe they were a couple, and...
- Then why didn't he drive before?

1087
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,920
- I don't understand.
- Exactly.

1088
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,420
- So... That's not all.
- That's...

1089
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,310
I was so upset,
but I didn't let it show.

1090
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,960
I wondered if I was overreacting
because they acted...

1091
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,930
- as if it had been a normal thing.
- It's weird. I would've been upset.

1092
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,590
I pondered on it that night,
and talked to him the next day.

1093
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,400
- "Honestly, it made me upset."
- Right.

1094
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,490
- "Why did you have to..."
- Of course.

1095
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,290
- His answer must've mattered.
- "Why did you drive her car?"

1096
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:45,640
Yes, I asked him why he drove.
He said that he didn't go home...

1097
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,370
because he was going to pick up
her birthday gift for him.

1098
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,270
He stopped by her office...

1099
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,610
before going home to pick that up.

1100
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,740
- I asked why he drove her car.
- Exactly.

1101
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,180
He said, "I asked her to let me
drive because I wanted to."

1102
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,180
- He wanted to drive her car?
- Why?

1103
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,220
He wanted to drive her car...

1104
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,540
- It must've been a nice car.
- Well...

1105
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,810
- I guess so.
- That's understandable.

1106
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:02,920
- That's what he said.
- That's...

1107
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,620
- understandable.
- "Don't get the wrong idea."

1108
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,930
"But you should've gotten out
of her car with me,"

1109
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,320
- "and taken a bus or a taxi."
- He lived near your house.

1110
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,490
"I understand that you went home
in her car."

1111
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,820
"But why would you drive her car?"

1112
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,170
- Right.
- "It made me upset."

1113
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,170
But he couldn't understand me.

1114
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,840
So Min, were you close
to his female friend?

1115
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,690
No, I just heard a lot about her.

1116
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,300
- I only saw her a couple of times.
- I don't understand his friend.

1117
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,900
- Maybe his friend was...
- The fact that he came...

1118
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,800
- in her car to pick you up...
- That's weird.

1119
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,940
He should've switched the seats
after getting out of the apartment.

1120
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,940
- If he wanted to hide it.
- No.

1121
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,110
- No. That's not good.
- Isn't hiding it even weirder?

1122
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,320
- That's even worse.
- That's not what I mean.

1123
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,740
- That's even worse.
- What I'm saying is...

1124
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,920
that even if he wanted to drive,

1125
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,320
- Then you wouldn't have known.
- he shouldn't have done it...

1126
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,820
- while you were watching him.
- No, that's even worse.

1127
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,130
I usually don't feel this way,
but I think I would be upset.

1128
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,760
- Right?
- Why?

1129
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,050
The fact
that they switched the seats...

1130
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,820
- would bother me for some reason.
- Of course.

1131
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,990
Think about it.

1132
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:51,260
We should all try to think
in So Min's shoes.

1133
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,360
- Of course, it would bother me.
- Imagine how you would feel.

1134
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,510
You thank him for giving you a ride.

1135
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,670
Then turn around to go home,
and your girlfriend...

1136
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,570
- switches the seats and drives.
- Exactly.

1137
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,820
What if her male friend is Suk Jin?

1138
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,190
- It would be okay.
- What if it's Suk Jin?

1139
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,840
(Everything would be okay
if it were Seok Sam.)

1140
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,920
I knew it.

1141
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,650
Why would it be okay if it's me?

1142
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,920
- It depends on the person.
- That hurts.

1143
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,130
- It depends on the person.
- Yes.

1144
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,260
- What's wrong with me?
- Anything would be okay, right?

1145
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,650
I wouldn't worry if it was him.

1146
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,490
- I wouldn't worry.
- Why?

1147
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,490
- It's always the subtle nuance.
- It's hard to say.

1148
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,900
It's a gray area.

1149
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,210
It's not an absolute dealbreaker.
Tell us something more serious.

1150
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,510
It happened more than ten years ago,
but it still hurts.

1151
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,570
- Really?
- Really?

1152
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,670
- Is she crying?
- She's crying.

1153
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,210
- Don't cry.
- You should let it go.

1154
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,570
- What? I'm not crying, Woo Seok.
- Oh, I see.

1155
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,010
Woo Seok just...

1156
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,440
(Woo Seok's words helped her
get over it.)

1157
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,740
- He was her boyfriend.
- If there was something going on...

1158
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,710
between them,
they wouldn't have picked you up.

1159
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,710
That's exactly what he said.

1160
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,190
- They wouldn't have picked you up.
- Right.

1161
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,460
You see, it's strange
that people always lie...

1162
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,150
that their opposite-sex friends are
same-sex friends to their partners.

1163
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,090
- To prevent any trouble.
- It's pointless...

1164
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,360
- to ask about them.
- I heard...

1165
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,570
that they can never be friends
unless they're attracted to...

1166
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,860
each other by more than 70 percent.

1167
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,070
They don't keep each other around.

1168
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,630
- It affects your friendship.
- They don't keep each other around.

1169
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,900
- Well, that's...
- Only then,

1170
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,570
- That's not necessarily true.
- a man and a woman can be friends.

1171
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,630
Also, in dramas like "Propose",

1172
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,710
the lead characters
who are best friends...

1173
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,070
- Ryu Si Won and Kim Hee Seon...
- You watched too many dramas.

1174
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,510
- That's not true.
- They become lovers.

1175
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,900
- It's a drama.
- Hey.

1176
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,940
Think about me and Song Eun I.
We've been friends for 30 years.

1177
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,190
I believe that a man and a woman
can never be friends.

1178
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,920
- I think it's possible.
- It's possible.

1179
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,590
- I don't think so.
- It's possible.

1180
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,690
- It's possible.
- No, it's not.

1181
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,190
- It's possible.
- I also think...

1182
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,760
- It's possible.
- I think it's possible.

1183
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,860
- I don't think it's possible.
- It's possible.

1184
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,960
- I don't think it's possible.
- Let's debate this.

1185
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,300
(So they began a new debate.)

1186
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,260
- It's possible.
- No. Let's debate this.

1187
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,340
- Okay. This is our new topic.
- A man and a woman can be friends.

1188
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
Hold on.

1189
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,070
You should be able to take a shower
with your opposite-sex friend.

1190
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,380
- Hey!
- What did you say?

1191
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,610
- Why?
- Come on.

1192
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,610
(Hold on. You should be able to
take a shower with your friend.)

1193
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,380
(Disgusted)

1194
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,510
- How can anyone do that?
- That's ridiculous.

1195
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,710
If she's your friend,
you can shower with her.

1196
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,110
That's too much.

1197
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,010
- No, I can't do that. Come on.
- That's nonsense.

1198
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,530
- You know I'm right.
- I agree.

1199
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,420
You should have no interest in her
in a romantic way...

1200
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,690
- if she's your friend.
- Still, I can't do that.

1201
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,730
- There should be no reaction.
- If your female friend...

1202
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,170
(Indifferent)

1203
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,320
- Right. But...
- What?

1204
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,840
(A common sight at a small sauna)

1205
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,900
You know I'm right.
You should be able to do that.

1206
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,670
- If you really are just friends.
- No.

1207
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,740
Are you sick?
Take a break if you are.

1208
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,780
How about this, then?

1209
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,940
There have been
many controversies...

1210
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,740
such as the perilla leaf debate
and the shrimp debate.

1211
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,550
The most recent one is
your boyfriend zipping up...

1212
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,490
- a friend's jacket on a cold day.
- A long padded jacket.

1213
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,710
Of course that shouldn't be done.

1214
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,280
Why would one go that far?

1215
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,590
- Of course.
- That's crossing the line.

1216
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,990
But what if...

1217
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,320
someone in front of you...

1218
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,230
was stuck?

1219
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,630
Even so...

1220
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,030
- What if the zipper's stuck?
- You can help in that case.

1221
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,340
- You can help with that.
- The act itself...

1222
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,340
is too warm.

1223
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,480
You only do that
for your own girlfriend.

1224
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,570
Gosh, listen up.

1225
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,840
- Only if the girlfriend allows it.
- Let me conclude this.

1226
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,170
- This really turns into a debate.
- Listen up.

1227
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,650
- Over here.
- Listen up!

1228
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:52,920
- I...
- Let me conclude this.

1229
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,090
Seriously?
Why are you arguing over this?

1230
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,590
- Over here.
- Listen up!

1231
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,010
Here's the thing with the zipper.

1232
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,960
- It shouldn't be done.
- Let's say that...

1233
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,550
someone is having trouble
zipping up his or her jacket.

1234
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,420
It's weird to
lend a hand right away.

1235
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,530
What if that person asks?

1236
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,460
But what if the zipper was stuck...

1237
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,130
and even my girlfriend
is trying to help her?

1238
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,240
And my girlfriend
couldn't help it either.

1239
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,300
- Only then...
- Of course you can help with that.

1240
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,440
- That scenario is okay.
- But that's an exception.

1241
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,480
- That much is allowed.
- Of course it is.

1242
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,940
What about this?

1243
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:23,740
She's trying to zip up her jacket
and her nose is running.

1244
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,110
"It's darn cold!"

1245
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,440
"It's so cold."

1246
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,820
- My girlfriend didn't see it.
- You still shouldn't.

1247
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,320
I'm the only one who sees her...

1248
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,380
and her nose is running.

1249
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,690
- "It's so cold."
- No way.

1250
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,730
- No?
- No way.

1251
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,820
- Why not?
- With the perilla leaf,

1252
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,190
the nuance is everything.

1253
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,730
Holding it gently...

1254
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,460
- could be an issue.
- The perilla leaf?

1255
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,300
No one will be able to eat it
if she can't get hers!

1256
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,300
We're only helping her eat
so that we can as well.

1257
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,570
- But the padded jacket...
- You're right, Jong Kook.

1258
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,880
- She's preventing us from eating.
- He's right.

1259
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,170
But zipping up someone's jacket...

1260
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,880
My helping her
is for the greater good.

1261
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,170
Who cares if she zips up
her padded jacket?

1262
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,820
- The padded jack is not okay.
- Right.

1263
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,760
We can't go
for second rounds of drinks...

1264
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,710
until she zips up her jacket!

1265
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,380
She can just wrap it around herself.

1266
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,150
- But her nose is running!
- Like this.

1267
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,420
Hold on a second.

1268
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,170
Gyeong Hye, what do you think?

1269
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,170
This is what happens
when you zip up a coat.

1270
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,860
Watch this.
It starts from down here...

1271
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:25,570
- and they end up face to face.
- Exactly.

1272
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,340
(An unexpected eye contact)

1273
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,210
- You're right.
- What about this, then?

1274
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,820
- How about this?
- This.

1275
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,150
Like this.

1276
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,590
- Here.
- Down to up.

1277
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,780
In that case...

1278
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,010
Her hair can get caught...

1279
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,210
and problems like that
will only make things awkward.

1280
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,650
Can you pull the zipper down?

1281
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,490
- That's weirder.
- Unzipping the jacket.

1282
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,630
Unzipping...

1283
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,230
Unzipping is weirder.

1284
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,420
- Unzipping...
- Unzipping the jacket?

1285
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,190
- No way.
- What if...

1286
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,190
What if the zipper gets stuck?

1287
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,400
- No way.
- Woo Seok, what do you think?

1288
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,610
- Well...
- After you unzip it...

1289
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,400
It's all about
not making eye contact.

1290
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,130
- Exactly.
- That's not what matters.

1291
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,300
- Without looking?
- Like this.

1292
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,240
- Must you go to such lengths?
- That's weirder.

1293
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,650
- Is it?
- Well...

1294
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,840
- You see...
- It's like this.

1295
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,340
This is where you stop
when zipping it up.

1296
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,780
It shouldn't reach the stop.

1297
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,760
- You just match the teeth for her?
- Yes, the teeth.

1298
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,360
All you need to do
is align the teeth for her.

1299
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,460
- That...
- That's a wise solution.

1300
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,960
Right? All you need to do
is align the teeth for her.

1301
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
- There's no need to zip it all up.
- Exactly.

1302
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,230
She's not that important, you know.

1303
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,300
- Then the conclusion...
- I have something to ask.

1304
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,860
- Go ahead.
- What if...

1305
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,460
my boyfriend...

1306
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,860
is good friends...

1307
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,510
- with one of my female friends.
- Right.

1308
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,670
- Let's say that she moved.
- Okay.

1309
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,840
Did he help him with the boxes?

1310
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,800
- He must've hung the curtains.
- Yes, the curtains!

1311
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,010
- Is he insane?
- Are you kidding me?

1312
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,190
(The boyfriend hung the curtains
for her female friend.)

1313
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,650
Gyeong Hye, that's insane!

1314
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,190
What if this happened?

1315
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,900
(He shows his soft belly.)

1316
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,800
This is more than okay.

1317
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,030
- Just a second.
- This is okay.

1318
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,170
(His squishy belly
gets him the okay sign.)

1319
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,260
- It's okay as long as it's you.
- Hold on.

1320
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,940
- You're fine.
- There's no issue with you.

1321
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,300
- You're good to go.
- Wasn't that charming though?

1322
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,130
- You're good.
- It's okay if that guy is you.

1323
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,480
- As long as it's me?
- I heard...

1324
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,440
that women find men charming
when they help with such things.

1325
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,920
- But...
- Call a handyman over instead.

1326
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,610
- That's just wrong.
- Of course.

1327
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,610
Hanging my own curtains
is a nuisance.

1328
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,690
Exactly.

1329
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,990
I can hang the curtains
for my girlfriend,

1330
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,260
but for my girlfriend's friend?

1331
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,400
That's absurd.

1332
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,630
What if that boyfriend...

1333
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:31,960
is the crafty type?
I'd allow it in that case.

1334
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,260
- If he's a professional handyman?
- Yes.

1335
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,110
He should at least
tell his girlfriend though.

1336
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,110
- As long as he's paid.
- Right.

1337
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,480
When he leaves...

1338
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,670
(As long as he's paid)

1339
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,050
- As long as he's paid.
- "That'll be 120 dollars."

1340
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,280
- Then that's more than okay.
- "Is it 100 dollars?"

1341
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,670
(It's fine if he gets paid for it.)

1342
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,840
- Good.
- That's fine.

1343
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,690
- But...
- Nicely said.

1344
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:50,820
A professional handyman.

1345
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,610
What should we vote for first?

1346
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,780
- The curtain debate?
- Yes, the curtain.

1347
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,260
- Let's vote first.
- The curtain debate.

1348
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,650
- Yes, the curtain.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1349
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,730
- Not okay!
- It's not okay.

1350
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,230
- No way.
- Not okay.

1351
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,360
- It's just weird.
- What about the driving debate?

1352
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,300
- I need a conclusion.
- The driving?

1353
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,440
Can we end this?
I'm too exhausted to continue.

1354
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,590
- I mean...
- All right!

1355
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,400
Only speak if you've been
in a relationship before.

1356
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,480
Then sit. Marriage...
That came out wrong.

1357
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,740
- Then...
- I meant, conclusion.

1358
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,510
Can you be friends
with someone of the opposite gender?

1359
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,320
- What?
- Friends of the opposite gender.

1360
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,480
It's a fundamental question.

1361
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,840
- Is it possible or not?
- Possible or not?

1362
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,990
Of course it is.

1363
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,340
Hold on a second.
What have we been doing so far?

1364
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,190
Just hurry up with it.

1365
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,860
- Let's get this over with.
- The friend thing.

1366
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:29,150
- Can you be friends or not?
- Yes or no?

1367
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,820
- Can you be friends?
- I think you can.

1368
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,730
In 1, 2, 3.

1369
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:33,800
- No way.
- Yes, you can.

1370
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,690
- Are you serious?
- Yes, you can be friends.

1371
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,820
Two, three.

1372
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,440
- No way.
- Yes, you can.

1373
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,630
- Yes, you can be friends.
- Are you serious?

1374
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:42,030
Let's hear from the staff next.

1375
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,530
- Of course.
- You're okay with it?

1376
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,800
Of course it's okay.

1377
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,340
That concludes your first game.

1378
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,710
In first place is Team Woo Seok.

1379
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,240
- Us?
- Really?

1380
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,340
- They have more on their team.
- Exactly.

1381
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,010
In second place is Team Gyeong Hye.

1382
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,380
(2nd place: Team Gyeong Hye)

1383
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,760
And in third place is Team Woo Jae.

1384
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,880
(3rd place: Team Woo Jae)

1385
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,260
Why do I finish last
every time I'm on the show?

1386
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,760
What's wrong with me?

1387
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,420
Shall we get started?

1388
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,960
The winning team may select seven.

1389
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,070
- Seven?
- Really?

1390
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,090
- We should pick the others.
- The cream bun.

1391
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,300
(Team Woo Seok)

1392
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,400
- Sominmon.
- Sominmon.

1393
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,170
- Another Sominmon?
- Yes, a Sominmon.

1394
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,780
- Do we already have one?
- Yes, from earlier.

1395
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,110
(Team Woo Seok)

1396
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,300
I have the Hahamon sticker.

1397
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,550
And I have Jihyomon.

1398
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,510
Your exterior is all rocks.
Check it out.

1399
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,240
- Rocks.
- Rocks?

1400
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,380
Woo Seok, did you open yours?

1401
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,550
- Not yet.
- Am I a rock golem?

1402
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,510
- We need what we don't have.
- Another Jaeseokmon.

1403
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,590
You should keep this for now.

1404
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,130
- And the Sominmon.
- I have Woojaemon.

1405
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,530
- We don't have that.
- What about Jongkookmon?

1406
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:41,260
- We don't have that either.
- We don't have it.

1407
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,090
And Hahamon? Hey, we're almost done.

1408
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,740
- I think we have them all.
- We have seven.

1409
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,860
Isn't this something we don't have?

1410
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,240
Wooseokmon, Jongkookmon,
Seokjinmon, Hahamon,

1411
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,130
Jihyomon, and Sominmon.

1412
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,110
(Team Woo Jae)

1413
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,150
Darn it. We have another Woojaemon.

1414
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,320
But this will be of help.

1415
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,650
- Why are there so many of them?
- It'll be of help.

1416
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,050
It's another Woojaemon.

1417
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,280
(This team is also frustrated
by Woojaemon.)

1418
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,610
Woojaemon, Jaeseokmon, Sominmon.

1419
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:06,920
- We don't have it.
- Jaeseokmon.

1420
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,150
We don't have Sechanmon.

1421
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,820
You'll now relocate,
play another game,

1422
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,900
and also have lunch.

1423
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,530
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1424
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:14,570
This bun's quite good.

1425
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,630
Let's go.

1426
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:17,840
- Do we sit with our team?
- Yes, please.

1427
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,570
So Min should sit with him.

1428
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:21,840
It's fine, Jong Kook.

1429
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,340
- You're over here.
- Sit there.

1430
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,780
- Do we have designated seats?
- How natural did that seem?

1431
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,550
They only sat in the order
they got on the bus.

1432
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:30,840
(So Min sits next to Woo Seok
thanks to the cheeky matchmakers.)

1433
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,210
It's only a coincidence.

1434
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,380
Cheeky, aren't you?

1435
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,090
- Put your seatbelt on.
- Now, I'm the one uncomfortable.

1436
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,150
I thought you were
helping me with it.

1437
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,260
Here I am sitting next to them.

1438
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,110
- This?
- I thought you were helping.

1439
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,650
- This goes over there.
- It startled me, you see.

1440
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,260
- Are you doing it for me?
- No, this one's mine.

1441
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,460
- Se Chan's not that considerate.
- I was just doing mine,

1442
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,130
but she thought I was doing hers.

1443
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:48,730
This calls for a debate too.

1444
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,190
Yes, the belt debate.

1445
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,800
What about this, then?

1446
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,130
A female friend of mine
is sitting next to my boyfriend...

1447
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,860
and he did this
after hitting the breaks.

1448
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,010
- That?
- Goodness.

1449
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,650
The arm shouldn't shoot out.
Maybe only this much.

1450
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,610
How about this?

1451
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,320
Like this. Just with the elbows.

1452
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,070
Wouldn't this be allowed?

1453
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,340
Yes, that's fine.

1454
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,420
Isn't that okay?

1455
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,820
This is more than okay.

1456
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,280
- This is perfectly fine.
- Right?

1457
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,780
The debate won't end.

1458
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,460
- Here's a good one.
- What is it?

1459
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,420
- His friend...
- It happened for real.

1460
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,260
A good friend of mine...

1461
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,460
did this for my ex-girlfriend...

1462
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,820
and my fist shot out.

1463
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,800
Did you actually punch him?

1464
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:26,130
No, more like this.

1465
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,460
- Like this?
- Even if it was for fun...

1466
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,840
He should've
mentioned it to you instead.

1467
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,240
- "There's something on her."
- He could've told her directly.

1468
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,780
"You have something on here."

1469
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,050
- Of course.
- There are some people...

1470
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:37,610
who act before thinking.

1471
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,380
- But it's none of your business.
- Woo Jae,

1472
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,940
- that...
- You must be sick again.

1473
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,010
Face the front, will you?

1474
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,210
It's an eyesore.

1475
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:45,490
(He passes out
from the harsh words.)

1476
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:46,960
- It's an eyesore.
- Why do it for her?

1477
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,050
CPR is allowed, right?

1478
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,990
- It's a crisis.
- When the boyfriend is there?

1479
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:52,190
Not you though.

1480
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:53,490
It's a no for smokers.

1481
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,730
- Of course.
- Would you allow it though?

1482
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,030
You'll faint while performing CPR.

1483
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,610
The one receiving it
might be against it.

1484
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,840
So Min's never been the one
to sit in the corner.

1485
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,840
You're not as talkative
as you usually are.

1486
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,940
It's to flirt with Woo Seok,
of course.

1487
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,670
- So Min...
- So that's where you are!

1488
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,190
She hasn't sat behind me in a while.

1489
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,090
- But...
- Yes?

1490
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:19,190
You don't seem
like the older woman though.

1491
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,380
- Woo Jae seems jealous.
- Me?

1492
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,530
- Even Se Chan gets chosen more.
- Right.

1493
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,800
I'm way more charming than he is.

1494
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,730
- Back in the day...
- Yes, on "Love Me Actually."

1495
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,530
Woo Jae's great,

1496
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,170
but he's not exactly charming.

1497
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,740
Yes, there's nothing
special about him.

1498
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,360
- That's his problem.
- Exactly.

1499
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,170
- That's harsh.
- How can we interpret this?

1500
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,380
- You're great as a friend, but...
- He's very approachable.

1501
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,380
- Yes, he's approachable.
- However...

1502
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,510
It's why people like us adore him.

1503
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,210
- We love you, you know.
- Right.

1504
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:44,610
It's why we adore you.

1505
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:46,510
If I were a woman,
I wouldn't date you.

1506
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,880
I've been up against him, remember?

1507
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:50,920
When?

1508
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,490
He isn't charming at all.
I know for sure.

1509
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:53,780
I'll beat him every time.

1510
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,550
- He lost to Se Chan.
- That's right.

1511
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:56,990
- He was crushed.
- Is the air conditioner on?

1512
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,650
Switch it off.
It'll only make you sicker.

1513
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,150
Calcium is what you need right now.

1514
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:02,070
You need calcium.

1515
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:04,240
Can we get a blanket for him?

1516
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,190
- But Woo Jae...
- He needs one.

1517
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,360
Just so you know,
Se Chan is super charming.

1518
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,940
- Se Chan is...
- Se Chan is super charming.

1519
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,340
Really? How so?

1520
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,210
- Se Chan's eyes are really pretty.
- It's my first time seeing him.

1521
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,670
- With a mask on, he's...
- Oh, gosh!

1522
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:18,380
She was so startled.

1523
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,240
- Se Chan's eyes are really pretty.
- It's my first time seeing him.

1524
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,590
- With a mask on, he's...
- Oh, gosh!

1525
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:22,740
(His face made her jump.)

1526
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,380
- She was so startled.
- Se Chan was looking at her...

1527
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,880
- like this when she turned.
- I know.

1528
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,230
- Gyeong Hye.
- What's wrong, Gyeong Hye?

1529
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,420
I'm the shy type, that's why.

1530
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,400
- I'm the shy type.
- His eyes are really pretty.

1531
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,630
And he's really sweet.

1532
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,490
So Min really likes Se Chan.

1533
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:37,570
- Really?
- Yes.

1534
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:40,400
- Then why don't you date him?
- We've been on the same show.

1535
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,630
- So I know what his charms are.
- What are they?

1536
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,110
Women approach him very easily,

1537
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:46,630
and they're at ease.

1538
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,300
But it turns out...

1539
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,570
- But he's mean?
- But he's manly?

1540
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,280
that he's different
from the image they know him of.

1541
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,510
You can't let your guard down.

1542
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,440
That's what they fall for.

1543
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,420
Once they fall for his charms,
there's no turning back?

1544
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,490
There's no turning back.

1545
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,210
- Right. He doesn't allow it.
- That's right.

1546
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,030
Let me tell you what it is.

1547
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,030
Se Chan has limits too.

1548
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,090
He can't cut them off.

1549
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,550
- Got it?
- That's exactly right.

1550
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:08,090
- I do have limits.
- You do.

1551
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,670
There are limits
he just can't overcome.

1552
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,170
Woo Seok, what's your MBTI type?

1553
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,840
- What was mine again?
- It's ESFJ.

1554
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,010
- Yours?
- No, Woo Seok's.

1555
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:16,530
- He's ESFJ?
- You know his MBTI type too?

1556
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,780
- You remember that?
- He's very caring.

1557
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,880
What's yours, Woo Jae?

1558
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,880
Mine is ISTP.

1559
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,210
Yours is ISTJ, right?

1560
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:24,920
I'm not sure. I tried it once,
and the result was the same as his.

1561
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,240
No, you and I got the same result.

1562
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,240
- What's yours?
- Where did I...

1563
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,110
Mine is INFJ.

1564
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,360
- INFJ?
- INFJ?

1565
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,860
- We got the same result.
- What was mine again?

1566
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,590
Can you please listen to Ji Hyo?

1567
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,090
- Ji Hyo said you got the same one.
- Ours is the same.

1568
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:37,530
- I know that. It's not like...
- Do I...

1569
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:38,990
Do I have to remember
these things too?

1570
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,360
That's not it.

1571
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,320
(Do I have to remember
these things too?)

1572
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,490
That's not it.

1573
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:44,530
It's not that.

1574
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,740
Ji Hyo is making a character...

1575
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:46,900
- for herself now.
- I can't remember!

1576
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,940
(Ji Hyo has been enjoying
playing couples...)

1577
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,960
(since the pepper incident.)

1578
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,240
I can't remember.

1579
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,900
- That was sudden.
- I should get it tested.

1580
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,400
- I'm a fan of that couple.
- I should try it.

1581
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,400
- Right?
- That couple.

1582
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,780
You can be their fan because
they're not a real couple.

1583
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,740
- It's for the show.
- They have the possibility though.

1584
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,050
- That's right.
- With So Min and Se Chan,

1585
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:02,340
no one thinks they can become
a real couple.

1586
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,550
No, they have their own storyline
that they still have a chance...

1587
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,490
- to become a couple.
- That's right.

1588
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:10,420
Is that an objective view?

1589
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,050
- Of course.
- I see.

1590
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,460
Why are your eyes so scary?

1591
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,670
- I was just looking at you.
- He seems so flustered.

1592
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:16,630
- I was just looking at you.
- Is that so?

1593
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:19,070
- You pick on Woo Jae a lot.
- That's not true.

1594
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:21,010
- He likes Woo Jae.
- That's because he likes him.

1595
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:22,070
Because he reminds me...

1596
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,710
- of the tall guy we used to have.
- It's been long, so...

1597
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,110
- The tall guy?
- It's been a while since...

1598
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:27,210
He likes tall guys.

1599
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:29,340
I like him.
I like guys who are clumsy.

1600
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,820
This is what I think.

1601
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:35,190
I think it'd be better...

1602
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,760
if you don't hope
for Jong Kook and Ji Hyo...

1603
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,320
to become a real couple.

1604
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,150
But you never know.
They could be dating right now.

1605
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,920
- But Jong Kook...
- Come on!

1606
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,190
- I told you.
- If they're actually dating,

1607
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,360
we can't tease them like this.

1608
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,300
I'll buy them a big-screen TV
and a fridge if they get married.

1609
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,460
- Come on.
- I'm sorry,

1610
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,670
but just don't come to the wedding.

1611
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:52,960
- He won't invite Suk Jin.
- Just in case...

1612
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,900
- I'm rooting for you two.
- Even if you don't invite him,

1613
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,960
he'll go to your wedding.

1614
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,340
(Even if you don't invite him,
he'll go to your wedding.)

1615
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:59,070
(Attendee of every event,
he tried going to Son Ye Jin's wedding.)

1616
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,130
He attends every event.

1617
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,650
When did I become that?

1618
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,240
Dear viewers,
don't be too surprised...

1619
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,710
even when Suk Jin
attends one of your family events.

1620
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,880
- It's in trend.
- It's just that...

1621
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,110
- he likes attending events.
- That's right.

1622
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:13,190
- He likes to attend events.
- He loves to party.

1623
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:17,090
The next mission is familiar
to the members of Running Man.

1624
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:19,360
It's a game where you can win
if you come up with a good strategy.

1625
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,860
It's Strategic Floating Mat Battle
with Bread at Stake.

1626
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,340
You'll start on your team's mat.

1627
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,690
The scores will be given
in the order of teams...

1628
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,030
that survived the longest.

1629
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:28,670
So the team that falls in the water
first gets one point,

1630
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:30,980
the 2nd team gets 2 points,
and the winner gets 3 points.

1631
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,710
There will be four rounds in total.

1632
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,800
There will be 1 round of 1-1-1,
2 rounds of 2-2-2,

1633
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:37,980
and 3 rounds of 3-3-3.

1634
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,010
But Jong Kook's team is too strong.
Let's just win second place.

1635
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,490
I'll tell you the first players
for the 1-1-1 game.

1636
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:44,590
It's Se Chan versus Woo Seok
versus Woo Jae.

1637
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:46,380
(Woo Jae versus Woo Seok
versus Se Chan)

1638
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,510
Let's go!

1639
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,860
(Jumping)

1640
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,530
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1641
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:59,050
- You can do it!
- I think our team will lose.

1642
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:00,930
Woo Jae, show us your jump again.

1643
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,320
(The mantis shows off his jump.)

1644
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,320
- That's so cool.
- Woo Seok, try jumping too.

1645
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,320
- That's so cool.
- This?

1646
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,870
(Woo Seok also shows off
his long legs.)

1647
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,300
- He's good.
- He's so light.

1648
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,300
They look cooler
because they have long legs.

1649
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,910
- They jump so well.
- Woo Jae is exhausted.

1650
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,740
- Se Chan, you should try it too.
- They're both so tall.

1651
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:15,970
- He's exhausted.
- To be standing...

1652
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:17,180
between these two...

1653
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,570
(The little kid from Dongducheon
is going up against the tall guys.)

1654
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:19,620
All right. Let's give it a shot.

1655
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,640
Oh, no. They must be really nervous.

1656
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,820
So this is how it feels.

1657
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:26,450
Everyone, the long-awaited
1-1-1 game will start now.

1658
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,450
Let's go!

1659
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,760
Woo Jae! It won't kill you!

1660
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,120
- Gosh, Woo Jae.
- Hey!

1661
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,760
- Hey, that's enough!
- That's not it.

1662
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,390
- Stop it already.
- It won't kill you!

1663
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:35,430
- You'll run out of energy.
- I wanted to act like...

1664
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:36,490
I was working hard.

1665
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:37,620
Gosh, seriously.

1666
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:38,720
Woo Seok!

1667
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,760
- Show them.
- Don't make a move hastily.

1668
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,430
I'll watch them first.

1669
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,240
Use every move you can.

1670
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,570
Se Chan, let's go!

1671
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,110
(Unlike the two,
Ssaebssaeb is experienced.)

1672
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:48,180
Gosh, that squid.

1673
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,240
Get ready.

1674
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:55,220
- Se Chan, you look especially...
- It's going to be fun.

1675
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:56,910
You stand out so much.

1676
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:59,450
- I'm the visual member here.
- Yes, you are.

1677
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,050
You stand out the most.

1678
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,050
I'm going to play
really dirty today. Watch me.

1679
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:05,620
Bo Pil, I'm going to beat them up
to a pulp.

1680
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,950
Get ready.

1681
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,050
(The game starts.)

1682
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:10,160
- All right.
- What's with his body proportion?

1683
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,320
Se Chan is really strong.

1684
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,470
I'll go to you.

1685
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,700
- I'll go to you.
- No, you have to be careful.

1686
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,240
You might fall while trying to
go over to another mat.

1687
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,840
- Think carefully when you do.
- Woo Jae.

1688
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,240
Don't fall in vain.

1689
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,510
While trying to jump over...

1690
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,240
- That's threatening.
- Look at Se Chan.

1691
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,800
Se Chan is the target.

1692
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,490
Look how Woo Jae is acting up.

1693
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:31,320
Here comes the mantis.

1694
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,260
Don't bully me!

1695
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,360
Don't bully me, you guys!

1696
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:37,950
What? Look at these guys.

1697
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:41,160
You need to be strong to play this,

1698
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,030
but you need to use the mat well.

1699
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,530
- It's all about timing.
- Of course.

1700
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:46,570
- It doesn't move forward.
- It will.

1701
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:47,740
Then come to me.

1702
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,030
- Woo Seok, you should row it.
- Right. You should do that.

1703
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,260
- Row it.
- Okay.

1704
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,430
It'll move if you row it.

1705
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,570
You should row on this side.

1706
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,340
- You should row on this side.
- What are you doing?

1707
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:58,550
If you row from there,
it'll come to this side.

1708
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,280
- Yes, that's how you should do it.
- Woo Seok, you might get attacked.

1709
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,820
Woo Jae might suddenly
pull your hand or something.

1710
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,640
If he does, I'll push him off.

1711
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,320
Only Se Chan is far away
from the two. How strange.

1712
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,450
I know. What's wrong with you?

1713
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:09,990
- Oh, they joined forces.
- Come at me.

1714
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,590
We can't beat Se Chan 1-on-1.

1715
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,700
- Then let's really go on his mat.
- Okay, let's.

1716
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:20,030
(Se Chan with strong bones
is their common enemy.)

1717
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:22,930
It's moving.

1718
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,260
You'll use up all your strength.

1719
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,430
Look at Woo Jae.

1720
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,840
Woo Jae will use up
all his strength.

1721
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,700
Woo Jae, you might use
all your strength.

1722
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:31,740
- They got it.
- They went pretty far.

1723
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:33,870
(Se Chan is cornered.)

1724
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:36,120
- Se Chan is cornered!
- They went far.

1725
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,340
- Se Chan, you're not cornered.
- I'm good.

1726
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,090
Woo Seok, let's just
jump onto his mat.

1727
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:41,410
- You have to go quickly.
- Okay.

1728
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,990
Great. That's great, Se Chan.

1729
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,820
Where are you going?

1730
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:52,260
(Only Woo Jae ends up
going toward Se Chan's mat.)

1731
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,640
They got it. They're 1-on-1 now.

1732
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,800
- Where are you going?
- Go! Attack him!

1733
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,840
(Se Chan went over
to Woo Jae's mat.)

1734
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,570
He went over.

1735
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:02,870
Woo Seok will...

1736
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:06,070
Woo Seok will...

1737
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:07,950
(He tries to escape but fails.)

1738
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,280
(Go away!)

1739
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,490
- All right.
- All right.

1740
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,950
We have one man down.

1741
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,490
- You fool.
- It went as we all expected.

1742
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:16,550
Oh, no...

1743
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:20,200
(The end of Pushover Joo
had no twist.)

1744
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,860
- You fool.
- Woo Jae, please move.

1745
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,990
Thank you, Woo Jae!

1746
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,430
That little...

1747
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:27,160
- Woo Jae!
- What's wrong with him?

1748
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,640
- My gosh, that guy...
- He didn't even get to attack.

1749
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,640
What did he just do?

1750
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,470
I have no idea!

1751
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,340
- Push him.
- What were you thinking?

1752
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,870
- Hey.
- Time to show how good you are.

1753
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:37,640
You'll be punished for this.

1754
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,140
- Woo Seok!
- It's 1-on-1.

1755
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,320
Time to show how good you are.

1756
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:43,680
Woo Seok, you just have to
fight him head-on.

1757
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,680
There's no other way.

1758
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,720
- Come at me.
- Woo Jae, push their mats.

1759
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:49,450
That's it. That's enough.

1760
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:50,760
- They're going at each other.
- Attack.

1761
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:52,860
- They're going at each other.
- Attack.

1762
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,530
- Great. Go!
- He came over.

1763
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:55,860
That's it.

1764
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,740
Grab him!

1765
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,910
Oh, no!

1766
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:06,280
Be careful, Woo Seok!

1767
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,610
Woo Seok! Be careful!

1768
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:10,640
Be careful, Woo Seok!

1769
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,740
Woo Seok! Be careful!

1770
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,740
(Se Chan fails to read the room
and does his best to win.)

1771
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,910
He's trying so hard to win.

1772
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,910
Woo Seok works out every day.

1773
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:16,950
Oh, really?

1774
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,240
Woo Seok won't lose to him.

1775
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,340
My gosh.

1776
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,180
- Hey, Se Chan.
- My gosh!

1777
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,430
- He's so strong!
- Woo Seok won't lose to him.

1778
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:26,820
- Hey, Se Chan.
- Se Chan is so harsh.

1779
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,720
(Se Chan got Woo Seok!)

1780
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,930
Se Chan is so harsh.

1781
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:34,340
(Surprised)

1782
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,740
(Throwing)

1783
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:40,970
He's so harsh.

1784
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:46,180
(Squid with
superhuman strength wins.)

1785
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,180
(Shouting)

1786
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,410
That was...

1787
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,090
Woo Seok!

1788
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:56,930
Are knee strikes allowed?

1789
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:58,720
Are knee strikes allowed?

1790
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:00,800
- Are they allowed?
- Sorry.

1791
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,220
He got hit by Se Chan's knee!

1792
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,490
Se Chan hit Woo Seok with his knee.

1793
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:05,370
- He got hit by Se Chan's knee!
- He hit Woo Seok with his knee.

1794
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:06,660
How dare you
strike him with your knee?

1795
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:08,260
Why that little...

1796
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,430
I think it's better...

1797
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:11,070
that I got eliminated early
than to be out pathetically.

1798
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:13,240
- You looked most pathetic.
- You looked most pathetic.

1799
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,240
Is that so?

1800
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,410
- You were so good.
- Did you hear So Min though?

1801
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:18,300
It was like he was
cheering for her boyfriend.

1802
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,680
She went, "Se Chan is so harsh!"

1803
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:25,090
You can't kick his face
with your knee!

1804
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,550
- Are knee strikes allowed?
- How dare you?

1805
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:28,510
- Good job!
- It's all right.

1806
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,680
- They won the first round.
- Let's go.

1807
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,780
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1808
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,760
- Is it our turn?
- Let's go!

1809
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,200
I'll give you another chance.
Don't you get eliminated again.

1810
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,390
- Those two are playing?
- Woo Jae is playing? Great!

1811
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:40,140
I have a shot at winning with them.

1812
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:45,910
(Laughing out of embarrassment)

1813
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,700
(Doing slapstick comedy
all by herself)

1814
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:48,800
I just...

1815
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,470
(Startled)

1816
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,070
(Her friend joins in
for slapstick comedy.)

1817
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:57,220
I can't stand up.

1818
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,720
Be careful.

1819
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,160
- Oh, no!
- Hey.

1820
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,890
- Be careful.
- We have a chance at winning!

1821
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,490
Let's go!

1822
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,320
I am Jong Kook here.

1823
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,320
Be careful, So Min.

1824
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,550
(Bring it on!)

1825
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:11,870
What are you, the Avengers?

1826
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,390
You can beat them
once you get on their mat.

1827
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:19,010
(The members of Group 2
are all playful.)

1828
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:22,070
So Min has no will to win.
She's just there to make it funny.

1829
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:23,510
Go!

1830
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:25,470
How should we play this?

1831
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:29,120
Why are you putting on airs?

1832
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,320
He got it.

1833
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,620
Woo Jae is good at rowing!

1834
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:37,260
(Woo Jae finally found his talent.)

1835
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,780
He's Row Woo Jae.

1836
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,760
Because his arms are long...
Woo Jae can row!

1837
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,390
- Row Woo Jae.
- Come here.

1838
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:44,970
- Go over!
- Woo Jae, go over on their mat.

1839
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:46,300
- Just go already.
- Where should we go to?

1840
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,760
(Right then, Seok Sam's
expression changes.)

1841
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,610
- Let's attack them!
- You went over already?

1842
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:53,300
Why did you go over?
Why did he go over on their mat?

1843
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,510
Go over on their mat, So Min!

1844
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,280
So Min, you must go over
on that mat!

1845
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,820
Get So Min!

1846
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,320
(Haha attacks So Min
while So Min is hesitating.)

1847
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,620
So Min! Come over!

1848
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,530
- So Min is out.
- Oh, no!

1849
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:11,590
So Min is out.

1850
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,260
Gosh, those two...

1851
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,990
Haha, help me!

1852
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,300
- I'm coming.
- You need to go over.

1853
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:18,970
(Gyeong Hye joins
the battlefield as well.)

1854
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:20,930
Hey, push the mat to me!

1855
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:24,660
Hey, push the mat to me!

1856
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,800
(Ji Hyo and Suk Jin
are eliminated.)

1857
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,240
All right.

1858
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,070
Ji Hyo, you're out.

1859
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:30,610
Woo Jae! Give it a try.
You can do it!

1860
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:32,200
- Play fair!
- Take his pants off.

1861
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,780
- Woo Jae.
- Take his pants off.

1862
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,950
I'm so sorry, Woo Jae!

1863
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:37,950
(Floundering)

1864
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:39,010
Woo Jae!

1865
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:42,990
- Woo Jae!
- What's with Woo Jae?

1866
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:45,720
(Woo Jae gets eliminated
after floundering pitifully.)

1867
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,450
At least we won second place,
Woo Jae.

1868
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,300
(Gyeong Hye, the dark horse,
eliminated 3 players on her own.)

1869
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,700
We won second place, Woo Jae.

1870
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,570
- We won second place?
- We did.

1871
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:55,700
- Who is playing next?
- The next 2-2-2 match.

1872
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,840
Let's start right away.
Please get ready.

1873
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,410
I think we should win the next one.

1874
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,010
(Panting)

1875
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:05,010
Hey! Seaweed, hurry over.

1876
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,010
- What is it?
- You're playing next.

1877
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,320
- You're playing with me.
- Again?

1878
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:10,720
- Woo Jae is playing again?
- Woo Jae is playing again?

1879
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,820
Won't he take a break?

1880
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,990
(A 2-2-2 match)

1881
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:14,410
- We should get rid of them first.
- Okay.

1882
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:15,910
- We'll drag you down with you.
- We'll drag you down.

1883
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:17,530
We'll drag down
the ones who attack us first.

1884
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:18,530
Okay.

1885
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,660
- They're our target.
- Hey, Jae Suk.

1886
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,030
We must win this time.

1887
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,870
- We must get rid of them first.
- We must win this time.

1888
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,300
- Jong Kook, give us a chance.
- Of course.

1889
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,530
- So you can attack them?
- Yes.

1890
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,300
- That's not allowed.
- Let's fight 1-on-1.

1891
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,760
We must get rid of them first.

1892
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,510
(Confessing all of a sudden)

1893
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:33,430
- I've always been your fan.
- Hey.

1894
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:35,110
- I'm serious.
- Why would you say that now?

1895
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,950
- Well...
- We've been here for so long.

1896
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:38,970
- He's...
- I didn't have a chance to tell.

1897
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,620
He's from Anyang.

1898
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,620
- You're from Anyang?
- Jong Kook, I'm from Anyang.

1899
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,090
(Jong Kook, I'm from Anyang.)

1900
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,990
- Why would you share that now?
- That's right!

1901
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,120
- I didn't have a chance to tell.
- Where in Anyang?

1902
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,120
- Are you really from Anyang?
- No, I'm from Ilsan.

1903
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,530
What are you doing?

1904
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:54,820
(Meanwhile, the seaweed passed out
on the mat.)

1905
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:55,890
Give us a chance to attack them.

1906
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:57,570
- So you're from Anyang?
- Yes.

1907
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:58,930
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1908
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,700
- What are you doing?
- Come at us.

1909
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,340
(Approaching)

1910
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,870
(Se Chan ends up
making a move first.)

1911
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:05,010
I'll push you down right away.

1912
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,530
Why that little...

1913
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:13,570
Why is he doing the leg dance?
What's with him?

1914
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:15,050
(Doing the leg dance)

1915
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:17,590
Your pants might fall.
Be careful, Woo Jae.

1916
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:19,240
- Come at us.
- This is so fun!

1917
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,510
- Let's do it.
- Come on over.

1918
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:21,990
Come at us!

1919
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,890
Let's jump over.

1920
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:25,430
- Bring it on!
- Let's jump over.

1921
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:27,590
There are waves, so... Oh, gosh.

1922
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:30,200
Look at Woo Jae! He's...
There are waves, so...

1923
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,090
(Whoosh)

1924
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:33,660
(Row Woo Jae is here again.)

1925
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,390
- He's rowing again.
- My gosh.

1926
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:37,140
He rows so well!

1927
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,840
- Row Woo Jae!
- I thought you had a motor on.

1928
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:41,680
This is so nerve-racking.

1929
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,300
We'll get really high viewer
ratings this week, don't you think?

1930
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:45,340
This week's viewer ratings
will be soaring.

1931
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,510
A battle between men.

1932
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,240
Those chickens.

1933
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:50,990
(Shouting)

1934
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:52,510
(Shouting back)

1935
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:53,990
(Glancing)

1936
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:56,010
(Shouting)

1937
01:00:58,490 --> 01:00:59,990
(Darn it.)

1938
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:04,160
- Darn it.
- No!

1939
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,220
- Gosh, that stings.
- Nice!

1940
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,490
What was that?

1941
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:09,030
- Jae Suk...
- Hold on.

1942
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:10,470
- It was a mistake.
- No, you're out.

1943
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:11,870
- You're out.
- You're out.

1944
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:13,800
- It was a mistake.
- No. Hey!

1945
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,410
- You're out.
- I was just playing around.

1946
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,510
- You're out.
- That was...

1947
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:19,700
- You can't play around!
- I was just playing around.

1948
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,470
- But it was funny.
- I made a mistake.

1949
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,620
- But you slipped.
- He's out.

1950
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:23,820
But I was just playing around.

1951
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,090
- It was so funny though.
- It was a funny scene.

1952
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:27,120
I'm so sorry. I just played around.

1953
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,120
I made a mistake.

1954
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,510
Then you should just
get a water slap.

1955
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:31,220
- Okay, I'll take that.
- Give him a water slap.

1956
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,360
- Get a water slap.
- Okay.

1957
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,820
- I'll do it.
- All right. I'll get a water slap.

1958
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,300
- Come here.
- Everyone.

1959
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,700
I was just playing around.

1960
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,590
- We'll go to you.
- We'll go to you.

1961
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:39,800
- It's a water slap.
- Okay.

1962
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,160
- Let's splash water on him.
- All right.

1963
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,760
- Let's do it.
- Here it comes. In 1, 2.

1964
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,340
- A water slap.
- Three.

1965
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,700
(Splash, slapping)

1966
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,110
- A water slap!
- That's right.

1967
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:50,700
- Water.
- Slap.

1968
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,240
- Boombastic!
- Okay.

1969
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,120
Okay, fine.

1970
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:56,570
- Okay.
- We can do this.

1971
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:58,220
I'm sorry about that.

1972
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,050
- We have to go.
- Oh, gosh.

1973
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,320
(He falls into the water again.)

1974
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,720
- Come on, Jae Suk.
- No, that doesn't count.

1975
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,090
What do you mean?

1976
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,990
- It doesn't count.
- What was that?

1977
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:10,200
- That was...
- It doesn't count.

1978
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,430
What do you mean?

1979
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:13,300
(No!)

1980
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,090
- It doesn't count.
- He was clearly out.

1981
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:16,340
How many times will you
fall into the water?

1982
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:18,840
- We weren't playing.
- What was that?

1983
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,870
- You're out.
- We weren't playing.

1984
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,680
I was just playing around.

1985
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,610
- I was just playing around.
- Come on.

1986
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,840
- He didn't say we could begin.
- Get a water slap from Jong Kook.

1987
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,620
- Get a water slap from Woo Jae.
- From Jong Kook?

1988
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,390
I'll get a water slap
from Jong Kook.

1989
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:32,220
I was just playing around.

1990
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,220
He's so playful.

1991
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:36,410
You know how excited I get
when I see water.

1992
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:37,530
- A water slap.
- A water slap.

1993
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:38,680
In 1, 2, 3.

1994
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:43,390
(They just slapped him twice.)

1995
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:45,030
- All right!
- All right.

1996
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:46,390
- There will be no more exceptions.
- No more.

1997
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:48,700
I won't play around anymore.

1998
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:49,890
He's so playful.

1999
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:50,910
Why are you so playful today?

2000
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:52,510
- You're not even good at it.
- He's so excited.

2001
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,870
- I'm just so excited to see water.
- All right.

2002
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:56,950
We got them.

2003
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:58,110
(The race starts again
with Se Chan's attack.)

2004
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:03,320
Haha, you must come over!

2005
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,840
Haha!

2006
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,220
Haha, you must come over!

2007
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,490
(His cowardly brother
pretends not to have seen him.)

2008
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:11,890
Haha, you must come over!

2009
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:14,450
Haha, you must come over!

2010
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:15,950
He's out.

2011
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,390
- He's out.
- What was that, Haha?

2012
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:20,390
It was too far.
Can you come over first?

2013
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:22,240
- Jong Kook, I'll help you.
- Come here.

2014
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,300
- I'll help you. Give me a chance.
- Come here.

2015
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,910
Take me as your hostage.

2016
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,570
- How will he throw Haha?
- You can do it!

2017
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:29,680
Haha!

2018
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,780
(The little martial artist
holds out against the tiger.)

2019
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:33,050
(Grunting)

2020
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,240
That's it.

2021
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,890
- The power of a dad.
- I can't tell who's going to win.

2022
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:37,890
The challenge of a dad!

2023
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:39,410
Jong Kook is smiling!

2024
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,220
- He's having fun. He's enjoying it.
- He's enjoying the game.

2025
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:44,220
- No!
- Look at Haha's muffin top.

2026
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,620
- Hey.
- Look at his muffin top.

2027
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:46,890
No!

2028
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,890
Look at his muffin top.

2029
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:50,620
- Okay!
- Hey.

2030
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,390
No!

2031
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:53,590
(A flip-over)

2032
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:55,700
(Darn it!)

2033
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,340
(He can feel pain in that area.)

2034
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,140
- Well done.
- Haha.

2035
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:01,070
- We got this.
- Look at Woo Jae.

2036
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,070
(Team Woo Seok approaches
Row Woo Jae.)

2037
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,510
Attack the only man standing!
Go! Go over!

2038
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:05,680
Woo Jae.

2039
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,680
(They try to attack Woo Jae
who's all by himself.)

2040
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,870
- Woo Jae!
- Go over!

2041
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:11,410
They're on. Okay, push them now!
Push them off!

2042
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:12,510
Wait.

2043
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:15,490
Push him.

2044
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:16,860
Jong Kook can't go over.

2045
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,220
- Push him.
- This won't work! Darn it!

2046
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:20,300
(This won't work! Darn it!)

2047
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,300
(Splash)

2048
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,890
Nice. We did it.

2049
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,070
He missed it.

2050
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,870
(He gets eliminated
in an absurd way.)

2051
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,390
Did you see how short
Jong Kook's legs were?

2052
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:30,470
We won!

2053
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:32,760
Wait!

2054
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,610
(Pushover Joo is
left all alone again.)

2055
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:36,300
- Wait!
- We did it.

2056
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:37,470
Please let me stand.

2057
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:38,870
- Let me stand, at least.
- No can do.

2058
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:40,410
- Please let me just stand up.
- No.

2059
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:45,140
(The floundering seaweed
gets eliminated.)

2060
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:49,890
- We did it.
- All right.

2061
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,120
Woo Seok and Jae Suk win.

2062
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,120
- We did it.
- We won.

2063
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,120
You have short legs

2064
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,990
It's the long-awaited 3-3-3 game.

2065
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:59,820
- It's the 3-3-3 game.
- All right.

2066
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:01,140
Woo Jae.

2067
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:02,140
(Woo Jae.)

2068
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:03,160
You must play.

2069
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:06,030
- Woo Jae!
- Come on up here!

2070
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:08,510
- Woo Jae! Your pants fell off.
- He didn't take a single break.

2071
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:09,700
Woo Jae needs to keep playing.

2072
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,870
- What? Why?
- Your pants fell off.

2073
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:14,370
Oh, gosh. Are you all right?

2074
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,780
Are you okay?

2075
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:19,090
Everyone! Woo Jae's pants fell off,
but he doesn't know!

2076
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:20,090
It's okay.

2077
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:23,320
The final winning team
is Team Woo Jae.

2078
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:24,680
(Team Woo Jae wins 1st place.)

2079
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,680
The team in second place...

2080
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,220
Oh, right.
There's a second-place winner.

2081
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:29,450
It's Team Gyeong Hye.

2082
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:31,700
Team Woo Seok is in third place.

2083
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:34,140
- What's the penalty?
- You'll choose your bread now.

2084
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:35,140
We don't know what the penalty is.

2085
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,410
The 1st-place team
will pick 7 pieces of bread.

2086
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:38,510
The 2nd-place team will pick 5,

2087
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,370
- and 3rd place will pick 3.
- We'll pick 3?

2088
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,070
We need Suk Jin's sticker and mine.

2089
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:44,300
Oh, please...

2090
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:48,320
(Team Gyeong Hye)

2091
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,570
It's Jihyomon.

2092
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,840
- What? Do we have her sticker?
- We do.

2093
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:54,260
We don't have your sticker
and Gyeong Hye's sticker.

2094
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,620
- It's your sticker!
- We got it!

2095
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:57,590
This is great.

2096
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:59,160
(Team Gyeong Hye)

2097
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,760
- Please.
- Please.

2098
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,220
- It's my sticker!
- All right!

2099
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,590
It's Sominmon again. We got enough.

2100
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:05,700
All right.

2101
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,590
(Team Woo Seok)

2102
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:09,070
Which stickers do we need?

2103
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:11,740
- It's what we don't have.
- We got Wooseokmon.

2104
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:13,260
- It's what we don't have.
- We got you.

2105
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,470
- It's you.
- We got it.

2106
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:16,340
- This one is Wooseokmon too.
- Okay.

2107
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:17,800
- It's you again.
- It's me again.

2108
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,070
- It's you again.
- We are getting multiple stickers.

2109
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:20,780
We need to stop getting it.

2110
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:22,620
- We don't have you.
- We need Seokjinmon and Sechanmon.

2111
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,340
- Which stickers do we need?
- What?

2112
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:26,450
Which stickers do we need?

2113
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:27,760
We only got Woojaemon.

2114
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,820
(They only got two Woojaemons.)

2115
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:31,820
- Aren't there too many Woojaemons?
- Seriously.

2116
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,050
It's like a dud.

2117
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,300
- How many did you add?
- We didn't do that.

2118
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:37,720
It's Seokjinmon.

2119
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:40,530
- Hey.
- Okay.

2120
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,030
- Seokjinmon.
- All right.

2121
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:43,800
The next mission will give you
the last chance to catch...

2122
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,530
the missing monsters for Runningdex.

2123
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,240
It's the One Last Punch.

2124
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:51,050
Stickers are hidden
throughout the broadcasting station.

2125
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:54,450
You simply need to find them
and complete the Runningdex.

2126
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:58,140
The race ends
as soon as a team completes it.

2127
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,450
- I see.
- We need two more.

2128
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:02,320
- You have overlapping stickers.
- Yes.

2129
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:06,530
You can use those stickers
to purchase elimination tickets...

2130
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:08,760
- to eliminate other members.
- How many?

2131
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,930
(You need elimination tickets
to take off the name tag.)

2132
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:16,200
You can use overlapping stickers
to purchase elimination tickets.

2133
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,030
However, the price is different
for each member...

2134
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:19,200
and it will be decided
by other teams.

2135
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,370
Let me give you an example.

2136
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:23,510
The total price
for each team is 12 stickers.

2137
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:26,300
Let's say Jong Kook decides
that it will be one for Gyeong Hye,

2138
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:30,390
one for Haha, and ten for Se Chan.
Once he makes that decision,

2139
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:32,550
Se Chan needs ten stickers
to purchase an elimination ticket.

2140
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:33,950
(Decide on the price
for each member!)

2141
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,720
Understood? Decide on the price
within the total of 12 stickers.

2142
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,320
That's what we need to purchase
an elimination ticket.

2143
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,260
If you eliminate a member
who was carrying a Runningdex,

2144
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,260
you can take off one sticker
you want.

2145
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,320
(You can take off one sticker
you want.)

2146
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,160
You can't take it.
You can simply eliminate it.

2147
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,140
Now, each team will move...

2148
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:53,300
and decide on
the elimination ticket price.

2149
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:55,510
Team Jong Kook will decide on
Team Jae Suk's prices.

2150
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:57,300
Team Jae Suk will decide on
this team's prices.

2151
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,410
- Then this team will decide on...
- Team Jong Kook's prices?

2152
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:00,720
The total price is 12 stickers.

2153
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,550
Let's make Se Chan pay 12 stickers.

2154
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,490
- No, that's the total.
- That's the total.

2155
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,340
Why don't we make it
seven for Se Chan,

2156
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:08,410
four for Haha,
and one for Gyeong Hye?

2157
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:10,180
- Shall we do that?
- Let's do that.

2158
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:12,680
Four for me, seven for you,

2159
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:13,760
- and one for Gyeong Hye.
- Seven?

2160
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,200
- It will be hard for me.
- We will need to help Gyeong Hye.

2161
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,700
You should take these stickers
so that you can eliminate someone.

2162
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:19,990
- Me?
- Of course.

2163
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:21,030
You just need four stickers.

2164
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:23,590
I will hold on to 1 sticker.
I will collect 6 more stickers...

2165
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,930
so that I can eliminate someone.

2166
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:26,760
Runningdex is what's important.
Who should carry it?

2167
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:28,430
Gyeong Hye should.

2168
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:30,380
- Me? What if I get eliminated?
- What if she gets eliminated?

2169
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,610
Should I protect it?

2170
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:33,250
What do you think?
Wouldn't that be better?

2171
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:34,380
- Me?
- What?

2172
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,970
(Did you just say
that you will protect me?)

2173
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:38,120
- I am not sure.
- Haha.

2174
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,750
Did you hear what she said?

2175
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:41,050
Upon hearing my words,

2176
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,250
she asked me if I would protect her.

2177
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,790
I will protect the Runningdex.

2178
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,530
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

2179
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,090
Gyeong Hye,
I will protect the Runningdex.

2180
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:49,750
Didn't you see us earlier?

2181
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:51,830
- We ditched you earlier.
- We have a business relationship.

2182
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,570
You should carry it.

2183
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:55,500
- You should carry it.
- I will carry it.

2184
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,700
I will run away well.

2185
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,430
- Okay.
- All right.

2186
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:00,240
We should make Jong Kook pay
the most.

2187
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,970
Let's go with 10 for Jong Kook
and 1 for the rest.

2188
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:05,750
- That isn't surprising at all.
- They are too much.

2189
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,450
- There is no twist whatsoever.
- They are too much.

2190
01:09:07,450 --> 01:09:08,510
That's no fun.

2191
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,540
We need Haha's, mine, and So Min's.

2192
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,680
- Three.
- We just need three more.

2193
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,750
- Haha, Ji Hyo, So Min.
- Ji Hyo, So Min, Haha.

2194
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:16,920
Ji Hyo, So Min, Haha.

2195
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,990
We could lose a sticker,

2196
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:20,550
so...

2197
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,590
It's okay to lose Woojaemon
like crazy.

2198
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:23,720
I have four more.

2199
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:25,870
Woojaemon, the mantis...

2200
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,700
You should look for the stickers...

2201
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:30,630
we can use to purchase
an elimination ticket.

2202
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:33,710
- So we will look for the stickers.
- Let's make it obvious.

2203
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:34,910
I will run.

2204
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:36,380
You should keep running.

2205
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,800
We can get eliminated like crazy.

2206
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:41,010
One thing is certain.
You need my help.

2207
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,620
(You need my help.)

2208
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:43,920
- Sure.
- My help.

2209
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,950
- You said that earlier too.
- Ji Hyo.

2210
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:47,380
This isn't a laughing matter.

2211
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:49,160
- I can do this.
- Sure.

2212
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,380
You have long arms.

2213
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:51,580
I have a long reach.

2214
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:53,220
Come here. You have long arms.

2215
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,200
But your long arms are useless
when you can't move.

2216
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,260
Don't you agree?

2217
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,960
Woo Jae used up his strength.

2218
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,790
Woo Jae, your long arms are useless.

2219
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:03,200
This won't do.

2220
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:05,540
- He is my team, right?
- Yes.

2221
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,240
- That's good.
- Your long arms are useless.

2222
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,930
- I can attack suddenly like this.
- Right.

2223
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,210
I could have ripped off
the name tag.

2224
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,040
I would have succeeded
had I moved a bit more.

2225
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,880
Let's make it 1 for So Min
and 3 for the rest.

2226
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,620
The same price
for Jae Suk and Woo Seok.

2227
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:19,180
- So 4, 4, 3, and 1.
- Let's do that.

2228
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:20,320
Why is my price one sticker?

2229
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,080
How come Suk Jin's price is
three stickers?

2230
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,160
- They are serious about this.
- They think I am strong.

2231
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,290
How come Suk Jin's price is
three stickers?

2232
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:28,030
I watched Woo Seok play games.
He doesn't have much strength.

2233
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,960
You are pretty clumsy.

2234
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,760
You need know-how
for Name Tag Elimination.

2235
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:34,090
Can I try ripping off the name tag?

2236
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:35,330
- Rip it off.
- Rip it off.

2237
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:38,430
Don't do it so shyly.
You need to do it roughly.

2238
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:40,500
- I will do it roughly.
- Why don't we have a face-off?

2239
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,800
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead. Have a 1-on-1 match.

2240
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,170
- Put down your bag.
- Let's try it.

2241
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:45,140
What if I win?

2242
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:48,080
- Then you win.
- You should win.

2243
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,170
Go.

2244
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,040
- Hold on.
- Come on.

2245
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,620
- You need skills.
- Yes. You need skills.

2246
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,490
- You need skills.
- Yes. You need skills.

2247
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:58,080
- See?
- See?

2248
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,420
- See, Woo Seok?
- See?

2249
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:01,660
- He has no skills.
- Listen.

2250
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:03,000
Listen, Woo Seok.

2251
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,500
- Listen to me.
- But...

2252
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,200
- Listen to me.
- What are you doing?

2253
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:07,830
- I will show you how it's done.
- It ripped.

2254
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,670
When you meet an opponent,

2255
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,630
- do this.
- Do you grab the clothes?

2256
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:13,870
- No. Don't grab the clothes.
- I have beaten other people.

2257
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:15,780
With one hand, push the shoulder.

2258
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:17,470
Actually, you shouldn't push it.
Pull it.

2259
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:18,880
- I see.
- Then rip off the name tag.

2260
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,140
Have you done that before?

2261
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:21,210
(Incredulous)

2262
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:22,510
(She got caught teaching a skill
she has never used.)

2263
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:23,710
- You don't have time for that.
- Stand strong.

2264
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:25,180
Woo Seok,
you don't have time for that.

2265
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,490
- Stand strong.
- Here.

2266
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:28,510
Just grab the person
and rip it off right away.

2267
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,250
- Okay. Stand strong.
- Stand strong.

2268
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:31,460
- Pull.
- Pull.

2269
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:32,990
Have you done that before?

2270
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:34,200
- Okay.
- Okay?

2271
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:37,460
Woo Seok, weren't you
a bit surprised?

2272
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:38,570
Yes, a bit.

2273
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,870
- It's harder than it seems.
- It's just that...

2274
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,760
- my body is still tense.
- That's right.

2275
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,210
We have done this for over 12 years.

2276
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:46,460
You got pulled over very easily.

2277
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,540
Suk Jin, stop it.

2278
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:50,840
Give it a rest.

2279
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,170
- It's not like that.
- Do you think you are better?

2280
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,450
- For goodness' sake.
- Woo Seok.

2281
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:55,040
- Jae Suk, he is enjoying himself.
- Why are you so weak?

2282
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,290
- Seriously.
- You got pulled over very easily.

2283
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:58,640
He hasn't done this in a while.

2284
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,290
I will take on Woo Jae.

2285
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:01,710
- Okay.
- I will take on Woo Jae.

2286
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:03,990
- Can I try again?
- Okay.

2287
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,920
Grab this part.

2288
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,590
- Then the top...
- The name tag comes closer to you.

2289
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,720
You can do that.
Grab the shoulder first.

2290
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,030
- Okay. Then I pull.
- Grab the shoulder first.

2291
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:12,290
There you go.

2292
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:14,460
- I get it now.
- You get it now, right?

2293
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:15,790
Here she comes.

2294
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:16,830
(He practices with So Min too.)

2295
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:17,830
You got it now, right?

2296
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:20,570
- Ripping it off gives me thrills.
- It does, right?

2297
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:22,670
I haven't had that experience once
in the past five years.

2298
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:23,880
- Really?
- Yes.

2299
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:26,210
- I haven't had it.
- You have that experience today.

2300
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:27,620
- Okay.
- I will help you.

2301
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,380
- Hurry up and buy it.
- I will buy an elimination ticket.

2302
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:31,250
- Me too.
- Buy So Min one.

2303
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:33,840
I will take out
the person I run into.

2304
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,420
(Haha purchases
an elimination ticket.)

2305
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:39,530
It hurts my pride that my price is
four stickers. Okay.

2306
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,500
I will eliminate someone.

2307
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:44,700
- The race will begin.
- Let's go.

2308
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,130
Five,

2309
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:47,260
four,

2310
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:48,370
three,

2311
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:49,370
two,

2312
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:50,430
one.

2313
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:51,910
The race starts.

2314
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:53,830
The race starts.

2315
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:55,040
Let's go.

2316
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,110
(The first team to complete
the Runningdex will win!)

2317
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,580
I need to find the stickers.

2318
01:12:57,710 --> 01:12:59,250
(Team Woo Seok needs to find
2 more stickers...)

2319
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,820
I need to find
as many stickers as possible.

2320
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:02,510
(to complete the Runningdex.)

2321
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,040
(Woo Seok looks very excited.)

2322
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,180
How far can we go?
Are we using the entire building?

2323
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:14,330
(Woo Seok navigates the building
with his long legs.)

2324
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:16,200
I found one.

2325
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,960
(He found a Runningmon sticker.)

2326
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,090
I found one.

2327
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,200
Already?

2328
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,370
Who is it? Open it.

2329
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:25,240
If it's a new one, we can't use it
to purchase an elimination ticket.

2330
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,130
- We don't have it. It's new.
- Don't we have Sechanmon?

2331
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:31,040
Make sure
no one rips off your name tag.

2332
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,380
Then they will take away a sticker.

2333
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:35,510
- They will take away a sticker.
- Yes. That will happen.

2334
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:38,010
- Sechanmon.
- Sechanmon. Then we just need...

2335
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:39,380
- Seokjinmon.
- Right.

2336
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,750
- I found a sticker.
- Did you?

2337
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:42,880
I found a sticker.

2338
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,050
It was a new sticker,

2339
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:45,180
- so we just need one more.
- Really?

2340
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:47,220
- We just need Seokjinmon.
- Okay.

2341
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,500
That's good.

2342
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,030
They might be hiding.

2343
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,920
We just need one more.

2344
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,330
We just need your sticker.

2345
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:56,330
- Really?
- Will the race end if we find it?

2346
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,170
Yes. It will end.

2347
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,240
What? It's Haha.

2348
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:03,000
- Haha is over there.
- Jae Suk.

2349
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,410
- What?
- Did you find something?

2350
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:07,970
No.

2351
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:09,140
(On guard)

2352
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:10,320
Who can rip off name tags?

2353
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,880
- You?
- It's obvious.

2354
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,210
Haha can rip off name tags, right?

2355
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,550
I bet Haha can rip off name tags.

2356
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:18,050
(They don't know
who has an elimination ticket.)

2357
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:20,960
My price is one sticker, so...

2358
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,720
- What?
- Come here.

2359
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,760
My price is one sticker.
It put me in a good mood.

2360
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:28,200
- We should look for more stickers.
- You are right.

2361
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,670
There is no need for a scuffle.

2362
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,610
What? Ji Hyo,
what are you doing here?

2363
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:34,610
(They find Ji Hyo
who is by herself.)

2364
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:36,170
- I am looking for stickers.
- Let's take off your name tag.

2365
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,950
- Come on.
- Give me that.

2366
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,610
Give me that.

2367
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,920
- Give me that.
- Hold on. All right.

2368
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,420
Will you give it to us
or get eliminated?

2369
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:44,450
I will give it to you.

2370
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:46,510
- Give it to us.
- Get lost.

2371
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,120
How dare you...

2372
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:52,050
(Ripping off)

2373
01:14:52,050 --> 01:14:53,220
Woo Seok, sorry.

2374
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,630
(Woo Seok's name tag
gets ripped off instantly.)

2375
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,000
Woo Seok, sorry.

2376
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,200
- Woo Seok is out.
- She ripped it off.

2377
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,720
- She ripped it off.
- Just like that?

2378
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:02,760
I will purchase one.

2379
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,410
(Gyeong Hye purchased
an elimination ticket.)

2380
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:10,610
(When they were having a standoff,
she waited quietly behind Haha.)

2381
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,840
Ji Hyo.

2382
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,950
(When their attention was
on Ji Hyo,)

2383
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:14,080
(she came out
and looked for a chance.)

2384
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,320
Now is my chance.

2385
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,010
Will you give it to us
or get eliminated?

2386
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:19,790
(Woo Seok had his back turned.)

2387
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:22,460
(She ripped off his sticker
right away.)

2388
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:23,620
Woo Seok, sorry.

2389
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:25,050
- Woo Seok is out.
- She ripped it off.

2390
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:26,330
- She ripped it off.
- Just like that?

2391
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:27,660
I can't believe it.

2392
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:28,860
- Hey.
- I can't believe it.

2393
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:30,290
Woo Seok.

2394
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:32,370
- Gyeong Hye, you are good.
- You are really good.

2395
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:33,920
I ripped it off too early on, didn't I?

2396
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,870
- It's okay.
- Don't worry about that.

2397
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:38,430
- I am sorry.
- Woo Seok, you practiced so hard.

2398
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:40,130
Why didn't you notice Gyeong Hye?

2399
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,780
You should have ripped off
a Running Man member's name tag.

2400
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:44,040
This is driving me crazy.

2401
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,610
(Woo Seok got eliminated
in 1 minute and 38 seconds.)

2402
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:50,580
(He took after his teacher, Suk Jin,
and got eliminated early on.)

2403
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,510
Let's remove a sticker.

2404
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:55,050
- Will he get screen time in prison?
- No.

2405
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,720
No? Oh, no.

2406
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,630
- Woo Seok.
- You eliminated a guest.

2407
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:01,050
Good job, Gyeong Hye.

2408
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:04,000
- Good job.
- The strap broke.

2409
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
She becomes really competitive.

2410
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,090
(When it comes to a match,
she disregards the friendship.)

2411
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:08,790
Hold on. I feel so bad.
What is he going to do?

2412
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,590
He was carrying the Runningdex.

2413
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:11,960
You can take off one sticker.

2414
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,210
Were you carrying the Runningdex?

2415
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:15,410
- This is so annoying.
- One sticker.

2416
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:16,800
- Oh, no.
- Take it off.

2417
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,000
- Gyeong Hye, what have you done?
- We will take off Sechanmon.

2418
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:21,250
You eliminated
Woo Seok's screen time.

2419
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,320
- This is driving me crazy.
- What am I going to do?

2420
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,780
Viewers must be watching
in order to see Woo Seok.

2421
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:25,990
- What am I going to do?
- One of them will carry it, right?

2422
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:26,990
(Gyeong Hye still feels bad.)

2423
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:28,180
What have I done?

2424
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:29,880
For goodness' sake.

2425
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,750
I will get going now.

2426
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:33,030
At prison...

2427
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:34,050
Good luck.

2428
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:35,090
All right.

2429
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:36,860
(He feels disappointed
as he heads to prison.)

2430
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:38,090
So this is how it feels.

2431
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:40,590
Woo Seok, why are you out?
Who ripped off your name tag?

2432
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:42,500
So Min. Gyeong Hye did.

2433
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,610
My goodness. Gyeong Hye?

2434
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:46,570
Oh, no.

2435
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:47,670
I practiced.

2436
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:50,500
Oh, no. It's too...
Why did it have to be Gyeong Hye?

2437
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,710
Is there a revival ticket?

2438
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:53,880
Is there?

2439
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:57,210
I want to revive Woo Seok
in exchange for my life.

2440
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:58,950
Is there no such thing?

2441
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:00,420
Is there no such thing?

2442
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,120
Oh, no. Once you go to prison...

2443
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,530
- I don't want to go.
- I will follow you. Hang in there.

2444
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:06,290
- Okay.
- I will follow you to prison.

2445
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:07,360
- Okay.
- Wait.

2446
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,720
(She will follow him
to the netherworld.)

2447
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:09,920
Gyeong Hye?

2448
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,000
I will have my revenge.

2449
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:14,370
I will rip off
Gyeong Hye's name tag.

2450
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:17,170
(Ji Hyo averts the crisis
and runs away.)

2451
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:19,630
Everyone is so scary.

2452
01:17:20,610 --> 01:17:21,880
Gosh.

2453
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:22,930
(Jong Kook is hiding
with the Runningdex.)

2454
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,300
Do they go around
as a group like that?

2455
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:25,670
Is that allowed?

2456
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:26,950
(He spots Team Woo Seok in a group.)

2457
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:28,380
That makes no sense.

2458
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,470
Let's go.

2459
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:31,490
(He goes back into hiding.)

2460
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:34,010
- We need to eliminate Se Chan.
- We need to eliminate him.

2461
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:35,510
- Jong Kook.
- We can't give them more time.

2462
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:37,180
- Jong Kook.
- Hurry up.

2463
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:39,380
We are doing pretty well.

2464
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:40,460
We have good teamwork.

2465
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:44,030
Gyeong Hye has a fighting spirit.

2466
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:46,670
It came off again.

2467
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:49,040
- What?
- Check up on Jae Suk's microphone.

2468
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,240
- I need it fixed.
- It keeps coming off.

2469
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,240
(Jae Suk has a problem
with the audio system.)

2470
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:52,910
We will take a look at it.

2471
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,470
The screen came off.

2472
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,500
(Suk Jin and So Min keep going
without Jae Suk.)

2473
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,380
Suk Jin's stickers are pretty rare.

2474
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:58,880
All right.

2475
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,380
There they are.

2476
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:01,580
Jong Kook is coming.

2477
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:03,970
Jong Kook is coming.

2478
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:05,250
Once we find Se Chan...

2479
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:06,490
They are the same team.

2480
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:08,160
Let's go.

2481
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,790
(He retreats.)

2482
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:12,330
- Why are you running away?
- Where are you going?

2483
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:14,860
- It's so nice to see him run away.
- We must be intimidating.

2484
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:17,330
- We must be intimidating.
- Rip it off when I grab him.

2485
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:20,590
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk is looking
for Suk Jin and So Min.)

2486
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:22,000
Where did Suk Jin and So Min go?

2487
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,700
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk is looking
for Suk Jin and So Min.)

2488
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:26,910
Where did they go?

2489
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:29,170
How could they run off
by themselves?

2490
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:31,140
How could they run off
by themselves?

2491
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,250
Where is Jae Suk?

2492
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,040
Where is Jae Suk?
We need to find him.

2493
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,450
It's dangerous to be by ourselves.

2494
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:38,450
- It's dangerous.
- We need to travel as a group.

2495
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:40,210
Where is Jae Suk?
Shall we call him?

2496
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:41,710
This is...

2497
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:43,160
Oh, no.

2498
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:44,880
This makes my heart ache.

2499
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:47,220
Wasn't there a snack bar here?

2500
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:49,360
It disappeared.

2501
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:50,920
When did it disappear?

2502
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:51,960
What's wrong?

2503
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,590
- This makes my heart ache.
- Why?

2504
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:55,960
I made so many memories
at the snack bar.

2505
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:59,240
What are you talking about?
This isn't the time to do that.

2506
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,080
It's not like that.
There was a snack bar here.

2507
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,080
- You startled me.
- We went in through here.

2508
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,540
We found many hints here.

2509
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,280
- That's right.
- There was a chair here.

2510
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,710
There used to be a snack bar.

2511
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:10,380
- We found a hint on the laptop.
- That's right. There was a table.

2512
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:13,750
Han Na and I looked at each other...

2513
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,510
- like this.
- That's right.

2514
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:17,680
- We did that.
- You were wary of each other.

2515
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:20,050
- That's right.
- "Come here. Come inside."

2516
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:22,530
We went inside and...
It's blocked off now.

2517
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:24,000
- Oh, no.
- The snack bar was on this side.

2518
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,220
- And...
- The snack bar was on this side.

2519
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:26,460
- the chair was here.
- It used to be empty.

2520
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:28,090
Ice cream container was here.

2521
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:29,870
- We had to solve a quiz here...
- Snacks were here.

2522
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:31,760
- for an elimination ticket.
- That's right.

2523
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,370
(While Suk Jin and So Min
are absorbed in the past,)

2524
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:37,910
(this man
is desperately calling them.)

2525
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,380
Where are they?

2526
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:42,510
(Seriously.)

2527
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,420
(At that moment)

2528
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:46,490
There he is.

2529
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:48,710
Haha, there he is.

2530
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,360
Jae Suk is coming.

2531
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,460
There he is.

2532
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:53,360
Jae Suk is coming.

2533
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,460
(Jae Suk got spotted
while walking around alone.)

2534
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:56,530
- Where?
- Jae Suk is coming.

2535
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:57,790
Gyeong Hye.

2536
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:58,890
(Team Gyeong Hye won't miss
this chance.)

2537
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:00,170
Hide there.

2538
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:01,930
Come here.

2539
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:04,930
(Se Chan approaches Jae Suk.)

2540
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:06,070
Se Chan.

2541
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,040
What are you up to?

2542
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:11,640
You hid Haha, didn't you?

2543
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:16,540
You underestimate me.
Why would I do that and lure you in?

2544
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:18,290
Let's have a conversation.

2545
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,620
Where are my team members?

2546
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:25,550
Suk Jin, what should we do?
Things changed so much.

2547
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:27,330
- They didn't change.
- Why didn't you change at all?

2548
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:28,960
They didn't change.
You didn't change either.

2549
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,960
Compared to five years ago,
you didn't change at all.

2550
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:34,760
You are still the same.

2551
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,240
(Smiling from ear to ear)

2552
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,960
Let's keep saying nice things
to each other.

2553
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,470
You become stronger
and healthier every year.

2554
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,170
(The 2 of them have no idea
what's happening.)

2555
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:46,170
(He senses that he is in trouble.)

2556
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:47,250
For goodness' sake.

2557
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:50,580
Let's take a stroll.

2558
01:20:51,290 --> 01:20:52,790
- Come here.
- What?

2559
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:54,290
Let's take a stroll.

2560
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:56,420
I won't walk all the way there.

2561
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:57,460
Grab him!

2562
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:01,050
Grab him!

2563
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:03,330
(Haha and Gyeong Hye
begin to gang up on him.)

2564
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,390
Grab him!

2565
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:07,630
(Jae Suk needs to fight
against 3 people.)

2566
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:08,760
Gyeong Hye is like a thug.

2567
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:10,500
Gyeong Hye is like a thug.

2568
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:14,170
(Team Gyeong Hye
attacks vigorously.)

2569
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:15,780
Gyeong Hye, take it off.

2570
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:18,880
Gyeong Hye, take it off.

2571
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:21,750
- Gyeong Hye.
- There you go.

2572
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,320
Gyeong Hye is like a thug.

2573
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,140
- Jae Suk is out.
- This is...

2574
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:26,380
Hey.

2575
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:28,290
Where were you guys?

2576
01:21:28,290 --> 01:21:29,380
This is...

2577
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:32,360
(The two of them finally appear.)

2578
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,790
Why did you walk around alone?

2579
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,050
Do you have the Runningdex?

2580
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:36,630
I can't believe him.

2581
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:39,530
Where were you?

2582
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:43,430
We would have saved him
if you weren't absorbed in memories.

2583
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:45,500
- It's her fault.
- I got eliminated.

2584
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,760
She was absorbed in memories.

2585
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:51,040
It isn't my fault.
Why is he using me as an excuse?

2586
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,950
I shouldn't have trusted them.

2587
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:55,320
Jae Suk?

2588
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:56,950
When did he get eliminated?

2589
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,710
They are fast.

2590
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,490
- Is there one?
- Yes.

2591
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:05,220
Let's open it.

2592
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:06,830
Let's open it.

2593
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:09,890
Why are there so many of them?

2594
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:11,390
I have five Woojaemons now.

2595
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:13,390
Is this Woojaemon?
This is Woojaemon.

2596
01:22:13,390 --> 01:22:14,570
Why are there so many of yours?

2597
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:16,330
Are you going to make me
a common man?

2598
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,070
Woojaemon is so common.

2599
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:19,610
Is there one?

2600
01:22:19,870 --> 01:22:21,430
Jihyomon.

2601
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:23,000
Is it Jihyomon?

2602
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,380
- Gosh.
- It's Woojaemon.

2603
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:26,410
- How many are there?
- Woo Jae.

2604
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:27,920
It's your sticker.

2605
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,710
Did you hide about 200 Woojaemons?

2606
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,880
We keep finding his stickers.

2607
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,180
There are only Woojaemons.

2608
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:35,680
- There are only Woojaemons.
- There are so many of them.

2609
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:38,080
Seriously.
There are only Woojaemons.

2610
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:41,790
This is making me look like
a common man.

2611
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,130
- That hurts.
- Suk Jin is out.

2612
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:45,960
- We might win if we stay still.
- Really?

2613
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,570
Who is eliminating everyone?

2614
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:49,330
That means the pink team is out.

2615
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:50,460
The pink team is over.

2616
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:51,610
(A moment ago)

2617
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:53,260
It's me.

2618
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,370
I got her.

2619
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:56,080
- Can you rip off name tags?
- So Min is out.

2620
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:57,610
Get Suk Jin.

2621
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:59,210
- What?
- I ripped it off.

2622
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,170
- All members are out.
- We eliminated all of them.

2623
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:02,170
(Team Woo Seok is out.)

2624
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:04,250
Did you have to go that far?

2625
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,510
You didn't know, did you?

2626
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,210
- Gyeong Hye, you are the best.
- You are incredible.

2627
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:09,960
She is a killer.

2628
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:11,920
I am so frustrated.

2629
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,720
You shouldn't have gotten
eliminated.

2630
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,130
I would have done well with you.

2631
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:16,200
Seriously.

2632
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,290
(Team Woo Seok started at the top
and ended up at the bottom.)

2633
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:20,260
- This is good.
- Team Pink got wiped out.

2634
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:21,930
We will win.

2635
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:23,870
At this point,

2636
01:23:23,870 --> 01:23:26,740
- it will be hard for us to lose.
- Se Chan and...

2637
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:29,930
Will you be able to beat Jong Kook?

2638
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:31,380
- Of course.
- Yes.

2639
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:33,080
It will be hard for Jong Kook
to collect ten stickers.

2640
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:37,640
(Both teams focus on
collecting Runningmon stickers.)

2641
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,990
It's Jong Kook again.

2642
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,580
It's Jong Kook again.

2643
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,220
It's Se Chan again.

2644
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:49,590
Gosh, Yang Se Chan.

2645
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:52,220
(Jong Kook found a sticker as well.)

2646
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:54,090
It's Haha.

2647
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,460
It's a sticker we don't have.

2648
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:57,290
This is great.

2649
01:23:57,790 --> 01:23:59,040
Haha.

2650
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:02,430
This must be why
people collect such stickers.

2651
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:04,430
How about you?
Did you get Ji Hyo or So Min?

2652
01:24:04,430 --> 01:24:05,950
- No.
- No.

2653
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:07,210
I just found Haha.

2654
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:09,320
- We need Ji Hyo and So Min.
- I just found Haha.

2655
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:11,080
- It's here.
- You startled me.

2656
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:12,490
- It's here.
- Where?

2657
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:14,710
(Team Gyeong Hye
finds Runningmon stickers as well.)

2658
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:16,580
What is it?

2659
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:19,880
(They need
Seokjinmon and Wooseokmon.)

2660
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,030
Hold on.

2661
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:23,550
- Is it Woo Jae?
- It's Wooseokmon.

2662
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:25,720
- We got this.
- Come here.

2663
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,330
(Team Gyeong Hye got
1 more Runningmon sticker.)

2664
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,500
- Haha.
- Woo Jae went that way.

2665
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,610
Haha, come here.

2666
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:35,110
We just need one more.
Show it to the camera.

2667
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:36,910
Seokjinmon.

2668
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:38,610
Let's do this.

2669
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,450
- If they find it first,
- It will be bad.

2670
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:42,970
- we won't get to use our strength.
- Let's take them on.

2671
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:44,250
How many stickers do you have?

2672
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,950
I have about five more.

2673
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:47,250
Hold on to them.

2674
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:50,320
- I have 7.
- You have 7?

2675
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,660
Hold on.

2676
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:55,050
Then give me four.

2677
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:58,370
Then we can eliminate one person.

2678
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:00,920
(Jong Kook purchases
an elimination ticket.)

2679
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,130
- Ten stickers.
- All right.

2680
01:25:02,290 --> 01:25:04,540
- We can do this together.
- All right.

2681
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:05,870
- Relax.
- Either one of us...

2682
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:08,000
- can rip off name tags.
- That's right.

2683
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:11,170
- My gait changed.
- You can relax now.

2684
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:12,950
You can relax now.

2685
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:14,970
- Do I look relaxed?
- Yes, you do.

2686
01:25:14,970 --> 01:25:16,840
Woo Jae, you look relaxed.

2687
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,820
There it is.

2688
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,250
Where? My goodness.

2689
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:21,580
Please.

2690
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:24,010
If it's Seokjinmon, we will win.

2691
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:25,530
- Suk Jin.
- I hope it's Seokjinmon.

2692
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:28,590
Please let it be Seokjinmon.

2693
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:32,460
Please.

2694
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:33,760
- It's Jong Kook.
- Gosh.

2695
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:35,590
All right.

2696
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:39,210
Once I grab someone,
rip off the name tag.

2697
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:42,500
You just need to rip it off quickly, okay?

2698
01:25:42,830 --> 01:25:45,580
Jong Kook can't eliminate us.
He doesn't have ten stickers.

2699
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,080
(Team Gyeong Hye hides
in a corner of the building.)

2700
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:49,140
This is driving me crazy
because we just need one more.

2701
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,170
We just need one more.

2702
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:53,490
- One more.
- We don't have time to do that.

2703
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:56,360
- We should eliminate someone.
- They only need to find one more.

2704
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,360
- Really? Then we should hurry.
- Yes.

2705
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,720
So I heard.

2706
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:00,860
Where could it be?

2707
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:04,000
Okay.

2708
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,590
- Did you find one?
- Please.

2709
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:07,630
(Team Gyeong Hye
found another sticker!)

2710
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:08,700
It's over once we get Seokjinmon.

2711
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:09,700
(Team Gyeong Hye
found another sticker!)

2712
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:11,370
It's over once we get Seokjinmon.

2713
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:13,130
Please.

2714
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:16,540
- Yes!
- Why?

2715
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:19,970
We found it. This is amazing.

2716
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:22,950
(They managed to find Seokjinmon.)

2717
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:24,170
Hurry.

2718
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:25,880
(Team Gyeong Hye is done
collecting all the stickers.)

2719
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:26,950
Let's hurry.

2720
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:27,990
- What?
- What?

2721
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,960
Darn it. Seriously, is it over?

2722
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:32,990
I guess they found them all.

2723
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:36,030
We were about to get them. My gosh.

2724
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:38,590
- We stranded Jong Kook.
- Right.

2725
01:26:38,590 --> 01:26:40,960
We got rid of Team Pink's name tags.

2726
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:42,670
This is the best.

2727
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:45,240
(Team Gyeong Hye wins the race.)

2728
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,800
My gosh. Our teamwork was perfect.

2729
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:50,380
We've completed it.
Let's pretend this is glaring.

2730
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:51,580
- Start.
- Oh gosh!

2731
01:26:56,470 --> 01:27:03,550
(Team Gyeong Hye)

2732
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:06,050
- Well played.
- You are really good.

2733
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:07,460
(The 3 winners have won the prize.)

2734
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2735
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,130
- I just started enjoying tea.
- Thank you.

2736
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:14,670
(We thank Woo Jae, Gyeong Hye,
and Woo Seok for their appearance.)

2737
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:19,370
(Let's forget about age and fight.)

2738
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:21,110
(I don't drink,
but I need some alcohol today.)

2739
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:22,710
(The two towns have grudges
that are about to come to a head.)

2740
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:25,110
(That's when they receive...)

2741
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:26,610
(a mysterious message.)

2742
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:28,110
(Two pairs of arch enemies show up.)

2743
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:30,320
(Cho Jun Hyun, Cho Jun Ho,
Yoo Ri, Hyoyeon)

2744
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:33,010
(There can't be two suns
in the sky.)

2745
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:34,820
(How dare you get smart with me?)

2746
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:35,820
(Act like a senior if you are one.)

2747
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,220
(Don't let your enemy know
about your embarrassing secret.)

2748
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,720
(Yoo Ri hasn't studied for a while.)

2749
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,250
You'd make a good idol artist.

2750
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:44,250
(They don't care about ethics.)

2751
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:46,500
(They have nothing to lose
with this battle.)

2752
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:47,760
Stop it.

2753
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,260
(The end of the conflict?)

2754
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:51,170
(Or the beginning
of the eternal war?)

2755
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:54,260
(Which town will be
the winner of the battle?)

2756
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:56,430
(Enemy Cha-Cha-Cha)
