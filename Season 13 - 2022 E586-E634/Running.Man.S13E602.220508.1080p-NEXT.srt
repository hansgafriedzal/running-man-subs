1
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,890
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,260
Hello. It's Jong Kook's
birthday today.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,300
(Running-ri News, Kim Jong Kook's
birthday party on April 25)

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,210
(The day of the shoot
is Kim Jong Kook's birthday.)

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,710
(There's a sumptuous feast that will
make Jong Kook feel uncomfortable.)

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,170
Is this for Jong Kook's birthday?

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,900
- It's a birthday meal, but...
- The table is full of food.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,940
- My goodness.
- Hello.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,940
(The members start coming in.)

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,710
Happy birthday to you

11
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,350
Here's the birthday man!

12
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,010
- He's the birthday man.
- My gosh.

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,080
Surprise!

14
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,080
Happy birthday to you

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,460
- Seriously...
- He must be shy.

16
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,790
- He hates things like this.
- Surprise!

17
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,060
(He's reluctant to come in.)

18
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,860
- You are a lucky man.
- He really hates it.

19
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,860
- He hates it.
- He doesn't like it.

20
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,240
- Our group chat room was crazy.
- The birthday meal.

21
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,770
- My gosh.
- Stand in the middle.

22
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,270
This is really embarrassing.

23
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,170
Aren't we supposed to do this
at the end of the shoot?

24
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,780
He is blushing right now.

25
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,000
- This is driving me crazy.
- It's your birthday today.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,410
- But still...
- Our group chat room...

27
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,240
(Here's the birthday gift for him!)

28
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,040
- Here's the birthday gift for him!
- Happy birthday to you

29
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,990
- She's the gift.
- Happy birthday to you

30
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,020
(She seems more excited
than usual today.)

31
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,150
(Song Ji Hyo, Running Man's star,
livens up the party.)

32
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,590
- Happy birthday, dear Jong Kook
- Boombastic!

33
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,730
What is this sound?

34
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,730
- "Happy Birthday song."
- Gosh, will you stop that?

35
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,030
This is your song.

36
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,200
- It's Jong Kook's song.
- Right.

37
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,590
My goodness.

38
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,670
(The birthday party begins.)

39
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,280
(They start dancing
to celebrate his birthday.)

40
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,040
Let's form a circle
with Jong Kook in the middle.

41
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,870
(Sighing)

42
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,280
Let's form a circle
with Jong Kook in the middle.

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,420
Come and stand in the middle.

44
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,890
- Let's go round.
- Let's go round.

45
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,980
Hold my hand.

46
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,650
(Happy birthday!)

47
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,150
(He claps his hands
with a blank look.)

48
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,150
This is so...

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,850
- I feel dizzy.
- I hate this.

50
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,200
- If I were Jong Kook...
- Me too.

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,670
- I would hate it a lot.
- I mean...

52
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,370
- It only embarrasses him.
- Let me...

53
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,170
Let me tell you something first.

54
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,570
I hate it so much.

55
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,640
- Isn't this nice?
- This is horrible.

56
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,180
- You should be happy.
- Sure. This is a good thing.

57
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,740
- Right. You should be happy.
- But...

58
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,450
Aren't I supposed to be happy?

59
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,010
- You must be happy.
- That's...

60
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,510
That's the most important thing.

61
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,510
You've been smiling the whole time.
Why do you say you're not happy?

62
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,650
- He's smiling broadly.
- That's because of the cameras.

63
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,190
- That's why he's smiling.
- Look at him.

64
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,290
That's because of the cameras.

65
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,820
- He's smiling from ear to ear.
- My gosh.

66
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,630
- All right.
- Please eat before it gets cold.

67
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,660
- Okay.
- Let's eat.

68
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,730
Look at that.

69
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,290
- There's yellow corvina too.
- This is amazing.

70
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,260
- It has names.
- There are our names on them.

71
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,570
- Jong Kook...
- There are name tags.

72
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,290
Why do the cushions have
our names on them?

73
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,290
They have names.

74
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,730
- That's yellow corvina.
- There's raw beef.

75
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,010
My goodness.

76
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,440
Jong Kook, there's seaweed soup.

77
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,570
Seaweed soup.

78
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,540
- Thank you for the food.
- My goodness.

79
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,750
- Happy birthday, Jong Kook.
- All right.

80
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,080
- This is great.
- Happy birthday, Jong Kook.

81
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,610
All right. Thank you.

82
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,320
Ji Hyo, the seaweed soup
is really good.

83
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,110
You are a good cook.

84
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,080
- How did you know that?
- Did Ji Hyo cook all this?

85
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,700
It's still warm.

86
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,070
- My gosh.
- Can we eat this in the morning?

87
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,570
We don't get to eat warm food
like this during a shoot.

88
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,570
- This is so good.
- It's delicious.

89
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,100
We usually eat cold food.

90
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,360
That's because
it's Jong Kook's birthday.

91
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,540
- It's Lord Kim's birthday.
- It's so tasty.

92
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,730
Even the elders wouldn't
get such nice dishes like this.

93
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,040
- My gosh.
- This is all thanks to Jong Kook.

94
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,770
- The food is really good.
- I love it.

95
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,420
It's still warm,

96
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,720
- so it tastes even better.
- Seriously,

97
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,610
the dishes are made
with love and affection.

98
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,320
The galbi tastes really good.

99
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,160
- It's delicious.
- By the way,

100
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,660
- I wish we didn't have this cake.
- Why not?

101
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,020
If it wasn't here,

102
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,700
it would've been a nice meal.

103
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,360
But we should have Jong Kook
blow out the candles.

104
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,600
- Right.
- We need a lighter.

105
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,170
- We have one here.
- The lighter.

106
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,330
This is what we do on a birthday.

107
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,670
Sure. Blow out the candles.

108
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,510
- Jong Kook, shall we take a photo?
- No.

109
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,330
- Let's take a photo together.
- That's enough.

110
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,200
- Let's do that.
- Hey, stop it.

111
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,640
That's all we will have left.

112
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,920
- Make a wish.
- Okay!

113
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,980
Gosh, Jong Kook. No.

114
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,380
- That's not right.
- Thank you.

115
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,420
- You can't do this.
- Thank you.

116
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,890
- That's enough.
- I will count to three.

117
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,920
- We have to at least applaud.
- We will applaud.

118
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,790
Anyway, I made my wish.

119
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,760
- You should say it out loud.
- Out loud.

120
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,630
- I should do it quietly.
- That's not true.

121
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,970
You should leave
video messages to each member.

122
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,130
Tell us you love us.

123
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,600
- Gosh, he is...
- Even I feel uncomfortable.

124
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,360
Should I kill him?

125
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,300
Thank you, guys.
I hope all of you will stay healthy.

126
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,640
All right.

127
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,750
One, two, and three.

128
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,480
(Even his birthday wish is health.)

129
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,250
- This is so good.
- I think this is tteokgalbi.

130
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,490
It tastes amazing.

131
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,990
Are you two...

132
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,490
visiting your parents?

133
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,060
I like the food, Father.

134
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,020
(He has a coy daughter-in-law.)

135
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,450
- You do?
- Yes, Father.

136
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,660
- But our family doesn't like you.
- Let's eat quietly.

137
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,500
- You don't belong here.
- Father.

138
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,140
Please give me the recipe.

139
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,370
I want to cook this for my husband.

140
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,960
- The recipe for this?
- Yes.

141
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,570
I bought it at the restaurant
in the neighborhood.

142
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,110
If you want the recipe,
you should go ask the chef.

143
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,180
She says her husband.

144
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,840
Ji Hyo, you were
on "Problem Child in House."

145
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,340
- With Jong Kook.
- Right.

146
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,820
I went there.

147
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,690
Well... That's amazing.

148
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,710
She is very supportive.

149
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,860
- Hang on.
- What...

150
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,020
- I mean...
- Why? It's great.

151
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,520
- Well...
- What's wrong?

152
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,800
- What is that supposed to mean?
- It's great.

153
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,200
Isn't that nice?

154
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,520
What do you mean by "amazing?"

155
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,590
That's amazing.

156
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,830
You've got a letter.

157
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,830
- Who is that?
- What?

158
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,510
(You've got a letter.)

159
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,610
- Who is that?
- What?

160
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,830
- You've got a letter.
- Hey, Myung Jae.

161
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,940
- Myung Jae, is this what you do?
- Myung Jae.

162
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,050
(The assistant director is
occupied with trivial work.)

163
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,110
Just throw it.

164
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,750
You've got a letter.

165
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,880
- My gosh.
- What's that?

166
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,990
- He looks feeble.
- What was that about?

167
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,120
He just needed to be outside
the view of the camera,

168
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,450
but he actually went out.

169
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,690
- He's embarrassed.
- He feels shy.

170
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,720
He's shy.

171
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,220
"Running-ri Correspondence."

172
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,390
"The two towns of Running-ri
are long-standing enemies,"

173
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,960
"so they get into a fight
whenever they face each other."

174
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,160
"And now they are filing suits
in conflict with each other."

175
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,310
"Hopefully, a prompt and amicable
settlement will be reached."

176
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,160
Ji Suk Jin, Haha,
and Song Ji Hyo...

177
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,470
- belong to Town A.
- They are a team.

178
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,570
Yoo Jae Suk, Yang Se Chan,
and Jeon So Min belong to Town B.

179
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,310
- What about me?
- The charges.

180
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,340
(I'm not there?)

181
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,270
It's Ji Suk Jin
versus Yoo Jae Suk.

182
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,750
The plaintiff is Suk Jin,
and the defendant is me.

183
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,280
- I see.
- The charge is contempt.

184
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,190
"Ji Suk Jin from Town A
files a suit against Yoo Jae Suk..."

185
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,260
"for his endless mockery
and insulting remarks."

186
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,780
I'd like to file a suit.

187
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,650
Haha is suing Se Chan
for libel and slander.

188
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,930
Haha is the plaintiff.

189
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,430
"Haha from Town A files a suit
against Yang Se Chan from Town B..."

190
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,260
"for his constant pranks
and spreading of false rumors,"

191
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,760
"which have significantly
tarnished his reputation."

192
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,160
- What?
- Song Ji Hyo and Jeon So Min.

193
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,240
"Song Ji Hyo from Town A files
a suit against Jeon So Min..."

194
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,470
"for her constant flirting
with men from other towns,"

195
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,680
"which kept her
from concentrating on her work."

196
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,490
"Notice. On April 25, new residents
at each other's throats..."

197
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,550
"will move into Town A and Town B."

198
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,060
(New residents will be moving
into Town A and Town B on April 25.)

199
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,620
What is Jong Kook doing?

200
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,860
As the correspondence confirms,

201
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,590
there are long-standing enemies
in Running-ri.

202
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,300
Ji Suk Jin versus Yoo Jae Suk.

203
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,430
Haha versus Yang Se Chan.

204
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,300
And Song Ji Hyo versus Jeon So Min.

205
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,160
The older residents
are from Town A...

206
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,530
while the younger ones
are from Town B.

207
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,960
(The older residents
are from Town A.)

208
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,240
So there will be two teams.

209
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,270
And each town has
new residents moving in.

210
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,250
- Really?
- Please welcome them.

211
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,750
- What?
- Who are they?

212
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,950
(Who are the new residents?)

213
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,270
What? My goodness.

214
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,750
- He's Cho Jun Ho.
- I know them.

215
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,080
- They are twin brothers.
- Girls' Generation.

216
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,280
- Gosh, Hyoyeon.
- Girls' Generation.

217
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,080
- Hello.
- Hello.

218
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,150
(The new residents in the two towns)

219
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
Yuri from Town B,

220
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,890
- Yuri from Town B.
- and Hyoyeon from Town A.

221
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:23,930
Please come on up.

222
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,300
Happy birthday.

223
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,570
- That's right.
- Happy birthday.

224
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,570
- All right.
- Is it your birthday?

225
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,570
- You're a year older now.
- That's enough.

226
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,880
- Let's sit, guys.
- Happy birthday.

227
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,030
- This is like a national holiday.
- I know. It's like a holiday.

228
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,180
This feels like a holiday.

229
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,770
- It's a holiday.
- This is nice.

230
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,820
I can't believe
you two look just the same.

231
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,580
- My gosh. I can't tell who's who.
- They are twins.

232
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,320
- Is this for me?
- They don't look the same on TV.

233
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,150
- Jun Hyun, are you the younger one?
- Yes.

234
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,760
And Jun Ho is the older one.

235
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,860
- How many minutes apart?
- We're eight minutes apart.

236
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,560
- Eight minutes.
- Eight minutes?

237
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,820
I've seen you guys
on many TV shows lately.

238
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,320
- They fight a lot.
- Right.

239
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,460
Seriously, they fight like crazy.
I've never seen brothers like them.

240
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,090
They are really funny though.

241
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,770
(They fight a lot at home...)

242
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,270
(as well as outside.)

243
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,120
(Don't you try to talk to me
from so close ever again.)

244
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,070
(They fight physically
and mentally every day.)

245
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,840
- Now he has a syndrome.
- What syndrome?

246
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,360
- People like it when we fight.
- I see.

247
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,520
- So when someone recognizes us,
- On purpose...

248
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,690
he picks up a fight.

249
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,220
That's what he does.

250
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,660
- It can't happen.
- He can't help it.

251
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,140
I feel like I should
show them something.

252
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,960
That's why they like us.

253
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,660
I know how it feels.

254
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,900
Identical twins at least
try to have different hairstyles.

255
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,240
But you have the same hairstyle.

256
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,110
We usually have
different hairstyles.

257
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,880
But after we did some TV shows,

258
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,410
he wants to signify
the identity of twin brothers.

259
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,490
He wants more people
to recognize you.

260
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,260
They don't recognize us
when we look different.

261
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,520
When we look the same,
they recognize us right away.

262
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,550
- So do you wear the same clothes?
- Yes.

263
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,260
- Even the clothes?
- That's unbelievable.

264
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,970
Yuri and Hyoyeon,
aren't you two close friends?

265
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,600
(She's eating seaweed soup
with some rice.)

266
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,970
- Yuri?
- She's eating.

267
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,660
- Yuri.
- Yuri is eating.

268
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,140
Yuri is different from...
her early days in Girls' Generation.

269
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,270
Of course she is.

270
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,400
He's straightforward.

271
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,670
- Let me just eat first.
- You are eating.

272
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,480
Yuri is... Seriously,

273
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,280
I always thought Yuri would
make an amazing entertainer.

274
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,490
- She did many variety shows.
- Before we came here...

275
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,050
Actually, I came here
after getting a call from Yuri.

276
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,960
She asked me to join this show
saying I was her best friend.

277
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,100
- So I was very touched.
- I see.

278
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,370
- But you two aren't so close?
- No.

279
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,870
- I didn't feel that way.
- What are you talking about?

280
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,890
- Hey, why would you say that?
- What?

281
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,370
But a few days later,
my manager told me...

282
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,530
that we'd be here as enemies.

283
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,710
(We'd be here as enemies.)

284
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,980
You two are enemies.

285
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,340
- That's what you are.
- I had no idea.

286
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,250
Hyoyeon is just like Suk Jin.

287
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,670
She often makes
a slip of the tongue.

288
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,040
- Really?
- Hyoyeon?

289
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,410
She met Ha Suk Jin
at an award ceremony.

290
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,280
You know that, right?
She called him Ji Suk Jin.

291
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,410
She called him Ji Suk Jin?

292
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,120
To Ha Suk Jin?

293
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,860
- You did?
- "Ji Suk Jin is the best!"

294
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,520
That's hilarious.

295
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,020
And she called Jun Hyun Moo
Im Chae Moo.

296
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,760
They are totally different names.

297
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,370
- Well...
- You would know this one.

298
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,160
She called Brian McKnight
Brian McMorning.

299
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,840
McMorning?

300
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,740
- That's impressive.
- Brian McMorning?

301
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,900
- There are a lot.
- That's impressive.

302
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,980
- But Brian McMorning is a little...
- She did it on purpose.

303
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,720
- I think she did it on purpose.
- I bet it was intentional.

304
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,910
- No.
- You wanted to show something.

305
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,220
No, I didn't intend anything.

306
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,990
- Really?
- I wish she did.

307
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,510
- You wish.
- McMorning.

308
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,680
I don't think
Brian McMorning was intentional.

309
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,230
But there's more.
She called Whoopi Goldberg...

310
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,680
Whoopi Golden Retriever.

311
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
- That must be intentional.
- I think so.

312
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,920
She called Whoopi Goldberg
Whoopi Golden Retriever.

313
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,130
- That must be intentional.
- I think so.

314
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,420
- It's intentional.
- You have to admit it.

315
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,600
- It must've been intentional.
- I swear.

316
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,930
Hyoyeon.

317
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,060
Seriously, it wasn't.

318
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,470
- It smells fishy.
- That can't be right.

319
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,670
It was right after my debut,
so I couldn't intend anything.

320
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,300
- You couldn't?
- I was so nervous.

321
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,980
- Oh, right.
- What?

322
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,680
I heard something
about Jun Ho and Jun Hyun.

323
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,780
- They prepared some dances.
- Really?

324
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,390
They are so determined. Good.

325
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,180
This is crazy.

326
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,460
I've never seen
judo athletes dance before.

327
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,650
- Dance?
- It's not a break-fall, right?

328
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,260
- Of course not.
- My goodness.

329
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,870
- That's what they prepared.
- We have to watch it.

330
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,140
We have to smile at the cameras
while we dance. You know, right?

331
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,800
- They are celebrities.
- You look like...

332
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,300
In those outfits,

333
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,710
you two look like Yookgaksu.

334
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,930
- The duo.
- Right.

335
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,770
- Heungbo is unbelievable
- I think I saw them on TV.

336
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,140
Heungbo is unbelievable

337
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,210
I saw them on
"The Return of Superman."

338
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,270
They've grown a lot.

339
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,350
Seriously, this is...

340
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,720
- I'm so excited.
- This is the judo dance.

341
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,140
I've never seen judo dance before.

342
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,150
My goodness.

343
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,360
What?

344
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,960
(What? Is this IVE's song?)

345
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,860
- What?
- Ready.

346
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,500
(What?)

347
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
- I see.
- That's a judo technique.

348
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,110
They look so serious.

349
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,010
- This isn't funny.
- Right.

350
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,800
(They dance like elementary
school kids with serious looks.)

351
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,640
What are they doing?

352
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,050
(A break-fall for the finale)

353
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,360
(The dance ends with a short skit.)

354
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,760
Hang on. The break-fall
didn't seem right.

355
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,420
- What...
- Hang on.

356
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,790
Can we do the ending again?
We didn't do it properly.

357
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,870
That was...

358
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,840
- The ground was shaking.
- The break-fall wasn't right.

359
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,760
- He fell on his back.
- It was so hard.

360
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,840
- Wait.
- It didn't seem right.

361
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,930
- Yuri and Hyoyeon, you should...
- Yes.

362
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,840
- I want to see their dances.
- Show us just a little.

363
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,010
- We all want to see it.
- Please show us.

364
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,140
- Dear me.
- Do all of your dances for us.

365
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,800
- Show us a little.
- You see, I...

366
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,980
A short version will do.

367
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,040
- I feel so happy...
- Like you do when you rehearse.

368
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,090
You know that Yuri is successful
as an actress these days, right?

369
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,510
- Yes.
- She still goes on variety shows.

370
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,990
Right. Of course.

371
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,460
- I'm so grateful to her.
- I know.

372
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,550
I told Eun Hye to appear on
variety shows too.

373
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,000
(I told Eun Hye to appear on
variety shows too.)

374
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,290
- Today is his birthday.
- But it's true.

375
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,560
- It's his birthday.
- Give him a break.

376
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,660
Eun Hye and Jin should've kept
doing variety shows.

377
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,170
It's Jong Kook's birthday.

378
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,250
Jin, right? I told Eun Hye and Jin
about it so many times.

379
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,670
- It's his birthday.
- Jae Suk.

380
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,810
- It's a happy day.
- Gosh, I need to drink today.

381
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,010
- Come on. It's a happy day.
- Darn it.

382
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,680
Don't be like this
on a happy day like this.

383
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,010
- I told them numerous times.
- He likes that joke so much.

384
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,810
- I can't believe...
- He keeps bringing her up.

385
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,960
I thought he would stop
bringing her up, but he won't.

386
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,500
- I might've forgotten a few moves.
- It's okay.

387
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,100
- You look amazing.
- I might've forgotten the moves.

388
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,020
- Your body must remember.
- You can skip some moves.

389
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,230
(It's been a while since they last
did Girls’ Generation's dance.)

390
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,290
We don't know
what song will be played.

391
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,760
Let's go.

392
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,870
"Into the New World."

393
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,340
("Into the New World" is their
debut song released 15 years ago.)

394
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,900
- This is my favorite song.
- It's a great song.

395
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,640
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

396
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,210
You look so pretty!

397
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,770
Their bodies are reacting
to the song.

398
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,890
They remember all the moves.

399
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,250
(Their bodies remember
the dance from their debut song.)

400
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,830
- They're dancing so effortlessly.
- Goodbye

401
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,180
Let's go!

402
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,520
(Kicking)

403
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,330
(The old fans are
exceptionally excited.)

404
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,560
Here we go!

405
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,390
(The 2nd song is "Tell Me Your Wish"
released in 2012.)

406
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,480
It sure is your birthday, Jong Kook.

407
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,110
The Girls’ Generation members are
performing for you.

408
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,880
(He's barely keeping a smile
on his face.)

409
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,040
Say your wish! Come on!

410
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,720
(His wish is that their performance
will end shortly.)

411
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,130
- Tell me your wish.
- All right.

412
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,180
(As Yuri and Hyoyeon do
a dance move for him...)

413
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,600
Tell us your wish.

414
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,890
(One Man wishes he could hide.)

415
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,660
- It's "Hoot."
- "Hoot."

416
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,270
I love this song!

417
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,930
They remember every move.

418
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,800
- They're amazing.
- Sing along, everyone.

419
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,910
They're incredible.

420
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,010
(He's getting overexcited
and singing, "I hoot.")

421
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,050
I don't remember the rest.

422
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,550
Why did you forget it?

423
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,920
I can't remember the rest.

424
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,290
- Thank you. That was awesome.
- Thank you.

425
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,050
- That was amazing.
- I'm impressed.

426
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,470
But they didn't dance to "Gee."

427
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,260
- I wanted to see "Oh!."
- That's enough.

428
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,890
- We didn't dance to that? Let's go.
- "Oh!"

429
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,870
(Ms. Kwon got excited
when it was already over.)

430
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,560
Dance to "Oh!" for us, please.

431
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,170
- Hyoyeon, show us, please.
- You were amazing.

432
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,640
- I really wanted to see it.
- It was awesome.

433
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,510
- I wanted to see this move.
- Can you play the song?

434
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,850
- It's cheerful.
- Yuri, you do it.

435
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
- Me?
- Yuri got excited.

436
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,220
- Right.
- Right now?

437
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,780
- I want to see the "Gee" dance.
- But...

438
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,620
(The encore performance begins.)

439
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,510
What was it? Let me think.

440
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,920
(Jong Kook becomes pale
as the song goes on.)

441
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,760
Keep going.

442
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,870
- That's great.
- Yes, keep going.

443
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,530
(Please stop it.)

444
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,060
- That's amazing. All right!
- She's cute.

445
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,580
Keep going!

446
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,400
- That was great.
- Thank you.

447
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,710
(He finally smiles
since her performance ended.)

448
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,440
- My goodness.
- That was amazing.

449
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,640
- The song would suit So Min.
- I'm so proud of you.

450
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,040
- So Min, do the dance just once.
- Do the highlight dance move.

451
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,620
- It's his birthday.
- Please show us.

452
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,150
- This is perfect for So Min.
- Exactly.

453
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,520
- For Jong Kook.
- I'm so excited.

454
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
- So Min looks excited.
- I really...

455
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
Come on. Show us.

456
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,550
Let's go!

457
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,710
Oh, gosh.

458
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,140
- It's so cheesy.
- It's so cheesy.

459
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,440
(Her cheesy dance makes
everyone shudder.)

460
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,810
- It's so cheesy.
- It's so cheesy.

461
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,510
- That's enough.
- My gosh.

462
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,910
- I need kimchi.
- She's so funny.

463
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,890
That's enough. Stop the music.

464
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,090
Stop.

465
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,780
(Gobbling down kimchi)

466
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,680
I love kimchi.

467
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,790
- I love them all so much.
- My gosh.

468
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,420
- That was so cheesy.
- I mean it.

469
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,190
- That was good.
- It was intense.

470
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,060
- She'd make a great idol singer.
- It was intense.

471
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,190
- I agree.
- Exactly.

472
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,260
- That was so cheesy.
- Ji Hyo, show your dance just once.

473
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,970
- Me?
- Don't do that.

474
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,300
- Ji Hyo has her own dance style.
- That'd be the real deal.

475
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,610
- Don't do it.
- Go on.

476
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,900
Ji Hyo has her own dance style.

477
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,400
- She has her own style.
- I'm excited.

478
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,610
- She looks so pretty today.
- It'll be an old-fashioned dance.

479
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,800
An old-fashioned dance.

480
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,670
There she comes.

481
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,940
It sure is your birthday.

482
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,210
Hey!

483
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,090
Hey!

484
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,650
She put her foot on the table.

485
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,330
Stop the music now!

486
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,630
- Gosh.
- Stop the music.

487
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,770
- Stop it.
- Ji Hyo.

488
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,720
- Come on. What are you doing?
- This isn't an R-rated show.

489
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,490
- Stop it.
- Ji Hyo.

490
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,190
- Hey! What are you doing?
- What's wrong?

491
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,310
- We're eating here.
- Hey.

492
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,040
That was inappropriate.

493
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,000
- But that's my style.
- What was that?

494
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,930
- It's my style.
- Why would you put your foot...

495
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,640
Why did you put a tablecloth
on the table?

496
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,710
How dare you call my skirt
a tablecloth?

497
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,670
(Laughing hard)

498
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,890
- Get her out of here. Now.
- What's going on?

499
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,210
(Suk Jin is running out of breath.)

500
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,390
- He's laughing so hard.
- Hey!

501
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,480
- She took me by surprise.
- He loved it.

502
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,530
- I was taken aback.
- Suk Jin loved it.

503
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,860
Be careful.

504
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,650
That was unexpected.

505
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,570
- Hey.
- What's with the tablecloth?

506
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,190
Check Suk Jin's blood pressure.

507
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,040
Check his blood pressure.

508
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,190
(He regained his vitality.)

509
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,340
- Suk Jin...
- That was completely unexpected.

510
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,200
I couldn't even imagine that.

511
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,810
That was unexpected.

512
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,580
- Seriously...
- It was unbelievable.

513
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,780
- She's unbelievable.
- It was unexpected.

514
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,240
- She's drinking dongchimi.
- She always catches us off guard.

515
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,910
She's drinking dongchimi
after dancing.

516
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,910
- I was thirsty.
- It was cheesy even for herself.

517
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,680
- I'm still thirsty.
- That's why she's drinking it.

518
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,910
That was funny.

519
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,130
Today's race where the enemies
with grudges against each other...

520
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,030
compete against each other...

521
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,300
is Enemy Cha-Cha-Cha,
Town A Versus Town B.

522
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,660
The two towns will compete with
each other.

523
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,540
- Jong Kook, who belongs to no town,
- Yes.

524
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,310
- is Chief Kook.
- Yes.

525
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,140
He can choose the town to join
in every mission...

526
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,930
through negotiation with both towns.

527
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,080
- I see.
- Got it.

528
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,000
- That's good. I like that.
- Okay.

529
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,850
The winning team members get
different amounts of money.

530
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,440
The losing team members get
a random amount of money...

531
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,210
out of different amounts
including negative numbers.

532
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,360
Chief Kook also gets
one of the amounts.

533
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,090
- It's an individual competition.
- I see.

534
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:04,160
The top two with the largest amounts
of money win and get a prize.

535
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,660
The bottom two get a penalty.

536
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,040
Before we officially begin the race,

537
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,270
each of you will check
your enemy's ability through a game.

538
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,370
- What is it?
- My enemy's ability.

539
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,280
You need to move fast and accurately
to shoot your enemy.

540
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
It's I Can Shoot You.

541
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,580
"I can shoot you."

542
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,050
"I might shoot you."

543
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,440
So Min is good at this.

544
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,620
Ready, go.

545
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,150
"I might shoot you."

546
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:32,360
We'll place disassembled water guns
on the table.

547
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,450
You have to assemble your water gun
and fill it with water,

548
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,890
- We've played this game before.
- shoot the opponent's headband,

549
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,340
and shout the letter written on it
to win.

550
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,490
- Okay.
- That's interesting.

551
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,340
You may disturb your opponent
while assembling the gun.

552
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,440
The winner gets 2 dollars,
and the loser gets 1 dollar.

553
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,810
Chief Kook,
you won't play this game.

554
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,170
Understood.

555
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,970
The first round is...

556
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,440
- Haha versus Se Chan.
- Great.

557
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,910
- Mapo One-Month Punch.
- Bang! Mapo One-Month Punch.

558
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,910
- Let's go.
- This is good.

559
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,060
- I'll teach him a serious lesson.
- Bang.

560
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,330
No mercy.

561
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,420
(They became enemies
as they got cheeky with each other.)

562
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,860
- I see.
- It'll be fun.

563
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,990
- We need agility.
- The amount of water matters too.

564
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,600
Just a second.

565
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,690
(Haha and Se Chan,
the 2 enemies look determined.)

566
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,840
Ready.

567
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,640
(Which of them will win
this match of enemies?)

568
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,830
What's going on?

569
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
What's going on?

570
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,190
(As soon as it began, Haha threw
Se Chan's water container.)

571
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,460
- Se Chan is clenching his teeth.
- Come on.

572
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,510
- Hurry up.
- Did you see that?

573
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,130
(They're trying everything
to disturb each other.)

574
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,840
Se Chan is clenching his teeth.

575
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,080
What is he doing? My gosh.

576
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,170
- This is so funny.
- Hey.

577
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,080
Haha is so fast.

578
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,850
- Se Chan is annoyed.
- Yes, he is.

579
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,740
- Good.
- It's starting to show.

580
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,650
(The game started getting dirty.)

581
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,790
It's starting to show.

582
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,950
This is ugly.

583
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,060
(They started tussling in the end.)

584
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,830
(Se Chan bites his head
with his front teeth.)

585
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,660
(Biting)

586
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,070
- It hurts so much.
- He dropped it.

587
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,130
(He's like a nutria
biting a chestnut.)

588
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,310
- Pick it up.
- That's ugly.

589
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,970
Come here.

590
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,010
- Se Chan, pick up the headband.
- It hurts!

591
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,900
That's good. One more time.

592
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,940
(A water slap)

593
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,240
- Gosh, it hurts so bad.
- Hurry up.

594
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,080
Check if it's yours or his.

595
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,640
(The headbands are soaked,
lying around on the ground.)

596
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,910
Whose is that?

597
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,150
(The person
who reads the letters first wins.)

598
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,290
- Let me answer. Bidet!
- Eel!

599
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,530
- Haha wins.
- What? Really?

600
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,070
(Haha from Town A who shouted
the answer first won.)

601
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,300
Haha wins.

602
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,370
- Are your front teeth okay?
- Wasn't Se Chan fast?

603
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,630
Am I bleeding right now?

604
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,930
Right here.

605
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,540
Hey, you guys...

606
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,730
You put too much pressure
on the twins.

607
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,280
- Exactly.
- How...

608
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,780
How much more intense should it be?

609
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,350
Exactly. They raised the bar.

610
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,580
- Hey, let's make it intense.
- Hey.

611
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,470
The second round is
Jun Ho versus Jun Hyun.

612
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,050
- All right.
- I'm excited to watch this.

613
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,480
I'm so excited.

614
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,710
- I'm excited about this match.
- Go, Jun Hyun.

615
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,120
They'll throw each other down.

616
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
- Of course.
- Good luck.

617
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,090
They'll do a foot sweep,

618
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,060
- and throw each other down.
- This will be intense.

619
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,150
No foot sweep, okay?

620
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,390
- It's a perfect day to fight.
- Okay.

621
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,660
- Let's play fair and square.
- Your fans are watching you.

622
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,770
- We need this to make characters.
- A lot of fans are expecting...

623
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,510
- to see you two fight.
- We should make characters.

624
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,160
(The greedy twins want to be funny
more than to play fair and square.)

625
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,340
Ready.

626
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,900
Set.

627
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,550
- Oh, good. He's fast.
- Hey, stop it.

628
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,940
(Jun Hyun cheated from the start
unlike what they agreed on.)

629
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,350
- Wait. Okay. Got it.
- Look.

630
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,410
He'll be able to read it shortly.

631
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,520
That's good. Keep going.

632
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,260
- Okay.
- I learned some skills from them.

633
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,980
- I'm impressed.
- I learned from them.

634
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,490
The guys from Town B play so dirty.

635
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,860
- My gosh.
- You...

636
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,570
You should pour water on me too,
so we can make it fair.

637
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,870
- Don't play dirty.
- You should pour water on me too...

638
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,870
(He pours water on his face.)

639
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,010
- My gosh. What is he doing?
- What are you doing?

640
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,160
- Duck.
- What was that?

641
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,930
- What are you guys doing?
- What's going on?

642
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,230
- Hey.
- Could the letters be reversed?

643
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,380
He's doing a shoulder throw.

644
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,400
(A shoulder throw)

645
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,780
- It's over now.
- My gosh.

646
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,670
- He won't fall.
- He's trying to throw him down.

647
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,790
(They started with a smile,
but now they're fighting seriously.)

648
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,320
- He won't fall.
- That's impressive.

649
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,860
- He didn't fall.
- This is fun.

650
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,480
- The letters are visible now.
- Hey, you should give it to me.

651
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,130
- You can read the letters.
- The letters are visible now.

652
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,790
- The letters are visible now.
- Just read them.

653
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,490
- Garlic.
- No, don't read it.

654
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,650
(Garlic!)

655
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,760
Correct.

656
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,770
(Jun Ho got the correct answer.)

657
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,800
(Jun Ho from Town A wins.)

658
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,630
- Gosh, Jun Hyun.
- Gosh, seriously.

659
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,070
Gosh.

660
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,160
Great job!

661
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,900
"You should pour water on me too,
so we can make it fair."

662
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
(They manipulated the game results
to make the viewers laugh.)

663
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,580
- That was funny.
- "So we can make it fair."

664
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,610
- Good job.
- Jun Hyun, that's a shame.

665
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,610
I'm sorry I couldn't do better.

666
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,080
- You did great.
- He won.

667
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,580
- Good job, Jun Hyun.
- Now...

668
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,970
- Shoes.
- Wig.

669
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,020
As for the results of
the preliminary mission...

670
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,880
Each of the winners will receive
two dollars.

671
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,150
- The losers will get one dollar.
- Yes.

672
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,330
As Town A has more winners,
you will get an extra 50 cents.

673
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,560
(The members of Town A receive
an extra 50 cents each.)

674
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,490
- It's time for the first mission.
- Yes.

675
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,220
Before we begin the first mission,

676
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,600
Chief Kook has to choose the team
he wants to be on.

677
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,460
The members of Town B seemed to be
no match for their opponents.

678
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,960
- Jong Kook, please.
- Jong Kook.

679
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,110
You never know.

680
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,280
Jong Kook could play a critical role
to win in every mission.

681
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,740
- Really?
- We'll need him on our team.

682
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,050
- We need to recruit him.
- Okay.

683
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,520
Chief Kook, you can choose
any town...

684
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,210
after negotiating with
the delegates.

685
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,980
The delegates will persuade him
with words.

686
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,920
You can collect money from everyone,
and offer him a reward.

687
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,760
For example, you can offer
1 dollar or 1.2 dollars.

688
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,760
I'll expect a reasonable amount.

689
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,490
The delegate must pay
half of the agreed amount.

690
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,600
- What?
- The delegate must pay...

691
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,490
- half of the agreed amount.
- Okay.

692
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,110
You can collect the remaining amount
from your team members.

693
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,230
- You understand the rule, right?
- As you all know,

694
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,630
- I'm not a greedy person.
- Yes.

695
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,550
I'm a reasonable person.

696
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:40,050
The delegates
for the first negotiation are...

697
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,740
- Yuri and Hyoyeon.
- Oh, I see.

698
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,980
Only the two of them have
the authority to make the decision.

699
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,980
- I see.
- I see.

700
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,060
- You may start persuading him.
- How much money...

701
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,360
- Which of them won?
- Right now?

702
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,090
Just give him
all the money you have.

703
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,860
Hyoyeon, how much money do you have?
Did you win or lose?

704
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,890
I have 2 dollars and 50 cents.

705
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,360
- You have more than she does.
- Yes.

706
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,160
Since she has only one dollar,

707
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,960
- I'll offer more money.
- offer him 1 dollar and 20 cents.

708
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,660
We'll pay half of the amount
you decided.

709
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,870
Do you always talk loud enough
for the other team to hear you?

710
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,730
This is us whispering.
We do this on variety shows.

711
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,470
- This is our first time.
- I can't hear you guys.

712
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,310
- Jong Kook can't hear us at all.
- I can't hear you.

713
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,050
Yuri will have to pay half,
but she has only one dollar.

714
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,410
- I have only one dollar.
- True.

715
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,910
Yuri, give him all you have.
It doesn't matter.

716
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,710
(What should I do?)

717
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:20,360
Tell me the amount you can offer me.
I'll decide based on that.

718
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,860
- We'll give you all we have.
- Okay.

719
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,360
- But we don't have...
- You all have one dollar.

720
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,860
- We have seven dollars in total.
- We don't have much money.

721
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,060
- So we...
- You can't give me all you have.

722
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,370
Take just two dollars.

723
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,270
- Jae Suk, don't say anything.
- Take just two dollars.

724
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,460
(Annoyed)

725
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,270
- My gosh.
- Jae Suk.

726
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,270
- Why?
- Can't you be more desperate?

727
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,700
- Be desperate.
- What's wrong with you?

728
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,810
- Well, this is...
- You don't sound like you care.

729
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,880
I'm sorry.

730
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,940
- I mean...
- Jong Kook.

731
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,610
- Jong Kook, I live in Anyang.
- Yes?

732
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,640
You live in Anyang?

733
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,320
- You don't live in Anyang.
- She lives in Anyang?

734
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,320
I moved to Anyang recently.

735
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,320
- Your parents will be upset.
- Don't lie to me.

736
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,360
- I'm not lying.
- He likes people living in Anyang.

737
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,950
- Our team member lives in Anyang.
- Do you really live in Anyang?

738
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,450
- Jong Kook.
- She's lying.

739
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,760
Your girlfriend is on our team.

740
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,150
(I'm on this team.)

741
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:05,890
Hey, don't make that face.
Just don't do anything.

742
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,300
Stay seated.

743
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,400
- Come on. Stop it.
- Oh

744
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,510
- She'll be disappointed.
- Stay seated.

745
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,880
She'll be upset
if you don't join us.

746
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,580
He must feel uncomfortable being
on the same team as his girlfriend.

747
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,350
- Right. It must be uncomfortable.
- He won't join that team.

748
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,970
- Then let me...
- We'll offer you...

749
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,710
You can write your final offers down
on the board.

750
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,880
- Write it down on the board.
- I see.

751
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,350
- I have more money than she does.
- Write down your offering amount.

752
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,590
Yuri, she has more money...
Never mind. It's up to you.

753
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,980
Can you tell me
how much money each of you has?

754
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,450
Jae Suk and So Min have 2 dollars.
I have 1 dollar.

755
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,130
And Jun Hyun has one dollar.

756
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,150
- I'll lose too much.
- I know.

757
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,360
- It's a lot.
- He has two dollars.

758
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,570
It might be better
if I didn't join your team.

759
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,600
- Why?
- No. Please join our team.

760
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,690
She only has one dollar.
She'll suffer too much damage.

761
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,730
- Even so...
- We can get more money.

762
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,270
- I'm betting on you.
- Okay.

763
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,170
- That's so cool.
- I'm offering all my money.

764
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,970
- Right. I know.
- That was a great comment.

765
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,510
I'll consider all the aspects...

766
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,140
- I'll see how sincere you are.
- I'm sure he won't turn me down.

767
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,140
- I'll give it serious thought.
- Okay. I wrote it down.

768
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,020
Jong Kook,
just pick the team already.

769
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,450
- What's your problem? Don't...
- My gosh.

770
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,060
(What's your problem?)

771
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,220
- Don't make him want to join them.
- It won't work because of him.

772
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,980
- Jong Kook.
- It won't work because of him.

773
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,490
- Don't worry about him.
- What?

774
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,990
- Gosh, seriously.
- All right.

775
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,960
- You're not helping.
- I just told him to hurry up.

776
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,770
I think he'll join us
if we just offer two dollars.

777
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,540
- Jae Suk is getting in their way.
- Gosh, you.

778
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,960
- I mean, that man...
- Please reveal the amount.

779
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,970
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

780
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,130
- Hey!
- Suk Jin and Ji Hyo.

781
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,970
- We agreed to pitch in.
- My gosh.

782
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,080
- She asked which of us lost. Why...
- I asked...

783
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,520
As for the first mission...

784
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,240
The amount of reward matters too,

785
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,590
- but that man was...
- Right. I knew it.

786
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,590
I really want to
take the money from him.

787
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,360
- Good.
- Then you should join our team.

788
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,060
- I knew he would join us.
- I've decided to join them.

789
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,150
- Okay!
- Oh, yes!

790
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,720
(Shocked)

791
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,360
- I don't understand.
- That man...

792
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,130
If you want to
go out with Jong Kook,

793
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,230
you should do what I did.

794
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,230
(You should do what I did.)

795
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,870
Do you understand?
You should never cater to him.

796
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,370
- You should play hard to get.
- Never cater to him.

797
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,610
- You should play hard to get.
- That man...

798
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,610
- He really provoked me.
- Right.

799
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,970
- I should join his team.
- Impressive.

800
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,140
- You saw that, right?
- A bad man.

801
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,970
Jong Kook will receive one dollar
from each of Yuri and Jae Suk.

802
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,710
- Okay.
- Okay.

803
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,850
We'll move to another place
after you get changed.

804
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,320
- Let's go.
- Gosh.

805
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,590
(At the place for the 1st mission,
judo mats are on the floor.)

806
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,060
It's judo.

807
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,560
- Are we playing judo?
- Will we really play judo?

808
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
What do I do?

809
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,600
It'll be fun.

810
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,720
- This is great.
- They placed judo mats here.

811
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,130
We'll definitely need Jong Kook
for this game.

812
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,070
- Okay.
- That's not true.

813
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,370
- A judo athlete is on your team.
- Gosh. What a shame.

814
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,810
- Look at these judo uniforms.
- Right.

815
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,130
- Hey, Jun Ho.
- We're doomed.

816
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,430
- We're in trouble.
- Judo?

817
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:32,050
I wouldn't be that important.
Each team has a judo athlete.

818
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,320
Jun Ho, you should
fight with Jong Kook.

819
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,710
- I think I'll lose to him.
- Hey...

820
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,740
What was your brother's name?

821
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,520
- My brother? Jun Hyun.
- Jun...

822
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,210
- Jun Hyun? Okay...
- Yes.

823
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,680
- If we win two points...
- Exactly.

824
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,560
- Then we can win.
- The sun and the moon...

825
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,650
- You all look so weak.
- Why?

826
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,220
I can beat you,
if not everyone else.

827
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,460
You all look so weak.

828
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,330
- Are we playing judo?
- You're so weak.

829
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,460
- I'm stronger than you.
- No one dares to go to the center.

830
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,370
- I can beat Jae Suk easily.
- They're talking from afar.

831
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,270
- You look so weak.
- Hey, long-headed locust.

832
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,610
- You look so weak.
- Long-headed locust?

833
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,670
- Right.
- Hey, long-headed locust.

834
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,780
I weigh 10kg more than you.

835
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,050
You look so weak.

836
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,140
- There she goes. She stepped up.
- Look at her.

837
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,970
- You want to fight with me?
- She stepped up.

838
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:12,140
(Suk Jin finally moved forward
as the weakest player came out.)

839
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,980
(Making a fuss)

840
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,360
(Kicking and shouting)

841
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,650
You kicked my anus.

842
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,600
- How dare you?
- He kicked the anus?

843
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,330
It went right in.

844
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,630
- Okay.
- All right.

845
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,070
- Please gather in the middle.
- Let's gather around.

846
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,270
In the middle.

847
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,870
- Oh, I see.
- Let's stand in the middle.

848
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,960
Come here.

849
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,770
- Okay.
- Everyone.

850
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,080
In this mission,

851
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,470
you will have a chance
to teach your enemy a lesson.

852
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,350
(The 1st mission is
Judo with No Mercy, No Friendship.)

853
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,240
It's
Judo with No Mercy, No Friendship.

854
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,710
- Okay.
- Judo.

855
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,880
- Judo?
- Judo.

856
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,680
- "No friendship?"
- Then would you say, "Okay?"

857
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,150
- Right?
- He's ridiculous.

858
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,860
I learned judo before. I learned
forward rolling and back fall.

859
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,860
- Se Chan knows how to do it.
- Oh, my.

860
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,860
You will have a match
against your enemies.

861
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,150
It'll be a 1-on-1 match
between the enemies.

862
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,490
- Within two minutes,
- Yes.

863
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,630
you have to get more points
than your opponent does.

864
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,960
- How?
- Here's how to get points.

865
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,460
You get one point for each sock
you take off of your opponent.

866
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,610
- What's that?
- Socks?

867
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,960
You get two points if you tear off
your opponent's name tag.

868
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,960
(1 point for a sock, 2 points for
a name tag, 4 points for the top)

869
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,430
You get four points
if you take off the judo top.

870
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,510
- The top?
- My gosh.

871
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,780
- Take off the top?
- I think...

872
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,780
- I mean, the judo uniform.
- the twins are at an advantage.

873
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,520
Give us more points
if we take off more clothes.

874
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,120
- Let us give it a try.
- I can...

875
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,140
- I don't mind showing my underwear.
- I can take off his underwear.

876
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,590
- Let us do that.
- How many points can we get for it?

877
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,620
Just the shirt will do.

878
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,760
Will you give me a point
if I take my own clothes off?

879
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,980
- I'd take my pants off by myself.
- Come on.

880
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,330
- That'd be so weird.
- I will...

881
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,720
Deduct a point if everyone is
disappointed when we take it off.

882
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,070
- Deduct a point?
- I'll just...

883
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,600
I'm not worried
if you'll be disappointed.

884
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,960
- You lose a point.
- I'm confident.

885
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,600
I guess
I'll get the highest score today.

886
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,370
I wouldn't be embarrassed.

887
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,580
- I don't want to imagine that.
- That'd be so funny.

888
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,880
- Don't imagine that.
- It's horrible.

889
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,470
- Chief Kook, you can choose...
- Yes.

890
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,940
- anyone you want to fight with.
- Okay.

891
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,940
- Great.
- That's good.

892
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,410
- Pick Jun Ho.
- Okay.

893
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,120
- Choose the weakest one.
- You can choose anyone.

894
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,050
- I might fight with Trainer Kook.
- Yes.

895
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,360
- Of course.
- Trainer Kook.

896
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,360
- Please put on the uniform.
- Okay.

897
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,880
- Jong Kook will knock you up.
- This is great.

898
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,360
- It's going to be intense.
- Gosh, seriously.

899
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,570
This brings me back the memories of
the shoulder throw.

900
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,570
You're talking about...

901
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,960
getting robbed, right?

902
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,660
Well, I admit that it happened.

903
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,460
I haven't worn these in a while.

904
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,730
Stop lying.
You have never worn them before.

905
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,730
(They're talking big
as they're wearing judo uniforms.)

906
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,810
It's been a while
since I last practiced.

907
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,110
Honestly, I missed this scent.

908
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
The scent of a judo uniform.

909
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,170
I remember that my uniform was
soaked in sweat on my way home.

910
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,240
- I miss those days.
- I really miss those days.

911
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
You?

912
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,260
You're such a loser.

913
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,130
- Hey. Yuri.
- You're such a loser.

914
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,090
Who would like to go first?

915
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,920
Maybe Chief Kook?

916
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,690
- That wouldn't be fair.
- Let me see...

917
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,490
- the weaklings go first.
- It wouldn't be fair.

918
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,600
Shouldn't we see
the representatives first?

919
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,660
I'll see how the others are first.

920
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,230
Those who are familiar with
the smell of sweat.

921
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,160
- How about it?
- Sure.

922
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,400
It's been a while,
so take a trip down memory lane.

923
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,780
Just like I used to,

924
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,970
let me breathe in
the scent of the dojo.

925
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,170
(The memory
of being robbed of money)

926
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,610
Back when...

927
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,470
the National Sports Festival
took place...

928
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,910
- I mean...
- He's no competition.

929
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,680
I threw a lot of guys like him.

930
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,520
- He's no competition.
- Get over here.

931
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,680
Look at him move as I pull.

932
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,530
(He says that
while being shaken as well.)

933
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,630
Shall we begin?

934
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,300
- Should we begin right away?
- Right now?

935
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,530
Look at you pulling him
at your will.

936
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,530
Go for it!

937
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,690
Nice!

938
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,040
(The keyboard warriors
carry distorted memories.)

939
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,870
Check him out from behind.

940
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,900
- Well...
- You seem like an expert.

941
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,230
Doesn't he look like...

942
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,700
the dojo's first chairman?

943
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,940
- The dojo's...
- The master of Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

944
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,170
- Okay!
- That's right.

945
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,820
- He founded this dojo.
- The famous martial artist.

946
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,880
Nice. That's what he's famous for.

947
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,090
- You will only get two minutes.
- Two minutes?

948
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,680
Two minutes
is longer than you think.

949
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,560
- Two minutes...
- I won't need that much.

950
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,330
I'll only need 30 seconds.

951
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,650
(He claims that he can
drop Jae Suk in 30 seconds.)

952
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,630
- Please don't cry afterwards.
- I bet he will.

953
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,390
- No crying.
- No peeing.

954
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,030
And no telling your mom.

955
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,660
Get ready.

956
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,100
(Round 1: Suk Jin vs Jae Suk)

957
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,270
- Close the distance.
- Go for it.

958
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,470
- Grab him. There isn't much time.
- Use the techniques.

959
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,200
No, just grab him.

960
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,700
(After sensing each other out,
they grab the collars.)

961
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,470
(Take that!)

962
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,440
(Seok Sam drops
to an outer reaping throw.)

963
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,880
Nicely done.

964
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,410
- Good.
- Suk Jin!

965
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
Go, Jae Suk.

966
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,590
(Forget 30 seconds,
he can't hold out for 5.)

967
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,590
(Giggling)

968
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,300
- My gosh.
- That's it.

969
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,420
- The sock.
- Press down.

970
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,160
All right.

971
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,460
(Jae Suk goes for the sock.)

972
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,530
Look at him playing defense.

973
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,160
(Suk Jin's close
to losing a point.)

974
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,630
He almost took off the sock.

975
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,700
(They are both after
each other's socks.)

976
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,700
- No!
- What are you doing?

977
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,470
(Seok Sam wins the first point.)

978
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,640
(Seok Sam managed
to take off the sock first.)

979
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
(Town A Ji Suk Jin 1,
Town B Yoo Jae Suk 0)

980
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,740
- What are you playing at?
- It won't come off.

981
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,050
(Suk Jin manages to take both off.)

982
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,860
Okay with the socks.

983
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,450
Now, go for his name tag.

984
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,860
- Look at how pale his feet are.
- What now?

985
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,860
- Go for his jacket.
- Right, I'll take his jacket off.

986
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,190
- Yes, his jacket.
- He's going for it.

987
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,490
Take his jacket off.

988
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,100
- Hold your ground.
- Rip his name tag off.

989
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,770
Suk Jin, subdue him.

990
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,510
(Jae Suk manages
to take one sock off too.)

991
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,900
Why do they both have
such pale feet?

992
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,040
They are as pale as they can get.

993
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,400
- They're very clean too.
- No, more like pale.

994
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,050
- Pale?
- You're tied right now.

995
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,240
(The facial massage begins.)

996
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,090
What on earth?

997
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,290
(Jae Suk presents Seok Sam
with a familiar smell.)

998
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,450
Once again, he's being victimized.

999
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,150
- He was off to a good start though.
- Where is his name tag?

1000
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,830
(Chuckling)

1001
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,030
My gosh.

1002
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,700
Isn't the smell
a blast from the past?

1003
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,490
Doesn't this bring back memories?

1004
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,160
How can this be
when you're 10kg heavier?

1005
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,200
(Groaning)

1006
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,010
He's drawing up
every last bit of energy.

1007
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,510
(However, he soon flames out.)

1008
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,840
- You...
- It's over.

1009
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,570
Oh, no. No!

1010
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,880
- He did it.
- It's over.

1011
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,010
- He got the name tag.
- It's off.

1012
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,640
Okay, he has it.

1013
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,550
- Nice!
- Yes!

1014
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,280
(Town A Ji Suk Jin 2,
Town B Yoo Jae Suk 4)

1015
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,760
- He won.
- What a blast from the past.

1016
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,680
Just like old times.

1017
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,160
- I...
- All right.

1018
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,760
- Our feeble brother.
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

1019
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,430
- Drag him out.
- Suk Jin!

1020
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,570
It's you against me next,
so get ready.

1021
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,510
- Get ready.
- What?

1022
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,010
- Drink some water.
- Step out.

1023
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,910
- Should we call an ambulance?
- Jae Suk wins with four points.

1024
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,700
Get out there and have some water.

1025
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,640
(Seok Sam is pulled
out of the danger zone.)

1026
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,950
- Goodness.
- It just got hot in here.

1027
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,220
This requires a lot of stamina.

1028
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,660
Jae Suk looks sexy right now.

1029
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,820
That was exhausting.

1030
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,860
Give me another chance!

1031
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,990
(The nostalgic battle
ended with Jae Suk winning.)

1032
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,890
Who would like to go next?

1033
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,260
The brothers are at war.

1034
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,320
The twins are up.

1035
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,200
Cho Jun Ho versus Cho Jun Hyun,

1036
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,240
I can't wait.

1037
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,140
Warm up to prevent any injuries.

1038
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,260
(The battle of the masters)

1039
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,140
Don't forget
to break your fall, okay?

1040
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,780
Holding out
will only lead to injuries.

1041
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,140
- He wants us to rig the game.
- Gosh, no.

1042
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,320
- It's a warning, that's all.
- This we must watch.

1043
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,610
They specialize in judo,

1044
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,140
- so this is a real game.
- I need to watch this.

1045
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,780
Let me show you
how to manage a game.

1046
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,530
(Let us tell you about Cho Jun Ho.)

1047
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,490
(At the World Championships...)

1048
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,300
(and at the London Olympics,
he won the bronze medal.)

1049
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,260
(Not only did he
take the world by storm,)

1050
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,990
(but in a match
against his own brother...)

1051
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,380
(He claimed victory over his brother
with a shoulder throw.)

1052
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,640
(Age matters, doesn't it?)

1053
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,410
(The 8-minute younger brother
is tough competition though.)

1054
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,280
(His tenacity
and competitiveness...)

1055
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,510
(led to many memorable games.)

1056
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,180
- I can't wait.
- Who was better...

1057
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,660
as judo athletes back in the day?

1058
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,700
I was better back then,

1059
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,490
but that changed after we retired.

1060
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:39,260
He hasn't been able
to take a game off me.

1061
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,260
- Really?
- Is that so?

1062
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,300
For real?

1063
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,340
Are you ready?

1064
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,010
You don't look cool at all.

1065
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,030
- I'm amazed.
- Get ready.

1066
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,340
- This is for real.
- Go, Jun Hyun!

1067
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,910
- This one is for real.
- A battle between brothers.

1068
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,110
This sounds like fun.

1069
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,200
Go, Jun Hyun!

1070
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,070
He didn't even say "go."

1071
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,680
The older brother bowed first.

1072
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,510
- Jun Hyun didn't bow.
- This is for real.

1073
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,420
(The brothers collide.)

1074
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,840
- Okay.
- This is for real.

1075
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,190
- This is a game of judo.
- I can't believe it.

1076
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,260
- My gosh.
- A game of judo.

1077
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,730
- Tensions run high.
- My gosh.

1078
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,050
Go for the name tag!

1079
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,590
(The twins aren't holding back.)

1080
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,400
- Tensions are running high.
- This is real for them.

1081
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,800
(Jun Ho lands a scooping throw.)

1082
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,990
Are we watching ssireum?

1083
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,460
(Jun Ho throws his brother
to the ground.)

1084
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,670
- Jun Hyun!
- Jun Hyun!

1085
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,110
(Jun Ho throws his brother
to the ground.)

1086
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
Guys!

1087
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,070
- Jun Hyun!
- Jun Hyun!

1088
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,780
- Oh, no.
- No.

1089
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,170
I can't believe this.

1090
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,650
His name tag.

1091
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,980
Oh, no.

1092
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,150
- His name tag.
- Oh, no.

1093
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,110
- Look.
- Seriously?

1094
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,710
(The older brother
goes after the name tag.)

1095
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,920
You can't let him grab behind you.

1096
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,820
(The name tag came off!)

1097
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,030
- Seriously?
- You can't let him grab behind you.

1098
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,820
(The brother from the Town A
scores 3 points in a flash.)

1099
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,820
- Seriously?
- No way!

1100
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:46,990
Can you believe it?

1101
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,900
- The name tag came off.
- Take off his jacket, then.

1102
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,030
(Town A Cho Jun Ho 3,
Town B Cho Jun Hyun 0)

1103
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,400
- Shouldn't you stand?
- The name tag came off.

1104
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,570
Rip off his clothes!

1105
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,440
- Take off his pants.
- He took your name tag off.

1106
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,300
- Oh, no.
- He took your name tag off.

1107
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,740
- Oh, no?
- If I take off his pants,

1108
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,840
please award me four points.

1109
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,510
Not the pants, you jerk.

1110
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,320
You're wearing something underneath.

1111
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,280
It's easier to take off his pants.

1112
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,650
No, not the pants.

1113
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,190
Jun Hyun's like, "No, don't."

1114
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,990
- "No, don't."
- He's pleading.

1115
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,190
- Take off his jacket.
- The twins are hilarious.

1116
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,760
Aren't they funny?

1117
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,150
Seriously?

1118
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,550
This is exhausting, you know.

1119
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,400
(He attempts a second
scooping throw.)

1120
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,570
No way.

1121
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,170
This sure is entertaining.

1122
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,940
(The older brother
scores another full point.)

1123
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,400
A full point!

1124
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,630
- What on earth?
- Look!

1125
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,800
(Jun Hyun is now being
dragged around.)

1126
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
Are you kidding me?

1127
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,610
(Jun Hyun is now being
dragged around.)

1128
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,340
Stop picking on your little brother!

1129
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,110
Go after his name tag.

1130
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,090
- Let go of me.
- Age does matter, right?

1131
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,110
- This isn't easy.
- Hold on a second.

1132
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,280
- He's dragging you around.
- You're owning him.

1133
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,490
Jun Hyun!

1134
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,690
- He's weaker than I thought.
- It's an arm bar.

1135
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,170
- Arm bar!
- Arm bar!

1136
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:58,090
(Jun Ho tries to hold him down
with an arm bar.)

1137
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,570
- Yes!
- Seriously?

1138
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,630
(Jun Hyun won't lose points,
just his pride.)

1139
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,840
You have 30 seconds left.

1140
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,380
Jun Hyun, are you kidding me?

1141
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,940
All that's left is his jacket.

1142
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,210
(All that's left is his jacket.)

1143
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,050
(It's becoming more
like a dog fight.)

1144
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,340
- They're not kidding around.
- Look at them.

1145
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,010
- He got the pants.
- The pants.

1146
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,320
- The pants are coming off.
- I'm amazed.

1147
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,630
The pants aren't worth any points!

1148
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,550
- Reward me for the pants!
- The socks.

1149
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,820
Get the socks.

1150
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,260
- The pants are off.
- You have 15 seconds left.

1151
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,530
Only 15 seconds.

1152
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,090
- Go after the socks.
- Seriously, Jun Hyun?

1153
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,340
Jun Hyun, are you kidding us?

1154
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,740
- I mean...
- Look.

1155
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,030
- I took off his pants.
- Give him points for that.

1156
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,110
- Please!
- Give him some points.

1157
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,780
- That wasn't the rule.
- Give him points for that.

1158
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,980
- Did you get my name tag?
- Yes.

1159
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,050
- That was incredible.
- Jun Hyun!

1160
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,320
I'm sorry.

1161
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,550
I thought that we were tied.

1162
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,110
You should've gotten his name tag.

1163
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,320
That was incredible.

1164
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,280
Give him a big hug, will you?

1165
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,320
- A big hug?
- That'd be cool.

1166
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,630
(The two brothers battled it out
with love and respect.)

1167
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,960
- A big hug.
- Yes, reconcile.

1168
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,590
(Joke's on you!)

1169
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,630
(He messes with
his younger brother.)

1170
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,940
Gosh, Jun Hyun.

1171
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,710
- Seriously?
- I knew it!

1172
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,300
Shouldn't he receive
a penalty for that?

1173
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,510
- Nice!
- Of course he fell for it.

1174
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,070
We all thought
we'd see two brothers hug.

1175
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,650
- Exactly.
- That's what everyone thought.

1176
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,170
Jun Ho, you...

1177
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,280
What? Come at him
if you have a problem.

1178
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,150
- What?
- Take him on if you can.

1179
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,420
- Take him on.
- Just because you lost...

1180
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,210
Would you like to breathe in
the smell of sweat again?

1181
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,360
Bring it on.
I'll take on the little brother.

1182
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,780
(Whimpering)

1183
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,650
- No way.
- Who's going next?

1184
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,260
This time,

1185
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,360
- So Min's playing.
- It's time for a woman to play.

1186
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,630
Cho Jun Ho's playing one more time.

1187
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,630
The rival.

1188
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,630
Ji Hyo. You should go.

1189
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,960
Right. Ji Hyo. You should go.

1190
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,900
Ji Hyo is really strong.

1191
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,740
Ji Hyo looks like a pro.

1192
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,840
- Right?
- Yes.

1193
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,820
You're so good-looking.

1194
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,670
So Min.

1195
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,880
Don't try to do anything.

1196
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,320
She...

1197
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,280
- What is she doing?
- She's immersed.

1198
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,650
- She's too into it.
- Why is she doing that?

1199
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,050
Stop...

1200
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,400
- I'm sorry.
- giving her excuses.

1201
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,050
- What's she doing?
- Just do it.

1202
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,630
Just do it.

1203
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:13,260
(Martial Arts Frog gained
confidence from her master.)

1204
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,710
That's hilarious.

1205
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,070
- Are you going to be okay?
- She looks perfect.

1206
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,780
Go, Neunggok!

1207
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,710
- Good luck.
- Go, Mapo!

1208
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,280
- Mapo.
- Go, Mapo.

1209
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,650
Mapo-gu.

1210
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,740
(The game begins.)

1211
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,420
Mapo.

1212
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,340
- Boombastic!
- Boombastic!

1213
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,280
(Jumping)

1214
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,990
Catch her.

1215
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,190
(Hitting)

1216
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,730
(Frog got smacked
for fooling around.)

1217
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,550
Hit her, So Min.

1218
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,630
Fool around even more.

1219
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,760
That's good.

1220
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,360
(Ji Hyo grabs her by the collar
to begin the real game.)

1221
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,800
(Ji Hyo grabs her by the collar
to begin the real game.)

1222
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,010
Take it slow.

1223
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,880
- She's down already.
- So Min. Go for her sock.

1224
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,610
It's not about strength.

1225
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,480
- Rip the name tag off.
- It's about the skills.

1226
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,820
(Martial Arts Frog got her name tag
ripped as soon as the game started.)

1227
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,740
- What was that?
- She's a monster.

1228
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,050
It's about the skills. Gosh!

1229
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,280
Oh, I shouldn't be impressed.

1230
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,550
(The race goes exactly
as everyone expected.)

1231
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:10,150
So Min will get dragged around.

1232
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,300
That's right.

1233
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,170
- She's super strong.
- You need to take her down first.

1234
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,490
(Another point)

1235
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,360
- So Min has no chance.
- Wait.

1236
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,260
Judo was so easy for her.

1237
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,570
- That's right.
- What is she doing?

1238
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,260
- Judo was so easy.
- Hey.

1239
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,610
We should have Se Chan...

1240
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,670
- play against a woman.
- That's great.

1241
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,610
- Take her top off.
- She's really good.

1242
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:29,900
- She's really strong.
- That's incredible.

1243
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,510
What on earth is she doing?

1244
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,420
Ji Hyo is as strong as a man.

1245
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,490
(Ragged)

1246
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,340
- Take it off.
- She's given up.

1247
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,650
- "Take it off."
- Take it off.

1248
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,260
What a tough man.

1249
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,760
Throw her.

1250
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,420
So Min. You're doing great.

1251
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,630
- Trip her.
- Wait.

1252
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,170
(Wait.)

1253
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:50,760
Wait. I'll take it off.

1254
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,840
(I'll take it off.)

1255
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,840
(So Min says she'll take off.)

1256
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,710
- Ji Hyo. I will take it off.
- Don't!

1257
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,070
Hey.

1258
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,110
- Ji Hyo. I will take it off.
- Don't!

1259
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,070
(She takes it off in a cheesy way.)

1260
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:04,070
- Hey! You can't just take it off.
- So Min.

1261
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,880
Stop it!

1262
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,090
- Hey.
- Hey.

1263
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,740
- Stop it.
- Cover her.

1264
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,280
Stop it already.

1265
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,880
You gave away all the points
you could.

1266
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,730
I'm sorry.

1267
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,050
Why would you take it off
on your own?

1268
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,300
Good job.

1269
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,360
She was good.

1270
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,960
"I'll take it off."

1271
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,130
- I couldn't throw her.
- No?

1272
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,990
- She was too fast.
- Well done.

1273
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:29,510
Next is Yuri versus Hyoyeon.

1274
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,130
- Yuri.
- Good luck.

1275
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,510
- Good luck.
- I'll do my best.

1276
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:33,940
- You can do it.
- Nice.

1277
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,650
(Hyoyeon from Town A
versus Yuri from Town B)

1278
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:36,880
I'm scared.

1279
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,070
I'm not sure about this.

1280
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,320
(Why is Yuri afraid?)

1281
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:44,110
(Hyoyeon is known for her strength
among Girls' Generation members.)

1282
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,860
(Even though they had
many matches before,)

1283
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,760
(she could never win
against Hyoyeon.)

1284
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,260
Hyoyeon. Show us what you got.

1285
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,460
Show us.

1286
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,030
Get ready.

1287
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,190
(Determined)

1288
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,170
- You're nothing against Hyoyeon.
- Go.

1289
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,300
- I have a feeling Yuri will win.
- What are you doing?

1290
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,510
- Get close to her.
- Yuri is strong too.

1291
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,400
- Hurry up.
- They're the same size.

1292
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,510
Hyoyeon. Get closer to her.

1293
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,670
Get closer?

1294
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,480
- How do you do that?
- She lost a lot of weight.

1295
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,050
- Hyoyeon...
- What are you doing?

1296
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,670
(Hyoyeon uses her technique first.)

1297
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,210
- Good.
- Hey.

1298
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,170
Go for the socks.

1299
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:15,740
- Good.
- Hey.

1300
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,320
- Go for the socks.
- She's down.

1301
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:22,360
- Good job.
- Go for the socks.

1302
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,280
- Good.
- Good job.

1303
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,630
You're doing great.

1304
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,130
- Good job.
- This is intense.

1305
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,130
She is not a toy.

1306
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,570
- Yuri. The name tag.
- No, Hyoyeon!

1307
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,440
That's right. Good job.

1308
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,300
That's right. Good job.

1309
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,610
(Yuri tries to make Hyoyeon faint
with mysterious shouting.)

1310
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,240
- Good job.
- That was good.

1311
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,340
Yuri is strong.

1312
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,840
Yuri. Watch out.
Her hand is approaching.

1313
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,210
(Hyoyeon was able to put her hand
on Yuri's back!)

1314
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,670
No!

1315
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:47,480
No!

1316
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,320
The sock.

1317
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,050
The sock. Take her sock off.

1318
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:52,050
(Hyoyeon is aiming for
Yuri's socks!)

1319
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,590
Good.

1320
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:54,960
Her left sock. That's right.

1321
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,650
Her left sock. That's right.

1322
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,860
- Yuri. Good job.
- You still got more points.

1323
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,490
(She tries to escape by
folding her body in half.)

1324
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,860
You're flexible.

1325
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:05,630
You got out.

1326
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:07,400
Yuri is stuck.

1327
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,460
You're doing great, Hyoyeon.

1328
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,460
(Ripping)

1329
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,710
Okay!

1330
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:12,630
You're doing great, Hyoyeon.

1331
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,110
(Yuri ripped her name tag off!)

1332
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,400
The sock.

1333
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,920
(Yuri gained 2 points first.)

1334
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,510
- Yuri. Enjoy it.
- The sock.

1335
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,150
Hey. Take that off.

1336
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,650
If you take her two socks off,
we win.

1337
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,760
You're doing good, Yuri. Okay.

1338
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,920
- Good job.
- Okay.

1339
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,380
- Let's go.
- You did it.

1340
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,650
- Don't leave yet.
- Okay!

1341
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:31,650
Okay.

1342
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:32,990
- Yuri is stronger than I thought.
- You did it.

1343
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,260
Six points.

1344
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,460
- Okay.
- Wasn't that tough?

1345
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,960
I'm worn out.

1346
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,090
Hyoyeon.

1347
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,990
- Good job, Yuri.
- We still have Se Chan.

1348
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,300
- Look at her eyes.
- I've been working out.

1349
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,260
Well done.

1350
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,670
- Good job, Yuri.
- Aren't you tired?

1351
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,170
You did great.

1352
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:47,510
- You're so strong.
- Yuri.

1353
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:53,670
(He looks as if
he has some stories.)

1354
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:54,740
Yuri.

1355
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,690
- Look at their faces.
- Okay.

1356
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:58,820
(Two children think they're big
when they're in uniform.)

1357
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,190
- Okay.
- Okay.

1358
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,550
I could never beat her.

1359
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,650
(Two children think they're big
when they're in uniform.)

1360
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,550
That bald guy.

1361
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,150
He has some stories.

1362
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,760
- They always have a good start.
- Se Chan.

1363
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,190
Exhaust him.

1364
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:11,190
Se Chan. End it.

1365
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,570
- Haha. You're strong.
- Look at his eyes.

1366
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,010
You know Haha is weak.

1367
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:17,030
- Look at his eyes. They're scary.
- Look at his face.

1368
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:19,740
- Haha. You look like a pro.
- Haha. You're strong!

1369
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,800
- End it.
- You're strong.

1370
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,070
What's wrong with them?

1371
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,780
Since it's hard to take the top off,
we'll give three points for pants.

1372
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:26,820
Get ready.

1373
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:31,650
- I got it.
- Go, Se Chan.

1374
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,210
Good.

1375
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,690
They're serious.

1376
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:37,380
I got you.

1377
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,530
If you go under,
it's disadvantageous.

1378
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:43,320
If you go under,
it's disadvantageous.

1379
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,300
If you go under,
it's disadvantageous.

1380
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:46,630
If you go under,
it's disadvantageous.

1381
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:48,300
That's right.

1382
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,570
- Go for the socks. Okay.
- Good.

1383
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:51,630
Nice.

1384
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,980
If you go under,
it's disadvantageous.

1385
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,980
- Come on.
- Watch out for your right foot.

1386
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,740
- Take it off.
- Watch out for your right foot.

1387
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,380
- My goodness.
- Show your strength.

1388
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,610
It's time for a technique.

1389
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,490
It's the arm bar.

1390
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:02,940
- The arm bar.
- Where is he going?

1391
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,510
(Haha turned Se Chan!)

1392
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:08,880
- Good.
- The arm bar.

1393
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,380
He's biting the clothes.

1394
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,320
(Biting)

1395
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,960
Isn't that a zombie?

1396
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,300
What's he doing?

1397
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,730
- What are you biting?
- He's a zombie.

1398
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:18,570
- That's a zombie.
- What's he doing?

1399
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,740
What's wrong with him?

1400
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,400
What are you biting?

1401
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,340
(He's about to rip something else
other than the name tag.)

1402
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,940
That's weird.

1403
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,050
I'm sorry, guys.

1404
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:31,920
I'm sorry.

1405
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,920
(The two are determined
to ruin each other.)

1406
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,420
Rip his name tag off.

1407
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,490
Se Chan.

1408
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:37,920
Se Chan.

1409
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,650
(Slapping)

1410
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,360
This is no time for that.
Think about the score.

1411
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:44,260
You must win the points.

1412
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,990
Se Chan.

1413
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,550
Se Chan. Take his pants off.

1414
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:48,730
(Banging with his head)

1415
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:50,960
Se Chan.

1416
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,240
Se Chan!

1417
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,630
Se Chan. This is no time for that.

1418
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:56,670
Se Chan. You shouldn't be
on your back.

1419
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,070
Yes. Get up.

1420
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,780
(The soft tofu fights back!)

1421
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,240
- Good.
- No!

1422
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,780
Okay.

1423
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:05,980
The sock.

1424
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,480
- Take his pants off.
- Take his pants off.

1425
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,340
- The sock.
- Go for the sock, Haha.

1426
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,590
You have 30 seconds left.

1427
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,710
Se Chan. In the back.

1428
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:12,990
Just get three more points.

1429
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,260
Haha's using his shaved head
as his weapon.

1430
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,130
That feels weird.

1431
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,260
Stop it.

1432
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,490
(Unexpected sandpapering)

1433
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:19,590
What's wrong with him?

1434
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,960
Stop it.

1435
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,860
(A strange feeling to
his soft tofu-like skin)

1436
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,460
- Endure it.
- It's almost over.

1437
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,170
(The game ends.)

1438
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:29,400
That was so much fun.

1439
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,630
"That was so much fun."

1440
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:34,380
Come here.

1441
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,650
That was fun.

1442
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:36,940
(Haha is satisfied after filling
his stomach with tofu.)

1443
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,070
I couldn't avoid it.

1444
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:40,170
This is bad.

1445
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,170
Okay.

1446
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:42,610
Okay.

1447
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,920
They're three points ahead.

1448
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:47,880
I'm not sure if I can coach him.

1449
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,650
(For the last game, Chief Kook
chooses the oldest member.)

1450
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:53,030
- Suk Jin is fast.
- Just don't lose any points.

1451
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,630
Suk Jin.
Pull the top out of the belt.

1452
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,570
Don't hold onto it. Take it out.

1453
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,240
- The chest...
- Good job.

1454
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:01,030
You're good at keeping balance.

1455
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,570
- You have good core strength.
- You're very swift.

1456
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,280
You're doing great.

1457
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,780
I'm not so easy, you punk.

1458
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,610
(But he quickly falls to the floor.)

1459
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:11,480
Hey.

1460
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,920
(He spoke his true feelings
out of urgency.)

1461
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,550
- He cursed.
- He just cursed.

1462
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,190
He just cursed at Jong Kook.

1463
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,010
- Why would you curse?
- We're still two points ahead.

1464
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:22,230
(Town A is still ahead by 2 points!)

1465
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:24,030
You have 35 seconds left.

1466
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,760
- How many seconds?
- Thirty five seconds.

1467
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:27,730
Grab it here.

1468
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:28,960
Suk Jin.
You just need to endure it.

1469
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,170
Endure it!

1470
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,460
No. Endure it.

1471
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:39,070
- Three, two, one.
- Endure it!

1472
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,340
We won!

1473
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,210
- We won!
- He endured it.

1474
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,010
Did he win?

1475
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,670
- He won.
- Did he win?

1476
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:48,780
Really?

1477
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,880
Town A wins.

1478
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,110
What?

1479
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,880
Did he win?

1480
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,360
I should've ripped his name tag off.

1481
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,280
That was close.

1482
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,820
You endured it well.

1483
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,900
- You're good at enduring.
- You did a good job enduring.

1484
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:01,920
(Falling)

1485
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,690
You did a good job enduring.

1486
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:06,630
(The old man doesn't have
the strength to pull his pants up.)

1487
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:11,010
- We lost, but we fought well.
- We lost, but we fought well.

1488
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,240
Suk Jin. Good job.

1489
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,480
Suk Jin.
You lost, but you still fought.

1490
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,010
I pretty much won, right?

1491
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:18,420
- You lost, but you still fought.
- You did a good job.

1492
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:22,650
Both teams will draw money.

1493
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,860
The winning team will pick
from positive amounts.

1494
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:27,820
The amounts vary from 3, 2,
1.50, 1, 0.50 and 0 dollars.

1495
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,860
Really?

1496
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:29,990
The losing team will pick from...

1497
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:33,730
1.50, 1, 0.50, 0, minus 0.50,
and minus 1.50 dollars.

1498
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:35,800
We need to pick well.

1499
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,900
- Okay.
- We need to pick well.

1500
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,900
Okay.

1501
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,900
The members of the winning team...

1502
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,530
will pick and open an envelope.

1503
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:44,570
- Okay. Let's do it.
- We do it separately.

1504
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,070
- You do it separately.
- This is incredible.

1505
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,900
Do we choose from this side? Okay.

1506
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,070
We can look, right?

1507
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:52,170
- We choose from this side.
- Yes.

1508
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:53,980
Choose among the green envelopes.

1509
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,280
(Hyoyeon, Haha, Jun Ho: 2.50 dollars
Suk Jin, Ji Hyo: 1.50 dollars)

1510
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,280
- Pick one, Hyoyeon.
- Me?

1511
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,880
- I will pick...
- Number three.

1512
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,380
- number 2.
- Number 1.

1513
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,990
The highest amount is 3 dollars
and the lowest amount is 0 dollars.

1514
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,090
Is there zero dollars?

1515
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:05,420
The envelopes
should have been facing down.

1516
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,690
- All right.
- Let's open the envelope.

1517
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,360
Haha, go ahead.

1518
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,070
- Two dollars.
- My goodness.

1519
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,400
- Okay.
- You are lucky.

1520
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,570
- That's a lot.
- Ji Hyo, how much did you get?

1521
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,760
- I got 0.50 dollars.
- Ji Hyo got 0.50 dollars.

1522
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,210
We avoided 0.50 dollars.

1523
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,740
But 0.50 dollars
isn't the worst you can do.

1524
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,570
- I got 1.50 dollars.
- Jun Ho.

1525
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:23,670
- You got 1.50 dollars.
- You got 1.50 dollars.

1526
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:25,480
I have a bad feeling about this.

1527
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,480
- Then...
- Zero dollars.

1528
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,710
- One dollar.
- One dollar.

1529
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,690
(The remaining options are
3, 1, and 0 dollars.)

1530
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,420
- Drum roll.
- Three dollars.

1531
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,280
- Zero dollars.
- Zero dollars.

1532
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,590
(Hyoyeon: 2.50 and 0 dollars)

1533
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:37,050
All right.

1534
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,230
Why did I have to pick this one?

1535
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:41,460
(The remaining options are
3 and 1 dollars.)

1536
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,530
I got...

1537
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:45,260
three dollars.

1538
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,260
Suk Jin got three dollars.

1539
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,670
Okay, Suk Jin.

1540
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,300
- Yes.
- Can I open this one?

1541
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,300
- You fought well.
- The amounts have been added.

1542
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,800
Members of the losing team
will pick now.

1543
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,480
It's our turn.

1544
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,280
- That one is mine.
- We need to pick well.

1545
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,280
I like number three.

1546
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,710
- Okay.
- As for me...

1547
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:02,210
The highest is 1.50 dollars and
the lowest is minus 1.50 dollars.

1548
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,820
- Minus?
- If your total amount is minus,

1549
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,590
it will be your debt.

1550
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,610
- I should have done better.
- Open the envelope.

1551
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:09,530
Did you say
the lowest is minus 1.50 dollars?

1552
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:11,900
(Jae Suk: 1 dollar)

1553
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,650
- Gosh.
- He got 1.50 dollars.

1554
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:15,420
- The highest amount.
- The highest amount.

1555
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,690
- He is lucky.
- Which number did he pick?

1556
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,400
- What is up with him?
- What was the envelope number?

1557
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,490
Number four.

1558
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:20,530
(Jae Suk is lucky these days.)

1559
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,130
- Minus 0.50 dollars.
- Okay. Minus 0.50 dollars.

1560
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:27,170
Minus 0.50 dollars.
I thought it was 5 dollars.

1561
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:29,170
- I bet I picked a bad one.
- I have a bad feeling about this.

1562
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:30,400
Maybe not.

1563
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,110
- Maybe not. Let's see.
- Jong Kook.

1564
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,840
(Jong Kook: 2 dollars)

1565
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,090
He got 0.50 dollars.

1566
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:36,380
I got 0.50 dollars.

1567
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,610
(Jong Kook:
2 dollars and 0.50 dollars)

1568
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:39,050
- I bet Yuri picked a bad one.
- Thank goodness.

1569
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:40,490
She got one dollar.

1570
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,730
(Yuri: 0 dollars and 1 dollar)

1571
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,360
- She picked a good one.
- One of you will get...

1572
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,590
minus 1.50 dollars.

1573
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:46,190
- Okay.
- If it's minus...

1574
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:48,460
- Thank goodness.
- So Min took what Se Chan picked.

1575
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,690
- Shall we switch envelopes?
- Yes.

1576
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:51,740
- Let's switch envelopes.
- All right.

1577
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,940
- Go ahead.
- It went to the original owner.

1578
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,190
Okay. So Min.

1579
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,400
- Shall we open them together?
- One, two, three.

1580
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:57,860
Okay.

1581
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,010
- Three.
- Okay.

1582
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,110
(So Min got minus 1.50 dollars.)

1583
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,210
I'm so lucky!

1584
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:05,480
- Boombastic.
- Why did you switch them?

1585
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,820
You shouldn't have switched them.

1586
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:07,880
All right.

1587
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,190
- I shouldn't have switched them.
- Seriously.

1588
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:11,380
The amounts have been added.

1589
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,880
Before we set off
for the second mission,

1590
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,230
Jun Ho and Jun Hyun will negotiate
the terms with Jong Kook...

1591
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,130
as town delegates.

1592
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,150
- The two of them.
- Let's go.

1593
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:21,090
Who has the most amount of money?

1594
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:22,800
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

1595
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,360
- How much do you have?
- I have 4.50 dollars.

1596
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,170
- He has a lot.
- He has a lot.

1597
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,570
- He has everything.
- He has a lot.

1598
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:28,840
If he pays half of the amount,
I will go to your town.

1599
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,460
- That's a good idea.
- Okay.

1600
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:31,570
Hold on.

1601
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:33,440
(Seok Sam suddenly lost
1.50 dollars.)

1602
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,710
I will go to this town.

1603
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,570
- Chief Kook joined Town A.
- All right.

1604
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,320
We will move to the location
of the next mission.

1605
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,690
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1606
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:43,780
This is fun.

1607
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:46,090
Okay.

1608
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,490
Here comes the birthday boy.

1609
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:50,550
It's time for the second match
between Town A and Town B.

1610
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:51,590
- Yes.
- We need to win.

1611
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:52,730
- We need to win.
- They don't stand a chance.

1612
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,550
Chief Kook is a resident of Town A.

1613
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,630
- We welcome you.
- Okay.

1614
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:58,090
Okay.

1615
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:59,190
- I will do well.
- Let's go.

1616
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,690
- We are weak.
- We need to do better.

1617
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:02,900
We need to do better.
I am not joking when I say this.

1618
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,110
- So Min and Jun Hyun,
- Jun Hyun.

1619
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:06,800
- you guys need to do better.
- Okay.

1620
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,710
You were really bad at judo.

1621
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:11,740
(You were really bad at judo.)

1622
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,570
- What was that?
- He lost big time.

1623
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:14,840
I think he went easy
on his older brother.

1624
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,340
- Don't do that.
- Don't go easy on him.

1625
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,490
You should have done
your absolute best.

1626
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:18,880
Before we reveal
the current mission,

1627
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,280
Haha will turn the board.

1628
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,380
- Okay.
- Okay.

1629
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,990
- What could it be?
- It's a quiz.

1630
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,360
No. I bet it's a poll.

1631
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,590
- A poll.
- Maybe it's...

1632
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:27,630
something like yutnori.

1633
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,130
We are good at guessing
the results of a poll.

1634
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,300
- It's yutnori.
- My goodness.

1635
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:32,490
It's a mix of quiz and yutnori.

1636
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:33,800
Good. We can do well.

1637
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:35,460
- Good.
- Quiz and yutnori.

1638
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,300
(It's obviously a quiz.)

1639
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,570
This is bad.

1640
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,800
We are set.
That team has two dumb ones.

1641
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:44,710
- Thank goodness.
- They have Hyoyeon and Ji Hyo.

1642
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,170
- Hey.
- They have three dumb ones.

1643
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,780
- Empty Head.
- Hyoyeon is smart, okay?

1644
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,510
- Dumb ones.
- Let's do this.

1645
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:53,090
I get teary-eyed...

1646
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,090
- whenever we have a quiz.
- Why?

1647
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,090
- Why?
- I become so nervous.

1648
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:58,590
I should give you guys
a private lesson.

1649
00:54:58,590 --> 00:54:59,630
Please make a class.

1650
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,990
I should do that.

1651
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:03,490
- Seriously.
- It's hard to be knowledgeable...

1652
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:04,800
because I am focused on work.

1653
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,740
Starring in variety shows
for years...

1654
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,460
makes you smart.

1655
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,460
- You end up studying during work.
- It's true.

1656
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,800
To be honest, I learned everything
through variety shows.

1657
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,570
What? Did you say
you learned things?

1658
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:16,300
Of course.
Why do you keep acting out?

1659
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:18,510
- I am not acting out.
- You know it's true.

1660
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:19,820
It's true.
Before he starred in variety shows,

1661
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,110
he couldn't write his own name.

1662
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:22,190
(Before he starred in variety shows,
he couldn't write his own name.)

1663
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:23,990
- Variety shows made him smarter.
- That's how dumb he was.

1664
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,590
- I couldn't write my own name?
- That's right.

1665
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:28,280
He is the original Empty Head.

1666
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,280
You respect me.

1667
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,590
I do, but you need to show me
what you can do...

1668
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:33,690
- like Jae Suk and Suk Jin.
- Seriously. Among Empty Heads...

1669
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:35,490
- Empty Heads.
- He is the best among them.

1670
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,190
He is the best indeed.

1671
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:39,840
Jun Ho and Jun Hyun,
how good are you with quizzes?

1672
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,360
- How good are you guys?
- Are you guys knowledgeable?

1673
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,570
Me? I think I will be fine
as long as it isn't English.

1674
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,210
- Are you okay with other subjects?
- Of course.

1675
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,630
Are you okay with other subjects?

1676
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:48,170
- Did you study other subjects?
- Yes.

1677
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,400
You know world history.

1678
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,010
- World history?
- Between the two of you,

1679
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,820
- who got better grades?
- That's right.

1680
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,780
- Who got better grades?
- I always did better.

1681
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:57,590
- What?
- I ranked 22nd in my class.

1682
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:58,650
Really?

1683
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:02,260
- People think I am a strong man,
- That's right.

1684
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,360
but I am actually a smart man.

1685
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,050
This is bad.

1686
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:06,960
I think Jun Hyun talks big.

1687
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,490
- I think he talks big.
- He always talks big.

1688
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:10,670
- I mean...
- I think he talks big.

1689
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,530
Yuri, how is Hyoyeon?

1690
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:13,570
- Hyoyeon?
- Is she knowledgeable?

1691
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,900
I stopped studying a long time ago.

1692
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,070
You are Empty Head like us.

1693
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:20,780
- That's good.
- Hyoyeon.

1694
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,110
- Empty Head.
- Brian McMorning.

1695
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,210
- Okay.
- I remember that.

1696
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:26,010
- We have Jae Suk.
- We have Jae Suk.

1697
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:27,880
- Jae Suk.
- We have Suk Jin.

1698
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,650
I can take on Jae Suk.

1699
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:31,990
- I can take on Jae Suk.
- Listen.

1700
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:33,920
- He went to Inha University.
- Hey.

1701
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,090
- He didn't go to Inha University.
- I went to Ajou University.

1702
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:37,090
- Really?
- I went to Ajou University.

1703
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:38,590
He was
a business administration major.

1704
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:39,900
- A business administration major.
- A business administration major.

1705
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,490
- Bachelor's degree.
- Did you take an exam?

1706
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:44,090
Of course I took an exam.
I didn't have a lottery, okay?

1707
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,530
That's not how
you enter a university.

1708
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:47,070
- I still can't believe...
- Okay?

1709
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,900
that you majored in
business administration...

1710
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,400
- at Ajou University.
- I didn't play rock-paper-scissors.

1711
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,300
- Was it easier to get in back then?
- It's unbelievable.

1712
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,280
Getting into Ajou University
wasn't as hard as it is now.

1713
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,280
- Really?
- Yes.

1714
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,480
- Hyun Woo takes after his dad.
- It's a prestigious school now.

1715
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,110
Hyun Woo takes after his mom.

1716
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:01,510
He takes after his mom too.

1717
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:02,920
Suk Jin is wise.
Isn't that right, Suk Jin?

1718
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,760
The only thing Hyun Woo got
from his dad is his nose.

1719
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,280
- Hey.
- The DNA is strong.

1720
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,860
- Why did you bring up his nose?
- Seriously.

1721
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,920
- Seriously.
- Big Nose.

1722
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,050
- He has a point.
- It might hurt his feelings.

1723
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,190
- He has a point.
- It might hurt...

1724
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:17,420
- It might hurt his feelings.
- Why would it hurt his feelings?

1725
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,090
I don't know
if he likes his nose or not.

1726
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:20,300
- I haven't asked.
- Why would it hurt his feelings?

1727
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,840
He might be self-conscious
about his nose.

1728
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,010
Does Ji Ho have a protruding mouth?

1729
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:26,530
Hold on. Why did you bring up Ji Ho?

1730
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:28,480
- You started it.
- He can get braces, okay?

1731
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,480
Shall we have a war about
our children? Shall we do that?

1732
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,170
My son, Dream, hasn't grown taller
since first grade.

1733
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:35,920
He hasn't grown taller.

1734
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,920
Hasn't Dream grown taller?

1735
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,190
- No.
- DNA does matter.

1736
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:40,490
It would be strange
if his son is tall.

1737
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:41,490
- That's right.
- Both his parents are short.

1738
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:43,260
My dad is 180cm tall, okay?

1739
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,550
I forgot about that.

1740
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,800
Your older brother is a doctor,
but you are a thug!

1741
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,300
(Your older brother is a doctor,
but you are a thug!)

1742
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,360
(DNA isn't the only indicator.)

1743
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,170
In this mission,

1744
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,900
Town A and Town B residents
will compare their knowledge.

1745
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,360
- Gosh.
- It's the Quiz Snake Ladders.

1746
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,210
- Snake Ladders.
- It will be hard.

1747
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,070
The die has sides that represent
numbers from 0 to 5.

1748
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:04,670
The rules are simple.

1749
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:06,440
Roll the die
and answer the question...

1750
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,320
that corresponds with the subject.

1751
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,380
If you get it right, you stay.

1752
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,340
If you get it wrong,
you go back to the starting line.

1753
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,550
(If you get it wrong,
you go back to the starting line.)

1754
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:14,010
You need to get it right
in order to advance.

1755
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,190
- You can catch the opponent's pawn.
- Okay.

1756
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:17,690
The finish line consists
of five squares, right?

1757
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:18,760
Yes.

1758
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,550
Land on any squares
and answer the question to finish.

1759
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:22,570
(The number of stars
determines the level of difficulty.)

1760
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,360
If you land on the five-star square,

1761
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,840
- you will get the hardest question.
- The level of difficulty.

1762
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,440
- That's good.
- That would be better.

1763
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,260
If you fail to answer,
do you go back to the beginning?

1764
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,260
- Yes.
- My goodness.

1765
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,670
If you succeed at any square
of the finish line, you are done.

1766
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:34,710
It's okay. We can do it.

1767
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:36,380
How difficult are the questions?

1768
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,110
- They are easy. However,
- Are they easy?

1769
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:40,320
other members can't help the player.
You only get five seconds.

1770
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,740
- Make them difficult.
- It's better that way.

1771
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:43,190
- Say that they are difficult.
- Make them very difficult.

1772
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,190
It's better that way.

1773
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:45,420
- It's less embarrassing.
- You know that, right?

1774
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,420
That's right.

1775
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,210
- It's fair that way.
- That's right.

1776
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:52,230
Jun Hyun will be
the first player on our team.

1777
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,050
- As for us, it will be Jun Ho.
- Okay.

1778
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:55,990
- The rivalry should continue.
- That's right.

1779
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,760
I am nervous.

1780
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,260
(I am nervous.)

1781
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,990
They usually give
difficult questions...

1782
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:02,530
- on the show.
- I know.

1783
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:04,710
- They aren't difficult.
- You can't think of the answer.

1784
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,210
- Seriously. You can't think of it.
- Your mind goes blank.

1785
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,170
Your mind suddenly goes blank.
You become flustered.

1786
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,010
Don't act like
it's a momentary lapse.

1787
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:11,400
- You don't know the answer.
- It's true.

1788
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:13,010
I am pretty nervous.

1789
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,070
This is nerve-racking.

1790
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:15,150
This is very nerve-racking.

1791
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:16,150
- Four.
- That's good.

1792
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,990
- Entertainment and sports.
- That's good.

1793
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,610
I envy him.

1794
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:20,990
Entertainment and sports.

1795
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,490
We are off to a good start.

1796
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:25,730
- You must answer in five seconds.
- Okay.

1797
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,050
- I get one question, right?
- Yes.

1798
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:28,150
Let's go.

1799
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,670
- It isn't very difficult.
- It isn't difficult.

1800
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,440
Get ready to play the tune
for the correct answer.

1801
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,400
In an international soccer match...

1802
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,710
- It will be easy.
- He might not know about soccer.

1803
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:40,110
Sending the ball into your own net
is described as OG.

1804
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,980
- OG.
- OG.

1805
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:43,710
What does OG stand for?

1806
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,070
- He wouldn't know.
- He would know.

1807
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:46,820
- Your own net.
- Aren't there choices?

1808
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:49,240
- Five, four,
- Sending it into your own net.

1809
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,690
- three,
- Oh, my gosh.

1810
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:51,710
- two...
- Oh, my gosh?

1811
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:52,760
(What does OG stand for?)

1812
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:54,190
- Okay.
- It wasn't...

1813
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,190
- an easy question.
- Oh, my gosh.

1814
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,360
- It was hard.
- It was hard.

1815
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,260
- Own goal.
- That's right.

1816
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,900
- Own goal?
- Own. O-W-N.

1817
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,490
- Own.
- Own goal.

1818
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:03,190
- Own goal.
- Own.

1819
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:06,170
- Own goal.
- I should have gotten the question.

1820
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,590
- English.
- English.

1821
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:08,690
- Five.
- Five.

1822
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:09,900
- What's the subject?
- Korean history.

1823
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,070
- It will be hard.
- Korean history isn't bad.

1824
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:12,900
Jun Ho, you don't know much
about Korean history.

1825
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,010
(Teasing)

1826
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:15,010
- Yes, he does.
- Yes, he does.

1827
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:17,210
- Yes, he does.
- He knows so much about it.

1828
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:18,880
You fell asleep
during the Korean history class.

1829
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:20,570
- You are annoyed, aren't you?
- Really?

1830
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:21,880
Here comes the question.

1831
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:24,190
It's about the leader
of Donghak Peasant Revolution,

1832
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:26,150
- Jeon Bong Jun.
- I know this one.

1833
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,690
He is my ancestor.

1834
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,360
Which nickname did he have
because of his short stature?

1835
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,920
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

1836
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,590
General Mung Bean.

1837
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:37,130
(Correct)

1838
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,440
- Let me answer. General Mung Bean.
- Okay.

1839
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,670
(Jun Ho quickly got
the correct answer.)

1840
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,130
That was incredible.

1841
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:46,010
- He is the older brother indeed.
- Seriously.

1842
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:47,900
A younger sibling
can't surpass an older sibling.

1843
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,070
(Town A advanced 5 squares!)

1844
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:50,840
- You answered so confidently.
- Let's go.

1845
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,940
You said you are good at quizzes.

1846
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:55,210
- Seriously.
- I am sorry.

1847
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:56,340
(His claim of being a smart man
was proven false in 5 minutes.)

1848
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:57,880
What's wrong with you?

1849
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,190
I got on my knees
as soon as I failed to answer.

1850
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,010
- Yuri.
- Me?

1851
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:03,360
- Yuri.
- Okay.

1852
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,960
If you get five
and answer correctly,

1853
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,030
you can catch the pawn.

1854
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,730
- You can catch the pawn.
- Come on, Yuri.

1855
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:10,360
- Catch the pawn.
- Five.

1856
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:12,300
- Five.
- Let's catch it.

1857
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,570
- Five.
- I love you

1858
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:15,710
- It's English.
- English?

1859
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,460
- It's English.
- English?

1860
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,900
- Isn't English better?
- Yuri,

1861
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,110
- you performed abroad many times.
- You can speak English, right?

1862
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,940
- A little bit.
- She knows enough to go shopping.

1863
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,650
- A little bit.
- I just know enough to go shopping.

1864
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:25,710
I am in trouble.

1865
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:28,210
- Imagine that you are at a shop.
- My heart is beating fast.

1866
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,550
I am the same.

1867
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:31,650
- So Min and I are anxious.
- Seriously.

1868
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,610
Talking about English
makes my heart beat fast.

1869
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,690
- I am like...
- You know,

1870
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:38,090
So Min isn't talking anymore.

1871
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:39,990
Your lack of knowledge
isn't exactly a secret, okay?

1872
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:41,630
Just take it easy.

1873
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:43,420
- Here comes the question.
- Let's go.

1874
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,860
In English, a fly is "Fly."

1875
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:49,710
- Fly.
- A butterfly is "Butterfly."

1876
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,210
- What's a dragonfly in English?
- It's so easy.

1877
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,570
Hold on. I...

1878
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,050
- A dragonfly.
- A dragonfly?

1879
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,240
What is it?

1880
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,150
A dragonfly? What is it?

1881
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,320
What is it?

1882
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,570
- Dragon...
- Dragonfly.

1883
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:02,650
It's "Dragonfly," right?

1884
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:03,710
- Jae Suk!
- That's right!

1885
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:05,550
I got it right! Dragonfly!

1886
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:07,960
There was a character
with the same name.

1887
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,630
I got it right. Dragonfly.

1888
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,820
- I should have gotten English.
- I am so flustered.

1889
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:12,990
I got it right.

1890
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,760
It's Town A's turn.

1891
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,530
We can't advance.

1892
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:17,960
- I got it right, So Min.
- We are pretty good at this.

1893
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:19,240
I am sorry.

1894
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,860
"Dragonfly" is basic knowledge.

1895
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:22,630
I didn't know either.
You heard the answer first.

1896
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:24,460
No, I didn't. I knew the answer.

1897
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:25,840
- Let's go, Hyoyeon.
- Hyoyeon.

1898
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,130
- Let's get English.
- Let's go.

1899
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:28,170
I am nervous.

1900
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,440
- Hyoyeon.
- You got this.

1901
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:30,800
- Four.
- Four.

1902
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:32,050
It's English.

1903
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:33,550
- English?
- Didn't you live abroad?

1904
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,880
- Hyoyeon is...
- I lived in China.

1905
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:36,090
totally from Incheon.

1906
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,210
- I thought she was Korean American.
- Incheon?

1907
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:40,460
- I know.
- I thought she could speak English.

1908
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,860
Many people think that, right?

1909
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:42,990
- So many people think that.
- All right.

1910
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:44,630
Here comes the question.

1911
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:47,420
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Yes.

1912
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,800
Say 5 months in 5 seconds.

1913
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,800
- Months?
- Yes.

1914
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,990
This is easy.

1915
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:55,030
July, June,

1916
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:56,760
May, April,

1917
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,210
Monday...
Where did Monday come from?

1918
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,630
(Monday?)

1919
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:02,840
- Monday.
- Where did Monday come from?

1920
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,900
Monday.

1921
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,440
June, July, April...

1922
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,940
- She became flustered.
- Monday!

1923
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:08,320
- Seriously.
- Hey.

1924
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,920
Was she about to say
Monday and Sunday?

1925
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,320
If you hadn't said that,
you would have looked cool.

1926
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,760
She was probably confused.

1927
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,490
- I was totally confused.
- She was probably confused.

1928
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,130
- It's okay.
- Hyoyeon, you did well.

1929
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,630
- I did well, right?
- You did well.

1930
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:18,760
You were nearly done.

1931
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:19,920
It's our turn.

1932
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,630
It isn't even my turn,
but I am so nervous.

1933
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:25,400
So Min is really nervous
even though it isn't her turn.

1934
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,130
- So Min, go next.
- Go.

1935
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,170
- So Min, go next.
- I hope...

1936
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:31,530
- you don't get two.
- You will go against Ji Hyo.

1937
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:32,570
Go, So Min.

1938
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,570
- Just don't get two.
- This is nerve-racking.

1939
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:36,400
- One.
- Korean.

1940
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,610
- It will be dictation.
- That's a good subject.

1941
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:41,070
- It might be about grammar.
- Dictation.

1942
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:43,420
- Korean is a good subject.
- It will be easy.

1943
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,110
Korean is hard.

1944
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,260
- All right.
- It's hard.

1945
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:49,590
Who wrote the first Korean novel,
"The Story of Hong Gil Dong?"

1946
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:51,530
"The Story of Hong Gil Dong?"

1947
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,630
- Don't you know it?
- It's easy.

1948
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:57,300
The author
of "The Story of Hong Gil Dong."

1949
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,570
(6 months ago,
Empty Heads had a study session.)

1950
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:01,030
- "The Story of Hong Gil Dong."
- "Call each other brothers."

1951
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:03,300
("Call each other brothers?")

1952
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,440
"For I cannot call my father
'Father'..."

1953
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,630
You were referring
to that line, right?

1954
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,710
You're wrong.
"Call each other brothers"...

1955
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:13,480
is the expression you use
for close friendship.

1956
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,710
(She learned about the author
during a lesson from Suk Jin.)

1957
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,440
- Heo Gyun.
- Heo Gyun.

1958
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,550
His name is similar to Heo Jun's.
Heo Gyun.

1959
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:24,420
(She definitely memorized
the name, Heo Gyun.)

1960
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:28,150
(Will So Min remember the name?)

1961
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:29,590
- Don't you know it?
- It's easy.

1962
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,190
Heo...

1963
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,960
(That's it!)

1964
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,590
Heo...

1965
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:36,840
Heo Jun. Heo Cham!

1966
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,130
(Heo Jun!)

1967
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,800
Heo Jun. Heo Cham!

1968
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,170
(Heo Jun?)

1969
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:44,050
(She memorized it as a name
that is similar to Heo Jun's.)

1970
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:46,170
- Someone told you, right?
- No.

1971
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:48,110
- Someone told you, right?
- Hey!

1972
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:50,210
- How shocking.
- Heo Jun...

1973
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,920
was played by Jeon Gwang Ryeol.

1974
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:54,960
Her pulse is racing.

1975
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:55,960
It's Heo Gyun.

1976
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,230
It's not like that.

1977
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:58,880
- We learned it a while ago.
- Where did Heo Jun come from?

1978
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,130
- My heart is beating so fast.
- Hey.

1979
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,420
We haven't left the starting line.

1980
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:04,990
Heo Jun is a bit...

1981
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:07,260
At this rate, we will have
a never ending quiz show.

1982
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,440
- Seriously. What do we do?
- Let's go.

1983
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,710
(It's Haha's turn.)

1984
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:12,880
- Which subject do you want?
- Two.

1985
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,070
- It's English. Okay.
- English.

1986
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,240
Haha is good at English.

1987
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:18,010
- He is pretty bad at it.
- He doesn't know the Alphabet.

1988
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,550
In email, what does e stand for?

1989
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:21,780
(In email, what does e stand for?)

1990
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:22,990
- Electronic.
- Pardon?

1991
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:25,610
- What?
- What did you say?

1992
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:26,760
Say it again.

1993
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,820
What's the spelling?

1994
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,090
(The production crew asks him
to spell it out.)

1995
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,730
Okay.

1996
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:33,990
(Surprised)

1997
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,820
(Electronic guy)

1998
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:37,990
- Electronic.
- Haha is good.

1999
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:40,570
- At the end...
- Since he has children,

2000
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:41,670
- he is knowledgeable.
- Electronic.

2001
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:43,070
I thought he would put K at the end.

2002
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:44,360
- Electronic.
- Seriously.

2003
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:45,630
Electronic.

2004
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:48,670
- Electronic.
- He didn't put K at the end.

2005
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:50,070
- He is good.
- All right.

2006
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,780
- He learned it.
- Electronic.

2007
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,110
He is good.

2008
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:55,780
(Thanks to Haha,
Town A advances 2 squares!)

2009
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,990
Okay.

2010
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:57,990
(Yoori got 5.)

2011
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:59,780
- Korean history. Let's go.
- I need to get it right.

2012
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,490
- Let's go, Yuri.
- Okay.

2013
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:03,730
Let's begin.

2014
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,550
What's the name of the policy
from the late Joseon Period...

2015
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,920
that was implemented
in order to recruit people fairly...

2016
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,740
regardless
of their political affiliations?

2017
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:14,860
- The name of the policy?
- Yes.

2018
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:17,210
- It's an exam, right? An exam.
- What?

2019
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:19,980
In order to recruit people fairy...
Don't give her a hint.

2020
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,300
- Hold on.
- Don't tell her anything.

2021
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,610
What's the name of the policy...

2022
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:23,900
that was implemented
in order to recruit people fairly?

2023
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,740
- I know the answer.
- Yes, you know the answer.

2024
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:28,650
- You know the answer.
- I really know it.

2025
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:30,710
- It's an exam.
- A policy.

2026
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,440
Five seconds passed.

2027
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,490
- Hold on.
- A policy.

2028
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:36,260
- Give me a hint.
- Five.

2029
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:37,960
- Just this once.
- Three,

2030
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:39,990
two,

2031
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,920
- one.
- A policy.

2032
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,400
- Tangpyeongchaek.
- Tangpyeongchaek.

2033
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,990
- Come on.
- Tangpyeongchaek.

2034
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,170
For goodness' sake.

2035
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:47,630
- It's in the textbook.
- Yes.

2036
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:48,990
It isn't
"Winning the state examination."

2037
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:50,170
Winning the state examination.

2038
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:51,900
- Tangpyeongchaek.
- Tangpyeongchaek.

2039
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:53,780
- It's different from tangsuyuk.
- Right.

2040
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,740
- Hold on. Suk Jin.
- What?

2041
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,400
Why do you keep making fun
of my teammates?

2042
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,840
- It's not like that.
- He acts all haughty.

2043
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,210
- He acts all haughty.
- Seriously.

2044
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:01,550
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

2045
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,150
Why do you keep making fun
of my teammates?

2046
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:05,710
- He is so annoying.
- Suk Jin is so annoying today.

2047
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,610
- Let's begin.
- Which subject did she get?

2048
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,190
- World history.
- World history.

2049
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,360
I am so nervous.

2050
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,490
What's the name
of the French hero...

2051
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:14,630
who saved France from a crisis
during the Hundred Years' War?

2052
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:15,960
- You should know the answer.
- I know it.

2053
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:16,990
- You know it.
- I know it.

2054
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:18,260
- She is like this.
- Be quiet.

2055
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,740
- She is like this.
- That's right.

2056
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:21,900
(What's the name
of the French hero?)

2057
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,630
I don't remember!

2058
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:26,900
(She becomes angry
instead of giving the answer.)

2059
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,380
Why don't you remember it?

2060
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:29,710
Why did you say you know the answer?

2061
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:31,050
- We know it.
- Do you know it?

2062
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:32,670
- We know it.
- One, two, three.

2063
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:33,710
- Napoleon.
- Napoleon.

2064
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:34,880
What are you talking about?

2065
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,280
- What's the answer?
- It's Joan of Arc.

2066
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,490
- It's Joan of Arc.
- It's Joan of Arc.

2067
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,460
- Joan of Arc?
- Those Empty Heads.

2068
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,420
The three Empty Heads said
"Napoleon."

2069
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:44,650
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2070
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:46,900
- Napoleon.
- Napoleon.

2071
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:52,490
(Team Napoleon had
4 members, not 3.)

2072
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:54,090
- Hey.
- We mouthed the word.

2073
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:55,740
- It's Joan of Arc.
- We went,

2074
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,570
"Napoleon."

2075
01:07:58,610 --> 01:07:59,740
Oh, no.

2076
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,300
It's Joan of Arc.
Hundred Years' War.

2077
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,610
- We are back to the beginning.
- I am sorry.

2078
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:05,440
- I feel dizzy. Seriously.
- This won't end.

2079
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:06,780
It's this town's turn.

2080
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,480
I think Yuri is...

2081
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,150
- I think Yuri is suffering too.
- She is having a mental breakdown.

2082
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:12,860
None of them can laugh.

2083
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:14,460
Hey.

2084
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,780
How could you give a guest
a mental breakdown?

2085
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,860
- I feel dejected.
- I hope this ends soon.

2086
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,030
- I hate this segment.
- It's okay.

2087
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:22,090
Se Chan, go ahead.

2088
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:23,530
World history
or entertainment and sports.

2089
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:24,800
- Entertainment and sports.
- You got this.

2090
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,030
Show us what you can do.

2091
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:27,260
Try to get four.

2092
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:28,570
Don't let me get English.

2093
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:30,860
- Five. Korean history.
- Good.

2094
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,630
- Korean history.
- That's one of the better ones.

2095
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:35,080
- You have a chance.
- That's one of the better ones.

2096
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:37,170
- Why are you showing confidence?
- What?

2097
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:39,110
- Why are you showing confidence?
- Korean history is better.

2098
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:40,280
- Korean history...
- He has a chance.

2099
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,480
- He watches many period dramas.
- Yes.

2100
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,880
- I learned from dramas.
- That's right.

2101
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,690
- Let's begin.
- Please read it slowly.

2102
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:46,790
I am bad at listening.
Please read it slowly.

2103
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,410
He wants time to think.

2104
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,860
What's the name of the general...

2105
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:55,290
who became a hero in 1018
by stopping the Khitan invasion?

2106
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:56,920
Gang Gam Chan.

2107
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:00,070
(Correct)

2108
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,500
Gang Gam Chan.

2109
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,460
(Se Chan knows
who Gang Gam Chan is.)

2110
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:07,800
(They can't believe their ears.)

2111
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,610
Gang Gam Chan is
the only one he knows.

2112
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:11,170
Seriously.

2113
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:12,450
As soon as I heard the question,

2114
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:14,210
I went, "It's Gam Gang Chan."

2115
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:15,210
Hold on. What?

2116
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:16,290
- Hey.
- He doesn't know anything else.

2117
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:18,010
I went, "It's Gam Gang Chan."

2118
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:19,510
- Hey.
- He doesn't know anything else.

2119
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:21,360
- Did you say "Gam Gam Chan?"
- What?

2120
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,580
- What's the exact answer?
- What?

2121
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:25,660
(His pronunciation
comes under fire.)

2122
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,030
- What's the exact answer?
- He said it's correct.

2123
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,500
- No.
- Say it.

2124
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,760
Don't ask. Don't be like that.

2125
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,500
- He pronounced it strangely.
- Say it.

2126
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,090
- Write it down.
- Write it down.

2127
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:35,760
Don't be like that. I got it right.

2128
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,500
- Hurry up and say it.
- "Gam Gam Chan?"

2129
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,300
"Gam Chan?"

2130
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,170
- What's the answer?
- Gam Gan Chan.

2131
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:42,440
Gwang Gam Chan. Gam Gam Chan.

2132
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:44,700
- Gam Gam Chan.
- Come on.

2133
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,320
- He got it right.
- Gam Gam Chan.

2134
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,450
- Write it down.
- Write it down.

2135
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:49,380
We were uncertain,
but your pronunciation seems off.

2136
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:50,620
- Please write it down.
- Gam Gam Chan.

2137
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:51,690
- Hey.
- Come on.

2138
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:53,290
Why are you making him
write it down?

2139
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:55,620
- It won't be an issue if he knows.
- I looked cool, okay?

2140
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,160
Why are you doing this?

2141
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,330
- Is his last name Gam or Gang?
- You should know it.

2142
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:00,400
Don't say anything.

2143
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,950
All right. Write it down.

2144
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:04,030
(He begins
to write down the answer.)

2145
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:05,870
This is the biggest crisis.

2146
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:08,000
- If I get this wrong...
- Se Chan.

2147
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,440
Just write it down.

2148
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:12,370
Think of Kang Chan Hee.

2149
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:14,480
- Hey!
- What's wrong with you?

2150
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,300
Why can't I talk about
Kang Chan Hee?

2151
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:17,910
- Don't give him a hint!
- What?

2152
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,300
- Jae Suk.
- For goodness' sake.

2153
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,780
- Kang Chan Hee isn't here today.
- Hey.

2154
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:22,820
Why did you give him a hint?

2155
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:24,190
I didn't do anything.

2156
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:27,690
Show us the answer. One, two, three.

2157
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,750
(What did Se Chan write down?)

2158
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,120
Two, three.

2159
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,290
Gam Gang Chan.

2160
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:35,200
(Incorrect)

2161
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:37,200
Gam Gang Chan.

2162
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,070
(That punk.)

2163
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,260
(General Gang Gam Chan's last name
became Gam.)

2164
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:42,460
Gam Gang Chan.

2165
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:44,370
Because Jae Suk talked about
Kang Chan Hee,

2166
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:47,830
he wrote down "Gam Gang Chan."

2167
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:49,580
He got "Gam Gang Chan"
from Kang Chan Hee.

2168
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:51,150
Gam Gang Chan.

2169
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:53,040
You shouldn't have said anything.

2170
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,450
- Hey.
- You confused me.

2171
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:57,490
Why didn't you get "Gang Gam Chan"
from "Kang Chan Hee?"

2172
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:59,860
- No.
- Gam Kang Chan Hee.

2173
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:01,820
- Kang Chan Hee.
- Gam Kang Chan Hee.

2174
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:02,920
(Gam Kang Chan Hee)

2175
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,250
For goodness' sake.

2176
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,660
My answer was correct.

2177
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:11,160
Your answer was correct.

2178
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,660
- You were close.
- My stomach hurts.

2179
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:14,870
- He startled me.
- You were flustered, right?

2180
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,040
- Your answer was correct.
- My answer was correct.

2181
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,240
I am so frustrated.

2182
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:20,580
It's Ji Hyo's turn.
Here comes the Red Hare.

2183
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:22,000
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

2184
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,000
Okay.

2185
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,200
Here comes Ji Hyo.

2186
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,340
- English.
- It's okay. You can do it.

2187
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:28,840
- I am not good at English.
- We can't get past that part.

2188
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,580
Ji Hyo's face fell.

2189
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:32,380
Why can't there be rivalry?

2190
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,750
- Seriously.
- You can do it.

2191
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:35,290
- All right.
- It will be easy.

2192
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:37,450
What's the English title
of the movie, "Parasite?"

2193
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:39,700
You know this.

2194
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:41,000
Come on.

2195
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,550
(What's the English title
of the movie, "Parasite?")

2196
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:44,000
- Two...
- "Amoeba?"

2197
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,330
"Paracide."

2198
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:48,740
("Amoeba?")

2199
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:50,410
- "Paracide."
- I thought it was "Amoeba" too.

2200
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:51,660
"Amoeba!"

2201
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:54,300
- I thought it was "Amoeba" too.
- Isn't it "Amoeba?"

2202
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,830
- What's the answer?
- What's the answer?

2203
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,910
- "Paracide."
- Guys.

2204
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:59,820
- I know it's "Paracide."
- "Paracide?"

2205
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,080
- "Paracide."
- What?

2206
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:03,150
- It's incorrect.
- "Paracide."

2207
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:04,880
What's "Paracide?"

2208
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,290
To be honest,
I thought it was "Bacteria."

2209
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:09,360
- "Bacteria?"
- I thought it was "Bacteria."

2210
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,490
"Bacteria."

2211
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:11,730
(Empty Heads' answers
are quite varied.)

2212
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:14,950
- "Parasite?"
- Why do you guys keep answering?

2213
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:16,330
- She keeps...
- Just sit still.

2214
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:18,000
She keeps asking me
what the answer is.

2215
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,260
- Just sit still like Yuri.
- Right.

2216
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:21,700
It's this team's turn.

2217
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:22,940
Jae Suk, it's your turn. Get five.

2218
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,440
- Get five.
- It's my turn.

2219
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,960
- Let's advance.
- Jae Suk.

2220
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,200
- Please.
- Five, I love you

2221
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:33,210
- Five
- I love you a lot

2222
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:34,320
- Five.
- Zero.

2223
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:36,410
- Three. It isn't half bad.
- It's good.

2224
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:38,540
World history is a good subject.

2225
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,190
Just get it right.

2226
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:42,010
- Let's advance.
- Let's advance this once.

2227
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:43,330
We can advance this time.

2228
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:44,380
Let's advance.

2229
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:45,620
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

2230
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:46,660
World history.

2231
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:49,250
- In Europe,
- What? Europe.

2232
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,870
this movement emerged
in the 14th to 16th centuries.

2233
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:55,570
The name means
"Revival of literature and art."

2234
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:57,240
What's this movement?

2235
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,610
- Renaissance.
- Renaissance.

2236
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:00,440
It was easy.

2237
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,980
- I had no idea.
- We are advancing.

2238
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:04,540
- It was easy.
- Let's advance three squares.

2239
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,150
World history is unexpectedly easy.

2240
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:07,210
Let's advance three squares.

2241
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:11,580
Which Greek philosopher said,
"Laws are not made for the good?"

2242
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,210
Socrates.

2243
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:14,820
Yes.

2244
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:17,660
- I knew the answer.
- I knew it was Socrates.

2245
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:19,750
I knew it was Socrates.

2246
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:21,620
- It's our turn.
- Let's go.

2247
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:22,830
- Yuri.
- Yes.

2248
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:24,230
Yuri, get it right.

2249
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:25,700
My goodness.

2250
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,870
Get a high number.

2251
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:28,900
Roll the die.

2252
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:31,760
- Five.
- Yuri, get it together.

2253
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:32,830
Five.

2254
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,610
- Four.
- That's good.

2255
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:36,250
That's good.

2256
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,980
I keep getting English.

2257
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,370
You can do it.

2258
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:41,040
Yuri, you can do it.
You have it in you.

2259
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,150
Let's go.

2260
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:43,650
(It's a chance to get ahead.)

2261
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:45,120
- Let's begin.
- Don't be intimidated.

2262
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:50,550
When the performance ends
and the audience applauds...

2263
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:51,620
Encore.

2264
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:53,420
- What?
- What?

2265
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:54,700
Hold on.

2266
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:56,760
Hold on.

2267
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:58,000
Listen to the question.

2268
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,370
- She got ahead of herself.
- It's encore!

2269
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:01,760
It's curtain call.

2270
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,570
- Yuri isn't strong-minded.
- Encore.

2271
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:06,330
Why isn't it encore?

2272
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:07,580
- Yuri isn't strong-minded.
- Hold on.

2273
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:09,440
- People ask for an encore.
- Listen.

2274
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,410
Why did you behave flippantly
without letting him finish?

2275
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:14,450
- You behaved flippantly.
- Encore.

2276
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,980
- You are in trouble.
- Encore.

2277
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,450
- I feel dizzy.
- You are really in trouble.

2278
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:18,650
- What are you going to do?
- I feel dizzy.

2279
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:19,880
It's the curtain call.

2280
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,210
Yuri, just accept it.

2281
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:22,750
- That's the way to do it.
- Variety shows suit Yuri.

2282
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,920
Variety shows suit Yuri.

2283
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,160
How did she get "Encore?"

2284
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,530
When Yuri finishes performing,
people ask for an encore.

2285
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:31,920
Seriously. What's your problem?

2286
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,760
- Good job.
- Yuri was too hasty.

2287
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,500
- Curtain call.
- You haven't heard of it, have you?

2288
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,110
- Why does he keep acting haughty?
- Have you heard of it?

2289
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:40,130
- Suk Jin.
- I bet you haven't.

2290
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:41,670
- Don't point at me.
- Of course he has heard of it.

2291
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:42,670
I know what it is.

2292
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:44,280
- Gam Gang Chan.
- You should have waited.

2293
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,370
Gam Gang Chan.

2294
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,120
Hey, Heo Jun.

2295
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,280
Stay still.

2296
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,620
- Gam Gang Chan. Heo Jun.
- Encore.

2297
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:53,210
Jae Suk, Suk Jin is so annoying.

2298
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:55,250
- The next question.
- We can win.

2299
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:56,750
- She is so cute.
- I bet he hasn't heard of it.

2300
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:57,920
- If we keep going like this...
- Let's go.

2301
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,330
Has a quiz like this ended
during the shoot?

2302
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:01,730
It will end.

2303
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,660
- Why can't we advance?
- We haven't advanced a square.

2304
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,830
- I feel so dizzy.
- There are only 12 squares.

2305
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:07,090
So Min feels dizzy.

2306
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:09,660
So Min doesn't want to do this.

2307
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:11,330
Please throw us white cloth.

2308
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:14,200
Ditch the rule about
going back to the starting line.

2309
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,610
Let's do that.

2310
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:17,750
- Shall we do that?
- We can't advance otherwise.

2311
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:21,540
What's the name of the emperor
who searched for the elixir of life?

2312
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:22,620
Don't give it away.

2313
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,010
Qin Shi Huang.

2314
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:25,210
(The older brother is better
than the younger brother.)

2315
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:26,660
- All right.
- He is good.

2316
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:29,690
What's the tomb
of the king of Egypt called?

2317
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:31,120
- This is easy.
- Think about it.

2318
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,380
Pyramid.

2319
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:34,530
(Thus, the two towns advance.)

2320
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,090
- What?
- What?

2321
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,160
- Pyramid.
- Pyramid.

2322
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,420
- Write it down.
- Yuri.

2323
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:40,570
- It's Yuri's turn.
- Let's go.

2324
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:41,870
Everyone, it's Yuri's turn.

2325
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,570
- Yuri, encore.
- Encore.

2326
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:45,760
- Encore.
- Encore.

2327
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,910
(The audience cheers
for Ms. Encore.)

2328
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,080
- Let's go.
- Let's go, Yuri.

2329
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,300
Show us what you can do.

2330
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,540
Get five.

2331
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:54,480
(The squares at the end have
different levels of difficulty.)

2332
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,750
- Yuri.
- Get five. Let's go.

2333
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:59,290
(She needs a small number
to get an easy question.)

2334
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:02,080
- Two.
- That's perfect.

2335
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:04,490
(She gets the easiest question!)

2336
01:16:04,490 --> 01:16:05,880
- Level one.
- That's perfect.

2337
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,550
- Yuri, get it right.
- It's level one.

2338
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:09,120
- You can do it.
- Even though it's level one,

2339
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:11,120
you never know because it's Yuri.

2340
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:13,940
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

2341
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:16,440
If you get this right,
people will forget about encore.

2342
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,070
- Encore.
- Think of your image.

2343
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:20,240
- Good luck.
- Let's begin.

2344
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:21,580
Think of your image.

2345
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:24,750
What's the term that refers
to the moral obligation...

2346
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,280
- those of a high social class have?
- Hold on. What?

2347
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:30,190
What's the term that refers
to the moral obligation...

2348
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:33,120
- those of a high social class have?
- This is really easy.

2349
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,510
- It can be confusing.
- It's used often.

2350
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:35,950
- Three...
- Don't say anything.

2351
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:37,750
What? What did you say?

2352
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,330
The term that refers
to the moral obligation.

2353
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:42,200
Those of a high social class
have more moral obligations.

2354
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,070
- Moral obligations?
- She doesn't know.

2355
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:45,370
They have more moral obligations?

2356
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:46,570
- She doesn't know.
- She doesn't know.

2357
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:48,590
She doesn't know the answer.
Don't say anything.

2358
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:49,940
- Don't say anything.
- She doesn't know the answer.

2359
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:51,940
- Hold on. I am nervous.
- It has two words.

2360
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,370
- I am nervous.
- Don't say anything.

2361
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:54,440
- Eight letters...
- What's wrong with you?

2362
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,780
Five, four,

2363
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:58,450
- three...
- Bourgeois.

2364
01:16:58,450 --> 01:16:59,820
"Bourgeois?"

2365
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:01,650
- Three...
- Bourgeois.

2366
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:02,910
("Bourgeois" came out of nowhere.)

2367
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,820
- Oh, no.
- It's "Noblesse oblige."

2368
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,490
- You don't know what it is.
- It's "Noblesse oblige."

2369
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:07,820
- You don't know what it is.
- I know what it is.

2370
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:09,210
I know what it is.

2371
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,750
- I know what it is.
- Do you know?

2372
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:13,250
- I know what it is.
- Hey.

2373
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,700
- It's "Noblesse oblige."
- Sit down.

2374
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:17,120
- Stop it.
- Do you know...

2375
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,230
what So Min said?

2376
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:20,400
- Stop it.
- So Min said, "Great people."

2377
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:22,240
- "Great people?"
- So Min said, "Great people."

2378
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:23,800
Great people.

2379
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:26,700
(A truly great person
when it comes to quizzes)

2380
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:28,740
- Great people.
- I want to use the restroom.

2381
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:30,480
- I am about to throw up.
- I want to use the restroom.

2382
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,150
- You know,
- Yuri.

2383
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:34,450
it's natural to be confused.

2384
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:35,870
Noblesse oblige.

2385
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:38,820
- Can I use the restroom?
- No.

2386
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,820
- You are up next. You can't go.
- I need to pee.

2387
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:42,410
- You are up next.
- You are up next.

2388
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:43,550
- But...
- You are up next.

2389
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:45,120
- I want to use the restroom.
- Go ahead.

2390
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,250
- Can I go?
- Go ahead.

2391
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,400
Quiz gives them a stomachache.

2392
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,400
Seriously.

2393
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,030
- It's because of the quiz.
- The irritable bowel syndrome.

2394
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:54,540
- This is too much.
- I might end up going home.

2395
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,240
Three. Here I go.

2396
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,330
- We caught the pawn.
- We caught it.

2397
01:17:57,330 --> 01:17:59,410
- We caught it.
- You need to answer the question.

2398
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:00,740
You need to answer the question
to catch the pawn.

2399
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:02,130
- You need to answer the question.
- That's right.

2400
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:04,610
- Why did you use your thighs?
- Answer the question first.

2401
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:06,370
- Answer and catch.
- "Answer and catch?"

2402
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,780
- Answer and catch.
- Answer and catch.

2403
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:12,210
- Suk Jin's Answer and Catch.
- Catch.

2404
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,410
Why did your cheeks turn rosy?

2405
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:18,120
It's strange.

2406
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,330
- He is sick and tired of it.
- It's hot.

2407
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:20,920
- It's too hot.
- Your cheeks turned rosy.

2408
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,200
This is driving me crazy.

2409
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,790
Korean history is hard.

2410
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:25,830
- You can do it.
- I need to catch the pawn.

2411
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:27,760
He can handle Korean history
because he is ancient.

2412
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,070
That's right. I was probably alive
when historical events happened.

2413
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:33,540
- That's right.
- I used to live in Hanyang.

2414
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:36,170
- He used to live in Hanyang.
- I used to live in Hanyang.

2415
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:37,340
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

2416
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,170
(If Suk Jin gets it right,
his team will win.)

2417
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:41,540
Where was the bell
which notified an emergency...

2418
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,540
as well as the time
the city gate closed and opened?

2419
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:48,210
Shinmungo.

2420
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:51,080
(Incorrect)

2421
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:53,230
The answer is "Bosingak."

2422
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,290
You must have been alive then.

2423
01:18:55,290 --> 01:18:56,420
Shinmungo.

2424
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,900
We are saved.

2425
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,160
- We are saved.
- What?

2426
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,500
It's "Bosingak."

2427
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,500
- Is it "Bosingak?"
- "Shinmungo?"

2428
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:05,300
- I had no idea.
- He doesn't have much knowledge.

2429
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,040
You don't have the basic knowledge.

2430
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,630
You can't laugh
because you don't know anything.

2431
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:10,000
Suk Jin.

2432
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:11,780
(Mr. Shinmungo
begins to aggravate them again.)

2433
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:14,410
- You don't know anything.
- He is like that until the end.

2434
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:16,650
You don't know what "Shinmungo" is.
I bet you don't.

2435
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:18,490
You are really aggravating.

2436
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:20,880
- I bet you don't.
- Mister, what's wrong with you?

2437
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,190
- Seriously.
- Suk Jin.

2438
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,530
- Why do you keep doing that?
- Mister.

2439
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:26,080
- What a strange man!
- We have the basic knowledge.

2440
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,400
What's wrong with you?

2441
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,920
- You don't know anything.
- Why do you keep teasing us?

2442
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,290
Tell us what it is then.

2443
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:32,160
- Suk Jin.
- He is really aggravating.

2444
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,130
- Suk Jin is annoying.
- He is annoying.

2445
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:37,330
If So Min and Se Chan dated,
they would have fun together.

2446
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:39,980
- They would have fun together.
- We wouldn't know anything.

2447
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:41,830
- Seriously.
- We would be happy.

2448
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:43,700
- We don't know what "Bosingak" is.
- So Min, it's your turn.

2449
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:45,110
- So Min, it's your turn.
- I need to use the restroom.

2450
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:48,010
- I will let you go ahead.
- Hurry up.

2451
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:49,950
- You can do it. You can answer it.
- The question...

2452
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:52,710
- Get five.
- You can do it.

2453
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:54,820
- Go ahead.
- You can do it!

2454
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,950
- Why is everyone so annoying?
- Go ahead.

2455
01:19:57,730 --> 01:19:59,080
(The best-case scenario is
getting a level-1 question with 2.)

2456
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,830
- Let's get five.
- Come on.

2457
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:03,200
- It's five.
- Five.

2458
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,090
(The worst-case scenario is
getting a level-4 question with 5.)

2459
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:06,630
Let's get 5. It's 5.

2460
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:09,830
(Finish line)

2461
01:20:09,830 --> 01:20:11,700
(She got a level-four question.)

2462
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,910
- It's five.
- Five.

2463
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:15,280
So Min, this is better.

2464
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,610
It wouldn't look strange
if you get it wrong.

2465
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:19,150
You will be a hero
if you get it right.

2466
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:20,620
- So Min, you might get it right.
- Then you will graduate.

2467
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:21,910
You will be a hero
if you get it right.

2468
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:24,450
You will move up a level
if you get it right.

2469
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:25,710
You will graduate
from the Empty Head Club.

2470
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:26,950
Then... Oh, right.

2471
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:28,550
- Let's begin.
- What?

2472
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:29,860
- Why?
- Then...

2473
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:30,860
(Getting up)

2474
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:31,860
Let's begin.

2475
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:32,920
- What?
- Why?

2476
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:36,120
(So Min suddenly runs
toward the production crew.)

2477
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:38,260
Why? What are you
trying to tell them?

2478
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:39,530
(Whispering)

2479
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,660
She wants to use the thing
she earned the other day.

2480
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:43,700
(She wants to use the thing
she earned the other day.)

2481
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:44,740
The card.

2482
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:46,000
- Is she using the card now?
- I see.

2483
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,080
You can't do that.

2484
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,300
No, it's not like that.

2485
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,370
Can she use that?

2486
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:51,200
(So Min suddenly recalls the wish
she earned 10 months ago.)

2487
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:54,480
(Tell me the answers to English
and Chinese character quizzes.)

2488
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:59,510
(So Min won the chance card
for quizzes last summer.)

2489
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:01,620
It was a few months ago.

2490
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:04,690
- It was a long time ago.
- The chance card for quizzes.

2491
01:21:04,690 --> 01:21:05,690
(She won the chance card
for quizzes a few months ago.)

2492
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:08,120
(The chance card for quizzes)

2493
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,160
It's over. We won.

2494
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:11,090
- That's right.
- This is unbelievable.

2495
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:13,440
Will our viewers know
about this or not?

2496
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,260
- They don't.
- Are we supposed to say...

2497
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:16,330
- you solved the quiz?
- Sure.

2498
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:18,000
- That's perfect.
- It's a good idea.

2499
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,540
- Are you using the card here?
- Right now?

2500
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:20,740
That means a lot to her.

2501
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:21,910
It's such a great card.

2502
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:23,750
- It's over. We won.
- My gosh.

2503
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,080
(So Min's crucial chance
to get away from the quizzes.)

2504
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,750
We should act surprised then.

2505
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,540
- You should.
- That's clever.

2506
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:30,320
Why would we do this
when it won't go on TV?

2507
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,320
It will. We will ask a question.

2508
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:34,160
And you give us an answer.
We will say it's correct.

2509
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:36,010
(And you give us an answer.
We will say it's correct.)

2510
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:37,920
- Just anything?
- No matter what she says?

2511
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,160
- You say it's correct anyway.
- She can give a random answer.

2512
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,950
- What are you talking about?
- You don't tell her the answer.

2513
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:45,290
Okay. I get it.

2514
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:48,330
(Whatever she says, it's correct.)

2515
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,940
(It's not that she gets
to hear the correct answer.)

2516
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:52,870
- You can't do that to her.
- Okay.

2517
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:54,540
- You should tell her the answer.
- You should tell me the answer.

2518
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,330
- Right. She won't look cool.
- She won't look smart.

2519
01:21:56,330 --> 01:21:57,580
- Great.
- This is ridiculous.

2520
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,950
- That makes sense.
- So Min.

2521
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:02,250
So Min. It's like getting a shot.
It will sting for a moment.

2522
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,540
It's an injection. It stings.

2523
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:05,210
- You have to cut this out.
- It's an injection.

2524
01:22:05,210 --> 01:22:06,250
- It stings.
- So Min, that's it.

2525
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:07,550
It's an injection. It just stings.

2526
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:09,010
- It will sting for a moment.
- It's like an injection.

2527
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:10,730
So Min, you won't look cool though.

2528
01:22:10,730 --> 01:22:12,330
- Right.
- It will just sting a little.

2529
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:14,200
- It won't take long.
- We need to get this quiz right.

2530
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,330
- It's no big deal.
- It's all right.

2531
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:16,830
Once you give an answer,
they will say it's correct.

2532
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:18,290
- It will sound great. So Min.
- She won the card.

2533
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:20,070
- It will sound good.
- Make sure...

2534
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:21,740
- to show some reactions.
- Okay.

2535
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:22,900
- Pretend I got it right.
- Okay.

2536
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:23,940
Okay. We will make you look cool.

2537
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:26,000
So Min, you did it.

2538
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,080
So Min.

2539
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:29,080
Once you talk,

2540
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:31,040
it will be dubbed
with a voice actress' voice.

2541
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,170
(Once you talk, it will be dubbed
with a voice actress' voice.)

2542
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:34,080
- So it's not her voice.
- So Min.

2543
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,650
- Right.
- I see, So Min.

2544
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:37,190
So you should say something.

2545
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:39,580
All right. It is a procedure...

2546
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:43,190
where members of the National
Assembly prolong debate...

2547
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:44,190
You must know the answer.

2548
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:45,250
- Hang on.
- to delay a decision legitimately.

2549
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:46,730
You can hear it
on the news every day.

2550
01:22:46,730 --> 01:22:48,620
It's the prolonged debate of
members of the National Assembly...

2551
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:50,730
to delay a decision legitimately.

2552
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:52,260
- That's...
- It's on the news every day.

2553
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:54,130
- Break time.
- Hang on. A debate?

2554
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:56,090
- Whatever you say is correct.
- You'll get it anyway.

2555
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:57,830
I want to get it right.

2556
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:59,740
There's no way you can answer it.
Just say anything.

2557
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:00,740
Why would you say that?

2558
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:03,170
- Don't say that.
- You will never get it right.

2559
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:05,000
Filibuster.

2560
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,840
(Correct)

2561
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,210
That's unbelievable.

2562
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:11,410
- Filibuster.
- My goodness.

2563
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:12,990
(She gives an answer with fluency.)

2564
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:13,990
(Impressed)

2565
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:16,010
(That's amazing.)

2566
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:17,250
There you go, So Min.

2567
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:18,790
She did it.

2568
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:20,700
- My goodness.
- How did she know that?

2569
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,360
(Her brilliant answer
makes everyone applaud.)

2570
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,920
You are very smart.

2571
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,070
- Right.
- My goodness.

2572
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:27,700
We won. We won the race!

2573
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:29,370
- Unbelievable.
- Yes!

2574
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:30,740
- Gosh, So Min.
- We win.

2575
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:32,740
But it seemed like So Min was
saying something shorter.

2576
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:34,440
It was short.
Like a three-syllable word.

2577
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,580
Hearing.

2578
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:36,800
(Her real answer is
just between us.)

2579
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,000
You nailed it.

2580
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,700
Thanks to So Min,

2581
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:40,780
Yes!

2582
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,750
Town B wins the race.

2583
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:44,950
- So they will pick the amounts.
- Okay.

2584
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:46,190
We should do this right.

2585
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:47,380
We should pick a good one.

2586
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,080
I should pick a good one.
Not the one with negative numbers.

2587
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,290
I need to pick a good one.

2588
01:23:51,290 --> 01:23:52,830
- I should do this well.
- Everyone.

2589
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:54,290
Before you pick anything,

2590
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:57,830
you should know that Town B
has more members to get a penalty.

2591
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:59,660
- Really?
- They have lower amounts.

2592
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:02,440
- Really?
- We should pick good ones here.

2593
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,570
- Right.
- I'll pick one.

2594
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:04,570
(Hyoyeon: 1, Se Chan: 1,
and So Min: 1.50 dollars)

2595
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:06,830
The losing team picks first.

2596
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:07,940
The losing team.

2597
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:09,670
I can't choose one.

2598
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:11,580
Please. I need good luck.

2599
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:12,950
(The losing team picks an amount
between -1.50 to 1.50 dollars.)

2600
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:14,650
- My gosh.
- Seriously, this is...

2601
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,040
Thank you for picking one for me.

2602
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:18,990
This is important.
It shouldn't be a minus.

2603
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,910
Hyoyeon, you should pick a good one.

2604
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:22,620
It shouldn't be a minus.

2605
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:23,990
- It's us.
- All right.

2606
01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:25,120
I pick number two.

2607
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,620
(Now it's Town B's turn.)

2608
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:28,530
(Se Chan has 1 dollar.)

2609
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:29,750
- Number 2.
- Number 1.

2610
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,000
- All right.
- You always get good numbers.

2611
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:34,090
Number two?

2612
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:36,200
- Number 1? I want number 1.
- I picked 2 dollars.

2613
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,300
You got two dollars.

2614
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:41,740
(The amount they pick now
can change their rankings completely.)

2615
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,040
(How will it turn out?)

2616
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,910
The result is in.
It's quite interesting.

2617
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:49,410
- Interesting?
- An interesting result?

2618
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:50,450
All right.

2619
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,010
Let me announce the winner first.

2620
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:54,120
(The winner of today's race!)

2621
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,550
Kim Jong Kook with nine dollars.

2622
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:57,290
(1st place Kim Jong Kook)

2623
01:24:57,290 --> 01:24:58,830
- I picked good numbers.
- Right.

2624
01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:00,920
- I lost twice.
- He got great numbers.

2625
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,200
And the difference between 2nd
and 3rd places is only 0.50 dollars.

2626
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,200
Who is it?

2627
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:07,200
- Is it you?
- No, it can't be me.

2628
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,440
It's Haha with five dollars.

2629
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:09,830
(2nd place Haha)

2630
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:11,700
- He's my business partner.
- Haha is second place.

2631
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:12,910
Second place?

2632
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:15,110
- That's a lot.
- I think I have about four dollars.

2633
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,480
I will announce the rankings
of the rest later.

2634
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,200
Let me tell you the two members
with the lowest amounts.

2635
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,750
- Who are they?
- I guess it's me.

2636
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:23,340
All right.
The member with the lowest amount.

2637
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:31,470
(Hyoyeon, So Min, and Se Chan
had the lowest amounts earlier.)

2638
01:25:31,470 --> 01:25:33,080
To get the penalty.

2639
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,080
Who is it?

2640
01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:35,670
Yang Se Chan with two dollars.

2641
01:25:35,670 --> 01:25:39,380
(Yang Se Chan is the last.)

2642
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,320
Was it that bad?

2643
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,990
What are you going to do?

2644
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:45,420
My goodness.

2645
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:47,530
- Gosh, Se Chan...
- So am I getting a penalty?

2646
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,180
Gosh, I'm so upset.

2647
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:51,350
And above him...

2648
01:25:51,390 --> 01:25:52,420
Who is it?

2649
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:53,870
Who would it be?

2650
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:55,170
I bet it's me.

2651
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:58,240
It's Yoo Jae Suk with 2.50 dollars.

2652
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,710
- That's right.
- My gosh.

2653
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,370
Is it you? I knew it.

2654
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:05,280
Please leave
Protruded Brothers alone.

2655
01:26:05,670 --> 01:26:07,100
But the penalty...

2656
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:09,640
I've been getting
a penalty for weeks.

2657
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:11,950
- Protruded Brothers.
- Please bring in...

2658
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:13,140
the prize first.

2659
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:14,320
(The prize will be revealed first.)

2660
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,490
- It's honey.
- Honey is rare these days.

2661
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:17,790
It's honey.

2662
01:26:17,790 --> 01:26:19,180
It looks really nice.

2663
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:23,220
It's the finest honey gift set
that will make the broken hearts...

2664
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:25,200
of the enemies sweet.

2665
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:27,500
- I will give this to my mom.
- Good.

2666
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,570
I'll give this to my mother-in-law.

2667
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:30,590
She will love it.

2668
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:32,370
And here's today's penalty.

2669
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:35,670
Actually, we had different penalties
for the members and guests.

2670
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:38,410
- Really?
- But only the members lost.

2671
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:40,750
Here's the penalty for the members.

2672
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:44,380
(Today's penalty
for Jae Suk and Se Chan is...)

2673
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:47,120
You will have to come
one hour early for the next shoot.

2674
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,380
(Coming 1 hour early
for the next shoot)

2675
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:52,210
You two will come an hour early
and do something special.

2676
01:26:52,210 --> 01:26:54,550
- My gosh.
- Darn it.

2677
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:57,160
(One week later)

2678
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,200
(For your Running Man)

2679
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:00,920
- What is this?
- What are we doing?

2680
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,960
(Are you ready to cast a vote?)

2681
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,000
Thank you for supporting me.

2682
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,600
(The only throne)

2683
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,670
(And the 100 kingmakers)

2684
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:11,910
(I hope those who voted
for Jong Kook will be eliminated.)

2685
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,670
You're good.

2686
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,250
(To become the last one)

2687
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:20,290
