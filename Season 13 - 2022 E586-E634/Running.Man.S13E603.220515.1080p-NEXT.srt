1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,200
(Monday, 7:30 a.m., Deungchon SBS)

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,040
(The producer is waiting
for someone in the waiting room.)

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,870
Aren't we shooting yet?

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,230
(At that moment...)

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,960
Hello.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,110
(Se Chan came an hour early
as a punishment from last week.)

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,800
- What's going on?
- Hello.

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,180
Are we having a test?

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,640
I don't know.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,270
Is this a test?

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,640
I'll get everything wrong
if I take a test.

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,340
First,

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,960
choose a uniform you want.

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,390
- Anything?
- You can pick anything you want.

15
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,560
A color I want? I pick purple.

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,150
- The purple one.
- Yes.

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,060
- Today,
- Yes?

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,100
we will have a complicated mission.

19
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,760
So we need to explain it
before we start.

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,500
- Okay.
- I'll explain it to each member.

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,570
All right.

22
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,540
Please listen carefully.

23
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,280
Today, we are having
The 1st Division Game.

24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,970
We will pick the luckiest one
among the members of Running Man.

25
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,110
(We will pick the luckiest one
among the members of Running Man.)

26
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,110
So the seven members will...

27
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,010
decide the ranking
through missions...

28
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,710
- where you need good luck.
- Okay.

29
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,380
And the last of each mission
with the worst luck...

30
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,800
- will be eliminated.
- Okay.

31
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,970
(The security guard
suddenly shows up.)

32
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,740
And the last of each mission
with the worst luck...

33
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,540
- will be eliminated.
- Okay.

34
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,580
That means a member will be
eliminated in each round.

35
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,380
And the one who survives
till the end will be the winner.

36
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,800
I see.

37
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,880
If you are eliminated
after a mission, a penalty ball...

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,020
I see.

39
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,790
(What's going on?)

40
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,850
with your name on it will be added.

41
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,690
We will draw a penalty ball
at the end...

42
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,890
We will draw a penalty ball
at the end...

43
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,390
We will draw a penalty ball
at the end...

44
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,210
to pick a member to get a penalty.

45
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,160
(Laughing)

46
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,180
If you're eliminated, you will
just get an extra penalty ball.

47
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,080
You still can take part
in the next missions.

48
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,740
What is he doing?

49
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,820
- But from the following missions,
- Okay.

50
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,380
(Looking straight at him)

51
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,910
You have to make the top three
not to get an extra penalty ball.

52
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,750
(Flustered)

53
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,880
If you fail to make the top three,
you'll get an extra penalty ball.

54
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,660
- Please focus.
- I'm sorry.

55
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,190
And we have special rules
for today's race.

56
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,790
- Our 100 staff members will join.
- Our 100 staff members?

57
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,310
They will vote for a member
whom they think will survive.

58
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,310
If the member survives,

59
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,880
the staff who voted for the member
will also survive.

60
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,280
If the member survives,

61
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,250
(He suddenly takes off his shirt.)

62
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,750
the staff who voted for the member
will also survive...

63
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,190
and advance to the next round.

64
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,160
- Okay.
- If the member is eliminated...

65
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,620
My goodness.

66
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,030
(This is just the beginning.)

67
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,530
(Warming up)

68
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,690
(He starts dancing in earnest.)

69
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,260
What is going on? What is he doing?

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,130
- Hey, he will take off his pants.
- You need to focus.

71
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,760
My goodness.

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,200
If you advance to the next round...

73
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,540
What?

74
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,630
(He can't believe his eyes.)

75
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,750
If you advance to the next round,
they will cast a vote again.

76
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,650
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I do.

77
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,670
The race is
called the Division Game...

78
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,540
because the winner and those who
voted for the person will...

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,480
(Giggling)

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,720
- I get it.
- divide up the money.

81
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,090
We will divide up the money.

82
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,290
Can you please stop him?

83
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,920
Please stop him.

84
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,130
- I need you to focus.
- Okay.

85
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,290
And you will get a prize based on
the number of coins you win.

86
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,370
So in the final...

87
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,290
What about the finals?

88
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,840
(His dance confuses
even the producer.)

89
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,500
You can just give it away.

90
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,880
- This is an important rule.
- Okay.

91
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,230
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I do.

92
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,350
There will be 100 staff members.

93
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,470
- Share the money with 100 people.
- They will take a vote.

94
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,350
The one who loses
the race will be eliminated.

95
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,170
And the winner and those who...

96
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,410
voted for the person
will share the money.

97
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,510
- This is the rule.
- I'm sorry,

98
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,910
but will he be
doing this seven times?

99
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,290
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

100
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,690
- I'm done explaining the rules.
- Okay.

101
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,250
- We're doing it with 100 people.
- And this was...

102
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,130
- the preliminary mission for today.
- I see.

103
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,160
We measured the time...

104
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,040
when you were distracted
by the dancing security guard.

105
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,100
(They measured the time when he was
distracted by the security guard.)

106
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,040
We will announce how long...

107
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,780
you stared at the security guard
as I was reading the rules to you.

108
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,720
Now you will move
to the monitoring room...

109
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,850
and watch
how the other members react.

110
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,350
This is hilarious.

111
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,960
I almost cried.

112
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,050
This is unbelievable.

113
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,550
Hello.

114
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,120
(He enters the monitoring room.)

115
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,160
My gosh.

116
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,930
That was so funny.
It was unbelievable.

117
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,400
It's hilarious.

118
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,970
I've never seen a man
who looked so sexy while dancing.

119
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,510
I mean, his pelvis came this far up.

120
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,670
He shook his hips like this.

121
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,910
I bet So Min will keep...

122
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,310
staring at him
once he takes off his shirt.

123
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,960
But the dancer might change
depending on the color they choose.

124
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,460
The color?

125
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,550
(He made a choice
before the preliminary mission.)

126
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,720
The color of the uniform?

127
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,980
(He made a choice
before the preliminary mission.)

128
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,700
(Se Chan was told to choose
a uniform when he entered the room.)

129
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,060
(Se Chan chose purple
among punk, mint, and purple.)

130
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,970
So will there be three dancers?

131
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,710
I mean, three teams?

132
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,410
Hello.

133
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,210
(In the meantime, Jae Suk
arrived early as a penalty.)

134
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,580
What?

135
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,780
- What is going on?
- Hello.

136
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,290
- What are you doing, Bo Pil?
- First,

137
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,240
choose a uniform you want.

138
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,790
- A uniform?
- Yes.

139
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,620
(If he picks purple, the dancing
security guard will enter.)

140
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,830
Well...

141
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,330
I don't like this one.

142
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,620
I'll go with either mint or pink.

143
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,100
- I want pink today.
- Pink it is.

144
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,120
Just put it there.

145
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,860
- Put it here?
- I'll get you one.

146
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,100
Okay. Pink.

147
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,410
We will have
a complicated mission today.

148
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,710
So I'll explain it to each member
before we start.

149
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,540
Please listen carefully.

150
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,650
- What is it?
- The name of today's race...

151
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,020
is The 1st Division Game.

152
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,680
We will pick the luckiest one
among the members of Running Man.

153
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,810
- The Division Game?
- Yes.

154
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,410
Then I'll be eliminated right away.

155
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,920
The last of each mission with
the worst luck will be eliminated.

156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,530
(A man with a big bag?)

157
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,200
That means a member will be
eliminated in each round.

158
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,360
The last of each mission with
the worst luck will be eliminated.

159
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,660
That means a member will be
eliminated in each round.

160
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,860
- Yes.
- And the one who survives...

161
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,580
till the end will be the winner.

162
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,450
(Rustling)

163
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,080
One member will be eliminated
after a mission in each round.

164
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,240
If you are eliminated
after a mission,

165
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,090
(He takes out a tennis racket.)

166
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,610
a penalty ball with your name
on it will be added.

167
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,680
- A penalty ball?
- Yes.

168
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,530
- The one who comes in last...
- Who is he, by the way?

169
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,160
will get an extra penalty ball.

170
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,120
- A penalty ball.
- We will draw a penalty ball...

171
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,860
at the end...

172
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,040
We will draw
a penalty ball at the end...

173
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,730
to pick a member to get a penalty.

174
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,660
- Draw a penalty ball? Okay.
- Please stay focused.

175
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,410
- Okay. I'll focus.
- You'll get an extra penalty ball,

176
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,840
but you can still take part
in the next missions.

177
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,910
- So I get an extra penalty ball?
- Yes.

178
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,520
- An extra ball in each round.
- Okay.

179
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,720
That's Mr. Tong Dance.

180
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,290
Gosh, Bo Pil.

181
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,020
That's Mr. Tong Dance.

182
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,810
Gosh, Bo Pil.

183
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,720
He's doing Mr. Tong Dance.

184
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,830
(Carried away)

185
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,900
(He can't believe what he's seeing.)

186
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,060
Please focus.
From the following missions,

187
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,830
you have to make the top three
not to get an extra penalty ball.

188
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,790
If you fail to make the top three,
you'll get an extra penalty ball.

189
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,430
- I have to make the top three.
- If you fail to do it,

190
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,140
you'll get an extra penalty ball.

191
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,040
And we have special rules
for today's race.

192
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,350
Our 100 staff members will join.

193
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,810
- Right. I saw them wearing hats.
- Exactly.

194
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,720
(Giggling)

195
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,120
- Please stop.
- If the member they voted for...

196
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,390
advances to the next round,

197
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,660
they can also survive.

198
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,920
Gosh, look at him.

199
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,290
(Struggling)

200
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
I can't focus because of him.

201
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,470
He can't do it,
but he's forcing himself.

202
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,910
The rule is important.

203
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,910
If the chosen member is eliminated,
they will be eliminated as well.

204
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,150
- Okay.
- When the next round begins,

205
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,110
they will cast a vote again.

206
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,720
Let's say you voted for Suk Jin,
and he got eliminated.

207
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,220
- Then you're out as well.
- I get it.

208
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,350
So...

209
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,290
- Then you're out as well.
- I get it.

210
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,660
- So...
- Why is he going into the bag?

211
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,790
The race is
called the Division Game...

212
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,290
because the winner
and those who voted...

213
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,970
for the person will
divide up the money.

214
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,900
What is he doing?

215
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,230
And you will get a prize based on...

216
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,430
(He can't help
but watch him struggle.)

217
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:37,930
- Darn it.
- the number of coins you win.

218
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,830
- I see.
- We prepared expensive gifts.

219
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,250
Okay. So this is like a random game.

220
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,570
There will be missions.

221
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,750
And the next round...

222
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,880
He might get hurt.

223
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,520
And the next round...

224
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,310
(He ends up turning his head again.)

225
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,580
Please stop it.

226
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,050
That's enough, sir.

227
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,360
My gosh.

228
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,400
- So you will share the money.
- Hello, Writer.

229
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,130
Yes.

230
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,960
- I nailed it.
- All right.

231
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,330
Yes. I'm going out.

232
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,270
And you will win the prize.

233
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,240
(Flustered)

234
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,800
Gosh, what was he doing?

235
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,930
What was that?

236
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,910
Why would he tell the writer
that he nailed it?

237
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,340
All right.

238
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,570
Do you understand the rules?

239
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,520
I think I do. But because of him...

240
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,840
This was
the preliminary mission for today.

241
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,680
- You picked the pink uniform today,
- I chose pink.

242
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,050
so the guy came in.

243
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,790
We measured the time
when you were distracted by him.

244
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,360
He was making a fuss
right next to me.

245
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,860
How can I not watch him?

246
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,370
I asked you to focus.

247
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,790
But he fell over and everything.
How would I not see that?

248
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,590
Please move to the monitoring room.

249
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,690
I can't believe this.

250
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,640
- How would I not watch it at all?
- Jae Suk.

251
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,380
I laughed myself to death.

252
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,910
I had someone else in the room.

253
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,510
- Who was it?
- It was a different man.

254
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,340
A security guard came in...

255
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,670
and started dancing Zero Two.

256
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,250
And he took off his shirt.

257
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,340
Right in front of me,

258
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,680
he was dancing like this.

259
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,180
You just can't help it.

260
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,360
- How would you ignore it?
- I don't know.

261
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,130
I don't understand the rules.

262
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,050
He did Mr. Tong Dance.

263
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,660
(So Min is coming next.)

264
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,050
Hello, Ji Yeon.

265
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,690
There's a camera. Hello.

266
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,900
(She says hello to the camera
even before entering the room.)

267
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,870
- Hello.
- Hello.

268
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,040
- No one's here.
- Come in.

269
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm lonely

270
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,780
I want to meet someone nice

271
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,710
- Hello.
- Today...

272
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,940
- Where's everyone?
- Pick a uniform you want.

273
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,180
- We have three?
- Yes. Pick one of the three.

274
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,210
(So Min picks a uniform
as soon as she gets in.)

275
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,550
- Well...
- Pick purple.

276
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,530
I'll pick the color I look good in.

277
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,320
Purple. I knew it.

278
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,450
I knew she'd pick it.

279
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,660
You'll see.

280
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,030
She can't get away with this.

281
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,400
We will have a complicated mission.

282
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,660
- I'll explain it to each member.
- You don't have to do that.

283
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,330
Please listen carefully.

284
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,910
And why do you have walls like that?

285
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,430
Do you think I can't see
the camera behind the wall?

286
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,800
All right. Let me explain.

287
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,340
She can't focus from the beginning.

288
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,410
The first...

289
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,020
We will pick the luckiest one
among the members of Running Man.

290
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,810
And the last of each mission...

291
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,450
(A security guard enters the room.)

292
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:12,630
And the last of each mission with
the worst luck will be eliminated.

293
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,050
Why do you have to...

294
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,360
You have to listen to it first.

295
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,090
Do you have to explain all that?

296
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,240
The last of each mission with
the worst luck will be eliminated.

297
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,330
That means a member will be
eliminated in each round.

298
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,010
- If you are eliminated...
- What?

299
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,280
(What?)

300
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,170
And the one who survives
till the end will be the winner.

301
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,210
- Please focus.
- Well...

302
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,650
What is he doing?

303
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,580
- Please focus.
- Well...

304
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,580
(He starts dancing.)

305
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,360
What is he doing? All of a sudden...

306
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,390
- If you are eliminated...
- What?

307
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,820
A penalty ball... Please focus.

308
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,490
- I mean...
- A penalty ball with your name...

309
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,530
- on it will be added.
- He's dancing.

310
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,730
- Okay.
- You will get an extra ball.

311
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,660
We will draw a penalty ball
at the end...

312
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,740
- Please explain it again.
- to pick a member to get a penalty.

313
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,540
- Can you explain it again?
- Please focus.

314
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,240
We will draw a penalty ball
to pick a member to get a penalty.

315
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,830
From the following missions,

316
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,380
you have to make the top three
not to get an extra penalty ball.

317
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,150
If you fail to make the top three,
you'll get an extra penalty ball.

318
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,440
- He's feeling hot.
- It's hot.

319
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,670
So you should try your best
to complete the missions.

320
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,990
And we have special rules
for today's race.

321
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,390
Our 100 staff members
will join the survival.

322
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,260
- A hundred staff members?
- Yes, they'll choose the member...

323
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,230
they think will survive
in each round.

324
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,550
- The chosen member...
- My gosh!

325
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,730
(Genuinely screaming)

326
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,960
What is he doing?

327
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
(She reacts loudly.)

328
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,060
- What is he doing?
- Why would he take his shirt off?

329
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,660
- I don't know.
- What are you doing?

330
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,110
- What are you doing? Gosh!
- The members will advance... Focus.

331
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,040
- Please focus on this.
- My goodness. What is he doing?

332
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Gosh. I have goosebumps.

333
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,580
- What are you doing?
- And...

334
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,680
Why did he remove his body hair?

335
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,550
- And if the member...
- What is he doing now?

336
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,550
- Please focus.
- My goodness.

337
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,050
How can I focus on
what you're saying?

338
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,290
If the member they chose
gets eliminated,

339
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,400
- So Min doesn't bother to listen.
- the staff members will...

340
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,190
I was so surprised
that I almost peed myself.

341
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,430
Why are you doing this? Gosh.

342
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,800
- It's called The Division Game...
- Who...

343
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,930
- for a reason.
- Who are you?

344
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,780
The winner and the staff members
who voted for that member...

345
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,410
will divide the prize money evenly,

346
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,150
and receive a gift
that's worth the money they won...

347
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,490
after dividing the money evenly.

348
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,490
- Do you understand?
- Wait.

349
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,680
Who...

350
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,360
- One more thing.
- He... The man... Who was he?

351
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,920
This rule briefing was
the pre-mission.

352
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,560
- No, wait.
- You chose the purple uniform.

353
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,740
And we measured the time you were
distracted by the security guard.

354
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
The measured time is your record.

355
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,570
Wait. Hold on.

356
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,570
I mean... My gosh.
He took me by surprise.

357
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,780
- You can leave now.
- I should've looked closely at him.

358
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,120
- What was that?
- So Min.

359
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,290
What was that?

360
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,750
You barely listened to him.

361
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,550
- But...
- Hey, So Min.

362
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,910
- You were amazed by his dance.
- Come on in.

363
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,550
Actually, I want to see it again.

364
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,950
- Why?
- I couldn't see it closely.

365
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,950
- You saw it closely.
- Come on. Stop lying.

366
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,000
You didn't even look at Bo Pil.

367
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,690
I saw that your eyes were open wide.

368
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,870
- Jae Suk, I was so surprised.
- I was surprised too.

369
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,460
That was shocking.

370
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,010
What could be done
if anyone picks the mint green one?

371
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,300
The mint green... Suk Jin came in.

372
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,070
He's wearing a bright color today.

373
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,810
First, please choose the color
of the team uniform.

374
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,940
This one looks better... Okay.
I pick this one.

375
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,680
- He picked the pink one.
- I chose that one. Yes.

376
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,760
The title of today's race is
The 1st Division Game.

377
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,420
I bet
he won't be able to concentrate.

378
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,050
Suk Jin is already distracted.
Look.

379
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,760
- It's called The 1st Division Game.
- The 1st Division Game.

380
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,030
We'll select the luckiest member
of Running Man.

381
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,040
(Big Nose is known
not to listen to mission rules.)

382
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,140
- Testing our luck?
- In each mission,

383
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,610
the unluckiest member
in the last place gets eliminated.

384
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,640
- The last place gets eliminated.
- The unluckiest member fails.

385
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,830
(He turns his head around.)

386
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,380
That is, one member gets eliminated
in each mission.

387
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,940
And the last member remaining
wins the race.

388
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,290
- I see.
- He's indifferent to others.

389
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,490
Each time a member gets eliminated,
a penalty ball...

390
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,490
with that member's name on it
will be added.

391
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,180
(Then Suk Jin looked at him.)

392
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,090
That means the eliminated member
gets an additional penalty ball.

393
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,290
- At the end of the race,
- Hold on a second.

394
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,190
we'll randomly pick a penalty ball
to pick the member to get a penalty.

395
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,300
(Suk Jin saw the Mr. Tong.)

396
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,700
- Who is he?
- But the last place...

397
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,040
- I couldn't hear anything.
- can play the next game.

398
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
- Wait. Can you repeat it?
- Do you understand?

399
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,620
- But from that mission,
- I mean, he...

400
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,710
if you failed to be
in the top three,

401
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,750
- you get another penalty ball.
- A penalty ball?

402
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,210
- Gosh, I didn't hear anything.
- You have to do well...

403
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,680
even after getting eliminated.

404
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,050
- We have an unusual rule this time.
- What is he doing?

405
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,860
- Hang on. I missed this part...
- All right.

406
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,260
What is he doing?
Hang on. I missed this part...

407
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,260
(Exhaling loudly)

408
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,820
He's not good at doing that dance.

409
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,270
That makes it even funnier.

410
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,140
He's hilarious.

411
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,740
Goodness.

412
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,980
- The staff members get eliminated.
- What is going on?

413
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,940
One member gets eliminated each time
until we have the winner.

414
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,910
- Do you understand?
- I couldn't hear anything.

415
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,280
- Since he came in...
- Let's move on.

416
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,310
The winner and the staff members
will divide the prize evenly.

417
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,410
(Inhaling)

418
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,580
- Since they divide...
- The winner...

419
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,290
(He starts the funniest performance
while exhaling loudly.)

420
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,230
the last member remaining...

421
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,830
- How do you expect me to focus?
- The winner...

422
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,400
He won't stop it.

423
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,660
- If...
- It's impossible to hold back.

424
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,770
(It's hard to see the intention
of his performance.)

425
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,010
- You can't hold back laughter.
- You can't.

426
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,200
- I want to see him closely.
- How can you not laugh?

427
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,780
They will receive a gift as well.

428
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,380
That is, the staff members' fate is
in your hands.

429
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,540
Please focus.

430
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,710
- How am I supposed to focus?
- Their fate is in your hands.

431
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,360
(He's too distracted
to think about the rules.)

432
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,030
- Hello? Writer, hello. Yes.
- I can't...

433
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,260
- Yes, I pulled it off.
- No one can focus despite that.

434
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,690
- That's what this game is about.
- Yes. I'm on my way.

435
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,130
- Come on. I couldn't hear anything.
- Try hard to win the race.

436
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,240
What did you say
we'll divide evenly?

437
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,540
- Gold?
- You just had a pre-mission.

438
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,770
Then the rules are fake too, right?

439
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,170
- I'm relieved.
- They're real. I'm done explaining.

440
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,800
- You're done explaining?
- You listened carefully.

441
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,380
I listened,
but I didn't understand anything.

442
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,910
(He'll play games without knowing
the rules as always.)

443
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,070
Hi, guys.

444
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,110
(Next up is Ji Hyo.)

445
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,580
- What's going on?
- Hello.

446
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,760
Hello.

447
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,290
- Ji Hyo came in.
- What's going on?

448
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,550
Why is no one else here?

449
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,230
Please choose
one of the team uniforms.

450
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,030
Should I choose one of them?

451
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,270
(We don't know anything about
the mint green uniform yet.)

452
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,200
Well... I pick the mint green color.

453
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,440
- You can leave it there.
- Okay.

454
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,670
- He didn't laugh.
- None of us chose that color.

455
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,680
- That's right.
- This is the first time.

456
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,780
- Is this the first time?
- Yes.

457
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,040
- The mint green color.
- She's the first one to pick it.

458
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,280
We're going to select
the luckiest member of Running Man.

459
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,520
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

460
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,920
In each mission, the unlucky member
in the last place...

461
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,920
(Giggling)

462
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,290
Baby, my legs hurt.

463
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,530
- Your legs hurt?
- They're a couple.

464
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,590
- They're role-playing.
- This will be funny.

465
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,090
- They're a couple?
- The member gets eliminated.

466
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,430
- One of you gets eliminated...
- Baby, my legs hurt.

467
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,700
- in each round.
- Your legs hurt?

468
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,090
- Yes.
- There's a bench here.

469
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,790
- It's a bit chilly in here.
- The last member remaining...

470
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,470
- Right?
- wins the race.

471
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,560
- Got it.
- Come here.

472
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,480
It's so warm.

473
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,710
Come here.

474
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,130
(What are they doing?)

475
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,800
- I'll make you warmer.
- I see.

476
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,980
- Come here.
- They can move on with the others.

477
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,380
They can move on with the others.

478
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,690
- They get eliminated as well.
- You're so handsome, baby.

479
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,290
- You're so pretty.
- Got it.

480
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,490
- Give me a kiss. One more time.
- Again?

481
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,820
- I bet they're not a real couple...
- Give me a kiss.

482
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,260
- They actually kissed.
- They just kissed.

483
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,560
- My gosh.
- They actually kissed.

484
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,290
- Did they actually kiss?
- They kissed.

485
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,890
Look at her. She's laughing.

486
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,060
(They're a real couple.)

487
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,300
- Give me a kiss.
- What's wrong with them?

488
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,400
- Hey. Excuse me.
- My darling.

489
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,140
- One member gets eliminated...
- Why would they do that in here?

490
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,980
- in each round.
- Baby, you made my heart flutter.

491
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,080
- The last one remaining wins.
- Are you okay?

492
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,190
Baby, that woman just looked at me.

493
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,920
That's because you're very handsome.

494
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,230
- Excuse me. This is crazy.
- She has good taste in men.

495
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,350
- It's The 1st Division Game.
- Don't look at me.

496
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,350
- What about pork cutlets?
- Pork cutlets?

497
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,170
- I love it.
- I like pork cutlets.

498
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,330
- Here you go. Open.
- Yoom. Feed me.

499
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,170
Ji Hyo won't look at them.

500
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,470
- She won't look at them.
- Exactly.

501
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,560
- She's amazing.
- She won't look at them.

502
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,780
- She's completely focused.
- She's incredible.

503
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,070
- Give me a kiss.
- Again?

504
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,800
- Give me a kiss.
- Again?

505
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,570
(Even when they kiss, she won't
turn around to look at them.)

506
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,020
- Shall we go out now?
- Okay.

507
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,610
They will divide
the prize of 100 R evenly,

508
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,750
- Baby, can you open the door?
- and receive a gift...

509
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,580
- Okay.
- that's worth the divided money.

510
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,490
- Try to win the race.
- Gosh.

511
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,460
- I don't understand a word you say.
- Do you understand?

512
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,090
No, I don't.

513
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,790
The members will be ranked
through games that require luck.

514
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,090
The unluckiest member
in the last place gets eliminated.

515
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,510
(Haha focuses on the briefing
right after glancing at him.)

516
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,570
- That is...
- It seems like a mistake at first.

517
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,630
- Up until this point.
- Right, I thought...

518
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,210
he was a real security guard.

519
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,570
- He must not know yet.
- Got it.

520
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,420
- That person wins the race.
- I see.

521
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,490
Each time a member gets eliminated,
a penalty ball...

522
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,460
Each time a member gets eliminated,
a penalty ball will be added.

523
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,650
Your phone is ringing.

524
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:10,500
At the end of the race, we'll
randomly pick one penalty ball...

525
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,270
to choose the member
to get a penalty.

526
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,270
(Haha's eyes are fixed on him.)

527
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,670
The eliminated member will
get a penalty ball,

528
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,300
but he or she will still be
in the race.

529
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,370
(He starts giggling.)

530
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,440
He's good at dancing.

531
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,250
- He's a great dancer.
- Indeed.

532
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,570
You get an additional penalty ball
if you're not in the top three.

533
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,920
Wait. What is he doing?

534
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,190
What on earth is he doing now?

535
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,340
You get an additional penalty ball
if you're not in the top three.

536
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,720
(The security guard has improved
his dance skills.)

537
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,080
- They'll vote for 1 member.
- I see. There will be 100 of them.

538
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,230
- In each round...
- What are you doing now?

539
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,730
In each round,
the staff members will choose...

540
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,930
- He must've lost his mind. Look.
- Please focus.

541
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,700
(Dancing topless)

542
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,510
If the member they chose...

543
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,900
- He's good. You can't ignore him.
- He's good, indeed.

544
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,400
He's really good.

545
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,210
- He's so good.
- He looks like...

546
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,710
He looks like a gymnast.

547
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,020
He looks like someone I know.

548
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,950
They survive as well.

549
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,250
- He removed his body hair.
- Likewise,

550
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,290
those who chose the eliminated
member get eliminated too.

551
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,690
Look how thin his waist is.
So Min will get so excited.

552
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,380
That member wins the race.

553
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,820
You should bounce
your pelvis harder.

554
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,200
I'll show you.
You should put your knees together.

555
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,560
Like this. That's good.
Yes, you're doing great.

556
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,360
(Haha even gives him feedback
without worrying about the rules.)

557
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,700
Yes, you're doing great.

558
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,630
That's it. Do you understand?

559
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,970
- I knew it.
- He'll be in the last place.

560
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,300
- Haha is doomed.
- He was watching the whole time.

561
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,480
He'll be in the last place.

562
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,010
The time you got distracted is
your record.

563
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,250
- But I heard everything.
- The longer, the worse.

564
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,310
I was listening
while looking at him.

565
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,790
- I can explain the rules to you.
- Even so...

566
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,990
I watch TV while using my phone.

567
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,050
Please move to the other room.

568
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,930
I had to respond to that
as an entertainer.

569
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,120
Please move to the other room.

570
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,000
My gosh. You have changed a lot.
That hurts my feelings.

571
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,350
Go to the other room.

572
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,170
(Bo Pil firmly asked him to leave.)

573
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,200
This is how you should do the dance.

574
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:01,010
(The orange thimble leaves
after enjoying the concert.)

575
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,780
I wonder what we'll do today.

576
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,040
(The last member Jong Kook appears.)

577
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,300
Hi, guys.

578
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,570
Gosh. What is this?

579
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,420
- Hello.
- Hi.

580
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,020
(He enters the room
with a wary look on his face.)

581
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,610
What are you doing so early?

582
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,730
- He's suspicious about everything.
- Right.

583
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,850
Hello.

584
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,260
Good morning.

585
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,390
- First...
- We're shooting later than usual.

586
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:23,200
- First, choose the color you want.
- Yes.

587
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,670
I like the mint green color. Okay.

588
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,360
- Today...
- Yes.

589
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,440
- I like the mint green color.
- The mint green color?

590
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,270
- He picked mint green?
- There's no way he knows.

591
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,060
- Today, in each mission,
- Yes.

592
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,600
the unluckiest one
in the last place...

593
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,130
- gets eliminated.
- I see.

594
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,640
Baby, aren't you cold?
I'm a little cold.

595
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,870
- I feel cold too.
- Please focus.

596
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,020
- How about we use our body heat...
- One member gets eliminated.

597
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,720
- to keep each other warm?
- Got it.

598
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,540
- Okay.
- If you get eliminated,

599
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,460
- When did you get your hair permed?
- a penalty ball...

600
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,580
- It looks beautiful.
- Yes.

601
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,150
- Really? You look so handsome.
- When you're eliminated,

602
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,320
- I got dolled up. How do I look?
- you still can play the next games.

603
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,650
You're all mine.

604
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,030
- Am I all yours?
- Yes.

605
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,500
- Then give me a kiss.
- Here.

606
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,170
(They began the kiss attack.)

607
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,270
- I see.
- I'm cold. You're cold too, right?

608
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,400
- Jong Kook won't look around.
- I'll make you warm.

609
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,860
- Yes.
- How is it?

610
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,870
You're the best.

611
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,300
- Am I the best?
- Yes.

612
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,540
- I can make you warm.
- I see.

613
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,840
- Really? How?
- Come here.

614
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,140
- Oh, I see.
- We've become one.

615
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,720
Nice. It's so warm.

616
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,420
- Baby, it's so warm.
- Really?

617
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,990
Actually,
I can make you even warmer.

618
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,930
- How?
- I have...

619
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:26,260
- a heat pad on my lap.
- Really?

620
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,760
But if I sit on your lap,

621
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,560
- you'll be too tired.
- Oh, really?

622
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,860
Come on.
You're as light as a feather.

623
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,000
- Am I as light as a feather?
- Jong Kook won't look at them.

624
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,360
- Of course, you are.
- He's holding his temper.

625
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,940
He's like a robot.

626
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,900
- He's focusing on one thing.
- That's right. He just wants...

627
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,950
- to understand the rules.
- He knows that it's a mission.

628
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,980
- He's ignoring them.
- He won't look at them.

629
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,840
- I'll kiss you as a prize.
- They'll divide the prize of 100 R.

630
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,250
- Really? Kiss me.
- I'll kiss you.

631
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,450
- Again.
- Okay.

632
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,450
(Even the kisses can't
distract him.)

633
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,020
- You'll receive a gift.
- I see.

634
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,850
- How about a human amusement ride?
- Their fate is in your hands.

635
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,850
- I see.
- Do you understand?

636
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,290
The 100 staff members...

637
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,650
- How about a human amusement ride?
- I see.

638
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,360
(The human amusement ride
performance.)

639
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,470
The 100 staff members...
They divide the prize?

640
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,940
Yes. I mean, no.

641
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,240
- Those who survived to the end.
- The ones remaining at the end.

642
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,330
Those who voted for the last place
get eliminated too.

643
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,900
- Baby.
- Try to win the race.

644
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,840
- Those who didn't...
- Yes.

645
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,140
- survive the round.
- Shall we get going now?

646
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,750
- Okay. Let's go.
- The staff members survive too.

647
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,110
- They vote in each round.
- Correct.

648
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,540
- Those who survive to the end...
- That's right.

649
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,750
- win the race.
- To the end, yes.

650
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,290
The winner and the staff members
will divide the prize.

651
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,650
- Right? I understand.
- Yes, that's correct.

652
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,820
My gosh. He's so competitive.

653
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,200
- You see...
- I won't listen anymore.

654
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,120
I wish he had picked
the Zero Two dancer.

655
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,000
- Why is he so serious about it?
- He would still be like this.

656
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,830
Can't you send the Zero Two dancer?

657
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,500
- Hi, Jong Kook.
- Hey, how could you...

658
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,040
- keep ignoring them like that?
- Jong Kook.

659
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,240
- I can't believe you.
- What?

660
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,240
- Why didn't you look at them?
- They even kissed each other.

661
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,180
- They kissed in front of you.
- They didn't fake it.

662
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,340
- I listened to him as I was told.
- You ignored them.

663
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,480
- I always listen to Bo Pil.
- Jong Kook.

664
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,840
- You're amazing.
- He said I should listen carefully.

665
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,080
- Did you understand the rules?
- Of course.

666
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,810
- I heard everything he said.
- Gosh.

667
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,460
You all heard about the rules
of today's race, right?

668
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

669
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,960
As I told you earlier,

670
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,760
today's race is called
The 1st Division Game.

671
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,260
- The 1st Division Game.
- We are going to select...

672
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,860
the luckiest member of Running Man.

673
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,240
- I see.
- There will be six missions,

674
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,090
and one member will be eliminated
in each mission.

675
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,830
The last member remaining will
win the race.

676
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,100
(The last member remaining will
win the race.)

677
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,300
But today, 100 staff members will
take part in the race as well.

678
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,710
I guess
the staff members had a poll.

679
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,840
They predicted
the result of this mission?

680
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,040
- Our records?
- Our rankings?

681
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,950
Each of the staff members will vote
for one member...

682
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,340
they think will survive the mission.

683
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,810
Oh, my. I'm excited.

684
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,990
The 100 staff members already voted
before this mission began.

685
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,190
(The 100 staff members voted
before this mission.)

686
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,730
Everyone, please gather around.

687
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,760
As you know the basic rules,

688
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,630
you have to vote for the member
you think will win before each game.

689
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,470
And put the sticker...

690
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,670
of the member you chose on your cap.

691
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,210
If Suk Jin gets eliminated
in that round,

692
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,980
those who voted for Suk Jin...

693
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,210
must take off their caps.

694
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,810
If you lied to move up,

695
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,920
it'd take too much time to wrap up.
So please follow the rule.

696
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,990
That way, some of you get eliminated
after each round,

697
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,380
and the ones remaining at the end
receive a prize.

698
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,230
You will actually receive a prize.

699
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,490
Please think wisely
when you vote for a member.

700
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,760
Thank you.

701
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,770
(So before the shoot began...)

702
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:24,060
(The 100 staff members voted for
the member to survive Round 1.)

703
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,900
Just so you know, the 100 voters
include your managers and stylists.

704
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,710
- Really?
- They're all wearing a cap.

705
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,010
They voted for one of you.

706
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,180
Many of them voted for Ji Hyo.

707
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,110
Most of them voted for Ji Hyo...

708
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,340
- Many chose Ji Hyo.
- and Jong Kook.

709
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,340
- Really?
- They're mostly lucky.

710
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,140
- Hyung In chose me.
- Really?

711
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,460
- No one chose me.
- Clearly,

712
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,460
- you don't know me.
- No one chose me either.

713
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,350
- Only one person chose me.
- No one chose me.

714
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,290
- I'll announce your records.
- Okay.

715
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,000
- Really?
- I'll announce the time...

716
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,050
- you got distracted.
- This is so funny.

717
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,120
The member who came in first
by a huge margin is Jong Kook.

718
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,620
- He didn't look at them at all.
- Ji Hyo placed second.

719
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,740
- But I looked at them many times.
- Suk Jin placed third.

720
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,400
Jae Suk placed 4th,
and Se Chan placed 5th.

721
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,040
- Se Chan must have...
- I looked at him so many times.

722
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,940
Two members are left.

723
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,180
I bet Haha is in the last place.

724
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,480
- So Min and Haha.
- It's definitely Haha.

725
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,750
Haha looked at him
longer than I did.

726
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,210
But he was so funny, you know.

727
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,220
He seemed so patient too.

728
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,250
First,
I'll announce So Min's record.

729
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,250
(So Min's record will be
revealed first.)

730
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,110
- One minute and five seconds.
- See?

731
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,190
- So Min looked at him...
- Did you keep looking at him?

732
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,350
- She made eye contact with him.
- Yes, I did.

733
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,080
You enjoyed his performance.

734
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,930
- I couldn't take my eyes off him.
- I knew she'd do that.

735
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,760
Next up is Haha.

736
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,240
One minute and 27 seconds.

737
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,250
- He...
- I knew it.

738
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,920
- You can say that he saw...
- He didn't even look at you.

739
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,780
- a whole performance.
- He enjoyed the performance.

740
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,020
- He didn't even look at you.
- I mean, he even...

741
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,290
- taught him how to dance.
- I want to see his dance again.

742
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,100
- Me too.
- I want to dance with him.

743
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,600
He didn't look at you
even when he walked in.

744
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,190
As a result of the mission,

745
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,430
(As a result of the mission...)

746
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,340
we have the first member
to be eliminated.

747
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,410
Hey, that's not fair.

748
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,760
- It's Haha.
- All right.

749
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,700
I'm relieved.

750
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,970
(Haha is eliminated
in the first round.)

751
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,970
- Here. Put this on your clothes.
- Oh, no. Goodbye.

752
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,420
Hey, it matches
the color of your hat.

753
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,940
- Haha is out.
- Right. Today...

754
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,210
- Your outfit is perfect.
- His shirt matches with his pants.

755
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,010
- It looks like a prison uniform.
- You look great.

756
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,560
For your information,

757
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,630
the staff members
who voted for Haha...

758
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,930
- also got eliminated.
- I'm sorry.

759
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,690
- Okay.
- Out of the 100 voters,

760
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,790
- nine people voted for Haha.
- I see.

761
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,190
- Right.
- I feel bad.

762
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,790
- So...
- I'm relieved.

763
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,870
they got eliminated from the race,
and lost the chance...

764
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,870
to win a great prize.

765
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,910
Just wait, you guys.
I'll make you win a prize.

766
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,240
We have another chance
in the next round, right?

767
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,310
- No, you're out.
- I'm out?

768
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:36,180
You got eliminated from the race,
and got a penalty ball.

769
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,710
Then can't I take part in
the next missions?

770
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,820
You can.

771
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,820
But if you're not ranked high
in each mission,

772
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,280
you'll get more penalty balls.

773
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,830
Hey, just leave the set
and cut meat at the restaurant.

774
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,990
- He's right.
- Just go and grill meat.

775
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,100
- You know...
- Get ready for the dinner rush.

776
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,220
- Score the meat, Haha.
- You should...

777
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,260
- prepare to open it.
- Right.

778
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,430
- And there's a fun fact.
- What is it?

779
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,290
Among the nine people
who voted for Haha...

780
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,960
There are Haha's staff members
Oh Young Jin and Choi Sung Woo.

781
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,930
- Obviously.
- And unexpectedly,

782
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,140
Jeon Chan Se voted for Haha too.

783
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,230
- Really?
- Chan Se?

784
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,880
- Jae Suk's manager?
- Chan Se?

785
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,910
- Jae Suk's manager.
- I like Chan Se.

786
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,180
He has a strong ego.

787
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,320
That's great.

788
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,320
- That's true.
- Chan Se.

789
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,710
So he got eliminated.

790
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,240
- Right. It serves him right.
- Did he...

791
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,590
- He didn't vote for you?
- He got what he deserves.

792
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,450
- Have some loyalty, will you?
- Gosh.

793
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,830
- It will be changed, right?
- Yes. They'll vote again.

794
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,020
Right?

795
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,400
Okay.

796
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,250
- I apologize to the nine voters.
- This is fun.

797
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,670
I'm sorry.

798
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,490
The first mission is over.

799
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,600
Those of you who got eliminated,
please take off your caps.

800
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,340
Vote for the second mission
and replace the sticker.

801
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,880
(The 91 voters who survived
voted for the 2nd round.)

802
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,610
(Who will be the second
to be eliminated?)

803
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,110
Everyone, please gather around.

804
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,420
(This is where The Division Game
will officially begin.)

805
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,440
What's this?

806
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,510
- It's huge.
- My gosh.

807
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,680
I like this.

808
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,480
My, look at that.

809
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,020
What is this? They did a great job.

810
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,950
(The division mansion)

811
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,290
My, this is huge.

812
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,290
I'm impressed.

813
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,290
(The division mansion)

814
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,170
They all voted for Jong Kook.

815
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,670
- I don't see my name.
- They all voted for Jong Kook...

816
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,930
or Ji Hyo.

817
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:04,000
So Min, none of them chose us.

818
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,410
- Hey, how could you?
- They all voted for him.

819
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,570
- So Min.
- I see a few...

820
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,810
- Come here. Let's be partners.
- Let me check.

821
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,940
- Let me check.
- Mr. Kang Chan Hee.

822
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,810
- Right.
- Mr. Kang.

823
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,380
- Mr. Kang, how could you?
- You voted for him.

824
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,350
- I mean, how could he...
- My gosh, Chan Hee.

825
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,350
- Chan Hee, I thought you'd pick me.
- Look.

826
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,620
- Mr, Kang, you can't do that.
- That's unexpected.

827
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,750
- Okay.
- I'm disappointed.

828
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,830
(They're quite conscious about
the voters' decisions.)

829
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,980
I think everyone
in the managers' seats chose Ji Hyo.

830
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,520
- Look. I Re voted for her too.
- Right.

831
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,190
I Re voted for her?

832
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,430
- Are those who voted for me shy?
- You see...

833
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,030
- Why are they all hiding?
- We...

834
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,340
I see one person
who voted for Suk Jin.

835
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,690
- He chose you last time as well.
- Found one.

836
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,570
- I see.
- But I think...

837
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,810
he didn't replace the sticker
because it felt like a hassle.

838
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,200
- No. You have faith in me, right?
- "Put anyone's sticker on my cap."

839
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Right?

840
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,440
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

841
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,210
You can see your stickers
everywhere in the studio.

842
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,970
You must be under a lot of pressure.

843
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,080
I feel burdened.

844
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,920
- Of course, you do.
- Oh, man.

845
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,950
- Right.
- They all chose Jong Kook...

846
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,090
- because of that cylinder.
- I agree.

847
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,280
- You see, I hope...
- There are only a few who chose me.

848
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,400
that those who voted for Jong Kook
will all be eliminated.

849
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,560
Right.
I hope you all get eliminated.

850
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,560
- That would be fun.
- Yes.

851
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,760
- I hope you all get eliminated.
- Let's not let him win.

852
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,930
- Let's get him eliminated.
- Right.

853
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:07,930
- It's possible.
- Yes.

854
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:10,410
- You never know who'll get lucky.
- That'd be so funny.

855
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,430
The second mission where the
next member will be eliminated...

856
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,140
is Luck Across the Cylinder.

857
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,880
- The cylinder?
- Luck?

858
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,000
- You all have surnames.
- Right.

859
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,080
- Surnames?
- Kim, Yang, so on and so forth.

860
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,210
There is a roulette with
your surnames...

861
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,920
written in six different languages.

862
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,120
After spinning it,

863
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,480
you will cross the cylinder
and write it on paper.

864
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,930
(Cross the cylinder
and write down the surname.)

865
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,430
You will only have
five minutes though.

866
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,950
Out of the six remaining contestants
other than the eliminated Haha,

867
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,400
the one with the worst record
will be eliminated.

868
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,930
If you get the Korean surname,
write it down in Korean.

869
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,460
- "Ji" in English.
- Yes, Ji.

870
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,670
It's in other languages too.

871
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,640
If it's one you don't recognize,
you'll have to memorize it.

872
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,970
We'll have to memorize it?

873
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,380
- What's with the cylinder though?
- Beats me.

874
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,580
It isn't as stable as you think.

875
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,040
- Must we cross it?
- Will we be eliminated if we drop?

876
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,440
No, you'll just have to try again.

877
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,850
We'll be timed.

878
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,540
In Haha's case,

879
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,820
a penalty ball won't be added
if he finishes in the top three.

880
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,980
If he doesn't,
a penalty ball will be added.

881
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,930
- But he can never win the race?
- Never.

882
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,720
- Has he already been eliminated?
- You must not be motivated.

883
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,930
Why is he even here, then?

884
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,520
- There's no pressure though.
- This isn't fun at all.

885
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,990
Just head to
the barbecue restaurant early.

886
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:14,640
My run ended because
I enjoyed the Zero Two dance.

887
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,340
Unbelievable. Where did he go?

888
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,460
Here we go.

889
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,810
- This...
- I wonder how challenging it'll be.

890
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,000
- It won't be easy.
- Is it unstable?

891
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,440
- If you lose your balance...
- Of course.

892
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,440
Must we write while
standing on the cylinder?

893
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,850
- That's right.
- Hold on.

894
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,240
- While standing on the cylinder?
- Yes.

895
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,180
- I'm scared, Ji Hyo.
- While on the cylinder?

896
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,480
What's that? I don't know Japanese.

897
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,590
- It's in Arabic.
- Arabic isn't easy to write.

898
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,330
We have to memorize it.

899
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,900
- We have to go back and forth.
- Jeon.

900
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,570
- Can we look at it and copy?
- This...

901
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,430
Yes, but you'll have to turn around.
If you drop, you must restart.

902
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,790
It's not as easy as it seems.

903
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,410
Can you write
while standing on the cylinder?

904
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,310
- Okay.
- How can one write while on it?

905
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,580
- Please spin the roulette.
- I'll spin it in 1, 2, 3.

906
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,410
Arabic!

907
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,970
- Arabic.
- Arabic.

908
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,680
Give her the Arabic word.

909
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,320
- The staff is just as focused.
- Arabic is perfect for So Min.

910
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,120
Arabic.

911
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,210
Give her the Arabic word.

912
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,620
The Arabic word.

913
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,160
- Please... Oh, no.
- Getting the Arabic word...

914
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,630
- It's impossible.
- Please, no.

915
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,100
- Japanese?
- No, that's too easy.

916
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,520
- She got an easy one.
- It's too easy.

917
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,930
She got an easy one.

918
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,170
You'll write the English word.

919
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,840
- Ready, get set...
- But...

920
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,230
So Min must be able
to cross the cylinder.

921
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,500
- She's not usually that lucky.
- Crossing it isn't easy.

922
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,000
- She must be able to cross it.
- Go!

923
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,970
(Go!)

924
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:30,970
All I need to do is cross it?

925
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,200
- That's it, right?
- Yes.

926
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,180
- She needs to stand to write.
- She can cross it like that.

927
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,270
That's even more dangerous.

928
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,680
Oh, no. How do I do this?

929
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,040
- Walk across it.
- She found her balance.

930
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,210
So Min, add weight to the right.

931
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,680
On your right foot.

932
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,180
Bye!

933
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,360
- Have confidence.
- This is impossible.

934
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,400
- Bye!
- So Min, you'll fall at this rate.

935
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,400
The cylinder will rotate.

936
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,930
The cylinder...

937
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,960
- It's about to rotate.
- Bye, So Min.

938
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,100
Bye!

939
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,790
Bye, So Min.

940
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,030
- Squeeze your core.
- It'll rotate.

941
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,070
- Bye!
- It's about to rotate.

942
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,500
It's funny to see her hips sway.

943
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,270
(It may be at a slow pace,
but So Min moves forward.)

944
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,410
She managed to hold on.

945
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,710
- It's a decent strategy.
- Look at her go.

946
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,240
(She's at the halfway point.)

947
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,380
- Nice.
- She's doing a good job.

948
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,890
- This is good enough.
- It'll rotate soon.

949
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,390
- Bye, So Min.
- It'll rotate.

950
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:16,450
She needs to stand up
in order to write it down.

951
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,630
- Yes, you must stand.
- Got it.

952
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,090
Got it.

953
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,020
- She'll stand at the far end.
- I'll do it on my first attempt.

954
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,160
You can't step on the platform.

955
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,960
- Bye!
- Why did you make me speak!

956
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,640
- She'll stand at the far end.
- I'll do it on my first attempt.

957
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,870
You can't step on the platform.

958
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,500
- Bye!
- Why did you make me speak!

959
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,480
- Be quiet, will you?
- Hurry and try again.

960
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,980
- It'll be impossible to stand.
- Get back here.

961
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,410
- Bye, So Min.
- She can't stand up properly.

962
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,500
Bye.

963
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,870
Those who voted for So Min...

964
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,620
can give up on winning today.

965
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,810
Don't get your hopes up.

966
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,410
- Please give up.
- You can even go home.

967
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,390
Not many seem agitated.

968
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,890
- Not many are on her side.
- There aren't many rooting for her.

969
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,830
- I was almost there.
- You should walk across it.

970
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,830
But standing...

971
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,290
- A minute has passed.
- A minute?

972
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,350
Try walking instead.

973
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,250
It's getting...

974
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,000
How about another
Zero Two dance performance?

975
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,190
- You won't make it.
- Not you.

976
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,270
You'll never make it.

977
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,730
You can't.

978
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,730
No way.

979
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,000
So Min, you should stand.

980
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,980
I bet your legs are shaking
from the idea of standing.

981
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,540
- So Min...
- Yes!

982
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,980
- Good job.
- Nice.

983
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,370
Time is ticking away.

984
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,540
What can she do?

985
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,540
So Min, just walk across it.

986
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,980
Those who voted for So Min.
Do you still have your hopes up?

987
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,790
The staff doesn't seem agitated.

988
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,660
(Tortoise Jeon won't give up.)

989
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,520
Yes, that seems like a good idea.

990
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,790
It won't be easy
since she'll have to stand.

991
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,790
Yes, she has to stand.

992
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,890
She'll have to stand in the end.

993
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,370
- It's a good plan though.
- It's not bad.

994
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,440
She has to stand up though.

995
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,810
- I can do this.
- You have to stand.

996
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:40,910
I can do this.

997
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,830
- That was fast.
- Everything else was perfect.

998
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,680
- But it's hard to stand up.
- Bye!

999
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,350
I bet you'll fall standing up.

1000
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,350
Stand up.

1001
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,440
Even if you do stand,

1002
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,940
you won't remember
how to spell your name.

1003
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,790
Of course.

1004
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,160
Should I just kill them?

1005
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,460
Stand up.

1006
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,390
Can't she grab that in front of her?

1007
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,480
You won't be able to kill us.
Do you know why?

1008
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,190
- It can't be done.
- You won't be able to stand.

1009
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,930
- You...
- Suk Jin will probably die first.

1010
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,930
(Trembling)

1011
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,230
Your legs must've given out by now.

1012
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,160
That's it, So Min. You're doing it.

1013
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,190
- You've got this.
- Now, stand.

1014
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,540
- Stand up.
- Once she shifts her weight...

1015
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,560
She'll fall in five seconds.

1016
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,730
Five.

1017
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,810
- Four.
- Four.

1018
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,870
- Three.
- Three.

1019
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,980
- Two.
- Two.

1020
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,710
- One.
- One.

1021
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,440
Bye!

1022
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,640
- One.
- One.

1023
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,020
(But...)

1024
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,540
(She managed to stand
and is now writing.)

1025
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,580
What on earth?

1026
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,890
(Frantic hand movements)

1027
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,290
- What is that?
- What are you writing?

1028
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:31,980
It's a success.

1029
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,080
I did it.

1030
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,350
It's a success.

1031
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,350
(The rise of the weakest link)

1032
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,520
J, E, O, N.

1033
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,730
It took you four minutes.

1034
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,230
Four minutes?

1035
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,290
I know what to do now.

1036
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,460
I finally know how to win.

1037
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,440
- Who's next?
- Me.

1038
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,310
Ji Hyo, who would you like
up there with you?

1039
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,310
Jong Kook, please.

1040
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,080
(She chooses Jong Kook
to hold the paint for her.)

1041
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,180
Let's do this.

1042
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,910
The words for "Song" won't be easy.

1043
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,540
Gosh, these look difficult to write.

1044
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,810
(What words must Ji Hyo
have to write?)

1045
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,250
- These are insane.
- They're difficult to write.

1046
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,750
It can't get harder than this.

1047
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,460
These aren't easy at all.

1048
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,160
- Unbelievable.
- She needs to get the Korean word.

1049
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,120
- The Korean word.
- You should spin it yourself...

1050
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,350
since these are
all difficult to write.

1051
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,190
- I have the trickiest words.
- How can one write this?

1052
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,000
The Arabic word, I mean.

1053
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,290
These are insane.

1054
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,640
Ji Hyo has spun the roulette.

1055
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,100
Please let it be the Arabic word.

1056
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,000
No way.

1057
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,440
Arabic.

1058
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,230
- Arabic.
- Arabic.

1059
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,000
Give her the Arabic word.

1060
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,870
- I think that's it.
- The Arabic word.

1061
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,620
- It's the Arabic word.
- The Arabic word!

1062
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,390
- It's the Arabic word.
- The Arabic word!

1063
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,080
You have been given the Arabic word.

1064
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,790
I won't accept it
unless it's properly written.

1065
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,830
Ji Hyo, my gosh.

1066
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,230
I bet this will be hard for you.

1067
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,250
You'll have to check it again
before you write it down.

1068
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,460
Please get ready.

1069
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,460
This is impossible.

1070
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,460
- She has to go and see again.
- How can one write that down?

1071
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,040
So Min's way is better. It's faster.

1072
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,410
You'll have to turn
and check it again.

1073
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,440
That's it. Find your balance first.

1074
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,810
Mama!

1075
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,080
(Mama!)

1076
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,480
- It's not easy, you know.
- Did she call for Jong Kook?

1077
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,640
- No, her mom.
- Her Mom.

1078
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,440
- Her mother.
- It must be his nickname.

1079
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,120
- Jong Kook's, I mean.
- As in Mama Kim?

1080
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,960
- Mama Kim.
- I must say that...

1081
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,980
Mama Song.

1082
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,390
Who did Ji Hyo name
as her ideal guy?

1083
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,620
Jong Kook.

1084
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,750
- Her?
- Jong Kook?

1085
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,190
She likes someone
who's like Winnie-the-Pooh.

1086
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,690
Yes, someone like a teddy bear.

1087
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,500
- Who likes teddy bears?
- Ji Hyo.

1088
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,140
Look how interested he is.

1089
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,160
He responded almost immediately.

1090
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,830
- Yes, like that.
- She likes someone with a belly.

1091
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:27,940
Maybe Jong Kook...

1092
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,940
will stop watching what he eats.

1093
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,680
Ji Hyo, you need to stand up now.

1094
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,080
Standing up is the hardest.

1095
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,790
That won't be easy at all.

1096
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,810
Ji Hyo, you won't be able to do it.

1097
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,710
You won't be able to stand.

1098
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,310
Is your tongue already twisted?

1099
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,250
"You won't be able to stand."

1100
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,460
Because the cylinder
will roll to the side.

1101
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,390
I'll give you 100 dollars
if you manage to stand.

1102
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,060
Then I'll receive it.

1103
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,370
He's offering you
half of what he'll earn today.

1104
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,230
Have you never been offered a raise?

1105
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,100
- All this time?
- Shouldn't he get a raise?

1106
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,870
Suk Jin has been receiving
a fixed income.

1107
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,180
They never offered me a raise.

1108
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,710
- He receives more than I expected.
- How can it still be the same?

1109
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,500
Do you even remember
how to write it?

1110
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
- She needs to see it first.
- We should let her see it.

1111
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,810
- Ji Hyo, that's my concern.
- Let her see it.

1112
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,290
- Jae Suk...
- Take a look.

1113
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,480
- Here.
- Okay.

1114
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,620
There we go.

1115
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,810
How can one memorize this?

1116
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,160
Standing up is the hardest part.

1117
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,660
Ji Hyo, time is ticking.

1118
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,190
Two minutes and 30 seconds
have passed.

1119
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,560
Place your feet first
and then stand.

1120
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,350
Women can squat low, right?

1121
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,430
Place both your feet
on the cylinder first.

1122
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:29,290
Time will run out
while you remain seated.

1123
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,330
- That would be funny.
- You won't be able to stand...

1124
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,270
since your legs aren't that strong.

1125
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,680
She's doing it.

1126
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,310
She's standing!

1127
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,250
- She's on her feet.
- Really?

1128
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,480
She'll manage it.

1129
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,080
- Look.
- She's doing it.

1130
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,480
You've got this.
Let me hold the paint for you.

1131
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,960
Make sure it's the Arabic word.

1132
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,160
- Do you have it memorized?
- Check it first.

1133
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,430
- Try copying it down.
- She's not even looking at it.

1134
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,430
No way.

1135
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,500
(Please...)

1136
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,160
- Make sure it's the Arabic word.
- Check it first.

1137
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,270
Try copying it down.

1138
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:03,000
- She's not even looking at it.
- Be certain of it.

1139
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,640
If not, they won't accept
your answer.

1140
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,210
- Ji Hyo.
- I think it's right.

1141
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,940
- It's not.
- Wait!

1142
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,080
I think it's right.

1143
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,440
(Ji Hyo has written something down.)

1144
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,100
- It's right.
- That's not for you to decide.

1145
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,440
- If you look at it...
- It seems similar enough.

1146
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,370
- There are two dots.
- Hold on a second.

1147
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,790
- I, I, C, and an L.
- She missed something.

1148
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,210
But there's something missing
up top.

1149
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,980
- Yes, this symbol.
- This.

1150
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,560
- Darn it.
- Get going.

1151
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,460
Why rush it
when it wasn't easy getting here?

1152
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,330
Why did you lose
your patience at the end?

1153
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,430
I forgot.

1154
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,100
But the time...

1155
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,270
- That's too bad.
- Five minutes.

1156
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,660
(Ji Hyo missed a stroke
and time ran out.)

1157
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,870
Your five minutes are over.

1158
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,040
- Then...
- The way I see it is...

1159
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,600
- Okay!
- Which language is this?

1160
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,660
Isn't that the Chinese character
for number eight?

1161
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,810
Haha has to finish in the top three.

1162
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,730
- The penalty ball.
- Or a penalty ball will be added.

1163
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,710
See?

1164
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,350
- Seriously?
- Darn it!

1165
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,680
Imagine an alligator
drooling over your leg.

1166
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:50,980
Is it here or here?

1167
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,020
On your left.

1168
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,980
Are you tight roping?

1169
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,390
That...

1170
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,830
- Your five minutes are up.
- It's not easy, you know.

1171
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,230
- Nice!
- How can he be so bad at this?

1172
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,330
- Tell me about it.
- Can I get one?

1173
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:01,790
- I wasn't trying to be funny.
- Is it that difficult?

1174
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,430
- Is it tricky?
- I couldn't find my balance.

1175
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,930
Seok Sam's next.

1176
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,020
- Why don't I hold his paint?
- Sure.

1177
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,290
- Get up there.
- No, wait.

1178
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,660
Jae Suk!

1179
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,960
Ji Hyo has done enough.

1180
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,270
Jae Suk, you're getting started
right away.

1181
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,730
How can I pull a prank with this?

1182
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,040
- It's impossible.
- You can't.

1183
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,100
I just can't.

1184
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,680
It's not like you can slap him
with ink on your hand.

1185
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,120
Suk Jin has to cross it though.

1186
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,250
- That's right.
- I know that.

1187
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,310
He'll be able to cross it.

1188
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,520
Ji! In Korean!

1189
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,960
- It's in Chinese.
- Nice.

1190
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
Here, Suk Jin.

1191
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,250
(Suk Jin's manager
is disappointed.)

1192
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,580
Yes! He got Chinese.

1193
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,390
- I think he'll be able to do it.
- It's a difficult letter.

1194
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,790
It's a difficult letter.

1195
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,390
- It's too...
- Let's go, Seok Sam!

1196
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,460
I thought Chinese
wouldn't be as difficult.

1197
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,460
There used to be a show called,
"Fight! Running Sunday".

1198
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,830
I know that show.

1199
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,640
- It aired on Sundays.
- That's right.

1200
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,480
- There were singers...
- That's right.

1201
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,640
who sang in the middle of the show.

1202
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,830
What's wrong with him?

1203
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:51,980
- That's right.
- They sang in the middle.

1204
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,480
(A delayed slapstick comedy
before he even began crossing it)

1205
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,810
You haven't started, have you?

1206
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,020
- I feel bad for him.
- I haven't started yet.

1207
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,410
You won't be able to get up
at the end...

1208
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,540
- because...
- This isn't easy.

1209
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,250
- Suk Jin.
- You won't be able to cross it!

1210
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,250
- You should walk instead.
- I have to walk?

1211
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,620
You won't be able to get up.

1212
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,460
- because he's not flexible.
- Get ready.

1213
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,350
- You're doing great!
- It's easier for women to get up.

1214
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,790
You're still healthy!

1215
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,230
- Here comes Suk Jin.
- Health!

1216
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:13,060
Health, blessing,
happiness, long life!

1217
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,790
- Here comes Suk Jin!
- Youth is now!

1218
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,540
Youth is...

1219
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,660
- That's it!
- Now!

1220
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,830
- Here he comes.
- Youth is Suk Jin!

1221
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,370
- You're doing great!
- That's a good idea!

1222
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,370
- Okay! Nice.
- The tteokbokki guy!

1223
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,870
(Not a chance.)

1224
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,580
YIN!

1225
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,980
- Youth is now!
- Youth is now!

1226
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,390
Success!

1227
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,480
Finally,

1228
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,580
- He will lower our standard.
- Suk Jin is playing.

1229
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,020
Some of the stylists and managers...

1230
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,460
- started watching.
- He will lower our standard.

1231
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,430
(Seok Sam's slapstick comedy
caught the audience's interest.)

1232
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,100
(Super focused)

1233
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,000
Ji Suk Jin. Who is this guy?

1234
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,960
- He's going forward!
- That's great going!

1235
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,370
To the left!

1236
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,440
To the left!

1237
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,870
This isn't working.

1238
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,040
Why don't we make a bet on this?
Will he fall on his left side?

1239
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,520
- I think he'll fall to the left.
- I agree.

1240
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,910
- I bet on the right.
- I bet on the right.

1241
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:04,910
- You know why?
- Why?

1242
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,080
Because the camera is on the left.

1243
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,540
I knew it. He's indeed amazing.

1244
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:11,660
- Suk Jin, you can do it!
- I bet on the left.

1245
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,690
Suk Jin!

1246
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:13,690
- To the left.
- To the left!

1247
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:14,890
Will he fall
on the left or right side?

1248
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,230
- Youth is...
- To the left.

1249
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,230
- He'll fall to the left.
- on this side or the other side?

1250
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:20,600
- This side?
- Let's clap for him.

1251
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,060
- I'll make it.
- It's like we're hypnotizing him.

1252
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,910
- We're hypnotizing him.
- A dad's challenge!

1253
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,140
He'll fall.

1254
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,080
(The frivolous son distracts his dad
when he's giving it a try.)

1255
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:35,910
(Cheering)

1256
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,790
(You can do it, Dad!)

1257
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,290
We're so distracting.

1258
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,690
(He decides
to lie with his face down.)

1259
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:42,850
He's trembling.

1260
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,080
- That was the left side.
- It was on the left.

1261
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,190
He fell on the left side.

1262
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,790
- How did you guys cross it?
- You can never cross it that way.

1263
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,160
How did you do it?
Did you walk across it?

1264
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,060
You've used four minutes so far.

1265
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,600
- He's already used four minutes?
- Suk Jin.

1266
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,730
- I can't even smile anymore.
- He didn't even make halfway.

1267
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:58,060
- You have 1 minute left.
- Give me 1 more minute.

1268
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,440
- What's with his pronunciation?
- What's with his pronunciation?

1269
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,330
- "Give me 1 more minute."
- "Give me 1 more minute."

1270
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,910
- "Please give me another minute."
- "Give me one more minute."

1271
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,350
"Give me one more minute."

1272
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:07,080
Suk Jin, just run across it.
Be brave.

1273
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,750
- Suk Jin.
- Just run across it.

1274
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,250
Run as you say, "Youth is now!"

1275
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,850
Imagine that your wife would die
if you fail to cross it.

1276
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,620
- You must save her.
- I bet he won't cross it.

1277
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,850
(Su Jung...)

1278
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,430
(The romantic from Jamwon-dong
runs toward his wife.)

1279
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,710
(He fails to save her.)

1280
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:35,940
That was quite cool though.

1281
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,640
I praise you for your bravery.

1282
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,140
- You have to save your wife.
- You can do it.

1283
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,480
You should've kept going.

1284
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,520
(Time's up.)

1285
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,080
You should've kept going.

1286
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,620
- He fails to save her!
- He fails!

1287
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,810
- Next player.
- Is it Jae Suk?

1288
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,250
- It's me.
- Is it?

1289
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,290
It's Yang Ssaebssaeb.

1290
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:51,750
- It must be in Arabic.
- Yang!

1291
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,120
- Arabic.
- It must be in Arabic.

1292
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,520
- Arabic.
- Yang!

1293
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,560
(He got Arabic.)

1294
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,290
At least it's
easier than Ji Hyo's name.

1295
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:00,500
It's Arabic.

1296
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,640
It's easier than Ji Hyo's.

1297
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,730
Get ready.

1298
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,410
- He's coming!
- That's it.

1299
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,680
I think he'll do well.

1300
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,250
(Moving forward
like he's walking on a tightrope)

1301
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:17,210
You're there, and I'm here.

1302
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,810
You're there, and I'm here!

1303
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:23,290
They're exchanging lines.

1304
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,520
You're there?

1305
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,290
I'm right here!

1306
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,000
(Drawing a heart)

1307
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,060
Hold on. Stop...

1308
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,160
Guys, I can't get a grip!

1309
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,160
I must've seen it wrong.

1310
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:38,000
- So Min is amazing.
- She is.

1311
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,710
- She's really amazing.
- She's one amazing woman.

1312
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,160
- I'm right here!
- She's amazing.

1313
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,180
- We should give her an award.
- We should.

1314
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,870
(A cheesy girlfriend who attacks
her boyfriend's mentality)

1315
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:49,350
(He quickly moves forward
with small steps.)

1316
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:50,350
He's coming.

1317
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:53,790
- He's dying to win her love.
- It's the power of love.

1318
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,250
- He's good.
- Wait.

1319
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,660
He managed to cross it.

1320
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,250
This is great. I did it.

1321
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,350
- All right.
- He crossed it. Good job.

1322
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,500
- He got it.
- How did it go again?

1323
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,250
(He'll succeed in the mission.)

1324
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,370
How did it go again?

1325
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,790
He's good.

1326
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:08,440
- All right.
- Let's see.

1327
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,270
That's it. He's doing great.

1328
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,600
- That's it. He's doing great.
- Another stroke here.

1329
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,980
- Here. I'm done.
- He balances himself well.

1330
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,180
- All right!
- Yes!

1331
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,540
He balances himself well.

1332
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,810
(He finishes it neatly.)

1333
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,180
He's good.

1334
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,870
His record is
1 minute and 40 seconds.

1335
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:25,540
(Final record:
1 minute and 40 seconds)

1336
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,020
You should join my team!

1337
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,620
(Shout out Se Chan!)

1338
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,620
- He's good.
- I might get eliminated.

1339
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:35,500
We should've watched them first
and learned the tips.

1340
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:37,850
If he makes it,
then you'll be eliminated, Suk Jin.

1341
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:39,020
Where is it? Let me see.

1342
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,230
You'd be safe
even if you just draw a dot.

1343
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:43,940
This is...

1344
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,410
- As long as you're not eliminated.
- Please spin it.

1345
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,440
- Is it his turn?
- Let's do this!

1346
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,480
(Which one does Jae Suk
have to write?)

1347
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,750
- I want to get a simple one.
- This one looks easy too.

1348
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,080
Get the Chinese letter.

1349
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,480
- The Japanese letter.
- It's the Chinese letter.

1350
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:56,370
- Get the difficult one.
- Yoo!

1351
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,680
Gosh, that'd be too easy.

1352
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,940
(He got Korean.)

1353
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,350
(It's in Korean!)

1354
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,750
(Sighing)

1355
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:06,980
This is great news

1356
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:08,790
He's happy.

1357
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:10,620
It's in Korean

1358
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:12,160
He's happy.

1359
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,730
Gosh, what an eyesore.

1360
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:17,060
- Get going!
- All right.

1361
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,600
(The reason Jae Suk
is so confident)

1362
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,270
- This is...
- How difficult must it be?

1363
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:23,580
- It looks difficult.
- Does it spin a lot?

1364
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:24,910
This is...

1365
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,480
You're good.

1366
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,640
- It looks difficult.
- It's not bad.

1367
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,680
It's doable.

1368
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,790
But you must do it well.

1369
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,520
But you did well.

1370
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,690
(He managed to cross it earlier.)

1371
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:36,480
- Get going!
- All right.

1372
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,230
(How will he do in the actual game?)

1373
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,060
How did you cross it so well?

1374
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,390
- He should cross it first.
- How did you do it so well?

1375
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:42,790
Jae Suk will cross it in no time.
He's good.

1376
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:44,730
(Going forward quickly)

1377
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:45,960
- Look at that.
- What is this?

1378
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,370
- How can he hop like that?
- He's going forward like that?

1379
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:48,960
(Showing off his skills
from his practice)

1380
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,160
The way he's moving forward
is weird.

1381
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,100
He's good. Look at that.

1382
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,100
- He's good.
- What is this?

1383
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,600
(Right then, Ssaebssaeb meddles in.)

1384
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,270
(Startled)

1385
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,250
- You can't hold on to her!
- He's falling!

1386
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,770
(He runs back quickly
after pulling a prank.)

1387
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:05,140
That was so close though.

1388
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,980
- You can't hold on to Ji Hyo.
- Don't hold on to her!

1389
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:09,410
- You can't hold on to Ji Hyo.
- Don't hold on to her!

1390
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,850
- But he ran on it earlier.
- All right, then

1391
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,230
How did you run on that?

1392
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,120
(He falls again on his own.)

1393
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,730
- I'm in trouble!
- He's in a hurry now.

1394
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,000
He's in a hurry.

1395
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,560
- He's in a hurry.
- I must hurry.

1396
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,810
- Hurry up.
- He's in a hurry.

1397
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,140
He was being playful.

1398
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,640
- Hurry up.
- He's in a hurry.

1399
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,080
Hurry up.
You should get your record.

1400
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,210
- Okay?
- That's a new stunt.

1401
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,080
This is a party!

1402
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,250
- Here comes the grasshopper!
- It's a party!

1403
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,310
- Here comes the grasshopper!
- It's a party!

1404
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,850
Keep going!

1405
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:43,480
- Here comes the grasshopper!
- Move!

1406
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,690
(The crowd is going stirred.)

1407
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,290
- Here he goes.
- Hurry up!

1408
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,980
- Let's go!
- I'm in trouble!

1409
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,520
His heart is racing!

1410
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,020
- What is this?
- He's nervous!

1411
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,730
- Will he make it?
- Let's go!

1412
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,100
- Earlier...
- No!

1413
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,940
He did well during practice.

1414
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,440
It's spinning!

1415
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,230
- The cylinder is spinning!
- It's spinning!

1416
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,000
You can't help it. It's spinning!

1417
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,730
It's spinning!

1418
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,410
It's spinning!

1419
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,850
The ink...

1420
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,850
(Drawing orchid on her face)

1421
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,390
- That was hilarious.
- Hey.

1422
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:15,020
- Look at Ji Hyo's face.
- Ji Hyo!

1423
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,750
- Ji Hyo's face is messed up.
- Ji Hyo.

1424
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,060
- Ji Hyo.
- It's not going to work.

1425
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,460
- Jae Suk!
- I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

1426
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,830
His heart is racing.

1427
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:23,660
Here's a celebratory performance!

1428
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,960
Here comes the Zero Two dance!

1429
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,460
(Celebratory performance
of the Zero Two dance)

1430
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:32,330
The Zero Two dance!

1431
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:33,600
(In the end, his legs gave way.)

1432
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,870
- Time is running.
- Here it comes.

1433
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,600
- What is she doing?
- What's wrong with you?

1434
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,620
Go ahead.

1435
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,580
(Right then, the grasshopper
gets back on his feet.)

1436
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,310
All right, now.

1437
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,580
Let's see.

1438
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,660
(He's used up most of his time
because he got nervous.)

1439
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,190
He'll make it at this rate.

1440
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:54,290
(Will he be able to overcome it?)

1441
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:56,100
But it won't be easy.

1442
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:57,560
The cylinder...

1443
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,730
(Spinning)

1444
00:49:58,730 --> 00:49:59,930
It's spinning!

1445
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,100
The cylinder...

1446
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,460
It's spinning!

1447
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,940
(He gave her a mustache.)

1448
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,870
- My goodness.
- What did Ji Hyo do wrong?

1449
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:13,540
Why is it so difficult
for you to write Yoo?

1450
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,520
- I'm so sorry.
- I might win first place.

1451
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,270
- Please stay balanced.
- Thirty seconds to go.

1452
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,440
- What?
- Thirty seconds to go.

1453
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,560
- Thirty seconds?
- Thirty seconds.

1454
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,390
- He's out of time.
- It's his last try.

1455
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,750
In the end, we'll play
rock-paper-scissors.

1456
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:26,850
I'll be able to do it this time.

1457
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,120
In the end, we'll play
rock-paper-scissors.

1458
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:31,000
- I'll be able to do it this time.
- He will.

1459
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:33,020
From what I see...

1460
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:34,940
He was close to it though.

1461
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,940
(The grasshopper got back in the
game with 30 seconds remaining.)

1462
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,660
He's in a hurry, that's why.

1463
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,000
- He still has time.
- He can do it.

1464
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,710
From what I see...

1465
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,140
He's in a hurry, that's why.

1466
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,410
You can't hold on to that!

1467
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,140
- He grabbed onto the platform.
- He grabbed it.

1468
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,750
- I got it, right?
- He did it!

1469
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,640
He did it!

1470
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,980
(He succeeds dramatically
with only 5 seconds remaining.)

1471
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,640
- We used a foul, so...
- Right.

1472
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,980
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

1473
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,020
(Jae Suk survives after
successfully finishing the mission.)

1474
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,930
The last player, Jong Kook.
You're up next.

1475
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:01,120
(The last player, Jong Kook)

1476
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,430
It looked quite hard.

1477
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,290
It's Jong Kook again.

1478
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,660
- Jong Kook is going to win again.
- Let's go!

1479
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,000
(He's got the most support
from the staff members.)

1480
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,540
After he's done playing,
we'll have the final result.

1481
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,440
- Jong Kook will...
- You should spin the roulette.

1482
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,310
- I'll spin it now.
- It's impossible.

1483
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:20,810
I'll spin it now, Jong Kook.

1484
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:21,810
(Korean, Chinese, Japanese, English,
Greek, Arabic)

1485
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:22,940
- Here we go.
- Jong Kook...

1486
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:24,870
(They spun it.)

1487
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:26,410
The letters are rather easy.

1488
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:28,480
As long as I don't get
the Arabic letter.

1489
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,710
Let him get the Arabic letter.

1490
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,350
- They all look easy.
- All right.

1491
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:32,480
(Many staff members' fates are in
his hands. Which one will he get?)

1492
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,480
- It must be easy for him.
- Just not the Arabic letter.

1493
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,020
- It's in Chinese.
- It's Japanese.

1494
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,230
- It's Japanese.
- It's Japanese.

1495
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,620
- That's easy.
- It's Japanese.

1496
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,870
Three strokes...

1497
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:41,370
(If Jong Kook succeeds
in the mission...)

1498
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:42,500
Get ready.

1499
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,940
Does it go like this?

1500
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,410
It's this one.

1501
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,710
(The final round with everyone's
fate on the line starts.)

1502
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:50,000
- You should get going.
- I'm quite heavy.

1503
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,640
- I'm in trouble.
- You should get going to write it.

1504
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,480
- That's right. He should go.
- You should get going to write it.

1505
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,020
It's disadvantageous
for those who are heavier.

1506
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,710
It'll spin faster.

1507
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,390
- That's right. He should go.
- You should get going to write it.

1508
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:00,140
It's disadvantageous
for those who are heavier.

1509
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,540
- That's right.
- You should get going to write it.

1510
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,290
- Look at her.
- What is that?

1511
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:04,350
(What is she doing all of a sudden?)

1512
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:05,350
What are you doing?

1513
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:06,350
Is that a heartfelt message?

1514
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:08,460
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?

1515
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:10,160
What? What are you doing?

1516
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,390
"Song Ji Hyo."

1517
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:13,660
- That's...
- Hurry over and give her a hug!

1518
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,440
Hurry over and give her a hug!

1519
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,560
Run!

1520
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,960
(My goodness.)

1521
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,960
Hurry over and give her a hug!

1522
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,140
Run!

1523
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,600
(The muscular boyfriend was faltered
by the girlfriend's confession.)

1524
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,080
- That was...
- You must've gone crazy.

1525
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,980
- He got up!
- My gosh.

1526
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,540
Is this "Love Studio" or something?

1527
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,370
- Hurry over and give her a hug!
- Darn it.

1528
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:30,770
(Come here!)

1529
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:32,850
- Gosh.
- Give her a hug!

1530
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:35,190
- She's amazing.
- Come on.

1531
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,560
Everyone must've gone insane.

1532
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,350
- This is nice though.
- He's in a hurry now.

1533
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,080
- Everyone must've gone insane.
- This is nice though.

1534
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,480
- My gosh.
- He can't cross over.

1535
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,560
That's...

1536
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,500
- He's panicking.
- It's spinning a lot.

1537
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:48,370
(He falls again
after taking a few steps.)

1538
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:53,460
(Jong Kook's supporters
are stirred by his performance.)

1539
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,770
He's running out of time!

1540
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,810
- I'm in trouble.
- Jong Kook will fail!

1541
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,040
It spins so well.

1542
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,040
- I'm in first place!
- You're all eliminated.

1543
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:01,580
Those who supported Jong Kook
will be eliminated.

1544
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,180
- Get ready.
- You'll all be eliminated.

1545
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,040
- Jong Kook will be eliminated.
- It's over for him.

1546
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,410
- I'm done for.
- About 40 people...

1547
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:07,810
voted for him, right?

1548
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,060
- I almost gave up.
- Hey.

1549
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,980
- You're in second place.
- I'm in first place.

1550
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:11,980
No, you're in second place.

1551
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,430
I have a better record.

1552
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:14,790
- Let's go
- Goodness.

1553
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,250
- Let's go
- Hop.

1554
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,120
(Darn it.)

1555
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,690
- Darn it.
- Bye!

1556
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,690
(Jong Kook's supporters
are slowly turning pale.)

1557
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:25,160
Hey, Muscle, what happened?

1558
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:26,940
Muscle.

1559
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,710
- Jong Kook.
- They'll all be eliminated.

1560
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:29,770
- Jong Kook.
- Hey.

1561
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:31,480
(They're getting parched.)

1562
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,410
You can cross it
with the dance of "Loveable."

1563
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,250
- You should go fast.
- Like this.

1564
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,080
(Back when he used to move forward
with cuteness)

1565
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,810
(Will he be able to move forward,
reminding himself of those times?)

1566
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,060
I'm so proud

1567
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,060
(He fails again.)

1568
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,250
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm so proud

1569
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,790
(Even the "Loveable" dance
didn't work.)

1570
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,560
- Poor Jong Kook.
- Darn it.

1571
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,660
It's a party!

1572
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,620
We have another dropout!

1573
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,330
They'll all be eliminated
if Jong Kook gets eliminated.

1574
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:58,330
Almost two-thirds of them
will be gone.

1575
00:53:58,330 --> 00:53:59,910
- They're in panic.
- They're all stirred up.

1576
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,140
Everyone, make some noise
at the count of three.

1577
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,080
- In 1, 2, 3!
- In 1, 2, 3!

1578
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,250
- Yes!
- Gosh.

1579
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:09,140
- He's done.
- Yes!

1580
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,770
You can do it!

1581
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:12,080
- They're cheering for him now.
- They're cheering for him now.

1582
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,540
- "You can do it!"
- They're cheering for him now.

1583
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,910
- He's in a hurry.
- You got this.

1584
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:16,690
"We believed in you."

1585
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:19,190
- Four minutes passed.
- Four minutes?

1586
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:20,290
(He has only one minute.)

1587
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,290
Four minutes?

1588
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,000
Almost 30 of them
will get to go home.

1589
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,430
Hyung In is his supporter too? Okay.

1590
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,270
It's over for you.

1591
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:30,230
(In order for him to avoid
getting eliminated,)

1592
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,870
(he must reach the point
where Suk Jin touched.)

1593
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,160
No, there are about 45 of them.

1594
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,410
I can just run like this.

1595
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,770
I can just run like this.

1596
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:39,180
(A sudden sprint)

1597
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,180
What?

1598
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,540
(Impressed)

1599
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,640
What just happened?

1600
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,940
That's it. Hold her!

1601
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:48,080
(He fell right before
reaching the end point.)

1602
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:51,120
They were all disappointed.

1603
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:52,660
- They're all stirred up.
- They were all sighing.

1604
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,830
No one said anything
when I was doing it.

1605
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:55,850
(They forgot that
they're in the middle of a shoot.)

1606
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,560
Hold on.

1607
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,600
(He has only 30 seconds left.)

1608
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,890
- Here we go.
- Why don't you crawl on it?

1609
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:02,660
Jong Kook, stay calm.

1610
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:05,270
(This will be his last try.)

1611
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:08,810
(The last chance where many people's
fate is at stake)

1612
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,810
(Will he succeed this time?)

1613
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:14,180
- Why don't you crawl on it?
- Jong Kook, stay calm.

1614
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,410
Jong Kook, stay calm.

1615
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,910
(A big twist)

1616
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:24,060
(He runs out of time.)

1617
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,350
- We never know who'll win.
- He's eliminated.

1618
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:26,930
- He's eliminated.
- Jong Kook is eliminated.

1619
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:29,190
- He's eliminated.
- Okay!

1620
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:31,060
- We never know who'll win.
- He's eliminated!

1621
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,120
Come on!

1622
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:33,600
No one chose me, did they?

1623
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,930
It's a party!

1624
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:36,890
Congratulations, guys.

1625
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,640
- What do we do?
- I couldn't do it.

1626
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,560
- You couldn't.
- Everyone.

1627
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:43,440
There was a big twist.

1628
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,580
- It really is a big twist.
- Forty people got eliminated.

1629
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:47,940
- All right, then.
- Forty people got eliminated.

1630
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,910
The major shareholder, Jong Kook,

1631
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:52,690
- All right!
- got the worst record...

1632
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,350
- and got eliminated.
- How many got eliminated?

1633
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,690
Forty-two people got eliminated.

1634
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:56,890
(Forty-two people got eliminated.)

1635
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,390
(Almost half of them
got eliminated.)

1636
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,460
You can all go home now!

1637
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,660
They're all going home?

1638
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,960
- Director Kang, go home!
- They should stay.

1639
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,960
(Serves him right)

1640
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:10,370
All 42 people who voted for him,
take off your cap,

1641
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,140
and leave the chatroom.

1642
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,270
- Leave the chatroom.
- Okay!

1643
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,330
A high dividend is gone!

1644
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,680
They're throwing away their caps.

1645
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,540
This is the fun of it.

1646
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:23,040
There should be twists
to make bets fun.

1647
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,980
All right, then. Haha,

1648
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,290
you're in the lower ranking,
so you get another penalty ball.

1649
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:29,810
Jong Kook,
you get a penalty ball too.

1650
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:35,060
(The staff members who survived)

1651
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,060
Staff members, please vote
for the next round...

1652
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,890
and stick the sticker on your cap.

1653
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,230
Are they voting in every round?

1654
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,620
Of course.

1655
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,660
(They're done voting.)

1656
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,230
Gosh, I should play
with no pressure now.

1657
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,980
- I didn't know.
- As long as I don't get penalties.

1658
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,910
They're all speaking ill of you.

1659
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,180
(They're all speaking ill of you.)

1660
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,980
- Right.
- That's understandable.

1661
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,270
- They're all speaking ill of you.
- Don't you feel relieved though?

1662
00:56:57,270 --> 00:57:00,690
It'd have been better if I got
eliminated in Round Three.

1663
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:01,690
I know.

1664
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:03,580
We'll get to see who is lucky now.

1665
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,350
- It's a twist after twist.
- It all depends on luck now.

1666
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:06,750
In the next mission,

1667
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,960
you must find a clip
with the highest views...

1668
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,960
using your name.

1669
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,270
It's called the View Count of Fate.

1670
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:13,660
Using my name?

1671
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,560
The laptop in front of you...

1672
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,660
- is connected to YouTube.
- Okay.

1673
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,640
You can use your name
and any word of your choice.

1674
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,180
The member
with the lowest view count...

1675
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,680
on the first clip they find
will be eliminated.

1676
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,870
- The lowest view count?
- Yes.

1677
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:27,270
(The member with the lowest
view count will be eliminated.)

1678
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:28,680
But I can purposely choose
a specific word, right?

1679
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,810
- I can choose the word, right?
- Yes, you can.

1680
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,080
- If I...
- But it has to be...

1681
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,520
- the view count of the first clip.
- The order...

1682
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,890
Sometimes, the most recent clip
is on top,

1683
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:36,290
and it'd have only 100,000 views.

1684
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:37,620
Oh, it'll be the first clip?

1685
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,890
He said it'd be the first clip.

1686
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:41,580
For your information, we didn't
touch the setting at all.

1687
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,250
Then it'll show the result
of recent ones. It's no joke.

1688
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:46,060
I have one with a high view count.

1689
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:49,660
But all their clips
have high view counts.

1690
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:53,210
If I survived the previous round,
I'd have won this mission.

1691
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,810
I recently saw one of my clips.

1692
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,870
Gosh, I remember seeing one,
but I don't know the title.

1693
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:59,270
There's one with five million views.

1694
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:00,910
All right, then. Who'll go first?

1695
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:01,980
No one will be able to beat mine.

1696
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,180
We only get one chance?

1697
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,680
You get only one chance,
and it has to be the first clip.

1698
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,540
The thing is, the clip I want
should be on top.

1699
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,390
So Min, tell us your keyword.

1700
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:10,390
(Search)

1701
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:14,390
Jeon So Min and Ha Suk Jin's
kissing scene.

1702
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,500
All right. It's Jeon So Min
and Ha Suk Jin's kissing scene.

1703
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,500
- You must have...
- Please type it in.

1704
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,330
- seen it recently.
- No, that's not true.

1705
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,560
It has a really high view count.

1706
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,890
- Which one?
- With Ji Suk Jin...

1707
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:25,460
- With Ji Suk Jin?
- Gosh, that startled me.

1708
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,000
(A horrifying slip of the tongue)

1709
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,770
- It's with Ha Suk Jin.
- Jeon So Min and Ji Suk Jin?

1710
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:32,210
It's Jeon So Min
and Ha Suk Jin's kissing scene.

1711
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,910
- The number of views compiled.
- I said it was with Suk Jin.

1712
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,020
I remember its view count
being high.

1713
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,520
(It seems like she regularly checked
her performance as an actor.)

1714
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,410
The one with the lowest view count?

1715
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,890
- Please!
- Let me see.

1716
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,310
- We have it.
- How high is it?

1717
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,560
Please!

1718
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,830
(Ha Suk Jin and Jeon So Min's
kissing scene on a sofa)

1719
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:48,160
It has 12.07 million views.

1720
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,160
(12.07 million views)

1721
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,160
How many?

1722
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,520
(12.07 million views)

1723
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,790
(They got a clip with 10 million
views from the start.)

1724
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:54,960
It has 12.07 million views.

1725
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,560
(They got a clip with 10 million
views from the start.)

1726
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,770
I'm sorry, but none of my clips
have more than ten million views.

1727
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,040
The one on top?

1728
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,270
- Who is going next?
- Gosh.

1729
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:03,440
I'll go.

1730
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:05,600
Those with ten million views
should go first.

1731
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,640
You can't search any
unless you've seen those clips.

1732
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,080
Kim Jong Kook, Lee Su Hyun,
"Addiction."

1733
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,390
- What's that?
- I think it'll be high.

1734
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:13,540
Kim Jong Kook, Lee Su Hyun,
"Addiction."

1735
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,620
- You got it, right?
- "Addiction?"

1736
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,960
- Oh, it's a duet performance?
- It was on "Fantastic Duo."

1737
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:17,790
The one on top.

1738
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:19,620
It has 22.87 million views.

1739
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,390
- Gosh.
- Jong Kook. Who can beat that?

1740
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,120
(22.87 million views)

1741
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,120
(Gym Jong Kook leads in
first place.)

1742
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,460
- How can we beat that?
- Wait. I'm in trouble.

1743
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,790
I might end up in last place.

1744
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,460
(His clip's view count
intimidates everyone else.)

1745
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,870
How can we beat that?

1746
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,310
I'll give it a go.

1747
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,600
Do you guys look up these clips?
How do you know these things?

1748
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,040
- I...
- No one can beat his.

1749
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,870
Look up
"Song Ji Hyo, Kim Jong Kook, kiss."

1750
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:41,080
(Look up
"Song Ji Hyo, Kim Jong Kook, kiss.")

1751
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,710
I think there could be one.

1752
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,180
- Song Ji Hyo.
- You typed in Song Ji Hyuh.

1753
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,140
It says Song Ji Hyuh.
It's not "Hyuh."

1754
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:48,620
- It's not "Hyuh."
- Why did you mention it?

1755
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,980
Why did you have to mention it?

1756
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,190
Because I felt bad.
Type in Song Ji Hyo.

1757
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:53,350
Why would you feel bad?
Song Ji Hyuh...

1758
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,890
Gym Jong Kook.

1759
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:56,390
- That'd have a high view count.
- That has a high view count.

1760
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:57,390
(Ji Hyo chose Gym Jong Kook,
her cheat code.)

1761
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:59,370
- That'd have a high view count.
- That has a high view count.

1762
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,560
- The first clip.
- It should be the first clip.

1763
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,230
It has 16.01 million views.

1764
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:04,540
Right? Okay.

1765
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,560
(16.01 million views)

1766
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,560
(Ji Hyo survives.)

1767
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,640
(So Min is still in last place even
when her clip has 10 million views.)

1768
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,770
Then let me lower the standard.

1769
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:15,270
- I'll lower the standard.
- Go ahead.

1770
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:18,910
Se Chan, there should be a clip
with three million views.

1771
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:20,790
Somewhere between 3 million
to 5 million views.

1772
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:22,690
There's no clip of me
with ten million views.

1773
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,560
I don't look up my clips.

1774
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,460
- Ones that guarantee high views.
- Maybe a clip with So Min.

1775
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,460
You know how I did
collaborations with many artists.

1776
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,020
- With EXO.
- EXO.

1777
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,600
- Yoo Jae Suk and EXO or...
- That must have a high view count.

1778
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,120
I recently did something with BTS.

1779
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,430
You did something with BTS?

1780
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:37,500
They were on
"You Quiz on the Block."

1781
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,640
Right! Those clips must have
a high number of views.

1782
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,870
There could be clips
with a high number of views...

1783
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,410
- if I type in Ji Suk Jin and BTS.
- It must have a high view count.

1784
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:44,370
It's because Jin mentioned me.

1785
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:46,370
- Right.
- It went viral.

1786
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,600
- Really?
- It was really popular.

1787
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,980
Wouldn't you win first place
with clips with BTS?

1788
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,080
- You can beat everyone with that.
- Right.

1789
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,890
- This is...
- I've never met them,

1790
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:54,040
but will it count
if there's a clip about me and BTS?

1791
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,620
- Yes, it will.
- With your name alone...

1792
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:57,290
If there's no result
with those keywords...

1793
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:59,080
No matter what you type in, we'll
check the first clip's view count.

1794
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,160
No matter what I type in?

1795
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:02,620
Should I type in Bangtan Boys
or BTS?

1796
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,620
- BTS.
- Give it a try.

1797
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,770
- BTS.
- Yang Se Chan and BTS?

1798
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:07,230
- I can't wait to see it.
- Have you ever met them?

1799
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:08,370
- Sorry?
- Have you ever met them?

1800
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:09,600
- Still...
- No, never.

1801
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,660
Should I write in all caps?
There are some results.

1802
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:12,830
Yes, there is something.

1803
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:14,310
Press enter.

1804
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:16,410
- Once you press enter...
- Go ahead.

1805
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:17,680
It's a competition.

1806
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,250
(The keyword
depends entirely on BTS' fame.)

1807
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:22,210
(What will be the result
of using BTS blindly?)

1808
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:23,250
Go ahead.

1809
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,940
- Go ahead.
- It's a competition.

1810
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,250
The number is 260,000. Gosh.

1811
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,020
The number is 260,000. Gosh.

1812
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:31,410
Gosh.

1813
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,790
Gosh.

1814
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:35,060
I will beat that.

1815
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,790
- I can beat that.
- I will beat that.

1816
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:38,390
- I will just look up my own name.
- He is out.

1817
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:40,600
I will win even if I look up
"Yoo Jae Suk poop".

1818
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:43,730
- Oh, no.
- "Yoo Jae Suk poop".

1819
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:46,310
They did play a game on Running Man.

1820
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:48,060
- I can beat that.
- Suk Jin.

1821
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,080
- Any keyword will beat that.
- Seriously.

1822
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:52,250
To be honest,
I have a surefire keyword.

1823
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,440
- Use it.
- Go ahead.

1824
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,040
- Use a different keyword, Suk Jin.
- I won't use it.

1825
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,250
- All right.
- To be honest...

1826
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,580
- I won't use it.
- Go ahead.

1827
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,770
- Go ahead.
- What?

1828
01:01:58,770 --> 01:01:59,790
Here is what I will do.

1829
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,190
I will beat you
with "Ji Suk Jin BTS".

1830
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,210
Okay.

1831
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:04,350
"Ji Suk Jin BTS". Search it.

1832
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:05,520
- I will beat you with the keyword.
- Okay.

1833
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,480
You will easily beat 260,000 views.

1834
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,160
Of course. BTS.

1835
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,960
- There they are.
- There are related keywords.

1836
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,160
(There are
even two related keywords.)

1837
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,560
I will beat you
with the same keyword.

1838
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,290
- It was BTS, right?
- Yes.

1839
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:17,460
Suk Jin.

1840
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:19,540
Don't make a typo.

1841
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:20,910
What is it?

1842
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:22,500
You got it right, Suk Jin.

1843
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,310
- Take a leap of faith.
- Let's go.

1844
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:25,370
Let's go.

1845
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,270
- Hurry up.
- Let's go.

1846
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:30,440
(What will be the view count
with BTS in the keyword?)

1847
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,440
- Take a leap of faith.
- Let's go.

1848
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,520
Let's go.

1849
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:36,160
- The number is 220,000.
- It's 220,000.

1850
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:38,080
It's 220,000.

1851
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:41,190
("Yoo Yaho Takes on Modern Songs,
Shocking BTS")

1852
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,500
It's 220,000.

1853
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:43,830
It's 220,000.

1854
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,600
(Se Chan miraculously survived.)

1855
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,660
- Suk Jin.
- What was your view count?

1856
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:47,770
It was 260,000.

1857
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,730
He got fewer views than me.

1858
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:51,690
(Se Chan's supporter survived.)

1859
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:53,960
I...

1860
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,810
I shouldn't have overdone it.

1861
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,730
You should look up
"Yoo Jae Suk BTS" too.

1862
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:59,100
- You had a safe option.
- Yes.

1863
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,680
- Jae Suk.
- You had a safe option.

1864
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,540
- Why didn't you go with that?
- Just look up "Yoo Jae Suk legend".

1865
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,620
- This is the third round of BTS.
- Yes.

1866
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:07,620
"Yoo Jae Suk BTS" is
a different matter.

1867
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:09,060
I am nervous about this.

1868
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,350
- I was nervous too.
- You don't need to be nervous.

1869
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,830
- You don't need to be nervous.
- The view count is 1.74 million.

1870
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:16,960
All right.

1871
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,250
Should I do the same?

1872
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:20,600
(Suk Jin remains
at the very bottom.)

1873
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,100
Should I do the same?

1874
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,660
For the video underneath,
the view count is 12 million.

1875
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:25,460
The view count is 12 million.

1876
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:26,870
You use the topmost video.

1877
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,410
- You use the topmost video.
- We know.

1878
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:30,500
Still.

1879
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:32,440
- Here I go.
- Go.

1880
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,540
Why?

1881
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:36,080
I should use lowercase letters.

1882
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,520
- No.
- Come on.

1883
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,210
(The cowardly man
obsesses over the smallest thing.)

1884
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:41,750
- Lowercase letters.
- What's wrong with you?

1885
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,790
- Gosh.
- He is so fussy.

1886
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:46,890
Back in the day on Mnet...

1887
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:48,020
Mnet?

1888
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,060
We met.

1889
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,890
The view count is 1.11 million!
Thank goodness.

1890
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:52,960
Really?

1891
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,460
The view count is 1.11 million!
Thank goodness.

1892
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:00,000
(Suk Jin ranked at the bottom
even when he used BTS.)

1893
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:01,460
What a twist.

1894
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:04,440
Okay. With a view count of 220,000,
Suk Jin is...

1895
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:06,680
- out.
- Suk Jin is out.

1896
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:07,980
Out.

1897
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,980
He is unrelated to BTS.

1898
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:13,540
(Suk Jin's shy supporters
lament the result silently.)

1899
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:15,580
- Four supporters...
- Four. Thank you.

1900
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:17,460
- of Suk Jin are out.
- Did you survive?

1901
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,350
- Of course.
- They are still in.

1902
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:20,560
Continue to support me.

1903
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,230
- Okay.
- I will survive.

1904
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,230
I should have picked
a different keyword.

1905
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:26,600
I want to thank my four supporters.

1906
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,620
Suk Jin...

1907
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,230
Staff members, please vote.

1908
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:30,460
Thank you, everyone.

1909
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:32,140
(The 4 surviving members)

1910
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,230
So Min.

1911
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,870
- Please gather around.
- Okay.

1912
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,540
- Now comes the lunch mission.
- Okay.

1913
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:42,140
- It requires luck and mobility.
- Mobility.

1914
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,350
It's the 7 People, 7 Colors
Lunch Mission.

1915
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:45,440
What is it?

1916
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:48,190
You will pick a random color...

1917
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:51,620
and procure food of the same color
from the surrounding area.

1918
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:53,020
- The surrounding area?
- Yes.

1919
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,960
Procure it
from the surrounding area.

1920
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,350
- The surrounding area?
- Yes.

1921
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:59,390
- What?
- It isn't the color of the wrapper,

1922
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:00,620
- but the food.
- The color of the food.

1923
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:02,370
You will have that food for lunch.

1924
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:03,600
- Really?
- Yes.

1925
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:06,270
In here are seven colors.

1926
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:07,330
Take a pick.

1927
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,480
Show your color
once I blow the whistle.

1928
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:11,910
One, two, three. Show it.

1929
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:14,710
- My color is green. It's bad.
- Darn it. I got yellow.

1930
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:16,520
- Black.
- It's white. I am in trouble.

1931
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,870
- Red.
- Yellow.

1932
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,210
You can set off now.

1933
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:21,120
Green? What kind of food is green?

1934
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,690
- Pink.
- Where is black food?

1935
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:24,020
I should go to a convenience store.

1936
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:25,850
What kind of food is pink?

1937
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,290
There are many tteokbokki places.

1938
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:29,520
I will eat tteokbokki.

1939
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:31,000
I picked an easy one.

1940
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,270
I just need to get instant rice.

1941
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:34,430
My color is white.

1942
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,790
My six supporters picked well.

1943
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:37,830
You guys are the best.

1944
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:39,560
I will place first.

1945
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:41,230
(Haha)

1946
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,370
Hello.

1947
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,600
Please give me gimbap...

1948
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,180
- without slicing it.
- Gimbap? Okay.

1949
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,270
- What are my options?
- Green.

1950
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:48,850
Is there green food?

1951
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:50,120
(Suk Jin's color)

1952
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,540
What's your color?

1953
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:52,580
Black.

1954
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,390
- That's an easy one.
- What's your color?

1955
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:55,690
- Green.
- Green?

1956
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,060
What kind of food is green?

1957
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,710
Here...

1958
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:00,160
(Green food is nowhere to be found.)

1959
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,850
- Please don't slice it.
- All right.

1960
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:04,160
Thank you, sir.

1961
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,060
(Haha's gimbap is nearly ready.)

1962
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,600
- With perilla leaves,
- Perilla leaf gimbap?

1963
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,600
would you make me
perilla leaf gimbap?

1964
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:19,100
Please put the perilla leaves
outside.

1965
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,940
- The white shouldn't be showing.
- No.

1966
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,710
It needs to be green.

1967
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:24,580
- Please put them on the outside.
- Okay.

1968
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,710
On the outside.

1969
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:26,890
(Se Chan's color)

1970
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:28,620
It's blue. Doesn't this work?

1971
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:29,910
It works, right?

1972
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,410
The ice cream inside
needs to be blue.

1973
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:33,520
Does it need to be blue?

1974
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,580
(The ice cream inside
needs to be blue.)

1975
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:36,060
What kind of food is blue?

1976
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:38,730
What kind of food is yellow?

1977
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:40,060
What's that?

1978
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:43,290
"The sweet food that will sate
your curiosity". What's this?

1979
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:44,870
Is it yellow?

1980
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:46,370
Yes. It's yellowish-brown.

1981
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:49,140
So it isn't completely yellow.
Hold on.

1982
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,540
Then please put a lot of mustard
on the corn dog.

1983
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:54,100
- Mustard?
- Yes.

1984
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:55,540
Will it take long?

1985
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,640
It will take about seven minutes.

1986
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:58,940
It takes long. Seven minutes.

1987
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:01,080
Hold on. Seven minutes.

1988
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:02,480
It takes long.

1989
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,810
(While Jong Kook waits
for the corn dog,)

1990
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:07,290
(Ji Hyo looks
for a tteokbokki place.)

1991
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:11,020
(She spots a tteokbokki place.)

1992
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:14,290
(Ji Hyo's color)

1993
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:15,500
It's closed.

1994
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,140
(The restaurant is closed.)

1995
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:20,210
Is there no tteokbokki place?

1996
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:26,410
There it is.

1997
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:30,270
(She spots a sign
for a different tteokbokki place.)

1998
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,810
What? It isn't here.

1999
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:38,210
(Ji Hyo is focused on tteokbokki.)

2000
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:40,850
No way. How is there
no tteokbokki place?

2001
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:45,790
(While Ji Hyo searches
for tteokbokki)

2002
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,660
- Coming.
- A member is coming.

2003
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:54,460
(Someone enters the studio.)

2004
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:55,870
- Coming.
- A member is coming.

2005
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:59,500
(Who will place first in Round 4?)

2006
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:05,900
Is everything okay?

2007
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,340
(The man who picked pink,
Jae Suk, enters.)

2008
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:10,730
- What did you buy?
- Something pink.

2009
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:13,360
- You succeeded. You placed first.
- Okay.

2010
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,010
(He succeeded with strawberry milk.)

2011
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:16,900
Am I the first one?

2012
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:19,070
(Haha enters next.)

2013
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:20,150
It isn't sliced.

2014
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:22,250
You succeeded.

2015
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,340
(He succeeded with black gimbap.)

2016
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,780
- What's your color?
- White.

2017
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:27,150
(So Min succeeded with string cheese
and instant rice.)

2018
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:28,210
- Gosh.
- That counts.

2019
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:31,590
I thought it would be white,
but it's brown.

2020
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:33,630
- Hold on. Seven minutes.
- Please roll it...

2021
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:35,190
- so that rice doesn't show.
- It takes long.

2022
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,150
- Haha, what was your color?
- Black.

2023
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:39,360
(Now, only one more member
can survive.)

2024
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,730
- Thank you. Enjoy.
- Thank you. Take care.

2025
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:44,310
I bought it. I bought red food.

2026
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,600
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

2027
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,730
(Ji Hyo looked for tteokbokki
and Se Chan looked for blue food.)

2028
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:47,770
Does it work?

2029
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:52,210
(One of them will be eliminated.)

2030
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:57,480
(The supporters eagerly wait
for the members.)

2031
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,590
Let's go.

2032
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,140
(Which member will enter first?)

2033
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:01,390
Move.

2034
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,590
I got it. I bought red food.

2035
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:04,650
(Which member will enter first?)

2036
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,190
The man with a view count
of 260,000 did it.

2037
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:12,190
(Se Chan appears.)

2038
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:16,560
The comedian who is related to BTS
and has a view count of 260,000.

2039
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,930
- This counts, right?
- You succeeded.

2040
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:20,100
- I totally succeeded.
- Yes.

2041
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,210
(Se Chan survived thanks
to the blue candy and ice cream.)

2042
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:22,710
- In any case...
- You bought tteokbokki.

2043
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:24,600
What's your food?

2044
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,710
Here. It's red.

2045
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:29,440
All right. Ji Hyo's food counts.

2046
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:31,480
- It counts.
- Okay.

2047
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,550
(Jong Kook switched from a corn dog
to pumpkin soup.)

2048
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,060
It's perilla leaf gimbap.

2049
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:36,420
(Mr. Perilla Leaf Gimbap
arrives last.)

2050
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:37,480
Perilla leaf gimbap.

2051
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,890
- It's my favorite kind of gimbap.
- Is it?

2052
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:40,350
- Yes. I love it.
- Let's see it.

2053
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:41,390
What's that?

2054
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:42,890
I haven't had it in a while.

2055
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:45,170
- My goodness.
- It looks delicious.

2056
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:46,220
How is it?

2057
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,060
It tastes incredible.

2058
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,970
(Coughing)

2059
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,310
You are coughing.

2060
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:53,100
- It's okay.
- Thus,

2061
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,600
in Round Four,

2062
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,400
Ji Hyo got eliminated.

2063
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,570
There were 45 staff members.

2064
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,140
- This time,
- I bet many of them got eliminated.

2065
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:02,380
twelve of them got eliminated.

2066
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:03,610
(12 out of 45 people
got eliminated.)

2067
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:04,850
- That's a lot.
- Seventeen supporters.

2068
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:06,250
I have a lot of supporters now.

2069
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:08,560
- The number of my supporters rose.
- Let's do this together.

2070
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,060
- My 6 supporters, let's go.
- So 33 people remain.

2071
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:12,630
- Okay.
- That's incredible.

2072
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:15,460
It's time
for the staff members to vote.

2073
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,820
(The remaining staff members
vote for Round 5.)

2074
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:19,720
- Please gather around.
- Okay.

2075
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,170
What are these?

2076
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:25,530
There are balloons in the back too.
I bet we have to run around.

2077
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:27,770
- What are these?
- I bet we have to pop balloons.

2078
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:31,210
I really want to participate
in this game.

2079
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:33,210
What could it be?
You will participate.

2080
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:34,350
- I know,
- Of course.

2081
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:35,440
but my participation
will be meaningless.

2082
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,270
- I helped Se Chan survive.
- It won't be meaningless...

2083
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:38,980
- if you get rid of penalty balls.
- You are right.

2084
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:41,110
What was that?

2085
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:42,310
I forgot about that.

2086
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:43,560
My goodness.

2087
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,960
He got convinced so quickly.

2088
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:46,430
The next mission was submitted...

2089
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:50,260
by the frequent guest
and family member of Running Man,

2090
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:53,300
- Ha Do Kwon.
- Do Kwon?

2091
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,730
Ha Do Kwon?

2092
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:56,300
Does Do Kwon submit games too?

2093
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,730
Doesn't he have things to do?

2094
01:10:57,730 --> 01:11:00,210
He asked the production crew
to have you play this game.

2095
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:02,680
- He should have visited the show.
- He is so nosy.

2096
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:05,510
The producer put up with it
because he is nice.

2097
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,680
- Balloons are in the lobby too.
- Lobby.

2098
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:13,640
Start in the lobby
and follow the route...

2099
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,760
as you burst the balloons
of your color.

2100
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,460
- All the balloons?
- Yes.

2101
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:20,280
You need to use your hands for some
and your butts for others.

2102
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:23,020
- I see.
- In the last section,

2103
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:24,300
you will throw a dart
on the count of three.

2104
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,170
You will win if you burst
the white balloon.

2105
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,640
We will meet at the end.

2106
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,640
(You win if you burst
the white balloon.)

2107
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:32,970
- The four of you won't participate.
- Why not?

2108
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,430
(The 4 eliminated members
can't participate in the game.)

2109
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:36,840
- What?
- Instead, you will guess...

2110
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,210
the three members' rankings.

2111
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:41,380
If you guess incorrectly,
you will receive penalty balls.

2112
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:43,550
- Se Chan.
- Give us...

2113
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:44,980
- the rankings.
- Se Chan.

2114
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:47,050
Se Chan, Jae Suk, and So Min.

2115
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,590
Se Chan, Jae Suk, and zom...

2116
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:51,560
He said "Zombie".

2117
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,280
(She is like a zombie
when it comes to athletic skills.)

2118
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,650
I will pick Se Chan, Jae Suk,
and So Min as well.

2119
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:56,650
Why?

2120
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:57,800
(Se Chan, Jae Suk, and So Min)

2121
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,800
- Why? Give a different guess.
- Se Chan, Jae Suk, and So Min.

2122
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,340
Ditto.

2123
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:03,600
- But...
- How about you, Suk Jin?

2124
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,860
Our guesses should be different
in order for a competition to work.

2125
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:07,170
- All right.
- Do you think So Min will win?

2126
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,640
Jae Suk.

2127
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,210
- Jae Suk, Se Chan...
- Jae Suk, Se Chan, and So Min.

2128
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:11,270
Jae Suk, Se Chan, and So Min.

2129
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:12,770
I have to pick you. I am sorry.

2130
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:16,020
Since this is a luck-based race,

2131
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:18,090
the level of difficulty differs...

2132
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:19,610
as each color has
different numbers of balloons.

2133
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:21,180
- Really?
- You will pick a color.

2134
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:22,960
- Please pick one.
- My color is...

2135
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,150
- So Min, give me what's left.
- blue.

2136
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:26,280
The difficulty level is hard.
For goodness' sake.

2137
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,930
- Okay.
- The difficulty level is medium.

2138
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:29,000
- Okay.
- I will win.

2139
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,500
- Okay.
- We guessed perfectly.

2140
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,930
Her difficulty level is easy,
but it will go as we guessed.

2141
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:34,130
The difficulty level is medium.

2142
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:35,890
- Okay.
- Does the difficulty level differ?

2143
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:38,140
- Se Chan got medium.
- I will get penalty balls.

2144
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:40,100
- We guessed perfectly.
- Make me the winner.

2145
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,510
- How much will you pay me?
- What?

2146
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:42,770
- How much will you pay me?
- Cash.

2147
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:45,380
- I will give you 200 dollars.
- That's a lot.

2148
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:49,520
So Min offered us 200 dollars
for making us the winner.

2149
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:51,590
Don't use money like that.

2150
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:52,810
Make me the winner this once.

2151
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,920
I don't see my name anywhere.

2152
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,020
You guys are so annoying.

2153
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:00,630
You didn't think
I would survive until now, right?

2154
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:01,690
Let's go.

2155
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:03,430
I will show you.

2156
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,500
Today, I am determined.

2157
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,670
I am determined.

2158
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:09,500
I will teach them a lesson.

2159
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:11,430
It looks so much fun.

2160
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:15,640
One, two, three. Start.

2161
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,970
(He falters from the start.)

2162
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:20,570
Start.

2163
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:23,920
(So Min also falters
from the start.)

2164
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:28,390
(Se Chan gets ahead!)

2165
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:29,720
They are going.

2166
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,650
The race must have begun.

2167
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:44,000
(Se Chan is the first one
to clear the lobby.)

2168
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:46,900
(He quickly enters
the next section.)

2169
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:49,340
Hurry up. Gosh, they don't compare.

2170
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:52,710
Okay.

2171
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:55,310
They got different numbers
of balloons.

2172
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:56,350
Hurry up!

2173
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:01,650
(Jae Suk gets the hang of it
and moves on to the next section!)

2174
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:07,680
(Even with the low difficulty level,
this contestant can't win.)

2175
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:12,770
(Thank goodness
she is enjoying the race.)

2176
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:15,190
- Hurry up!
- Se Chan will place first.

2177
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:17,100
Hurry up!

2178
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,100
(Jae Suk quickly chases
after Se Chan.)

2179
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,400
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up. Run!

2180
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,770
Don't go easy on them.

2181
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:25,770
(So Min arrived late,
but she doesn't have many balloons.)

2182
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:27,310
Don't run like a fool.

2183
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:28,920
Let's go.

2184
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:31,480
All right.

2185
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:35,310
(Jae Suk continues
to chase after Se Chan.)

2186
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,350
Don't run like a fool.

2187
01:14:39,650 --> 01:14:41,020
Anything can happen.

2188
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:47,970
Good job.

2189
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:49,340
Why didn't it pop?

2190
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:51,970
(Jae Suk gets caught up by So Min
after two misses.)

2191
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:53,600
Hey, don't let So Min catch up.

2192
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:02,110
There you go.

2193
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:03,380
- Hurry up!
- Come on.

2194
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:05,440
(Will Se Chan place first?)

2195
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:08,090
(Nervous)

2196
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:13,150
(Se Chan enters the last section
with the darts.)

2197
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,100
He is bad at this.

2198
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,300
(Missing)

2199
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:19,500
(Missing again)

2200
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,890
- Hey.
- He is bad at this.

2201
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:23,860
(Se Chan struggles
with the last section.)

2202
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:25,030
Hey.

2203
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:26,430
- This is...
- Hey.

2204
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:27,510
(Se Chan's supporters
become anxious.)

2205
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:28,600
He is bad at this.

2206
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:32,710
(Jae Suk picks up the speed.)

2207
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:35,810
(Popping)

2208
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:36,880
Okay.

2209
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:38,780
(So Min's supporters wish
for an unexpected ending.)

2210
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,090
Let's go.

2211
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,420
- He is bad at this.
- Hey.

2212
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:45,430
(A balloon finally bursts!)

2213
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:46,780
- He is bad at this.
- Nice.

2214
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:48,190
Okay.

2215
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:49,820
Okay.

2216
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:50,930
(Jae Suk finally enters
the dart section!)

2217
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,690
(Will Se Chan win?
Will Jae Suk come from behind?)

2218
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:58,210
Okay.

2219
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:00,340
(Se Chan will win
once he pops the white balloon.)

2220
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,210
- Let's go.
- Anything can happen.

2221
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:05,010
- Let's go.
- Anything can happen.

2222
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:06,600
(Jae Suk gives his last spurt!)

2223
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,970
Let's go!

2224
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,250
- You punk.
- Anything can happen.

2225
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,270
Let's go.

2226
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:11,920
- So Min.
- Anything can happen.

2227
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,590
(It's hard to it the white balloon
since it's far and up high.)

2228
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:14,920
- You punk.
- Anything can happen.

2229
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,680
(It's entirely possible
to come from behind.)

2230
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:18,780
Anything can happen.

2231
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:20,350
- Let's go.
- Do it slowly.

2232
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:22,190
(Jae Suk only has
the white balloon left!)

2233
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:23,300
Anything can happen.

2234
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,430
(Jae Suk, the master hitman
is close behind.)

2235
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:27,100
- Let's go.
- Throw higher.

2236
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,530
- Anything can happen.
- Okay.

2237
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:31,190
- Throw higher.
- Anything can happen.

2238
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:33,470
(Se Chan popped the white balloon.)

2239
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:38,710
(Se Chan won Round 5
by a close margin.)

2240
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:40,900
Se Chan, you did it.

2241
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:45,640
(So Min is eliminated
because she placed last!)

2242
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:51,480
(Everyone cheers except
for a few So Min's supporters.)

2243
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:53,930
That was great.

2244
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:55,190
You scared me.

2245
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:57,100
You scared me.

2246
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,130
I was close.

2247
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:00,520
- You scared me.
- You were close.

2248
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,640
- Se Chan.
- I survived until the end.

2249
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,530
- Good job.
- You did well.

2250
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:06,230
- I was close.
- You were close.

2251
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:08,600
- I needed one more try.
- My heart almost burst.

2252
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,030
Okay. I won't get
more penalty balls.

2253
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:14,250
- Suk Jin will get a penalty ball.
- Okay.

2254
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:15,880
- Nice.
- All right.

2255
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,220
Since So Min arrived last,
she will be eliminated.

2256
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:20,590
- Okay.
- Investment is...

2257
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:21,920
- all about probability.
- Probability.

2258
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:27,020
For your information,
six people had bet on So Min.

2259
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,850
- Okay.
- Now, 27 people remain.

2260
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:31,220
- Twenty-seven.
- That's right.

2261
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,000
Se Chan's era has come.

2262
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,060
Staff members,
please vote one last time.

2263
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:37,430
Thank you, everyone.

2264
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:39,310
(The 27 staff members
have the last vote.)

2265
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:41,530
Please finish voting.

2266
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:43,270
Se Chan's era has come.

2267
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:44,940
Thank you.

2268
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,210
You never know.

2269
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:47,550
You never know what I will do.

2270
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:49,020
The last mission will determine...

2271
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:50,970
the fate of 27 staff members
and 2 cast members.

2272
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:52,310
The final round,

2273
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:55,720
the Lucky One Wins Anyway.

2274
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,760
(The Lucky One Wins Anyway)

2275
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:57,980
- It must be a random game.
- Okay.

2276
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:00,890
There will be
a roulette with 16 sections.

2277
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:02,020
(They will begin with their names
in one section each.)

2278
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:04,860
In the beginning, you will have
your name in one section.

2279
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:06,970
- I see.
- Fourteen sections will be blank.

2280
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:09,140
- Then you will spin the roulette.
- Okay.

2281
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:11,400
If your name gets picked,
you are out.

2282
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:13,730
You are out.

2283
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:16,340
But if a blank section gets picked,
you add your opponent's name.

2284
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:17,340
(But if a blank section gets picked,
you add your opponent's name.)

2285
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,640
The sections with names
will multiply.

2286
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,250
And if a name gets picked,
that person is out.

2287
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,020
- It's a random game.
- This is...

2288
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,590
(The last round
depends on luck by 100 percent.)

2289
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:26,780
It will be fun.

2290
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,960
- This will be so...
- It sounds fun.

2291
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,020
- It's a matter of luck.
- It's a random game.

2292
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:31,090
This is...

2293
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:32,590
- It might end in one go.
- Yes.

2294
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:34,890
Please place a bet.

2295
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:35,960
Raise your hand
if you think Jae Suk will win.

2296
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,220
- Jae Suk should get eliminated.
- Yes.

2297
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:41,360
I usually do badly
if the game is big.

2298
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,930
That's right.

2299
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:44,560
- That's right.
- Jae Suk.

2300
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,560
- I will tell you that.
- He does badly in a big game.

2301
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,270
I usually do badly
if the game is big.

2302
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,810
- Will you choose Se Chan?
- But Jae Suk gets big breaks.

2303
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,400
- I will choose Se Chan.
- Will you choose Se Chan?

2304
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,940
Then I will choose Jae Suk.

2305
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:55,810
- I will choose Jae Suk too.
- Go ahead.

2306
01:18:55,810 --> 01:18:57,550
- All right.
- Se Chan.

2307
01:18:57,550 --> 01:18:59,750
- Okay.
- It has to be Se Chan.

2308
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:01,810
- Let's go with Se Chan.
- I bet Se Chan will win...

2309
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:03,060
on the first try.

2310
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:04,930
- The first try.
- So Min.

2311
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:06,180
I bet Se Chan will win
on the first try.

2312
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:07,680
- In one go.
- Jae Suk, let's do this.

2313
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,720
- Se Chan.
- I think I will lose.

2314
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,360
Jae Suk thinks he will lose.

2315
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:13,470
(His voice shakes
even before the game begins.)

2316
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:15,730
- See? He is drinking water.
- I have never won in such games.

2317
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:17,270
Jae Suk won't win. I know him.

2318
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:19,640
You lose if your name gets picked.

2319
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:21,900
- I hope Jae Suk loses in one go.
- Jae Suk gets big breaks.

2320
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,400
The order is important.

2321
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,140
Play rock-paper-scissors
to decide on the order.

2322
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:26,310
- Okay.
- That's good.

2323
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:27,440
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2324
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,680
(Jae Suk won.)

2325
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:31,640
He'll win. See?
He won in rock-paper-scissors.

2326
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,180
That's right.

2327
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,060
You lose if your name gets picked.

2328
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:36,590
- Let's see.
- Hold on.

2329
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:37,850
(Jae Suk
will spin the roulette first.)

2330
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:38,890
Let's go.

2331
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:41,320
- Jae Suk, you can do it.
- Ji Hyo and...

2332
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,600
You lose if your name gets picked.

2333
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,970
- Se Chan's name will make you lose.
- I lose if my name gets picked.

2334
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:47,430
- I hope you get Se Chan's name.
- Please get Jae Suk.

2335
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:50,840
- I hope you get Se Chan's name.
- Please get Jae Suk.

2336
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:53,010
Jae Suk, you can do it.

2337
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:54,770
(Will Jae Suk get a big break?)

2338
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:56,070
Please.

2339
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:57,840
- Let's go.
- Let's see Yang Se Chan.

2340
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,070
- Let's go.
- Let's see Yang Se Chan.

2341
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,750
- I am wrong.
- Let's end it fast.

2342
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:03,220
We should see Yoo Jae Suk.

2343
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:04,850
- Let's end it fast.
- I am wrong.

2344
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:06,680
- Please give us Se Chan's name.
- Let's end it fast.

2345
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,480
- Se Chan.
- Give us Jae Suk's name.

2346
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,260
- Jae Suk. Let's end it.
- Let's end it.

2347
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:11,820
I think it will work.

2348
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:13,460
It's here.

2349
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:15,560
- This might be it.
- It's here.

2350
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,390
(Is it over on the first attempt?)

2351
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:20,600
(What?)

2352
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:22,560
I bet Jae Suk will be picked
on the first attempt.

2353
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,770
It's here.

2354
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:25,010
(It's right next to Jae Suk.)

2355
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:26,770
- That was close.
- It's here.

2356
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:28,930
That was close.

2357
01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:30,210
- It's here.
- My goodness.

2358
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,810
- That was close.
- Oh, dear.

2359
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:32,850
Isn't that it? Let's try it again.

2360
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:34,600
- That was really close.
- My gosh.

2361
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,750
- My goodness.
- That's...

2362
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:38,980
- Isn't that it? Let's try it again.
- My gosh.

2363
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:41,180
You fool, you should've gotten it.

2364
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:42,610
Jae Suk, put Se Chan's name
on a place you want.

2365
01:20:42,610 --> 01:20:44,090
- Go ahead and put it.
- That was so close.

2366
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:45,890
- It should go right next to you.
- A place you want.

2367
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,300
- That was really close.
- Right next to your name.

2368
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,930
- Should I put it here?
- No, not there.

2369
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:51,300
Jae Suk, next to your name.

2370
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,820
My gosh.

2371
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,190
It should go here.

2372
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:57,930
See? It already feels like
Jae Suk will lose.

2373
01:20:57,930 --> 01:21:00,470
- That's how it feels.
- I'm so scared.

2374
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:02,810
Things are getting heated here.

2375
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:03,810
This is amazing.

2376
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:05,770
Make some noise
if you're on Se Chan's side.

2377
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:06,770
(Shouting)

2378
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:08,750
(The supporters are absorbed
in watching the last round.)

2379
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:10,050
- Se Chan.
- It's spinning.

2380
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:11,220
Yoo Jae Suk.

2381
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:12,390
- By the way...
- Yoo Jae Suk.

2382
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:15,460
Again, I Re is...

2383
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:16,920
Does I Re have my name?

2384
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,560
Did you not pick me?

2385
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:20,280
Gosh, I Re...

2386
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,690
I Re picked me.

2387
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:23,020
I Re...

2388
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:25,360
(The managers are just as
stubborn as the members.)

2389
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,690
All right. Let's begin.
Spin the roulette again.

2390
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,560
- In 1, 2, and 3.
- It will be over.

2391
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,900
It will be over this time.

2392
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,840
It will be great
to have Jae Suk's name.

2393
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:36,930
- Right.
- My goodness.

2394
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:38,570
(Things are going well for Se Chan.
How will it go this time?)

2395
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:41,400
- No.
- This is going well.

2396
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,920
- Gosh, it went past.
- It went past.

2397
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:43,920
Put it on.

2398
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,090
Se Chan, you should put it there.

2399
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:47,350
- Here?
- Yes.

2400
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:49,280
- Yes. Put it there.
- Good. That's a good idea.

2401
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,560
- Don't be nervous.
- We should put it somewhere else.

2402
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,720
Why would you be nervous?

2403
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,460
- You can put it there next time.
- No, Jae Suk.

2404
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:55,720
- You can turn this around.
- I don't think you will lose.

2405
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,930
- Wish me good luck.
- Good luck.

2406
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,100
- We don't have many spaces left.
- All right.

2407
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,360
It might be me.

2408
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:01,600
Jae Suk's name
will be picked this time.

2409
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,100
Yoo.

2410
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:04,100
Good luck.

2411
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,710
- He has bad luck.
- Don't be nervous.

2412
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:07,270
- He's out of luck.
- It might be him.

2413
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:08,270
I don't think it will be me.

2414
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:09,430
Se Chan!

2415
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,680
Don't be nervous.

2416
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:14,640
It didn't feel right
when he spun the roulette.

2417
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,270
- This feels...
- It's here.

2418
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:18,250
- It's here.
- It's here.

2419
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:19,920
(Please...)

2420
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:21,140
- This feels...
- It's here.

2421
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:22,520
- It's here.
- It's here.

2422
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,350
(It slows down around their names.)

2423
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:27,150
- My goodness.
- It's here.

2424
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:29,720
- No.
- My goodness.

2425
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:34,170
(It is becoming a close game.)

2426
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:36,170
- Put it on there.
- This is so close.

2427
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:37,640
It's going this way.

2428
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:38,670
(Yoo Jae Suk)

2429
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:39,930
(Se Chan's name is put up.)

2430
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:41,840
Good luck, Se Chan.

2431
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,010
Let's do this!

2432
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:47,180
- Yang Se Chan!
- Yang Se Chan!

2433
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:48,940
There aren't many people.

2434
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:50,770
They are not shouting your name.

2435
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:52,090
There are only a few of them.

2436
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:54,220
- There aren't many.
- It's all right. You can still win.

2437
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:55,280
It shouldn't be over.

2438
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,350
It has to be over.

2439
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:59,460
You should get your name picked.

2440
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,460
Please.

2441
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:01,760
You should get your name picked.

2442
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,760
- Just imagine that you won.
- Please.

2443
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,000
- Please.
- Please.

2444
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,390
In 1, 2, and 3. Let's go.

2445
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:07,390
- Hey.
- Jae Suk can turn this around.

2446
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:08,600
It's done.

2447
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:10,560
It's not Jae Suk.

2448
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:12,210
Just relax. Put yourself at ease.

2449
01:23:12,210 --> 01:23:13,810
- It's coming.
- It's here.

2450
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:16,380
(The roulette slows down
around the names.)

2451
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:18,310
It's here.

2452
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:20,680
(What?)

2453
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:22,940
It's happening this time.

2454
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:25,090
- Yang Se Chan!
- It's Se Chan!

2455
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:27,280
It's happening this time.

2456
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,920
(Yang Se Chan is eliminated
in the final round.)

2457
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:32,780
- Yang Se Chan!
- It's Se Chan!

2458
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:35,560
(The 1st Division Game,
Winner Yoo Jae Suk)

2459
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:36,650
Yang Se Chan!

2460
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:38,300
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Yang Se Chan!

2461
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,720
(Shouting)

2462
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:46,710
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Yoo Jae Suk!

2463
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:48,210
(Se Chan is sadly defeated
on the verge of victory.)

2464
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:49,400
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Yoo Jae Suk!

2465
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,930
- It was just one.
- Jae Suk.

2466
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:53,010
- Yang Se Chan.
- Jae Suk, you turned this around.

2467
01:23:53,010 --> 01:23:54,380
- This is what I told you.
- I did it.

2468
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:55,640
- I did it.
- It stopped right here.

2469
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,640
- I did it.
- My goodness.

2470
01:23:57,770 --> 01:23:59,280
- Okay.
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

2471
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,350
All right.

2472
01:24:00,350 --> 01:24:01,350
(Throwing)

2473
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,920
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

2474
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:07,960
They are throwing their caps.

2475
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,600
He never won when I voted for him.

2476
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:11,890
(He never won when I voted for him.)

2477
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:13,560
Jae Suk, I will announce
the survivors.

2478
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:14,890
All right.

2479
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:16,100
(Jae Suk meets with
the supporters who believed in him.)

2480
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:18,100
- Ju Eun.
- Look at I Re.

2481
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:20,140
- Hey, I Re.
- Gosh, I Re.

2482
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:21,880
Hey, Ju Eun.

2483
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:24,210
So Suk Jin's bad luck...

2484
01:24:24,210 --> 01:24:26,250
outdid Jae Suk's bad luck.

2485
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:28,550
- I guess we lost because of me.
- Right.

2486
01:24:28,550 --> 01:24:30,180
- He is...
- This was so close.

2487
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:33,850
They are the ones
who made me who I am now.

2488
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,560
I'm sorry for all this.

2489
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:37,890
(Yoo Seon Myung, Gang Seo Rim,
Choi Ga Eun, Jang Ye Bin...)

2490
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:40,460
There were 13 supporters...

2491
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:41,800
who voted for Jae Suk.

2492
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:43,020
That's a lot.

2493
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:44,190
It's almost half.

2494
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:45,300
That was a close game.

2495
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:46,670
All right then.

2496
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:50,770
A total of 100 R are divided
by 13, so you get 7 R each.

2497
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:53,170
- Okay.
- Here are the gifts for today.

2498
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:55,180
If you get 100 R to yourself,

2499
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:56,880
you will win a gold bar of
37.5 grams.

2500
01:24:56,930 --> 01:25:00,550
With 31 to 50 R, you get designer
sneakers worth 1,000 dollars.

2501
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:04,310
With 21 to 30 R,
you get a bladeless fan.

2502
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:07,780
With 11 to 20 R,
you get the prime Korean beef set.

2503
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:10,460
Today, the winners won 7 R each.

2504
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:13,760
With 5 to 10 R,
you get the J perfume.

2505
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:16,800
So the prize that Jae Suk
and the 13 staff members...

2506
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,390
won today is...

2507
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:20,300
the J perfume.

2508
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,840
- The J perfume?
- For all of them?

2509
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,000
- Yes.
- My goodness.

2510
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,360
(Only the 13 survivors
get the high-end perfume.)

2511
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,640
Congratulations.

2512
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:26,810
Nice.

2513
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:28,680
And for those who supported me,

2514
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:31,380
- I will prepare some gifts.
- My gosh.

2515
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:34,210
Don't do that.

2516
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:36,050
- Why would you do that?
- They supported me.

2517
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:37,550
I can't get you anything.

2518
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:38,590
(I can't get you anything.)

2519
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:39,590
Now we should
draw the penalty balls.

2520
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:41,110
I will announce the numbers
of your penalty balls.

2521
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,150
Ji Suk Jin has 4.
Kim Jong Kook has 3.

2522
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:45,280
(Suk Jin: 4, Jong Kook: 3)

2523
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,520
Haha has three.

2524
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:48,890
- So Min has 2.
- I have only 2 balls.

2525
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:49,930
Se Chan and Ji Hyo have one each.

2526
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:50,930
- Okay.
- Good.

2527
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:52,190
- This is...
- If we pick Se Chan or Ji Hyo...

2528
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,390
I bet we will get So Min's name.

2529
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:55,530
- No.
- I'm glad to hear that.

2530
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:56,800
Shall we begin?

2531
01:25:57,930 --> 01:26:01,560
Who will get the penalty today?

2532
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:04,100
Let's begin.

2533
01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:06,940
- One, two...
- It can't be me.

2534
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:08,720
(Who is the member
with the worst luck?)

2535
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:09,810
- Gosh.
- I'm nervous.

2536
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:11,810
- Is it out?
- It's out.

2537
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,350
- Is it out or not?
- It's out.

2538
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:15,720
- I bet it's me.
- We have one ball.

2539
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:18,590
This is the ball
that came out afterward.

2540
01:26:19,150 --> 01:26:20,980
- It's Haha.
- Gosh, I'm relieved.

2541
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:22,130
But I still have some balls left.

2542
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:23,520
I hope it's Haha again.

2543
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,890
- I know.
- Two balls came out.

2544
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:26,890
And the one that came out first
will get the penalty.

2545
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,500
The ball that came out first is...

2546
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,390
(Suk Jin 4, Jong Kook 3, Haha 3,
So Min 2, Se Chan 1, Ji Hyo 1)

2547
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,600
- Jeon So Min.
- Yes!

2548
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:37,310
(Jeon So Min will get the penalty.)

2549
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:40,180
I can't believe this.

2550
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:44,020
(So Min had fewer balls,
but she got picked for the penalty.)

2551
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:47,250
Why? Why me?

2552
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:48,590
- Are you serious?
- Great.

2553
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:50,180
- Seriously?
- You have a good hunch.

2554
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:52,350
- Did you have two?
- You were right about this.

2555
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:54,820
Hey, Haha and...

2556
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:58,000
- Suk Jin had so many balls.
- I can't believe this.

2557
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,190
I was winning.
I was about to win the race.

2558
01:27:00,190 --> 01:27:02,030
I do have a good hunch.

2559
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:03,470
Today is Jae Suk's day.
It's your day.

2560
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:04,800
So Min, ready.

2561
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:05,900
(Today's penalty: Fresh cream bomb)

2562
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:08,010
So Min has the worst luck today.

2563
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:10,030
- She's a frog.
- The worst luck.

2564
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:12,210
After playing all the games...

2565
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:13,470
This is a mess.

2566
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:14,900
(She's getting the penalty
after playing all the games.)

2567
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:17,610
One, two, three.

2568
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:19,480
(The fresh cream is fired.)

2569
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:20,750
Okay.

2570
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:22,090
Gosh, So Min. That was amazing.

2571
01:27:22,090 --> 01:27:23,810
- Thank you.
- Look at So Min.
