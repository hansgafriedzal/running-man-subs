1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,510
(May 16, Gyeonggi-do Paju-si)

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,810
- What is this place?
- It's so quiet.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,270
It's pretty here.
Is this English Village?

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,990
- Hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,590
Why are we here?

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,780
(Three guests appear with So Min.)

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,480
(Kim Ji Young, Hong Ye Ji,
Hwang Seog Jeong, Jeon So Min)

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,230
(The four heroines of the movie
"2037" premiering on June 8.)

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,270
(Hong Ye Ji)

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,590
(Hwang Seog Jeong, Kim Ji Young)

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,000
(First time "Running Man" promotes
So Min's work)

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,910
- It's so quiet.
- I think it's okay to...

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,300
Is this English Village?

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,910
Yes, I think so.

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,150
English?

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,050
It's quiet because
they want us to speak English.

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,440
(English Village becomes quiet
as only Korean speakers are here.)

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,810
Because we must speak English.

19
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,340
That's why it's quiet.

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,220
I was here when
"Produce 48" was taken here.

21
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,380
It's a music program.

22
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,980
You're so bright Ye Ji.

23
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,400
Ye Ji you look so fragile.

24
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,090
Everyone is in a pastel tone
except me.

25
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,190
- I've been here...
- Everyone is pastel.

26
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,470
Because it's spring.

27
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,630
- I look dark.
- They did a good job here.

28
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,910
A good job.

29
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,470
- Only me.
- English...

30
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,230
English Village...
They have waiting rooms here.

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,700
- Do we have to go in?
- The waiting rooms.

32
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,000
Do we wait?

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,420
Do we go in?

34
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,420
- Ye Ji.
- One in each room?

35
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,020
Oh my, we have to go in.

36
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,750
- Really? Now?
- Everyone is inside.

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,610
See you soon. Hello.

38
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,110
Hello.

39
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,980
- Hello.
- What is this?

40
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,390
What is this?

41
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,220
We all came up together but
putting us in each room is scary.

42
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,390
Is someone coming in?

43
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,300
(The guests spend the waiting time
in their own way.)

44
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,700
(After about 20 minutes...)

45
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,340
Please gather outside.

46
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,340
(The staff asks them to gather.)

47
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,970
Do I go out?

48
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,250
(She takes some candy.)

49
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,030
What is this?

50
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,500
(What?)

51
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,270
(The youngest producer is out.)

52
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,320
What is this?

53
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,800
(Seog Jeong looks confused.)

54
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,960
Why is he here?

55
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,640
Excuse me...

56
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,010
(An unexpected acting battle against
the professional Seog Jeong)

57
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,640
- They told me to do nothing.
- Now they want us out.

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,550
They told me to stay put,
so I ate some snacks.

59
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,050
I also drank some soda.

60
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,580
Could it be poisoned?
It's not, right?

61
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,260
- I hear something weird.
- What is this?

62
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,680
Why is he smiling?

63
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,550
- Oh, my.
- What's this?

64
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,860
Seog Jeong is... Gosh.

65
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,980
(Surprised)

66
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,100
- What's this?
- What a surprise.

67
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,550
- I don't know...
- Seog Jeong...

68
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,890
You didn't beat him down, right?

69
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,360
Of course not. Why would I?

70
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,040
Police! Do not touch him.

71
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,270
(The police are here.)

72
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Police! Do not touch him.

73
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,610
- Gosh, what is this?
- What...

74
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,800
Is this the crime scene?

75
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,980
- It seems so.
- Excuse me?

76
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,080
But who are these people?

77
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,640
What were you doing
at the crime scene?

78
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,920
- We just came.
- We were just chilling.

79
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,240
But I...

80
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,890
Seog Jeong was here.

81
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,860
No, what are you doing?

82
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,420
The four of you are under arrest
as suspects.

83
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,050
- Take them!
- Yes, sir.

84
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,150
What are they doing?

85
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,700
But I clearly saw Seog Jeong...

86
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,770
But he was smiling at me.

87
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,640
I saw Seog Jeong here...

88
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,140
Was he lying there from the start?

89
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,170
Yes, he was just there.

90
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,700
What kind of situation is this?

91
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,830
Take them.

92
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,640
Hey, I know you're alive!

93
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,270
- Jong Seo!
- Take her!

94
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,380
Jong Seo!

95
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,140
(Thirty minutes after
the producer's death)

96
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,740
They told us to wear
our own clothes.

97
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,270
Today? I didn't hear that.

98
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,340
You wore what your stylist gave you.

99
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,840
- Did you really say that?
- There must have been a mistake.

100
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,180
Really? But I...

101
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,420
They told us to wear
our own clothes.

102
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,210
I just...

103
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,310
I see.

104
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,530
It might be a bit cold.

105
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,820
- No worries, I'm healthy.
- You sure?

106
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,620
Your arm has goosebumps.

107
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,530
Short sleeves are a bit cold but...

108
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,530
It's summer.
Why is the weather like this?

109
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,340
- It's not summer.
- You should wear...

110
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,540
like this normally. You look good.

111
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,740
I normally do dress like this.

112
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,700
You look good.
I like this kind of fashion.

113
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,910
Your glasses don't have lens though.

114
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,180
(No lens attack against
his fashion comment)

115
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,650
Hey...

116
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,300
- Don't do that.
- Why?

117
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,940
Why bother wear them with no lens?

118
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,940
Doesn't your wife say anything
about your glasses?

119
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,180
She says I look better without them.

120
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,810
- I see.
- Because she...

121
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,110
likes me so much.

122
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,510
- Who? Your wife?
- Yes.

123
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,660
You know nothing of her.

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,450
"Because she likes me so much."
My foot.

125
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,690
She's my number one supporter.

126
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,470
What do you feel about your wife?

127
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,300
I'm her number one supporter.

128
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,840
- Why do you suddenly go on...
- No.

129
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,560
- about your love for her on TV?
- I never lie on a TV show.

130
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,910
- I never lie...
- Suk Jin.

131
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,910
Watch some of the old episodes of
"Radio Star" and "Happy Together",

132
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,480
and see what you said
about your wife back then.

133
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,980
I didn't feel this way back then.

134
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,700
- It was different back then.
- But why...

135
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,350
- Relationships can change...
- Why is that?

136
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,480
as time goes by, right?

137
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,610
Lately, we're very happy
with each other.

138
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,180
- Do you know why?
- Why?

139
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,590
Since you've aged,

140
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,590
- Yes?
- you don't have enough energy now.

141
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,660
- You punk.
- You don't...

142
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,790
- You're wrong. I'm full of energy.
- I'm serious.

143
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,950
- You've reached the age.
- Got it?

144
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,120
- You punk.
- You know what I mean, right?

145
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,620
Men suddenly become obedient...

146
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,740
- to their wives...
- That's not true.

147
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,560
and say,
"You're the only one for me..."

148
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,360
between their mid-50s
and their early 60s.

149
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,260
- It's not that I'm obedient to her.
- He's reached that age.

150
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,200
- It applies to him.
- I realized that she'd been right.

151
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,130
- Exactly. You should've been...
- I didn't know before...

152
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,480
- nice to her before.
- that she was right.

153
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,700
- Now,
- That's how I feel now.

154
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,350
arrest Ji Suk Jin.

155
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,680
- What? Why?
- Arrest Ji Suk Jin.

156
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,590
- Suk Jin,
- I knew it.

157
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,110
you just lied to the viewers,

158
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,090
- pretending to be a romanticist.
- That's right.

159
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,880
- Yes, he's a fraud.
- I didn't lie.

160
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,550
- That's why you asked him about it.
- You're arrested for fraud.

161
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,860
- Great. But is this real?
- Why should I be arrested?

162
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,820
- Why can't you see my sincerity?
- You deserve this.

163
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,100
- This is not right!
- He deserves to be arrested.

164
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,690
- Seriously. Hey, how could you...
- He's been acting...

165
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,100
- like he's a romanticist on TV.
- Arrest him too.

166
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,540
Now, arrest Yoo Jae Suk.

167
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,700
- Why?
- Of course, you should be arrested.

168
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,760
Jae Suk,

169
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,780
you hurt your fellow entertainer's
feelings with brutal honesty.

170
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,150
(He's being arrested for hurting
his fellow entertainer's feelings.)

171
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,610
- You've been caught red-handed.
- That's ridiculous.

172
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,650
- You're arrested for assault.
- Wait. I was...

173
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,370
- He got seriously injured.
- Who?

174
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,590
Suk Jin.

175
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,720
Is stating the facts a crime?

176
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,360
- Brutal honesty is a crime.
- I mean...

177
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,050
Gosh, I'm speechless.
This is just ridiculous.

178
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,820
Hello. It's good to see you again.

179
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,860
You're dressed fashionably
as always.

180
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,100
Thank you for saying that.

181
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,970
I picked these clothes randomly.

182
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,990
I didn't pay so much attention to
my clothes today.

183
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,930
Aren't you wearing the same clothes
as Young Jin?

184
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,930
(Aren't you wearing the same clothes
as Young Jin?)

185
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,180
No, I'm not.

186
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,570
I'm wearing different shoes,
and everything else is different.

187
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,200
Why?

188
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,910
Hey, what's going on? Ouch. Hold on.

189
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:58,980
It hurts. Wait.

190
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,010
- You copied your stylist's style.
- No!

191
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,240
You're arrested for...

192
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,740
- infringement of fashion style.
- These are my clothes!

193
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,450
These are all mine!

194
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,610
- Can you make a menacing face...
- Yes.

195
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,180
- and show off your leg muscles?
- Come on.

196
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,990
Why are you making me do that?
I don't want to...

197
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,950
This is my angry face.

198
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,100
(Menacing)

199
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,900
- Jong Kook, your menacing look...
- Yes?

200
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,100
intimidates people around you,

201
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,200
and you have
an unnecessarily muscular body.

202
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,300
- Yes?
- You're arrested for disquieting.

203
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,480
What's going on?
What are you talking about?

204
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,430
Why are you arresting me?

205
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,050
We need you to write down
your personal information.

206
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,940
Be honest.

207
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,240
(She's writing down her information
as she was told.)

208
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,990
- All right. Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

209
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,810
You wrote "Song Ji Hyo" instead of
your real name, Cheon Soo Yeon.

210
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,810
You're arrested for
false entry of your name.

211
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,450
Have you lost your mind? Why... Hey.

212
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,930
Hey, I asked you about it, didn't I?

213
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,970
You didn't even answer me.
Then why are you...

214
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,400
(Screaming)

215
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,060
- What do you want?
- You're arrested.

216
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,780
Se Chan, you showed too much
of your light skin on your belly,

217
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,440
which disgusted other people. You're
arrested for disorderly conduct.

218
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,740
I was changing my clothes.
That's all.

219
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,240
Mister, what are you doing? Mister.

220
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,310
Take him away.

221
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,920
You should at least let me
put on my shirt.

222
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,920
Mister.

223
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,950
- Gosh, seriously.
- What's going on?

224
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,730
- Why can't you see my sincerity?
- No!

225
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,950
Let me just
put on my shirt properly.

226
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,230
You punk.

227
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,690
- Hey, why is this my number?
- You idiot.

228
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,950
- What does this mean?
- Hey.

229
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,490
Inmate 5623.

230
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,820
- Inmate 6666.
- It's 6666.

231
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,230
- It's an evil number.
- That's right.

232
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,040
- This number is upsetting.
- That reminds me of "The Omen."

233
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,740
- The movie "The Omen."
- Mine is 9487.

234
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,970
- "The Omen."
- Yours is 1234.

235
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,630
- He was born in 1966.
- "The Omen."

236
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,070
- Oh, right. What does this mean?
- What's yours?

237
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,180
- It's 0957.
- Mine is 0957.

238
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,700
- Were you born in 1934?
- What does 09 mean?

239
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,750
By the way, why isn't So Min here?

240
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,810
- Someone's coming. She's not here.
- What is So Min doing?

241
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,840
- She's here.
- What is going on?

242
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,660
- Please be quiet.
- Kim Ji Young is coming too.

243
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,180
- Why is So Min with them?
- Hwang Seog Jeong is here too.

244
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,550
- Seog Jeong.
- Seog Jeong.

245
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,220
- It's been a while.
- Welcome.

246
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,220
- He must be a detective.
- Hello.

247
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

248
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,090
- It's been a long time.
- Hi.

249
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,190
- Hello.
- What is that?

250
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,460
- Please come here.
- Hey!

251
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,090
- Greet us politely.
- Button up, you brat.

252
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,560
- Button up your shirt, you punk.
- Greet us.

253
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,870
Wait. So Min.

254
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,040
Hey, what are you doing?

255
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,330
- So Min.
- What's wrong with you?

256
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,780
(The problematic inmate is
walking toward Jong Kook angrily.)

257
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,680
- What's wrong with you?
- What are you doing? Why?

258
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,940
- Stop it.
- What's her problem?

259
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,920
- Why would you do that?
- So Min.

260
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,890
- How was the Grand Mint Festival?
- Great.

261
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,080
I really enjoyed it.

262
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,420
You got arrested
the day after the festival.

263
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,130
I was wrongfully arrested.

264
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,480
- I've done nothing wrong either.
- I know.

265
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,950
Suk Jin,
your inmate number is 6666.

266
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,270
- It's an evil number, you know.
- It reminds me of "The Omen."

267
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,960
He was born in 1966.

268
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,370
- My gosh. Why...
- He was born in 1966.

269
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,930
- It's the year of his birth.
- Is that true?

270
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,100
- He was born in 1966.
- Yes.

271
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,540
- Goodness gracious.
- Please be nice to him.

272
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,680
- He's the oldest entertainer.
- Why are you so surprised?

273
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,380
- Were you really born in 1966?
- Yes, he was.

274
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,150
- Please be nice to him.
- He'll turn 60 soon.

275
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,710
- Seog Jeong, how old are you?
- He's quite old.

276
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,340
- By the way, Jae Suk.
- Yes?

277
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,550
You look younger than you did...

278
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,890
- Me?
- the last time I saw you.

279
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,580
- What's with the romantic tension?
- What's going on?

280
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,660
(What's with
the romantic atmosphere?)

281
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,930
- Why is it romantic suddenly?
- Hold on a second.

282
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,030
- We don't want that.
- Why are you acting like this?

283
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,320
- I was just...
- We don't want romance.

284
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,330
- I was...
- He's married.

285
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,670
- He's married.
- We don't want any romance here.

286
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,460
- He's a married man.
- I was just surprised. That's all!

287
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,770
But he's a married man.

288
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,330
- You shouldn't flirt with him.
- Well...

289
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,330
- She's just like us.
- I won't see that.

290
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,440
- I like you, Seog Jeong.
- Why romance?

291
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,650
- I'm against it.
- He's a married man.

292
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,310
- I was taken aback too.
- Of course.

293
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,150
- That was unexpected.
- Why did you step forward?

294
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,580
- She acted coy.
- With a romantic gaze.

295
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,710
To make sure he could hear me.

296
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,050
To make sure he could hear her?

297
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,420
Seog Jeong,
your hairstyle reminds me of...

298
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,890
- an old professional wrestler.
- She looks like a warrior.

299
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,430
- The Undertaker.
- The Undertaker?

300
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,680
(The Undertaker style)

301
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,350
- Exactly.
- I agree.

302
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,560
Seog Jeong, your hair reminds me of
The Undertaker.

303
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,330
I'm serious, Seog Jeong.

304
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,670
Ye Ji, didn't you...

305
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,510
- appear on "Produce 48?"
- Yes, I did.

306
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,060
- Oh, my. I'm glad to see you here.
- "Produce 48."

307
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,300
- I appeared on "Produce 48."
- She appeared on "Produce 48."

308
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,540
- Really?
- "Produce 101?"

309
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,800
- No, it's "Produce 48."
- "Produce 84."

310
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,070
- I mean, "Produce 48." I'm sorry.
- It's "Produce 48."

311
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,070
- She said "Produce 84."
- "Produce 84?"

312
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,150
- What was your final ranking?
- I didn't know that.

313
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,570
I was eliminated in the first round.

314
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,980
- Why would you ask that?
- What's wrong with you?

315
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,210
- Why did you ask such a question?
- It's okay.

316
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,130
- You see...
- Only the winners are remembered.

317
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,220
You've crossed the line.

318
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,000
- Did I say anything about it?
- Only the winners are remembered.

319
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,590
- By Suk Jin.
- Many of those who failed...

320
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,320
- in an audition stood out later.
- Absolutely.

321
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,670
- Many of them became successful.
- That's right.

322
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,330
- He was a race starter too.
- As far as I know,

323
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,100
the four of you
filmed a movie together.

324
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,230
Can you tell us about the movie,
Seog Jeong?

325
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,600
You'll know when you watch it.

326
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,830
- What is the movie about?
- Is it about prison?

327
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,910
- Sorry?
- What's it about?

328
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,150
What do you want to know?

329
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,940
(She chuckles after asking,
"What do you want to know?")

330
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,420
- Why do you keep doing that?
- What is...

331
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,150
- with you two?
- Don't make it look romantic.

332
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,290
- What are you doing?
- I told you not to do that.

333
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,650
- We don't want that.
- What's with you two?

334
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,950
- He's a married man.
- She's making physical touch.

335
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,120
- Why did you come forward?
- Stop it!

336
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,580
- Why did you come here?
- He's a married man.

337
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,950
- What's wrong with you?
- Don't touch him.

338
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,080
Silence!

339
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,260
- Stop doing that.
- Gosh, seriously.

340
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,300
- Stop it. He's married.
- What's her problem?

341
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,930
- What's wrong with you?
- Seog Jeong.

342
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,320
- Hey.
- Listen. I...

343
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,430
If you want to stand next to him...

344
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,540
- I have my own reason.
- Why...

345
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,170
- I do have my own reason.
- What is it?

346
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,960
- I feel like crying.
- Why?

347
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,930
I haven't met a man who looked at me
so warmly in a long time.

348
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,680
- She drives me nuts.
- What are you talking about?

349
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,070
- What is her problem, really?
- I'm not joking. I mean it.

350
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,250
- You look at me so warmly.
- Do I?

351
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,120
- It touched my heart.
- I didn't know that.

352
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,950
- He looks at us like that too.
- He always does it.

353
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,130
- No other men look at me that way.
- We don't?

354
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,320
- I must say, she's so charming.
- How do we...

355
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,630
- That's why...
- My gosh.

356
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,320
Don't try to create a romance
between you and her.

357
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,300
- Don't be jealous, Suk Jin.
- She's so charming.

358
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,900
- Why would you be jealous?
- He wants to make a love triangle.

359
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,560
Why would you create a romance
between you and her?

360
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,430
- Why would you play along with it?
- Why are you jealous?

361
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,510
- Both of you are married.
- Spit it out.

362
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,200
- What's wrong with you?
- Spit it out.

363
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,040
- I just said she was charming.
- Gosh. We were trying to end it.

364
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,970
- I meant, as an actress.
- Why would he do that?

365
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,750
Seog Jeong brought us gifts.

366
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,420
- What gifts?
- That's right.

367
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,980
- I own a farm now.
- I see.

368
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,550
- For the 1st time in my life,
- The 1st plant you grew?

369
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,630
I'm growing this tree
called White Spire.

370
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,430
- Is it something to eat?
- So...

371
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,030
- I...
- Does she want us to grow it?

372
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,160
I grew these...

373
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,900
in my plastic greenhouse.

374
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,670
- Is it to eat or to grow?
- Jae Suk.

375
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,190
- You might find her phone number.
- This is...

376
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,800
- Or a wiretap.
- Check if there's her number.

377
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,060
Thank you for this, Seog Jeong.

378
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,040
- It's a valuable gift.
- Thank you, Seog Jeong.

379
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,800
Now, please tell us what we'll do
with our guests.

380
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,470
You are imprisoned
for different crimes.

381
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,940
The six of you are here
for minor offenses.

382
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,850
- We committed serious crimes.
- The four of them...

383
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,020
They committed serious crimes.

384
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,260
are the ones...

385
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,980
who were involved in the elimination
of the assistant director...

386
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,090
- that happened earlier.
- What?

387
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,130
- We found him dead.
- He was eliminated?

388
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,060
- The four of them are suspects.
- I see.

389
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,040
We got the camera footage.
We'll let you watch it.

390
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,930
It sounds like a brutal crime.

391
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,830
- Did one of them eliminate him?
- Is the assistant director dead?

392
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,910
- Yes.
- The assistant director.

393
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,700
- That's it.
- Let's watch.

394
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,700
Let's see
how the culprit eliminated him.

395
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,080
(The 4 of them came up together.)

396
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,850
What?
That's us walking up the stairs.

397
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,760
- The four of them are together.
- Yes.

398
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,590
So Min is behind everyone else.

399
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,300
- Is this man the victim?
- He's the assistant director.

400
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,770
- He's Jong Seo.
- Right. He's Jong Seo.

401
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,690
- He was on the floor.
- It's Jong Seo.

402
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,830
- When did he follow us?
- I didn't know he followed us.

403
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,410
Some time passed.

404
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,100
- Did he fall down the stairs?
- His name tag is gone.

405
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,070
- Someone ripped off his name tag.
- My gosh. What does it mean?

406
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,210
(He flopped down in the perfect spot
while acting realistically.)

407
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,310
My gosh.

408
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,080
(He flopped down in the perfect spot
while acting realistically.)

409
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,180
- My gosh.
- He's good at acting.

410
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,790
He's good at it.

411
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,790
- Did 1 of the 4 of them do that?
- But there's no clue...

412
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,030
- Who is that?
- Seog Jeong found him first.

413
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,690
When I saw her,

414
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,530
she was already there,
checking on him alone.

415
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,000
- Of course. He was unconscious.
- I think...

416
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,190
- I couldn't leave him like that.
- An alibi?

417
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,640
- Okay. For now, So Min...
- Yes.

418
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,100
- Seog Jeong came down first.
- So Min...

419
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,370
Is So Min coming down next?

420
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,880
(And a while later...)

421
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,440
- They all came down together.
- They ran into her.

422
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,280
- They ran into her.
- There could be two culprits.

423
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,970
- True.
- Maybe three of them did it.

424
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,340
- Now...
- Okay. It's So Min.

425
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,790
- I think it's So Min for now.
- We checked the camera footage...

426
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,350
and saw where the four of them went.

427
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,390
- He was eliminated after that.
- That's right.

428
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,390
- Therefore, they got arrested.
- The others...

429
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,720
You have to find the culprit
among the suspects.

430
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,430
If you find the culprit...

431
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,900
through 2 sessions of trial
until 4 p.m.,

432
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,870
you will receive a reward.

433
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:12,100
You can use it to pay your bail
to be freed and receive a prize.

434
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,380
And the culprit will get a penalty.

435
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,570
If you fail to catch the culprit,
the culprit will win the race,

436
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,680
and receive all the prizes.

437
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,810
There will be two missions
before the trial in the afternoon.

438
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,080
If you complete them successfully,

439
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,950
you'll have more people...

440
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,720
to search everywhere in the prison
before the race.

441
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,590
If you do well,
there will be more people to search,

442
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,590
which will increase the probability
of catching the culprit.

443
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,670
But if you don't,

444
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,040
you'll have fewer people
and a lower probability.

445
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,040
(Could the inmates be able to
catch the culprit?)

446
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,300
My, the weather is so beautiful.

447
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,070
- This is so nice.
- Indeed.

448
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,650
This correctional center has
good facilities, right?

449
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,880
- Yes, it's so nice.
- Indeed.

450
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,710
Since the weather is nice,
we'll do outdoor activities.

451
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,020
Outdoor prison is...

452
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,980
And you will have
a special meal today.

453
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,020
- That's great.
- Really?

454
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,420
- Really?
- That's so funny.

455
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,550
Is it product placement?

456
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,800
- The advertiser sent you some food.
- All right.

457
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,190
- I'm excited.
- That's great.

458
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,960
- Let's see what it is.
- I'm excited.

459
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,030
(The advertiser's kindness
even spread into the prison.)

460
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,190
- I'm excited.
- Look at this!

461
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,730
- What's that?
- Did they grill it?

462
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,900
- How did they grill it?
- Did they grill it?

463
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,930
How did they do it?

464
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,800
- They grilled potatoes?
- I often eat this. I like it.

465
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,070
This is my favorite.

466
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,100
- It doesn't make you so fat either.
- Look at this.

467
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,100
It's really tasty.

468
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,250
This is a new flavor.

469
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,550
- I think it's a new flavor.
- Right.

470
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,070
- It's grilled, not deep-fried.
- Oh, my.

471
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,810
So it's lower in calories.

472
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,340
- Smell the scent of sweet potato.
- Try this one.

473
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,080
- It's so good.
- All family members can enjoy it.

474
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,930
- My, it's so tasty.
- And its price is reasonable.

475
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,760
- "Texas hot barbecue."
- Try this.

476
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,060
It tastes exceptionally good
as they used steamed sweet potatoes.

477
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,530
- It's even sweeter.
- Really?

478
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,140
I can smell steamed sweet potatoes.

479
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,770
- Really?
- Yes, steamed sweet potatoes.

480
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,800
- I see.
- The scent spread in my mouth.

481
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,780
- Did it?
- It spread right away.

482
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,470
- Se Chan.
- The scent of sweet potato...

483
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,340
- Should we play the snack game?
- It's amazing.

484
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,940
Hey.

485
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,570
- She wants to play a game with me.
- Yes?

486
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,280
- Should we play the snack game?
- It's amazing.

487
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,940
Hey.

488
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,390
(She makes a move like a bulldozer.)

489
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,950
- Yes?
- Stop it, will you?

490
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,160
- Stop it.
- Gosh.

491
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,930
(She aimed at him
without a warning.)

492
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,430
- We don't want romance here.
- Put out the cigarette.

493
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,290
- My gosh. Seog Jeong...
- Seog Jeong, stop it.

494
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,900
- Put out the cigarette, Seog Jeong.
- It's just a game!

495
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,230
- Even so...
- Suk Jin...

496
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,340
Suk Jin wants to play the game.

497
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,910
Gosh, don't do that.

498
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,230
- Even so...
- Suk Jin...

499
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,580
(Love spreads in the prison
like wildfire.)

500
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,920
Everyone, I'll explain the rules
of the first reformation activity.

501
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,210
You'll play a word game...

502
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,010
- and a physical game.
- I see.

503
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,090
The results will determine...

504
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,010
the number of search team members.

505
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,020
- The search is important.
- Indeed.

506
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,430
- Or you won't get any hints.
- Exactly.

507
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,790
All ten of you will play the games
together as a group.

508
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,100
The culprit may play
the games poorly intentionally.

509
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,430
- Right.
- Of course.

510
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,870
In the 1st mission,
you'll play 1 of 2 games.

511
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,500
I'll give you a word,

512
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,410
- and you'll spell it backwards.
- Okay.

513
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,580
For example,
I give you the word "kindergarten."

514
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,580
- Net...
- Net,

515
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,270
- rag, rednik. Like this.
- Okay.

516
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,480
The other game is
Make a Three-syllable Word.

517
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,820
- If I say "de..."
- Desert lime.

518
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,780
The 1st person should say "nim",
and the 2nd one should say "pants."

519
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,590
- "Desert lime" works too, right?
- Yes.

520
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,950
I'll pick 1 of these 2 games
just as I want.

521
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,900
You have ten chances.

522
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,960
If all ten of you pull it off
in a row at least once,

523
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,600
five of you can search for hints.

524
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,930
But if you fail in all ten attempts,

525
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,840
- only two of you will search.
- Okay.

526
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,230
To get more hints,
you need to pull this off.

527
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,680
- I see.
- It'll be so difficult.

528
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,610
The person who doesn't seem to worry
about it...

529
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,320
- We can do it.
- is likely the culprit.

530
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,980
- I'm not good at playing games.
- Why are you looking at me?

531
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,320
- No reason.
- Why are you looking at me?

532
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,980
Jong Kook never finds a culprit
using clues.

533
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,210
- He just suspects everyone.
- Yes.

534
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,280
He focuses on the suspects'
facial expressions and behaviors.

535
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,520
And his hunches are right
in most cases.

536
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,130
Suspects, can you sit
among the inmates?

537
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,370
- Okay.
- That's not true.

538
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,990
- Everyone, listen to me.
- Yes.

539
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,110
Since Ye Ji is much younger than us,

540
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,810
it must be hard for her
to blend in with us.

541
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,000
Since she's only 21,

542
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,270
she's 50 years younger
than the oldest member.

543
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,470
(56 minus 21 equals 50.
What a weird calculation.)

544
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,850
- Hey, are you saying...
- Right. You were born in 1966.

545
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,540
- that I'm over 70?
- You're not 66 years old.

546
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,540
(You were born in 1966.
You're not 66 years old.)

547
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,510
Seog Jeong just declared...

548
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,560
that she's bad at playing games.

549
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,600
- Did she?
- She made sure she had a way out.

550
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,330
- That's right, she did.
- She could be the culprit?

551
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,960
- That's what she did. Listen to me.
- We look close, right?

552
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,400
She could be the culprit, okay?

553
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,460
(The petty criminals are showing off
their friendship while talking.)

554
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,070
- Ji Hyo, what are you doing?
- We look like close friends, right?

555
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,570
You're so cute.

556
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,910
That was good.
Ji Hyo is so funny lately.

557
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,000
- Keep it up.
- She's cute.

558
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,110
- Shall we start with Suk Jin?
- Yes.

559
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,270
- Please pronounce words clearly.
- I'll do that.

560
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,740
- Pronounce words clearly.
- I have bad hearing.

561
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,380
- Do you understand the rules?
- Yes, I do.

562
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,650
Ye Ji,
are you good at playing games?

563
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,180
- I'm sure she's good at it.
- Yes. I like playing games.

564
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,210
- Young people are quick-witted.
- True.

565
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,450
I'll say "Say It Backwards"
and a word.

566
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,430
- Take turns spelling it backwards.
- Of course, we know that.

567
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,600
It'll be harder for you guys.

568
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,520
I just have to say the last letter.
It'll be easy.

569
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,760
Here we go.

570
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,760
Make a Three-syllable Word. Ba.

571
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,530
(Make a Three-syllable Word,
the 1st syllable, ba)

572
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,070
- Gu...
- Banana!

573
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,610
(The director caught him off guard.)

574
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,730
(Time's up.)

575
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,440
- There are a lot of words.
- What was that?

576
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,810
- Why is he so bad at this?
- The director is a fraud.

577
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,380
- What do you mean?
- You said it'd be Say It Backwards.

578
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,680
Why can't you do it?

579
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,920
- He explained the rules before.
- An, an, ab.

580
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,360
- It was Make a Three-syllable Word.
- But he said...

581
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,920
- that we were going to play...
- Banana, Bahamas, and many more.

582
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,390
- But he said...
- Ba?

583
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,600
- I thought he said "ga."
- It was "ba."

584
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,130
I thought of saying "ganging up."

585
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,720
- That wouldn't work.
- No.

586
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,020
- No.
- I have bad hearing.

587
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,790
- It's not appropriate.
- You said we'd play the other one.

588
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,700
He said we'd play Say It Backwards.

589
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,530
- Let's start with someone else.
- It's okay.

590
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,430
- I understand the rules now.
- Let us play.

591
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,970
- Okay.
- Let's go. Who goes first?

592
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,580
Jae Suk will go first,
and Ye Ji will go next.

593
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,540
- In this direction?
- It's easy for Jae Suk.

594
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,540
- In that direction?
- I'll show you how it's done.

595
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,120
- Here we go.
- Ye Ji, keep it together.

596
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,390
- He's focused.
- He's nervous.

597
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,920
Make a Three-syllable Word. Co.

598
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,980
Co.

599
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
(Make a Three-syllable Word,
the 1st syllable, el)

600
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,890
- Co.
- Kki.

601
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,400
- Ri.
- It should have three syllables.

602
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
- You should've said the 2nd one.
- You said the 1st syllable.

603
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,070
(The 1st syllable was repeated.)

604
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,600
- It should have 3 syllables.
- You should've said the 2nd one.

605
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,960
- You said the 1st syllable.
- Why did you say the 1st syllable?

606
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,530
You should've said the 2nd syllable.
Why did you say the 1st one?

607
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,030
- Jae Suk, do you understand?
- Don't be nervous. Relax.

608
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,940
- Right. "Cocoa" would've worked.
- That's right.

609
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,380
- Co, co, a.
- Right.

610
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,710
- But she said "kki."
- That's right.

611
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,440
You wanted to make the word
"coconut", right?

612
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,420
- I wanted to make "coconut." Why?
- I'm sorry...

613
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,390
I'm sorry, but Ye Ji is at fault.

614
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,920
- Oh, right. I'm to blame.
- Yes.

615
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,480
- Ye Ji, come on.
- I'm sorry.

616
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,750
- She made a mistake.
- You should get it together.

617
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,160
- Co, co, a.
- I see.

618
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,400
But you were confused
about the rules, weren't you?

619
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,630
No. I wanted to make
"coconut" or "cocoa."

620
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,170
Why are you all so bad at this game?

621
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,430
- I'm not bad at it.
- Why...

622
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,840
- Let's begin.
- I'll go first.

623
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,670
Go ahead. You go first.

624
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,140
- It's too nerve-racking.
- You can do this.

625
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,340
It's too nerve-racking
to wait for my turn.

626
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,430
Here we go.

627
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,410
Say It Backwards. Toothpick.

628
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,810
- K.
- Ph.

629
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,040
- Ci.
- Gosh.

630
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,540
Who was it?

631
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,710
- It was reversed.
- He got it wrong.

632
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,010
- It was me.
- She got it wrong first.

633
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,890
- See, Ji Young?
- You got it wrong too.

634
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,090
I got it wrong too?

635
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,660
- K.
- K, ph, ci.

636
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,920
- Hang on.
- K, ph, ci.

637
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,020
- Ji Young, you're suspicious.
- K, ci, ph, toot.

638
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,490
- What did I do?
- Catch it.

639
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,600
- It's mine!
- No, it's mine.

640
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,760
Ji Young, you're suspicious.

641
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,900
(A snack packaging box)

642
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,870
(The advertiser's kindness was blown
by the spring breeze.)

643
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,170
- It's mine!
- Advertiser, I caught it!

644
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,670
- I'll be in their advertisement...
- Hey!

645
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,930
- It's mine!
- Give me that, you punk!

646
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,200
Give me that, you punk!

647
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,700
(The petty thief snatched it.)

648
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,940
- It's mine. I caught it.
- Darn it.

649
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,510
(The fierce competition
among the petty criminals)

650
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,850
I could've been their model.

651
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,620
Wasn't it a bonus game?

652
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,930
Anyway, that was suspicious.
I don't think it was a mistake.

653
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,630
- Let our aces play the game.
- No, I'm just bad at this game.

654
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,250
- Our aces?
- I'm not the culprit.

655
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,490
Se Chan will go first this time.

656
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,990
- In what direction?
- To your left.

657
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,170
- To our left?
- I'll go first.

658
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,140
- It'll be hard for me.
- Make a Three-syllable Word...

659
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,290
- I'll prove that I'm innocent.
- Now,

660
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,430
- here we go.
- Make a Three-syllable Word.

661
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,930
Say It Backwards. Chicken breast.

662
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,080
Tsa.

663
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
- Nek.
- What?

664
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,310
- It's "erb."
- Erb.

665
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,440
- She's suspicious.
- No.

666
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,620
- Chicken breast.
- Tsa, erb, nek, cihc.

667
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,040
- Is it that difficult?
- Tsa, erb, nek, cihc.

668
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,150
Is it really that difficult?

669
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,010
Do you think you can do it...

670
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,980
- the moment you hear the word?
- Hey, tsa, erb, nek, cihc.

671
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,480
I know it's hard to say it backwards
all at once,

672
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,980
but you should've gotten
one syllable right!

673
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:20,950
You just had to say one syllable.

674
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,660
(Tapping)

675
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,720
- Tsa, erb, nek, cihc. It's easy.
- But...

676
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,730
I couldn't think of it right away.

677
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,760
- You should've...
- Why not?

678
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,840
- I bet you can't do it either.
- Chicken...

679
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,030
- We'll pull it off.
- Of course.

680
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,500
- Chicken breast.
- What?

681
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Chicken breast.

682
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,380
- Er, nek, erb, cihc.
- See? It's hard.

683
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,640
My breast.

684
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,500
- "My breast?"
- What was that?

685
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,540
(She twisted the question.)

686
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,270
- "My breast?"
- What was that?

687
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,210
- What...
- Seriously, what's wrong with her?

688
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,320
- Why would you say "my breast?"
- What was that?

689
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,860
Little kids watch this show too.

690
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,590
- What's your problem?
- This isn't an R-rated show.

691
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,890
Haha's son Dream
must be watching this.

692
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,180
- Apologize to Dream!
- Gosh, seriously.

693
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,900
- I wanted to make it tricky.
- Gosh.

694
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,290
- Why is it tricky?
- "My breast."

695
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,990
But I think
we should feel comfortable...

696
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,140
talking about things like that.

697
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,110
- There's nothing wrong with it.
- Exactly.

698
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,730
- We can say "your breast" too.
- It's not like that.

699
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,200
You ate a lot of chicken breasts.

700
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,910
- You work out shirtless every time.
- Right. He shows his nipples too.

701
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,850
I've never heard anyone
say that before.

702
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,010
Hey, Seog Jeong graduated
from Seoul National University.

703
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,010
- Yes, she did.
- No, that can't be true.

704
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,090
She graduated from SNU.

705
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,710
- No, she didn't.
- Yes, I did.

706
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,920
How did you graduate from SNU?

707
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,630
(How did you graduate from SNU?)

708
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,830
- What do you mean by that?
- I can't believe you.

709
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,190
- I mean, I have a feeling...
- How could you say that?

710
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,130
- that she didn't. How did she?
- She majored in traditional music.

711
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,690
- How did you get into SNU?
- She graduated from SNU.

712
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,430
- She graduated from SNU.
- How did you get into SNU?

713
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,760
It's all in the past now! Drop it!

714
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,260
- How did you get into that school?
- I...

715
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,970
- How did you get into SNU?
- It's all in the past now.

716
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,640
I don't want to think about it.

717
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,310
Tell me how you got into the school.

718
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,150
- Let's try again.
- Okay. Who goes first?

719
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,080
- We'll start with Jong Kook.
- Okay.

720
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Okay.

721
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,440
Say It Backwards. Africa.

722
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,480
A.

723
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,510
R.

724
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,090
- You should've said "ci."
- See?

725
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,160
R.

726
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,890
(Ye Ji, who said she was good
at games, made a mistake again.)

727
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,100
It should be a, ci, r, fa.

728
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,430
- A, ci, r, fa.
- Ye Ji.

729
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,990
- You said you were good at games.
- Hold on.

730
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,330
How can a 21-year-old
be bad at this?

731
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,100
When she was born in 2002?

732
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,430
- Gosh.
- But...

733
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,370
- It's easy, you know.
- We can at least do it once.

734
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,140
Are there multiple villains?

735
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,410
It was Africa, right?

736
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,810
"A, ci, r, fa" is the answer.

737
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,740
- Jae Suk...
- Let's be honest here.

738
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,080
Can You believe him?

739
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,120
- He was just as confused.
- He said it after taking his time.

740
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,320
What a snob.

741
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,940
- That's not it.
- Let him try it on his own.

742
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,420
Ye Ji, watch and learn.

743
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,620
- Ye Ji, watch.
- Have him do it by himself.

744
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,680
- Just you.
- If you manage to do it,

745
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,220
I'll consider it as a win.

746
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,250
What? No, we should all do it.

747
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,490
No, do it on your own
since you were arrogant just now.

748
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,020
It'll be an extra round.

749
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,250
- Sure.
- What do you have to lose?

750
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,830
- Good luck.
- All right.

751
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,020
- Here we go.
- Bring it on.

752
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,100
Give him a long word.

753
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,840
Say It Backwards.

754
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,430
Mona Lisa.

755
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,640
As, il, an, am.

756
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,270
(As, il, an, am)

757
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,340
(Incorrect)

758
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,110
Are there vacant seats somewhere?

759
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,650
(He suddenly announced
that we had vacant seats.)

760
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,650
Are there vacant seats somewhere?

761
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,350
Where do we have vacant seats?

762
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,510
- Seriously?
- And yet you were arrogant.

763
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,090
- It's as, il, an, om.
- Stop being so arrogant!

764
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,420
I only got a vowel wrong.

765
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,420
- As, il, an, om?
- Aren't I good at this game?

766
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,520
- I'm not bad at the game.
- As if.

767
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,830
Mona Lisa with vacant seats.

768
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,020
Wasn't that good enough?

769
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,060
- I only got a syllable wrong.
- Right.

770
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,220
- I only got a syllable wrong.
- We have one vacant seat.

771
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,330
One seat is unoccupied.

772
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,190
- I'm amazed.
- See?

773
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,260
- A vacant seat?
- You did a good job.

774
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,260
- Let's keep going.
- Who would like to go first?

775
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,870
Let me start it off
since that'll be easier to track.

776
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,340
You need to get it right this time.

777
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,910
If not, it'll mean
you're the culprit.

778
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,530
- Exactly.
- But it isn't me.

779
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,580
Here we go.

780
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,500
Say It Backwards. Wi-Fi.

781
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,510
I.

782
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,880
- F.
- I.

783
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,920
W.

784
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,150
(They succeeded.)

785
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,160
- Nicely done.
- Good job.

786
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,920
- Good.
- Nicely done.

787
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,680
That one was doable. Nice, So Min.

788
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,480
- Here we go.
- Do I go first?

789
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,720
- Yes.
- Okay.

790
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,100
- There's no need to be nervous.
- Good luck.

791
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,900
- Please get it right.
- Don't tense up.

792
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,020
- Okay.
- It'll be a three-syllable word.

793
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,490
- Don't worry.
- There are only six left.

794
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,490
- It can't be a four-syllable word.
- Bring it on.

795
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,730
- Come on.
- Let us have it.

796
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,370
Say It Backwards. Spaghetti.

797
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,430
It.

798
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,730
- Teh.
- Ps.

799
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,880
- What on earth?
- Seriously?

800
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,940
There is no need to be nervous!

801
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,110
- It should be Ga and then ps.
- How can you get it wrong?

802
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,010
- It wasn't hard at all.
- But...

803
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,510
Ye Ji, what do you think?

804
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,780
- It was an easy one.
- Right?

805
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,350
Ye Ji, are you kidding me?

806
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,160
- How can he get it wrong?
- You didn't say anything,

807
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,920
but as soon as Jong Kook
suspected me of foul play...

808
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,980
It doesn't have to be done
at a fast pace.

809
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,680
Yes, just keep it
at a moderate pace.

810
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,830
You can slow it down if you want.

811
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,930
- Here we go.
- Let's get it done this time.

812
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,670
Make a Three-syllable Word.

813
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
A.

814
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,100
- Auto.
- Shop.

815
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,600
- Say It Backwards.
- Backwards.

816
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,110
(Next up is a game
of Say It Backwards.)

817
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,110
It's simple.

818
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,730
- You know when your turn is.
- There were many options.

819
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,700
- Say It Backwards.
- Next is Say It Backwards.

820
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,040
(Say It Backwards)

821
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Triangular gimbap.

822
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,080
Pab.

823
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,420
- Nairt.
- Mig.

824
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,150
Triangular gimbap.

825
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,210
(Pab)

826
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,090
(Nairt?)

827
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,680
- Are you kidding me?
- Unbelievable.

828
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,590
- Get over him.
- It's him.

829
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,250
- Get him.
- You've been busted.

830
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,520
- We got you.
- Come on.

831
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,630
We know it's you.

832
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,720
- It's been a while.
- Exactly.

833
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,160
It makes no sense.

834
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,100
- What do you mean?
- What are you playing at?

835
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,690
- Seriously?
- How is that difficult?

836
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,790
It makes no sense.

837
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,430
Just say the syllable
that is second to last.

838
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,530
You need to explain yourself
with this one.

839
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,340
Explain yourself if you can.

840
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,470
- It makes no sense.
- Tell us why.

841
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,740
- It makes no sense.
- You said Ye Ji's syllable.

842
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,740
What he said was the first syllable.

843
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,810
- Pab.
- Oh, right.

844
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,880
Mig.

845
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,080
- Nairt.
- What?

846
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,680
- No, that's not it.
- Hey!

847
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,590
(They're all confused.)

848
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,890
- That isn't right.
- Ralug.

849
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,480
He told you that the game
was Say It Backwards,

850
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,950
so all you had to do
was say the second to last syllable.

851
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,630
- After hearing the word...
- I'll do better in the next game!

852
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,100
There's a good chance
you'll botch that too.

853
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,430
What can I do
when I already got it wrong?

854
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,690
And just like that, this game...

855
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,870
- We failed.
- Only the minimum will be in play.

856
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,960
Does this mean
we won't find any clues?

857
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,870
I'm sure that the spy
deliberately got it wrong.

858
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,000
Won't we be able to find any clues?

859
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,680
But on a day like this,

860
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,810
we should lie down
rather than do any work.

861
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,410
(He lies down.)

862
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,820
Exactly.

863
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,970
- Let's party instead.
- Just like this.

864
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,090
Nice.

865
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,850
There are days like this,
don't you agree?

866
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,510
It's like we're in Manhattan.

867
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,250
Let's take a short break.

868
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,250
Yes, let's.

869
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,830
Bite me!

870
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,690
- Nat, tah, nam.
- What?

871
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,330
- Nat, tah, nam.
- She's saying it backwards.

872
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,020
How did you ever
get into Seoul National University?

873
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,370
It's all in the past,
so stop talking about it!

874
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,870
"It's all in the past."

875
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,500
(Ms. Hwang has forgotten about
her early success in life.)

876
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,110
"It's all in the past."

877
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,430
You failed all ten rounds,

878
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,910
which is why only two of you
will get to conduct the search.

879
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,410
- Does that mean no clues?
- Win this next game,

880
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,040
and more people
will get to join the search.

881
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,620
In this second game,
you will get physical.

882
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,120
- Physical?
- Physical?

883
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,210
- As you know, you're a team.
- Right.

884
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,620
The next game...

885
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,250
is a 6-on-6 futsal game
against the prison guards.

886
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,060
Finally.

887
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,900
- Okay, it's settled.
- Good.

888
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,490
- We'll see how good Jong Kook is.
- I will get to defend...

889
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,100
my honor today.

890
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:38,640
(For a long time, he was known
to be terrible at soccer.)

891
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,610
(He hates it more than
being told he's a bad singer.)

892
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:47,350
(He makes crucial assists
throughout the game.)

893
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,620
(He'll get to show the viewers.)

894
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,560
You will play in a team of six...

895
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,250
and the game will be split
into two halves.

896
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,660
There must be 3 men
and 3 women at all times.

897
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,220
Win the game and five more people
will be able to join the search.

898
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,950
If you lose or
the game ends in a draw...

899
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,520
- Women must be on the team.
- Are the numbers fixed?

900
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,870
- Okay, I got it.
- It's the same for the staff too.

901
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,730
- Of course.
- Will Myung Jae be playing?

902
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,230
- Absolutely.
- Yes, Myung Jae.

903
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,460
I hear he's good.

904
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,640
- Wait. Isn't there a second half?
- There is.

905
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,270
- So Min, wait.
- Get ready.

906
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,310
Warm up.

907
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,440
Yes, warm up.

908
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,420
Let's crush them.

909
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,090
They should get
a taste of Jong Kook's fury.

910
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,420
- They should.
- Yes, they should.

911
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,780
They'll see what it's like
to be hit by a dump truck.

912
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,210
You'll go flying at least 2m.

913
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,720
- Get ready to be run over.
- That's right.

914
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,930
You will be
in a traffic accident today.

915
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,690
Ye Ji, do you know
how to play soccer?

916
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,130
I was known as Hong Messi.

917
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,960
- Really?
- I'm good.

918
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,730
Hong Messi?

919
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,730
That's right.

920
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,640
- Were you known as Hong Messi?
- Yes.

921
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,880
- That's perfect.
- Hong Messi?

922
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,380
You need two more players.

923
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,740
- Jong Kook and...
- Yes, I'm here.

924
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,940
- Seog Jeong.
- Seog Jeong?

925
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,770
- Yes?
- Seog Jeong, hurry on over.

926
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,150
I was at the restroom.

927
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,780
- Good for you.
- Nicely done.

928
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,320
One must be lighter to run faster.

929
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,210
- Nicely said.
- Of course.

930
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,320
Who is your goalkeeper?

931
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,950
We'll change up the members
as we go.

932
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,280
- Sure.
- Got it.

933
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,160
- Now...
- They don't seem...

934
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,690
intimidating to me.

935
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,900
They aren't any better.

936
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,600
- Exactly.
- All right.

937
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,960
- Hold on a second.
- Please take your places.

938
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,000
Okay.

939
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,260
Go, Team Running Man.

940
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,410
Go, Team "2037."

941
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,810
- Let's do this.
- This is as far as we can go.

942
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,180
- Right.
- Exactly.

943
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,180
- When the game begins.
- I can see that far out though.

944
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
(First half start)

945
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
And go.

946
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,290
That's it!

947
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,170
Cover him.

948
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,830
- Here.
- Pass the ball.

949
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Over here.

950
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,800
- Seog Jeong, nice.
- My gosh!

951
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,970
- It's good.
- That ball crossed the line.

952
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,800
It crossed the line. It's ours.

953
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,030
- It's ours.
- It didn't cross the line.

954
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,270
Let's spread out.
Ji Young, head over there.

955
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,510
- Where?
- Jae Suk, run forward.

956
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,750
Jae Suk! What the...

957
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,250
Is the ball that light?

958
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,490
(He hit it out of the field.)

959
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,110
I knew you'd do this.

960
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,960
I kicked it too strongly.

961
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,690
Is this "Shooting Running Man?"

962
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,350
- It's all right.
- We get to play soccer though.

963
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,760
Welcome to "Shooting Running Man!"

964
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,360
Kick it forward.

965
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,590
- Good.
- Oh, no.

966
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,470
- It's okay.
- He blocked it.

967
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,560
Why are they so good?

968
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,010
- Go.
- Run for it.

969
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,830
- Run!
- Keep going.

970
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,870
Run.

971
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,370
(He dribbles past his opponents.)

972
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,750
My gosh!

973
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,370
Run.

974
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,340
(He suddenly hugs Ye Ji.)

975
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,540
What on earth?

976
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,890
- Sorry about that.
- Seriously?

977
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,390
Seriously? What was that?

978
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,990
I didn't want her to get injured.

979
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,990
What on earth was that?

980
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,160
Are you kidding me?

981
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,350
- I didn't want her to get hurt.
- Kiss her, why don't you?

982
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,090
I didn't want her to get hurt.

983
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,620
He hugged her out of nowhere.

984
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,760
- Hold on.
- Ji Hyo is fuming!

985
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
It's not...

986
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,560
Hey, you.
Hong Ye Ji, get off the field!

987
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,030
That's not it.

988
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,770
- It's okay.
- He's good at all kinds of sports.

989
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,480
(The guards are in control
of the ball more often.)

990
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
Seog Jeong!

991
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,680
- Move!
- She...

992
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,270
Seog Jeong, over here.

993
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,070
- Nice!
- Seog Jeong, over here.

994
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,080
(She bulldozes her way
to obtaining the ball.)

995
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,690
Go for it.

996
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,690
(Se Chan is in a position to score.)

997
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,420
That's it. Score!

998
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,730
Go for it.

999
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,260
Score!

1000
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,090
(A big save)

1001
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,960
- You did well.
- It's all right.

1002
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,620
That was close.

1003
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,470
Guys, faster!

1004
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,470
Here.

1005
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,030
Not there.

1006
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,740
(The warrior is back.)

1007
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,180
Good.

1008
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,870
(Groaning)

1009
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,100
(The warrior's legs gave in.)

1010
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,010
- Get back in there.
- It's our ball.

1011
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,650
Stay on the other side.

1012
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,340
(The prisoners
will kick the ball in.)

1013
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,990
(The guards make a counterattack.)

1014
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,760
Get him. Just cling on to him.

1015
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,320
- Okay.
- Nice!

1016
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,960
- Jae Suk's there.
- I'm right here.

1017
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,760
- I'm right here.
- Okay.

1018
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
- Jae Suk's there.
- I'm right here.

1019
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,430
(He keeps dribbling
even though Jae Suk's is close by.)

1020
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,820
Darn it.

1021
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,200
- Jae Suk's there.
- I'm right here.

1022
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,940
(After failing to score,
he lets out a sigh.)

1023
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,100
Why is everyone playing it
so seriously?

1024
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,530
- It's our ball.
- Go forward!

1025
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,710
Give it to me.

1026
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,450
(It's Team Inmate's kick-in.)

1027
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,370
Go forward!

1028
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,870
Jae Suk, go over there!

1029
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,720
- If you stand there...
- Cut it in!

1030
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,110
Cut it in! Heading!

1031
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,960
- Nice!
- It went in!

1032
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,320
Cut it in! Heading!

1033
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,350
Nice!

1034
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,490
(Slapstick)

1035
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,890
Cut it in! Heading! Nice!

1036
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:25,200
(Scoring an own goal,
flapping all by himself)

1037
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,740
(Team Inmate scores a goal with
Director Lee Ju Yong's slapstick)

1038
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,330
- Nice!
- Great one!

1039
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,510
- It just went in.
- Good job!

1040
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,140
- Well done.
- That was great.

1041
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,640
- That was incredible.
- That was great.

1042
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,970
It went in.

1043
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,540
- It just went in.
- Good job!

1044
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,040
It's become like "Shooting Stars."

1045
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,450
- Shooting Running Man.
- Shooting...

1046
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,580
- Running Man!
- Running Man!

1047
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,240
Seog Jeong.

1048
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,810
Go up to the goalpost.

1049
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,180
- Go up to the goalpost.
- You're doing great.

1050
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,760
- You're doing great.
- Get his ball.

1051
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,100
- Give it to me.
- Go forward. Pass it to the back.

1052
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:58,100
Take your time.

1053
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,490
(He doesn't pass it to Jae Suk.)

1054
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,700
Go forward.

1055
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,430
- Pass it to me!
- You must pass it.

1056
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,040
It's okay.

1057
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,040
Why are only three players playing?

1058
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,200
Oh, gosh.

1059
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,680
(Team Officer
quickly counterattacks.)

1060
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,180
(But Jong Kook
cuts off their attack.)

1061
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,910
They are...

1062
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,410
- What was that?
- Foul!

1063
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,220
(A sudden tackle)

1064
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,830
Foul!

1065
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,330
It's a foul!

1066
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,330
It's a foul!

1067
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,560
(Making a complaint
while showing off his trapezius)

1068
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,990
- It's a foul!
- They're making so many fouls!

1069
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,490
It's a foul.

1070
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,330
She's no joke.

1071
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,600
- She's really fierce.
- Hey.

1072
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,160
(They barely calm down
before the game resumes.)

1073
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,270
- Messi!
- Go!

1074
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,640
Pass it to Jae Suk.

1075
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,810
- Over here.
- That's it.

1076
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,740
(He plays all by himself again
in the corner.)

1077
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,950
It's not out.

1078
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,270
It's not out.

1079
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,120
What are you doing all by yourself?

1080
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,790
What are you doing all by yourself?

1081
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,720
(The goalie defends his attack.)

1082
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
That startled me.

1083
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,660
(Giving the thumbs up
when he hasn't scored)

1084
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,430
- We're way better.
- We're really good.

1085
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,660
It's becoming neck and neck though.

1086
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,830
We're way better.

1087
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,540
- Let's go!
- It's a one-on-one chance.

1088
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,470
(A dump truck
who succeeds in every tackle)

1089
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,740
(Jae Suk quickly moves up
to help Jong Kook.)

1090
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,810
- Let's go!
- It's a one-on-one chance.

1091
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,810
Shoot!

1092
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,140
- Hey!
- Why did he...

1093
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,240
- It's a one-on-one chance.
- Shoot!

1094
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,220
(He blows his chance again.)

1095
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,290
Why did he...

1096
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,490
- That was so...
- Shoot!

1097
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,890
His legs are pretty long.

1098
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,560
(The first half is over.)

1099
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,660
His legs are really long.

1100
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,720
The first half is over.

1101
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,160
- Jong Kook, that punk!
- His legs are really long.

1102
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,220
I should've scored one.

1103
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,490
(He had 8 tackles and 1 hug
during the first half.)

1104
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,140
- Why did you dribble for so long?
- I mean...

1105
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,060
Why does he play the game
all by himself?

1106
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
It's not that!

1107
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,810
There were five of us
on the other side.

1108
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,540
- I passed it to the others too.
- It's okay. He's cool.

1109
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,580
- My gosh.
- I passed it to you too.

1110
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,240
- He kept showing off his skills.
- It's okay.

1111
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,120
(Jong Kook blew his chances
during the first half.)

1112
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,450
Ye Ji, it looks like
you have to play again.

1113
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,640
- Me?
- She doesn't have the energy to.

1114
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,720
How come you're called Hong Messi?

1115
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,620
Is it because you like mesh shirts?

1116
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,620
How come she's known as Messi?

1117
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,100
I used to be good at soccer.

1118
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,200
- You?
- Yes.

1119
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,560
Then how come you were so bad?

1120
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,560
Because it's been long.

1121
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,660
It looks like the referee
is generous with fouls.

1122
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,930
You know it, right, So Min?

1123
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,640
- I think you should do some fouls.
- So Min.

1124
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,700
You should just hang on
to one of them.

1125
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,370
You should be in charge
of using fouls.

1126
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,600
- We'll now begin the second half.
- All right!

1127
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,200
It's confusing
because there are no boxes.

1128
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,540
You can't stand right behind.

1129
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,080
Send it to the back.

1130
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,350
- Go up there.
- Pass it to Jong Kook.

1131
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,810
We'll be in danger
if it gets cut off.

1132
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,160
You punk!

1133
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,930
- You should've caught it.
- It was his ball. It's out.

1134
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,080
Why didn't you catch it?

1135
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,950
- You should block them!
- It was his ball. It's out.

1136
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,290
Hurry up and run!

1137
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,490
(Right then,
Team Officer counterattacks.)

1138
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,970
- Gosh, we're in trouble.
- Hurry up and run!

1139
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,990
- Hurry up!
- What? Why is he so good?

1140
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,060
(After defending easily...)

1141
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,100
Go.

1142
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,310
Go up there.

1143
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,740
So Min! It's your chance!

1144
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,910
He's playing by himself again.

1145
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,010
- He's playing by himself again.
- So Min!

1146
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,680
(So Min is all by herself
on the front line.)

1147
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,410
- So Min! It's your chance!
- He's playing by himself again.

1148
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,890
- So Min!
- So Min!

1149
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,040
- He's playing by himself again.
- So Min.

1150
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,220
- So Min!
- So Min!

1151
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,680
(So Min just let
the ball roll away.)

1152
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,560
- So Min!
- So Min!

1153
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,060
What are you doing? Am I the target?

1154
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,100
- Why did he dodge?
- My gosh.

1155
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,560
He's playing by himself again.

1156
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,490
- No!
- Hey!

1157
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,830
- Hey!
- No!

1158
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,990
You should cut it off.

1159
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,740
(Jong Kook's dribble can only
be cut off by hanging on to him.)

1160
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,060
What was that, So Min?

1161
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:31,040
Why is he playing futsal
against six players?

1162
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:35,120
Even Kim Byung Ji didn't go up
like that during his prime.

1163
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:39,290
Suk Jin! You should cut them off
in the middle.

1164
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,240
So Min, go up there.
Go up some more.

1165
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,950
Go up some more.

1166
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,580
Go up some more.

1167
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,350
Heading!

1168
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,930
You kicked it too far.

1169
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,260
Heading!

1170
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,490
(It went out.)

1171
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,620
Suk Jin.

1172
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,390
Can't you see the other players?

1173
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,870
- He hasn't scored at all.
- What's wrong with him?

1174
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,740
(But Jong Kook is in high spirits.)

1175
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,910
That's great.

1176
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,870
Hey! Come down to defend!

1177
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,700
All right. He blocked it.

1178
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,040
- Hey!
- Hey!

1179
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,310
(Right then, the ball rolls
toward the opponent team.)

1180
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,370
All right. He blocked it.

1181
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,540
- Hey!
- Hey!

1182
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,140
(The ball misses the goal
by a narrow margin.)

1183
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,260
That was sensible of you.

1184
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,910
(Jong Kook almost let them turn
the game around with his dribble.)

1185
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,350
- That was sensible of you.
- Thank goodness it didn't go in.

1186
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,520
- I thought it'd go in. My gosh.
- It didn't go in.

1187
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,720
So Min! Get the ball!

1188
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,390
- Aren't I doing so well?
- All right. It's here.

1189
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,330
My gosh.

1190
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,600
(Receiving it with his belly)

1191
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,470
Why would you go that way?

1192
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,010
- Come this way.
- Why did he pass it to them?

1193
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,660
- So Min!
- Hurry up and go!

1194
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,700
- Hey, run!
- Watch out!

1195
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,140
- What is he doing?
- Block it!

1196
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,310
(A 1-on-1 chance
given by Haha's mistake)

1197
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,640
- Hey, run!
- Watch out!

1198
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,120
My gosh, Haha.

1199
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,620
- Come this way!
- Oh, gosh.

1200
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,450
(It hit the mark.)

1201
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,410
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

1202
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,160
- Switch!
- Timeout!

1203
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,950
Timeout.

1204
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,330
- Are you okay?
- Timeout!

1205
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,330
You know, it was...

1206
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,060
- somewhat refreshing.
- It really was.

1207
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,200
- He's the only single man here.
- Give him a pain relief patch.

1208
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,410
It's okay because you have muscles.

1209
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,510
That was the best play
you've shown so far.

1210
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,640
(First time taking an active role
by sacrificing his vital part)

1211
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,180
(The game resumes.)

1212
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,950
- Hit it! Shoot!
- Shoot!

1213
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,140
So Min!

1214
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,450
Distract them!

1215
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,290
- There you go.
- Great!

1216
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,850
Here he goes.

1217
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,450
- Ye Ji!
- Ye Ji!

1218
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,350
- Hong Messi!
- Kick it out!

1219
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,350
(The opponents
start counterattacking right away.)

1220
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,790
Kick it out!

1221
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,560
No!

1222
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,890
(They're about to lose a point!)

1223
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,930
No!

1224
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:36,990
No!

1225
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:40,240
(Team Officer: 1, Team Inmate: 1)

1226
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,870
(Shaking his head)

1227
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,180
He can't block it well
because he's injured.

1228
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:48,010
He hasn't even gotten married!

1229
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,080
Jong Kook is injured.
It can't be helped.

1230
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,490
- Since last week...
- Give him a pain relief patch.

1231
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,790
Will you please run?
Why isn't he running?

1232
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,620
- Haha, run up there!
- Okay.

1233
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,850
Why is he so slow?

1234
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,850
- Something's up with Haha.
- What are you doing?

1235
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,180
Pass it to me. Oh, gosh.

1236
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,430
She got it.

1237
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,930
Go forward. Go.

1238
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,430
Go forward, So Min.

1239
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,830
- Great!
- Pass it, So Min!

1240
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,660
- Great!
- Go forward!

1241
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,140
Go forward, So Min.

1242
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,490
- Go!
- Pass it, So Min!

1243
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,660
- Great!
- Hey.

1244
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,470
This is great.

1245
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,310
Jong Kook!

1246
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,850
- Jong Kook!
- Pass it to So Min!

1247
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,080
(But Jong Kook is short-sighted.)

1248
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,350
- Jong Kook! Behind you.
- Pass it.

1249
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,310
- Kick it. You should've kicked it.
- Kick it high.

1250
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,720
- What are they doing?
- Keep it going.

1251
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,810
All right. She got it.

1252
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,020
Over here!

1253
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,390
They are not going to get up
anytime soon.

1254
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,560
(He's showing off his skills again.)

1255
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,080
What is he doing
all by himself again?

1256
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,390
- What is he doing?
- Kick it!

1257
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,760
- What is he doing?
- Hey.

1258
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,160
- Kick it!
- Kick it!

1259
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,270
- Over here.
- Kick it!

1260
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,430
- Kick it!
- Kick it, Hong Messi!

1261
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,390
- Kick it!
- Over here.

1262
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,270
- Kick it!
- Kick it!

1263
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,270
Kick it!

1264
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,770
(His shot was weak.)

1265
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,240
- Gosh, how frustrating.
- My gosh.

1266
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,470
Why did he have to wear sunglasses?

1267
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,310
Take them off!
You can't see properly.

1268
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,640
(Team Officer's counterattack)

1269
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,790
- Heading!
- No!

1270
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,350
- Heading!
- No!

1271
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,160
- That was great.
- In the middle!

1272
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,080
- Block it. There you go.
- He got it.

1273
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,430
- Ji Hyo!
- They're gathered in the middle.

1274
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,660
Pass it to So Min!

1275
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,930
That must've hurt his back.

1276
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,160
No!

1277
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,330
(The ball rolls to the corner.)

1278
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,100
Pass it to So Min. Behind you.

1279
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,240
Pass it to the player behind you.

1280
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,740
- Behind you.
- I should've kicked it hard.

1281
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,010
Jong Kook! Behind you.

1282
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,310
(In the end, he loses the ball.)

1283
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,740
No!

1284
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,740
(No!)

1285
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,970
(She shoots amidst chaos.)

1286
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,140
No!

1287
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,390
No...

1288
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,160
(Team Officer turns the game around
by scoring another goal.)

1289
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,120
- What are they doing?
- I can't believe it.

1290
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,490
- Gosh, he's driving me crazy.
- What's wrong with him?

1291
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,620
Player number 66!

1292
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,430
Aren't you going to run?

1293
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:49,830
I was running.

1294
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,100
Can't we switch players?

1295
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,700
We'll just switch one.

1296
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,310
You can switch players
if they're severely injured.

1297
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,810
(Grunting)

1298
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:57,870
He's...

1299
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,200
- Suk Jin is mentally hurt!
- He's mentally shaken!

1300
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,520
He can't walk!

1301
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,540
(They all claim to be injured.)

1302
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,620
- I'm sorry. You should play.
- Should I play?

1303
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,890
You have three minutes left.

1304
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,760
- Let's make a goal!
- We can do it!

1305
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,220
Let's score another goal!

1306
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:13,430
Let's make a goal! Slowly.
Pass the ball.

1307
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,990
Suk Jin is roaming around there
all by himself.

1308
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,260
- What?
- Why wouldn't you pass the ball?

1309
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,870
They wouldn't pass the ball to him.

1310
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:22,870
They know
where to position themselves.

1311
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,600
(Team Officer gets a corner kick
chance a minute before it ends.)

1312
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,270
- What's wrong with them?
- Go!

1313
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,410
(Jong Kook cuts it off.)

1314
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:29,600
- All right!
- Here he comes.

1315
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,850
(A racehorse who only runs forward)

1316
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,520
- He's playing by himself again.
- Ji Hyo is up there.

1317
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,240
- He's playing by himself again.
- You're so cool!

1318
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:38,910
- Here he comes.
- Ji Hyo is up there.

1319
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,290
He's playing by himself again.

1320
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,520
- You're so cool!
- It's a no-mark chance!

1321
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,950
(Jong Kook finally gets a chance
to score.)

1322
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:46,620
- You're so cool!
- It's a no-mark chance!

1323
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,490
(He fails to score.)

1324
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,930
It's a no-mark chance!

1325
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,450
It didn't go in.

1326
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,790
(The game ends.)

1327
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,830
Team Officer wins!

1328
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:56,990
(Team Officer wins.)

1329
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:58,200
How many were blocked?

1330
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,810
How many goals did you have to miss?

1331
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:02,930
Ji Hyo was right there!

1332
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:03,970
(He's frustrated.)

1333
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,370
Your girlfriend was right there!

1334
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,040
I was going to pass it to you,
but they caught up.

1335
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,310
Of course. I understand.

1336
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,470
- It was supposed to be 5 to 1.
- Jong Kook didn't score at all.

1337
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,240
- Gosh, I ran so much.
- Good work, Jong Kook.

1338
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,020
I ran so much. Why didn't you run?

1339
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,290
Everyone, please gather over here.

1340
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,660
- This is so frustrating.
- That's disappointing.

1341
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,890
- We can't do it with one player.
- How many chances did he blow?

1342
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,390
- I mean...
- He didn't score at all.

1343
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:29,040
What were you trying to show us?

1344
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,870
I ran up there many times.

1345
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,810
- My gosh.
- Only if he doesn't put together...

1346
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,510
the funny parts only...

1347
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:36,870
(He's worried about
how the director will edit it.)

1348
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,080
My gosh, Jong Kook.

1349
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,680
Don't you mess with it.

1350
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,080
(The production crew only included
the parts where he played bad.)

1351
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,580
He keeps badmouthing me.

1352
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,350
My gosh.

1353
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:50,850
You acquired two players
from the previous mission...

1354
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,930
and two players
from the current mission,

1355
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:57,760
so only four players can go
and search the area.

1356
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,220
All right.

1357
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,020
We should send out the players
who aren't likely to be culprits.

1358
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,330
(They picked four players
they'd send out for a search.)

1359
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,790
If only four players can go,
players from our side should go.

1360
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:06,160
- These four will go.
- These four will go.

1361
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,510
- All right.
- Let's go.

1362
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,410
Ye Ji, come with us. Let's go.

1363
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,200
(A mysterious murder case
that occurred on the set)

1364
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:18,520
Where could the hints be?

1365
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,890
(Make the real culprit
take the stand in court.)

1366
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:24,060
Did you notice
anything strange today?

1367
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,180
Or did anyone act differently?

1368
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,680
Maybe she behaved
a little strangely?

1369
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,120
(Someone who acted strangely?)

1370
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,560
Ji Young is actually...

1371
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,490
not very athletic.

1372
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:35,830
But she seemed...

1373
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,240
Doesn't she seem
especially spiritless?

1374
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,200
- Yes, she seems to lack energy.
- She seems that way.

1375
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,370
- She's usually not like that.
- She's usually very active.

1376
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,040
- Right. She's very active.
- Really?

1377
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,740
I think Seog Jeong is here
just to be entertaining.

1378
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,740
She's determined to entertain us.

1379
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,850
She's trying
to make it entertaining.

1380
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,410
So Min always ruins everything.

1381
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,810
- It's So Min. I think it's her.
- Maybe she's given the role.

1382
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:53,810
Right?

1383
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:56,790
But to think that So Min
is the real culprit...

1384
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,350
But it'd be too obvious
if it was So Min.

1385
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,490
- Where?
- We're starting now?

1386
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,330
- Over here?
- From here?

1387
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:04,020
- What? It's too vast.
- The area is too big.

1388
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,160
There's a second floor too.
It looks like there's nothing.

1389
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:07,990
There's nothing.

1390
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,140
What kind of hint
are we supposed to find?

1391
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,160
(The time passes helplessly
without finding any hints.)

1392
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,660
I don't think there's anything
in here.

1393
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,810
This can't be it, can it?

1394
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:16,770
There's paper in here,
but it can't be it.

1395
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:18,010
It's not.

1396
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:20,810
There seem to be no objects
that look like hints.

1397
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,410
(Everyone is looking for a hint.)

1398
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:27,580
(Surprised)

1399
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,810
(Ye Ji found something.)

1400
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,290
- You found it?
- Yes, I found something.

1401
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:36,720
- What is it?
- It's a letter to Kwang Soo.

1402
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,850
Hey!

1403
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:39,020
What? What is it?

1404
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,700
- Kwang Soo...
- I found it in here.

1405
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,060
Kwang Soo?

1406
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:46,160
"To Kwang Soo who only has
121 days in prison."

1407
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,740
"From Young Seok,
inmate number 664."

1408
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,910
"Kwang Soo,
I got only a week left in prison."

1409
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,850
"I could hang in here
thanks to your help. Thank you."

1410
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,180
("Kwang Soo,
I got only a week left in prison.")

1411
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:00,390
"From Young Seok,
inmate number 664."

1412
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:03,060
The part before the number
is torn off.

1413
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,160
It means his inmate number
ends with 664.

1414
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,950
(Is the number 664
a hint about the culprit?)

1415
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,520
"Your performance in prison
is the most important part."

1416
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,220
"When your turn
to clean the bathroom comes,"

1417
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,930
"don't skip it
and do your job well."

1418
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,870
"You tend to fly into rage,
so control your temper."

1419
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:21,600
"Try to disregard Ggan Dol
who always gets on your nerve."

1420
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,510
"You're a good singer, so continue
to perform in choir with passion."

1421
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,080
"Attending every event is a way
to leave a strong impression..."

1422
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,310
"on the officers."

1423
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,290
"Hoping you'll sing with your soul
and continue to have a dream."

1424
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:38,060
I think the number 664
is a big hint.

1425
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,220
- Keep it for now.
- Okay.

1426
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,990
- Make sure not to lose it.
- Okay.

1427
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,600
It feels like
there'll be a hint here.

1428
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,660
(And Se Chan who was
looking around by himself...)

1429
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,790
Wait. What is this?

1430
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,140
What's with the minutes?

1431
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,140
What is this?

1432
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,740
(Running Prison 1st Meeting Minutes)

1433
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,100
(It's meeting minutes
of Running Prison?)

1434
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,270
Is this a hint too?

1435
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:02,640
(Participants: Warden Choi Bo Min,
Assistant Warden Kim Beom Jin)

1436
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,120
I should take a photo of this.

1437
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,180
(Collecting evidence)

1438
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,910
(What kind of hint
will they find in the minutes?)

1439
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:10,790
I got it. I can share this
with them, right?

1440
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,350
It's minutes.

1441
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,430
(He shares the hint with Haha
right away.)

1442
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:15,660
"Participants, Warden Choi Bo Min,
Assistant Warden Kim Beom Jin,"

1443
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,830
"Officer Lee In Seok."

1444
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:19,770
"Hold a reformation ballad concert
with ChoNam Zone."

1445
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,060
(Running Prison 1st Meeting Minutes)

1446
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,430
- My gosh. What is this?
- Did you find something?

1447
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,870
I thought Seog Jeong
was the real culprit.

1448
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,330
But you tell me.

1449
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,770
The hint mentioned that the culprit
was a good singer.

1450
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,370
Right. The letter mentioned
that they were a good singer.

1451
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,040
- And here, it says,
- A ballad concert.

1452
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,680
"Hold a reformation ballad concert
with ChoNam Zone."

1453
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,680
(Both hints say that the culprit
is a good singer.)

1454
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,620
Aren't you the culprit?

1455
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,490
- No, I'm not the culprit.
- Then sing for us.

1456
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,450
- I'm a bad singer.
- Show us.

1457
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:43,680
- I can't sing.
- Show us.

1458
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,890
Don't you think she's being strange?

1459
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,490
- No, I'm not!
- She was even on "Produce 48."

1460
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,100
- You were good.
- You...

1461
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,890
- You!
- I'm really not the culprit.

1462
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,020
I'm serious. I'm not the culprit.

1463
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,100
I mean it.

1464
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,270
- You!
- Come on.

1465
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,790
If I were the culprit,

1466
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,330
- I wouldn't have shared the hint.
- Right. She wouldn't have.

1467
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,510
No.

1468
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,870
She would've shown it to us
so we wouldn't doubt her.

1469
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:05,850
- Oh, she faked it?
- Because she's...

1470
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:06,970
I'm not the culprit.

1471
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,640
- Let's get going now.
- All right.

1472
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,080
Why would you make us move
all of a sudden?

1473
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,810
- Here.
- Why?

1474
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:13,350
- Let's get going.
- Okay, fine.

1475
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,410
(He's even suspicious
of the production crew.)

1476
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,620
It was Ye Ji.

1477
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,260
- Ye Ji.
- They're suddenly cornering me.

1478
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,220
So you were a good balladeer.

1479
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,830
You lied about your age, right?

1480
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,600
Don't I look so relaxed?

1481
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,990
- Is that from yesterday?
- Yes.

1482
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,290
The sky is beautiful.

1483
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:27,330
(So Min is showing off the photos
from the festival she went to.)

1484
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,890
You must've enjoyed it.

1485
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,160
There are so many people.

1486
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:31,790
Are you looking for a hint?

1487
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:33,640
I'm just wondering
why they set this up here.

1488
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,270
- Right. It could be in there.
- You're right.

1489
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:36,330
- Try opening the cabinet.
- He's right.

1490
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:37,510
I didn't think of that.

1491
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,540
(The old detective thinks
there could be a hint in the room.)

1492
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,700
Why did they put these here?

1493
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,700
Wait.

1494
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:42,910
What is it?

1495
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,450
- You found something?
- There's nothing.

1496
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,540
- I wish there were some papers.
- It looks like there's nothing.

1497
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,740
I also checked it earlier.

1498
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,560
Look around the place.
There could be a hint here.

1499
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,180
It's confusing.

1500
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,270
Hey, I found a laptop.

1501
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,640
What? Turn it on.

1502
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,870
- Turn it on.
- No way.

1503
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,370
Isn't it strange
there's a laptop in here?

1504
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,370
It is. There could be a hint
on the laptop.

1505
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:11,830
You're right. There must be a reason
they left it in there.

1506
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:13,680
It's strange how there's
a laptop in here.

1507
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,220
Isn't it strange
that a fully charged laptop...

1508
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,390
was deep inside the cabinet?

1509
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:22,180
You should click the videos folder
to check CCTV footage.

1510
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,520
Because earlier...
There it is. CCTV one.

1511
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,020
(There's a folder that says CCTV 1?)

1512
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,120
There really is a hint.

1513
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:30,560
- Wait.
- It's the clip from earlier.

1514
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,990
No, it's a different one.

1515
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,660
Isn't it the same footage?

1516
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,660
- It's the same footage.
- Is it?

1517
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:38,270
- But it's...
- It's the clip they showed us.

1518
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:39,310
Is there anything else?

1519
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:40,640
There's nothing else.
That's the only one.

1520
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,660
You see?

1521
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,770
- It was nothing.
- I know.

1522
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:46,180
- Guys!
- We caught the culprit.

1523
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,010
- You caught them?
- Who is it?

1524
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,370
- First of all...
- It's over.

1525
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:51,810
- Who is it?
- Haha is not the culprit.

1526
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:52,890
- Why not?
- Why not?

1527
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:54,490
- The culprit...
- That's not true!

1528
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:55,850
- The culprit is...
- I could be...

1529
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,520
The hints said that the culprit
was a good singer.

1530
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,080
- Wait.
- So he can't be the culprit.

1531
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,450
- I am one of the suspects.
- He wasn't the culprit.

1532
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:02,560
It's not him, then.

1533
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,060
If you start doubting me from now,

1534
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,770
- He's not the culprit.
- I'll treat you to a meal.

1535
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:07,160
- He's not the culprit!
- Hey!

1536
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,370
Ye Ji, what did you find?

1537
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:09,640
We found a letter.

1538
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,160
- "To Kwang Soo?"
- It was meant for Kwang Soo.

1539
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,830
It was already torn off.

1540
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,930
"To Kwang Soo who only has
121 days in prison."

1541
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:16,930
With Sleepy...

1542
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,540
"From Young Seok,
inmate number 664?"

1543
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,370
It's an inmate number
that ends with 664.

1544
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,950
It's an inmate number
that ends with 664.

1545
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,180
Also, they should be a good singer.

1546
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,910
- Wait. Ji Young.
- Ji Young.

1547
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,680
- Also...
- Wait. Ji Young.

1548
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,220
- Yours ends with 664.
- That's right.

1549
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,850
- Wait. What?
- A part of it is torn.

1550
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,390
(Ji Young's inmate number
ends with 664 as well.)

1551
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,350
("From Young Seok,
inmate number 664")

1552
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:37,620
I told you.
The number ends with 664.

1553
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,660
I didn't see her as a criminal.

1554
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,220
- Wait. It's you.
- Kwang Soo?

1555
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:42,970
- Kwang Soo?
- Yes.

1556
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,830
- You've worked with...
- I miss him.

1557
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,100
- You've worked with him before.
- "Kwang Soo, I got..."

1558
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,770
"only a week left in prison.
I wanted to share some tips."

1559
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,040
"Your performance in prison
is the most important part."

1560
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,470
"When your turn
to clean the bathroom comes,"

1561
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:55,410
- Hey.
- "don't skip it..."

1562
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,850
- Hey.
- "don't skip it..."

1563
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,810
- What's wrong with you?
- "Make sure..."

1564
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:01,620
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- How can you hit me with your knee?

1565
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,220
- I was so immersed.
- He was too focused on it.

1566
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,790
He was too focused on it.

1567
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,080
- Please focus on the letter then.
- "You tend to fly into rage..."

1568
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:08,890
- "During lunch time..."
- Hey!

1569
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:10,160
Let's see it together.

1570
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,560
"Until we
see each other again outside."

1571
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,540
"Hoping you'll sing with your soul
and continue to have a dream."

1572
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:19,040
- Sing with your soul?
- If you look here...

1573
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,600
This is the first meeting minutes
of Running Prison.

1574
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,640
(They check the minutes
together as well.)

1575
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,040
It says, "Hold a reformation
ballad concert with ChoNam Zone."

1576
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,510
- "Within the gardening area,"
- They're a good singer?

1577
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,680
"make a water garden."

1578
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,870
- Yes?
- Gardening is about me, then.

1579
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:31,350
Seog Jeong is good with gardening.

1580
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,850
Gardening is about me, then.

1581
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,290
(Then could it be Seog Jeong
who owns a farm?)

1582
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:36,120
- You see? I mentioned this.
- She's a good singer too.

1583
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,220
- You see?
- Seog Jeong.

1584
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:39,490
I know.

1585
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:41,330
- Who is it?
- Gardening is about me.

1586
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,430
She's a good singer too.

1587
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,060
- I found a hint too.
- What is it?

1588
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,200
These pages were folded
in the book I found.

1589
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,270
(Jong Kook found another hint
at the end of the search.)

1590
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,240
A tablet... Wait. What's this?

1591
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,560
("Keys to Passing the Exam")

1592
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,180
(An exam preparation book?)

1593
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,930
These pages were folded.

1594
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:02,100
From page 165 to page 180.

1595
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,580
- Or it could be...
- Isn't that someone's height?

1596
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,910
There could be something
between the pages.

1597
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,490
I think it is someone's height.

1598
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:10,620
- Right?
- You're right.

1599
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,520
- Right?
- From 165cm to 180cm.

1600
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,830
There are so many people
who fall into that range.

1601
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:15,560
- Everyone falls into that range.
- Except for Haha.

1602
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,200
- You're 163cm tall, right?
- Haha is an exception.

1603
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,490
Haha is not the culprit.

1604
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:22,490
You're 163cm tall and a bad singer,
so you're not one of the suspects.

1605
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,740
- Seriously...
- Anyone shorter than 165cm?

1606
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:28,240
(Luckily, Haha doesn't fit into any
categories that the hints provided.)

1607
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,600
- Hey.
- Okay.

1608
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,970
You should start doubting me.

1609
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:32,680
- Okay.
- Got it?

1610
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,970
Is there anyone shorter than 165cm?

1611
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:36,450
I'm taller than that.

1612
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:37,540
- Someone shorter.
- Ji Young.

1613
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,640
- How tall are you?
- I'm 164cm.

1614
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,740
- Then Ji Young isn't the culprit.
- It's not Ji Young.

1615
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,310
- It's not her.
- It must not be her.

1616
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:43,760
Ji Young
doesn't fall into the range.

1617
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,180
- But...
- How tall are you?

1618
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,790
- I'm 165cm.
- Someone purposely...

1619
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,850
- She falls into the range too.
- wanted to slander others.

1620
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,290
She should be included too.

1621
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:52,290
They must be good at
gardening and singing.

1622
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:53,430
It's you.

1623
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,660
- It points at you.
- It's you.

1624
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,640
It doesn't make any sense. Come on.

1625
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,270
It's either Seog Jeong or So Min.

1626
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:03,200
(Jae Suk has a hunch
it's either Seog Jeong or So Min.)

1627
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,270
But I am not a good singer.
I am just mediocre.

1628
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,910
- She is a good singer.
- Can you sing a bit?

1629
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:10,540
- Let's hear it.
- Don't sing badly on purpose.

1630
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,740
Please sing a bit.

1631
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:14,580
(Foggy)

1632
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,720
See? She is a good singer.

1633
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:18,120
(Jangchungdan Park)

1634
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,990
- She is good.
- She is really good.

1635
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,020
- Ye Ji, sing.
- Sing.

1636
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,060
- Ye Ji said that she is tone-deaf.
- She said that.

1637
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,450
- I can't sing.
- She is the culprit.

1638
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:25,700
- Ye Ji, sing.
- Sing.

1639
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,120
- She was on "Produce 48."
- Seriously.

1640
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,990
(You must know
that I am drawn to you)

1641
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:36,770
- She is good.
- It can't be Haha.

1642
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,410
<i>- It can't be Haha.</i>
<i>- Say</i>

1643
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:40,310
- It can't be Haha.
- You punk!

1644
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,310
(You punk!)

1645
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:42,910
It can't be Haha.

1646
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,740
- Haha, you aren't the culprit.
- It isn't Haha.

1647
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,120
- It isn't Haha.
- Come over here.

1648
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,720
Haha should deduce diligently today.

1649
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,290
But Ji Young can sing
really well too.

1650
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,490
- That's right. She has good cheer.
- Ji Young, please sing.

1651
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:53,580
Sing.

1652
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,520
(Run with me)

1653
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,850
- She is good.
<i>- We don't have to go far</i>

1654
00:54:58,330 --> 00:54:59,600
- She is good.
- She sang "Run with Me."

1655
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,600
- So Min remains.
- It's suspicious.

1656
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,390
- So Min is a good singer.
- So Min, go ahead and sing.

1657
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:04,430
Seriously.

1658
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:06,410
<i>Come on</i>

1659
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:09,830
(Love is the same)

1660
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:13,180
- It isn't So Min.
- She tries too hard.

1661
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,010
(She avoids suspicion right away.)

1662
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:18,470
- It isn't So Min.
- It isn't So Min.

1663
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,180
- You can be at ease.
- You aren't the culprit.

1664
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,580
- You aren't the culprit.
- You aren't the culprit.

1665
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:22,760
She avoided suspicion.

1666
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,760
(You can't forget sadness)

1667
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,410
- It isn't her.
- It isn't So Min.

1668
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,430
It isn't her.

1669
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,990
- It isn't her.
- It isn't So Min.

1670
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:30,260
She totally avoided suspicion.

1671
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,600
- So Min is okay.
- So Min isn't the culprit.

1672
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,200
- You can be at ease.
- Seriously.

1673
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,220
You can be at ease.

1674
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:35,700
- "You can be at ease."
- All right.

1675
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,890
This is your last chance to find
the culprit...

1676
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:41,970
who eliminated the youngest producer
in the morning.

1677
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,810
This is the final race,
the Silent Culprit.

1678
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:46,580
(The final race, the Silent Culprit)

1679
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,640
At 4 p.m.,
the last trial will take place.

1680
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,580
At 3:30 p.m.,
the first trial will take place.

1681
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,020
- There will be trials.
- Yes.

1682
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,790
Let me tell you about the trials.

1683
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:56,990
There is a court.

1684
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,160
When you go there,
you will find a cage.

1685
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,450
If the culprit is
inside the cage at 3:30 p.m.,

1686
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,390
the race will end right away.

1687
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,100
If someone else is inside the cage,

1688
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,600
the race will go on
for another 30 minutes.

1689
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,990
Put the culprit inside the prison...

1690
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:11,740
- by 4 p.m..
- How will we do that?

1691
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,810
- Do we arrest the culprit?
- That's right.

1692
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,100
- We arrest the culprit.
- Yes.

1693
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,080
Five minutes before the trial,

1694
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,010
- we will make an announcement.
- Okay.

1695
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:23,220
When it's time for a trial,
the bell will ring five times.

1696
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:26,490
Put the culprit inside the cage
during that time.

1697
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,080
- The bell needs to ring.
- So Min.

1698
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,910
The innocent ones
should stick together.

1699
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:32,220
- In that case...
- I am not the culprit.

1700
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,290
- Me neither.
- I am not the culprit.

1701
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:34,620
I know you aren't the culprit.

1702
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,680
(Who will go inside the cage
for the first trial?)

1703
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:40,890
(Ji Hyo visits the crime scene.)

1704
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:47,560
(She follows the route
the youngest producer took.)

1705
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,600
CCTV three.

1706
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:57,770
CCTV two.

1707
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,910
Then CCTV one...

1708
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:06,180
(The title of the video she watched
was "CCTV 1.")

1709
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,120
I just watched a video
from CCTV one.

1710
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,200
I need to watch the videos
from CCTVs 2 and 3.

1711
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,700
(She learned about other CCTVs.)

1712
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,660
I need to watch the videos
from CCTVs 2 and 3.

1713
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,100
(There could be video files
from other CCTVs.)

1714
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,510
Did you find something?

1715
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,510
- Suk Jin, come over here.
- What is it?

1716
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,180
Hurry up, Suk Jin.

1717
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,350
Hurry up. Suk Jin.

1718
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,180
Do you see these red insects?

1719
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,450
(Do you see these red insects?)

1720
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:38,660
- Yes.
- Aren't they fascinating?

1721
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,220
(For goodness' sake!)

1722
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,200
Look at them.
Aren't they fascinating?

1723
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,100
Why would they be fascinating?
I thought you found a hint.

1724
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,990
Hurry up and look.
Look at these red insects.

1725
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:48,720
Why would they be fascinating?
I see them, okay?

1726
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,200
There are so many of them.
What's up with them?

1727
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,100
- Suk Jin.
- It's protective coloration.

1728
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,600
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

1729
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,870
Gosh.

1730
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,240
What is it?

1731
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:01,850
Look at this three-leaf clover.

1732
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:03,020
(Look at this three-leaf clover.)

1733
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,220
For goodness' sake.

1734
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:05,970
(He got fooled for the second time.)

1735
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:07,640
What's up with the members...

1736
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,450
- who were born in 1986?
- Did So Min tease you too?

1737
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:11,390
Isn't that three-leaf clover
fascinating?

1738
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:13,330
- All right.
- Suk Jin, it's nice.

1739
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:14,620
- I am going.
- So Min.

1740
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,830
Those rookies
passed by a place like this.

1741
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:19,890
(Being pretentious)

1742
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:23,200
(Jae Suk walks around loudly.)

1743
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:28,430
"The Dads'..."

1744
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,080
"List."

1745
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:31,700
(What?)

1746
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:36,410
(He finds a suspicious envelope
between the books.)

1747
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,140
I knew there would be
something like this.

1748
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:42,520
"A crime scene report.
Victim, Yoon Jong Seo,"

1749
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,020
"a police officer
at the Running Police Station."

1750
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,220
"May 29th. Key findings."

1751
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,290
"The victim was
in good physical condition."

1752
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,890
"There is evidence
he got kicked in the butt."

1753
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:52,200
"The exact shoe size
can't be determined,"

1754
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,370
"but it's estimated
to be over 240mm."

1755
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,660
Okay. I got this.

1756
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:57,790
(The shoe size is estimated
to be over 240mm.)

1757
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:00,510
Over 240mm.

1758
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:05,410
They say the culprit always returns
to the crime scene.

1759
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:06,410
(So Min visits the crime scene.)

1760
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:09,810
He was on the floor like this.
If I remember correctly...

1761
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,220
Jae Suk.

1762
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:12,810
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing here?

1763
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:13,810
What are you doing here?

1764
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:14,910
- I am looking around.
- I am checking out...

1765
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:16,020
the crime scene.

1766
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,580
- Hold on.
- Same here.

1767
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:18,990
What are you doing here?

1768
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:20,580
- I am checking out the crime scene.
- It's perfectly natural.

1769
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,830
- Did you find something?
- Yes, I did.

1770
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:24,720
- Please say it with us.
- Please say it with us.

1771
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,620
The culprit's shoe size
is 240mm or bigger.

1772
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,270
- It's 240mm or bigger.
- My shoe size is 240mm.

1773
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:30,040
- Her shoe size is 245mm.
- It's exactly 240mm.

1774
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:32,430
Ji Hyo said your shoe size is 250mm.

1775
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:34,330
- Why are your feet so big?
- It isn't 250mm.

1776
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:35,370
- My feet aren't that big.
- It's 250mm.

1777
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:37,200
- I heard that it's 260mm.
- It's 240mm.

1778
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,010
Come on. It's 240mm.

1779
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:41,540
What else did you find?

1780
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,810
What's Seog Jeong's shoe size?
And Ye Ji...

1781
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:47,020
I have a question.
Can't the culprit be...

1782
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:48,740
- in Team Blue?
- Of course not.

1783
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:50,910
It's so strange.

1784
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:52,390
- So Min.
- Yes? It's strange.

1785
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,560
You know
that you are being suspected, right?

1786
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,200
- But I...
- What's your shoe size, So Min?

1787
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,200
(Why did So Min change the subject?)

1788
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:00,560
- Seog Jeong, I found a hint.
- Really?

1789
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,200
The culprit's shoe size is
240mm or bigger.

1790
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:04,890
What's your shoe size?

1791
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:06,510
It's 245mm.

1792
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:07,810
(Is it me again?)

1793
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:10,370
I am so shocked.

1794
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:11,810
All the hints point to me.

1795
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:14,080
You are under a lot of suspicions.

1796
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,640
But I am not the culprit.

1797
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,220
But all the hints point
to you, Seog Jeong.

1798
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:19,720
- That's ridiculous.
- All of them point to you.

1799
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,850
It would be absurd
if we don't put you in the cage.

1800
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:24,390
All the hints point to you,
Ms. Hwang. Listen.

1801
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:26,020
- You like horticulture. Listen.
- But I...

1802
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,830
- You like horticulture.
- "Ms. Hwang" sounds strange.

1803
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:29,620
- Ms. Hwang, you like horticulture.
- Go ahead.

1804
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,290
You like to sing. You can sing well.

1805
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:35,700
Your height is
between 165cm and 180cm.

1806
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,830
Not over that,
your shoe size is 240mm or bigger.

1807
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:38,830
All the hints point to you.

1808
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:40,510
Did you find any one of those hints?

1809
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:41,560
No. I didn't find a single one.

1810
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,410
Then why are you acting like...

1811
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:46,370
you found all the hints?

1812
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:49,200
- We only have two chances.
- If I get wrongfully imprisoned,

1813
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,470
can I hit you once I get released?

1814
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:55,390
Have you been taking a nap?

1815
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:57,080
Can I do something then?

1816
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,450
- Come here.
- What do I get in return?

1817
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:01,580
Come here. You need to eat
some rice with beans.

1818
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:02,890
- What?
- It's what prisoners eat.

1819
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:04,830
I always eat rice with beans.

1820
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,970
My mom is diabetic.

1821
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:10,430
You didn't need to reveal that.

1822
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:11,700
- Seriously.
- It's true.

1823
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,410
- I am the honest type.
- It's unrelated to the situation.

1824
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:15,510
- All right.
- You always eat rice with beans.

1825
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,100
I eat brown rice.

1826
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,330
I even boil beans ahead of time.

1827
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:20,910
- Really?
- Yes.

1828
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,740
Do the hints have the R sticker?

1829
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:26,020
(Ji Hyo looks for hints
while the others talk about rice.)

1830
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:28,810
(She found something.)

1831
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:29,810
This is...

1832
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:35,020
the security camera two.
It's a crucial hint.

1833
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,930
I took photos
of the security cameras earlier.

1834
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:39,890
(At the crime scene, she spotted
other CCTVs.)

1835
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,970
(A video from CCTV 2
can be a crucial hint!)

1836
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:46,310
It's a crucial hint.

1837
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:49,740
Okay. I will watch it
before I show it to the members.

1838
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:50,740
(She decides to check it secretly.)

1839
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,080
- Ji Young, is that you?
- Yes.

1840
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,810
- Did you find something?
- Yes.

1841
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:56,450
- What is it?
- It's a crucial hint.

1842
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:58,020
What did you find?

1843
01:01:58,370 --> 01:01:59,470
A book.

1844
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:00,490
(Ji Young joins him with a hint.)

1845
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:03,060
- Some pages were dog-eared.
- Okay.

1846
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:04,220
Did you find something?

1847
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:06,020
Did you find something?

1848
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,580
(Ji Hyo joins them.)

1849
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,390
I read the dog-eared pages.

1850
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:12,990
The book is about
exercises for the spine.

1851
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:14,890
Although it seems unrelated...

1852
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:17,790
The dog-eared pages are 165 and 180.

1853
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:18,790
My goodness.

1854
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:21,600
It means the culprit's height is
between 165cm and 180cm.

1855
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,910
Why were you reading the book?

1856
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:25,040
Really?

1857
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,310
The height is
between 165cm and 180cm.

1858
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,970
The shoe size is 240mm or bigger.

1859
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:31,910
Is it 240mm or bigger? That means...

1860
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:33,080
it's Seog Jeong.

1861
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,350
(Ji Hyo holds a crucial hint,
a video.)

1862
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:36,580
I read the book for no reason.

1863
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:38,080
The shoe size is 240mm or bigger.

1864
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,180
Then it's her.

1865
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:42,060
Ye Ji has small feet.
My shoe size is 230mm too.

1866
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,890
- Is your shoe size 230mm?
- Yes.

1867
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:45,100
My shoe size is 235mm.

1868
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,890
Seog Jeong's shoe size is
240mm or bigger.

1869
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:48,490
- My shoe size is 235mm.
- Is it 235mm?

1870
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:50,830
It's either So Min or Seog Jeong.

1871
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:52,540
It's Seog Jeong.

1872
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:55,810
I think the culprit is
either So Min or Seog Jeong.

1873
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:57,830
Inmates of Running Prison,

1874
01:02:57,830 --> 01:02:59,870
the first trial will open
in five minutes.

1875
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,100
Please gather around.

1876
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,680
The bell needs to ring first.

1877
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,580
Put her in the cage.

1878
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,640
(It's the first opportunity
to arrest the culprit.)

1879
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,740
Put her in the cage.

1880
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:08,620
It's either Seog Jeong or...

1881
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:10,910
I am not the culprit.

1882
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:15,350
What are these sunglasses for?

1883
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:16,700
- What?
- What?

1884
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,390
- These sunglasses are a hint.
- Did you find them?

1885
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:20,390
- Yes.
- Sunglasses?

1886
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:22,100
I don't know what they are for.

1887
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,390
What are they for?

1888
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:25,540
- Sunglasses?
- Will they let us see something?

1889
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:29,830
- Let me see them.
- A film is attached.

1890
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:31,700
I bet they can help us see something
that is invisible to the naked eyes.

1891
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,080
- Something like words.
- That's right.

1892
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,100
I don't know what they are for.

1893
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,580
- Suk Jin!
- What? You startled me.

1894
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,080
What?

1895
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,220
- What is it?
- What is it?

1896
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:44,080
- Earlier,
- Go on.

1897
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:46,580
I told you about...

1898
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:47,760
- CCTVs.
- Yes.

1899
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,060
There was a monitor in the room.

1900
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,200
- Did you see anything?
- I didn't see anything.

1901
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,100
- The screen was white.
- These sunglasses must be related.

1902
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,390
- Let's use these sunglasses.
- I get it now.

1903
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:56,390
Let's use these sunglasses.

1904
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:57,390
- Really?
- Yes.

1905
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:58,640
We don't have time though.

1906
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,830
- Let's put one of us in first.
- Yes.

1907
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:01,930
- Let's check on the second try.
- Okay.

1908
01:04:01,930 --> 01:04:04,870
Okay. For your information,

1909
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:07,850
- Ye Ji is eliminated.
- What?

1910
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:11,370
- Ye Ji is eliminated.
- What?

1911
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:13,040
(Ye Ji was eliminated
while searching for hints?)

1912
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,720
- Ye Ji is eliminated.
- Who did it?

1913
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,990
- Why?
- Someone eliminated her.

1914
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:18,520
What? How?

1915
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:21,350
- What happened?
- She is eliminated?

1916
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:22,680
(One of them eliminated Ye Ji!)

1917
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,700
She's eliminated? What does it mean?

1918
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,850
We should see the overall picture.

1919
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:28,430
(Ye Ji is the second victim
after the youngest producer?)

1920
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:30,430
- This is not a simple matter.
- She's eliminated?

1921
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:31,660
How about Se Chan?

1922
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:33,330
- Where is he?
- How about Se Chan?

1923
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:34,600
Gosh.

1924
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,200
- Hey, why are you back only now?
- Where have you been?

1925
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:38,640
- Did you put it up?
- No.

1926
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,910
Ye Ji died.

1927
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:41,200
- Ye Ji is eliminated.
- She's out.

1928
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:43,470
- Do you know anything about it?
- What's that?

1929
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:44,540
Really?

1930
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:46,410
- You came too late.
- Why did you...

1931
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:47,720
- I mean...
- Why?

1932
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:49,180
What happened to Ye Ji is one thing.

1933
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,520
- Isn't it Ye Ji's bag?
- No.

1934
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:52,620
- It's not Seog Jeong.
- Why not?

1935
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,930
- It's the youngest producer's.
- Did you find her bag?

1936
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:56,890
The text was amazing.

1937
01:04:56,890 --> 01:04:57,990
- What is it?
- What does it say?

1938
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,370
What's this? There's a phone.

1939
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:03,430
(Se Chan found a phone
in the youngest producer's phone.)

1940
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:06,370
Gosh, it must be So Min.

1941
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:07,970
(Gosh, it must be So Min!)

1942
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,330
Jeonsobari.

1943
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:11,410
(He's sure So Min is the culprit
after reading the text messages!)

1944
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:12,930
This is a plot twist.

1945
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:15,200
- It got me surprised.
- Why?

1946
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,370
- Hurry up and tell us.
- We don't have time. Hurry up.

1947
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:18,740
- This is a message from Ji Yeon.
- Okay.

1948
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,580
"You have a shoot this week, right?
Are you okay?"

1949
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:23,290
This is Jong Seo's reply.

1950
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,310
"They keep asking me what we will
do. It's driving me crazy."

1951
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:27,330
- "I didn't tell them..." Listen.
- It's not me.

1952
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:28,560
"They're even threatening me now."

1953
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,350
- It's not me.
- "I must see them every week."

1954
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:31,660
"It's suffocating."

1955
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:34,700
(They have to meet for a shoot
every week?)

1956
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:37,040
- It's So Min.
- It's So Min.

1957
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,270
It's So Min.

1958
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:39,370
It says "every week."

1959
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:41,010
- It's really not right.
- It's not Seog Jeong.

1960
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,140
- I'm really not.
- So Min.

1961
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,080
He's right. It's So Min.

1962
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,600
(They're suspecting So Min instead
of Seog Jeong before the verdict.)

1963
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,540
- You go in, So Min.
- Let's check.

1964
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:50,540
- So Min, you go in for now.
- No.

1965
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,270
I don't think it's right. Because...

1966
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:53,720
- It's not me.
- It can't be her motive...

1967
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:56,520
- to eliminate someone.
- But I said earlier.

1968
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,910
- Look, Suk Jin.
- Are you helping her?

1969
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:00,490
- They meet for a shoot every week.
- Suk Jin.

1970
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:03,450
I think this can't be evidence.

1971
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:04,930
It's the motive.

1972
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:06,490
Why are you defending her?

1973
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,830
I'm not defending her.

1974
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:08,970
Are you helping her?

1975
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,490
- I told you.
- We should put Seog Jeong in.

1976
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:13,430
- Why would you put me in?
- It's not Seog Jeong.

1977
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:15,040
It's frustrating. Think about it.

1978
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,970
There's 1 hint about So Min.
There are 4 hints about Seog Jeong.

1979
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:17,970
And you want to put in who?

1980
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:20,510
But Seog Jeong won't see him
every week.

1981
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:22,540
- Right. That's too...
- It's not every week, but...

1982
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,410
- I'm really not it. This is crazy.
- She's not.

1983
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:25,950
- I'm really not.
- Are you really not?

1984
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,240
I swear I'm not.

1985
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,410
(They send So Min to the cage
because of the text Se Chan found!)

1986
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:30,220
No. For round one,

1987
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,450
- we should put Seog Jeong in.
- Or let's put So Min in and...

1988
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,830
- So Min, come here.
- I...

1989
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:36,450
- Why did you eliminate the suspect?
- I'm not.

1990
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:37,720
- We don't have time.
- Why would I...

1991
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:39,430
- Why would I eliminate Ye Ji?
- Jae Suk.

1992
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:41,370
We have two chances.
You can't put her in.

1993
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:43,560
- Hey.
- I'm really...

1994
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:45,930
Why are you trying to stop me?
You're being ridiculous.

1995
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:47,040
I mean... Think about it.

1996
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,140
Why are you trying to stop me?

1997
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:49,310
There's one hint about her.

1998
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:50,810
So Min, you should go in for now.

1999
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:52,870
- I mean...
- But she...

2000
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:54,200
- So Min.
- It's unfair to put me in...

2001
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,450
because of those text messages.

2002
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:56,640
This isn't rational.

2003
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,350
So Min, go in.

2004
01:06:58,350 --> 01:06:59,520
Why would you put her in?

2005
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,120
- Hold on.
- Wait.

2006
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,540
- We'll lose our chance.
- Mister.

2007
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:03,580
We should vote.
Why are you trying to put her in?

2008
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:04,910
This guy is suspicious.

2009
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:06,020
- Let's vote.
- Right.

2010
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,430
- He wants to put her in quickly.
- What's suspicious about this?

2011
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:08,950
- He wants to put her in quickly.
- Isn't he a little suspicious?

2012
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:10,830
- Let's take a show of hands.
- Should I go in then?

2013
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:12,490
- No.
- We should put Seog Jeong in.

2014
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:13,620
- It can't be you.
- Right.

2015
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:14,930
- It's not me.
- Me?

2016
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:16,890
(The bell starts ringing.)

2017
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:17,990
- Why...
- No.

2018
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:19,970
- You have no rules or basis.
- I don't think it's Seog Jeong.

2019
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:22,040
- The culprit might have a grudge.
- Let's vote.

2020
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,370
- It's four.
- Seog Jeong was kind of...

2021
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,100
- acting strange.
- We don't have time. Hurry up.

2022
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:28,970
Seog Jeong, you go in then.

2023
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,470
- Me?
- No.

2024
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:33,740
- Why would you...
- You have no rules or basis.

2025
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:35,140
There are too many hints.

2026
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:37,290
If it's not Seog Jeong nor So Min,
who is it?

2027
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:39,660
I think it's hard
to find the culprit...

2028
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:42,680
- with these hints anyway.
- There's no reasoning.

2029
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:43,850
You go in.

2030
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,200
This is ridiculous.

2031
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:48,790
- He said "every week."
- He said "every week."

2032
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:51,290
But as Suk Jin said,

2033
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:53,410
just because we found
the text messages,

2034
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:55,770
you can't assume she's the culprit.

2035
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:57,830
But Jae Suk,

2036
01:07:57,830 --> 01:08:01,640
if "every week" is the key
in the text we found at the end...

2037
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:04,970
We should get things straight
about Seog Jeong before moving on.

2038
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:06,120
Seog Jeong, sit down.

2039
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:08,540
(Seog Jeong was brought to justice.)

2040
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:09,620
What did you say?

2041
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:12,260
So many hints are pointing
to Seog Jeong.

2042
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:13,850
- There are so many hints.
- Okay.

2043
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:17,520
Seog Jeong is the first one
brought to trial.

2044
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:19,560
- I'm really not.
- It's So Min.

2045
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,620
- I'll tell you.
- I'm really not.

2046
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:24,540
- Green siren and confetti...
- Will she be eliminated?

2047
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:26,470
mean you caught the culprit.
She'll be eliminated.

2048
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:29,860
Red siren...

2049
01:08:30,370 --> 01:08:32,110
- means your first trial failed.
- Okay.

2050
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:34,010
- But she won't be eliminated.
- She will be eliminated.

2051
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:35,810
Gosh, you guys are...

2052
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:36,980
All right.

2053
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:39,070
The result of the first trial.

2054
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:40,190
(The result of the first trial is?)

2055
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:41,780
- I'm not.
- Is it green?

2056
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:44,820
- Who put me in here?
- The result of the first trial.

2057
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:49,780
(She found the youngest producer
who had been eliminated first.)

2058
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:54,660
(From gardening to singing,)

2059
01:08:54,660 --> 01:09:00,110
(height, and shoe size, most
of the hints were pointing to her.)

2060
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:02,610
The result of the first trial.

2061
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:04,530
Even if it's not her,
we should put her in first.

2062
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:05,680
One.

2063
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,810
Two.

2064
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:07,940
Three.

2065
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,870
- I told you.
- I told you.

2066
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:11,850
(Seog Jeong isn't the culprit.)

2067
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:13,070
- I told you.
- I told you.

2068
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,280
He sees her every week.

2069
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:18,110
- It's So Min.
- He sees her every week.

2070
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:20,580
- I said it wasn't me.
- I told you it was Jeonsobari.

2071
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,260
There will be the last trial
exactly 30 minutes later.

2072
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,360
They will suspect me again.

2073
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,650
- The key is he sees her every week.
- But I'm really not.

2074
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:28,530
I told you I was not.

2075
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:30,830
I said it 300 times.

2076
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:32,660
- I said it was not me.
- I'm sorry.

2077
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,860
- I clearly said it wasn't me.
- You have 30 minutes...

2078
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:35,070
before you put someone in the cage.

2079
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:36,200
I'm not.

2080
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,030
I swear I'm not.

2081
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,280
Just go for now.

2082
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,350
That's what I'm talking about.

2083
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:42,480
It's not me.

2084
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:45,070
It's none of us here.

2085
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:46,890
(Ji Hyo goes straight to get
a laptop with a USB memory stick.)

2086
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:49,520
I should find Suk Jin
to get a laptop.

2087
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,360
(Ji Hyo goes straight to get
a laptop with a USB memory stick.)

2088
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:52,520
I'm really...

2089
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,280
It's so unfair.

2090
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,360
They will say it's me again. Gosh.

2091
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,620
- So Min.
- It's so unfair to me.

2092
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:58,900
So Min. Tell me.

2093
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,970
- So Min, you kept saying that.
- Haha.

2094
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:04,190
Did you say that just now
because I'm here?

2095
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:06,030
- No.
- Did you...

2096
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,360
No way.

2097
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,860
"Gosh, they will say it's me again."

2098
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:12,010
It seems you said it
so that I can hear you.

2099
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:14,810
- Haha.
- To win me over to your side.

2100
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,150
That's a laptop.

2101
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:17,910
Gosh, I have to see.

2102
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:19,110
(Ji Hyo arrived at the gym
where the laptop is.)

2103
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:22,740
(The USB memory stick with
"CCTV number 2" she found earlier.)

2104
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,150
Okay.

2105
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:28,620
Okay.

2106
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:31,450
"CCTV number two."

2107
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:33,290
(She found
the "CCTV number 2" file.)

2108
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:40,700
("CCTV number 2" captured
what happened in the morning.)

2109
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:50,240
(It's a completely different angle
from the CCTV number 1 earlier.)

2110
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:55,080
I just looked over this earlier.

2111
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,220
(Se Chan is in front
of the whiteboard he found earlier.)

2112
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:57,360
This is a little strange.

2113
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,780
(Wet wipes
in front of the whiteboard?)

2114
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:03,860
What's this?

2115
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:05,320
Should I...

2116
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:07,600
Will it show something
if I remove it?

2117
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:10,490
I took a picture, so it'll be okay.

2118
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:12,440
No way.

2119
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:13,730
I think I'll get chills.

2120
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:21,110
(There are letters
that won't be erased?)

2121
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,200
I was right.

2122
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,370
(Ja, Da)

2123
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:25,440
Gosh.

2124
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:28,240
What? Some letters aren't erased.

2125
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:40,690
(After four suspects,)

2126
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:43,570
(the youngest producer
finally appeared.)

2127
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,790
Kim, Beom.

2128
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:49,010
(The whiteboard and the CCTV
are slowly revealing the hints.)

2129
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,400
(What?)

2130
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,820
(The other room?)

2131
01:11:57,820 --> 01:12:02,940
(The youngest producer was killed
in the opposite room.)

2132
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:04,760
(And on the whiteboard...)

2133
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,320
"The culprit is a man."

2134
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:08,730
(Minutes of the 1st
Running Prison Meeting)

2135
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:11,100
(The culprit is a man.)

2136
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,190
This is amazing.

2137
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:15,930
It's one of our members.

2138
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:17,640
(The culprit is one of our members!)

2139
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,140
(The culprit is one of the guys.)

2140
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,400
Among the members...

2141
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,030
(Real suspect number 1: Haha)

2142
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:24,680
- It's you, isn't it?
- Why me?

2143
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:27,310
Why are you suspecting me
out of nowhere?

2144
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,540
Why?

2145
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:31,480
(Real suspect number 1: Haha)

2146
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,190
(There's Jong Kook over there.)

2147
01:12:34,610 --> 01:12:38,410
(Real suspect number 2:
Kim Jong Kook)

2148
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:39,820
Where should I go?

2149
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:40,930
(Real suspect number 2:
Kim Jong Kook)

2150
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:43,820
People were going in and out
of the cage earlier,

2151
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:45,230
but it didn't affect me at all.

2152
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:47,030
(Suspicious)

2153
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,690
Okay. I should have a rest now.

2154
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:59,440
(Real suspect number 3:
Yang Se Chan)

2155
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:00,980
Did you not take it off?

2156
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,650
Why would I do that?

2157
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:03,940
Did you not take off
Ye Ji's name tag?

2158
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,610
- You know what?
- Go on.

2159
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:08,720
I take off the name tag
of important people.

2160
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,480
I don't take off the name tags
of younger ones.

2161
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:11,860
So weak.

2162
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:12,980
(One of these clumsy-looking guys
is today's culprit.)

2163
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:15,390
I hope the sunglasses work.

2164
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:16,950
The culprit...

2165
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:19,860
- Suk Jin, I found it here.
- Where?

2166
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:21,470
No wonder why it was on.

2167
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:23,030
- Look at this.
- Why? Let me see.

2168
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:25,830
(It's still a blank white screen.)

2169
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:28,810
Why? Let me see.

2170
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,530
Right.

2171
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:33,440
- Can you see it?
- "Futsal strategies."

2172
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:35,310
(He can see something
on the screen...)

2173
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,240
(with the glasses on?)

2174
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,520
- Can you see it?
- Yes.

2175
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,150
(It's definitely
a blank white screen.)

2176
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:42,320
- Give them to me.
- Look at this.

2177
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,950
- Let me see it for a moment.
- Wait. 1, 2, 3, 4. Team Blue.

2178
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,890
One, two, three, four. Team Blue.

2179
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:51,690
(It seemed there was no hint
on the monitor!)

2180
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:52,990
Look at this.

2181
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,530
This is...

2182
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:57,360
- Do you see anyone?
- What's this?

2183
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,100
- What colors?
- Futsal strategy board.

2184
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,190
Pink.

2185
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:01,640
(The sunglasses reveal
a mysterious clue.)

2186
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:04,030
This is incredible.

2187
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,040
It's so fascinating
that I can see a different image.

2188
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,480
I can't see it
without the sunglasses.

2189
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,610
It's so fascinating.

2190
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,040
(He decides to take a photo.)

2191
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,350
I should take a photo like this.

2192
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,220
Hold the glasses for a second.

2193
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,390
Not those glasses.
Those are my glasses.

2194
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:18,390
(Those are my glasses.)

2195
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,860
(Jae Suk loves playing
with Suk Jin's glasses.)

2196
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:20,930
I got it.

2197
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,190
There is another pink one.

2198
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:25,400
(The futsal strategy board
is a mystery.)

2199
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,760
What is this?

2200
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,400
There are 2 goalkeepers
from 2 teams.

2201
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,190
One member is having a corner kick.

2202
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:34,860
What is this?

2203
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:36,970
I don't know what this is.

2204
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:38,530
What is this?

2205
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,230
Why is the goalkeeper here?

2206
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,820
Jae Suk and I can't figure out
what this is.

2207
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:45,020
We are out of ideas.

2208
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:47,320
What is this?

2209
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,350
(Futsal?)

2210
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:49,940
Those ones aren't pink.

2211
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,610
They can't be initials, right?

2212
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:52,760
J.K...

2213
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,080
Oh, it would be J then.

2214
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,390
- What?
- Then...

2215
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:58,560
I thought the initials
might point to Jong Kook.

2216
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,760
Jong Kook.

2217
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:01,790
- Hey.
- I didn't see the letters right.

2218
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:03,430
You are saying anything
that comes to mind.

2219
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,860
Do you have another chocolate?

2220
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:07,440
Suk Jin, we are deducing.

2221
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,360
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

2222
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,180
Jong Kook's initials are J.K.

2223
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,510
We played futsal earlier.

2224
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:16,740
(They had a futsal mission earlier.)

2225
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:21,080
Jong Kook made the last attack.

2226
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,350
(Jong Kook charged to the goalpost
despite being a goalkeeper.)

2227
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:24,860
(Is he the culprit?)

2228
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:25,910
That's the only situation
that comes to mind.

2229
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:30,530
(The goalkeepers' positions
were similar in the actual match.)

2230
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:32,620
(Suk Jin's deduction makes sense.)

2231
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:34,400
Jong Kook worked the hardest.

2232
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,900
He ran around by himself.

2233
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,940
Suk Jin, your birthday is
in March, right?

2234
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:40,440
(They go to meet Jong Kook,
a strong candidate.)

2235
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:43,700
- What?
- I wanted to rip it off once.

2236
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:45,310
Then he is out.

2237
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,570
- Really?
- He is out.

2238
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:50,850
- I wanted to rip it off once.
- He is out.

2239
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,150
That's ridiculous.

2240
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:53,780
Whose name tag got ripped off?

2241
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:54,980
- But...
- Jae Suk's.

2242
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:58,220
Jae Suk, you are out.

2243
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,450
- But...
- Ji Young.

2244
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:01,650
(Jae Suk suddenly got eliminated.)

2245
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:02,820
Oh, no.

2246
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:05,900
You can't rip off a name tag
just because you want to.

2247
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:08,470
- You are out if it's removed.
- It's my first time on the show.

2248
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:10,270
His son must be watching
expectantly.

2249
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:11,490
I am sorry.

2250
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:13,070
- His son...
- You are out.

2251
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:14,360
(Jae Suk died in vain.)

2252
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,200
You told me that we aren't having
that kind of a race today.

2253
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,680
It was the most absurd elimination
in the past 12 years.

2254
01:16:19,230 --> 01:16:20,510
Seriously.

2255
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:23,400
- I mean...
- Ji Young, I was eating candy.

2256
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:25,370
It wasn't like that.

2257
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:27,190
Can't I remove a name tag?

2258
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:28,410
Removing it leads to elimination.

2259
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:29,410
- Not today.
- It leads to elimination.

2260
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:30,890
No. Removing it leads
to elimination.

2261
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,580
Jae Suk.

2262
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:33,820
Ji Young, why did you do that?

2263
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:36,080
(Jae Suk got eliminated
because of Ji Young.)

2264
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:40,060
Who eliminated
the youngest producer?

2265
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:42,160
(Jong Kook is searching the place
by himself.)

2266
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,490
Hold on.

2267
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,100
What?

2268
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:47,860
What is this?

2269
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,480
Hold on.

2270
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:53,780
What is this?

2271
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:56,940
What is this?

2272
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,820
It's a broken clock.

2273
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:00,650
What is a broken clock doing here?

2274
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:02,910
(A broken electronic clock
from Age Tech)

2275
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,580
This must represent a number.

2276
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:07,450
I don't know what to do with it.

2277
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:10,320
Perhaps I need to use
the sunglasses.

2278
01:17:12,490 --> 01:17:13,760
Hold on.

2279
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,360
Hold on.

2280
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,530
(Did he figure something out?)

2281
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:20,270
The empty spots make...

2282
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:22,140
numbers.

2283
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:23,570
Four.

2284
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:25,830
Four.

2285
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:28,010
Four.

2286
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,740
My goodness.

2287
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:31,780
Hold on.

2288
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:36,020
Hold on.

2289
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:37,980
What do these numbers mean?

2290
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:40,280
The numbers are 44, 42...

2291
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:44,450
The numbers are 44, 42, and 37.

2292
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:46,190
Age?

2293
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:47,320
Hold on.

2294
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:48,690
My goodness.

2295
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:51,290
(A hint that points to the culprit:
44, 42, and 37)

2296
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:52,530
You know,

2297
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:55,030
Se Chan is 37 years old.

2298
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,870
Haha is 44 years old.

2299
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:05,680
(Out of the four culprits,
those who fit the hint...)

2300
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:09,020
(are Haha and Se Chan!)

2301
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,110
Hold on.

2302
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:12,080
(One of them is the culprit.)

2303
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,230
Those punks. Hold on.

2304
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:17,990
I knew something was strange.

2305
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,490
Did you find something?

2306
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:21,320
It's either Se Chan or Haha.

2307
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,530
- You are right.
- There are two candidates.

2308
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:24,830
Seriously.

2309
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:26,530
(The inmates got fooled
all day long.)

2310
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:31,310
We suspected So Min
and the guests for no reason.

2311
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:32,640
(Meanwhile, Haha approaches...)

2312
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,610
(the monitor that shows
the futsal strategy.)

2313
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:37,870
These are the sunglasses.

2314
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:40,150
(Haha looks at the monitor
with the sunglasses Suk Jin left.)

2315
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:42,740
This is what we did earlier.

2316
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:45,410
There they are.

2317
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,080
Everyone is here. Jong Kook.

2318
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,280
The culprit isn't Ji Hyo or So Min.

2319
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,360
(The prime suspect came
on his own volition.)

2320
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,950
- It's one of the members.
- That's right.

2321
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:53,650
We figured it out from a CCTV video.

2322
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:56,100
- Really?
- It isn't one of them.

2323
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,290
It isn't one of the guests.

2324
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:58,790
Is it Jae Suk? Is it Suk Jin?

2325
01:18:58,790 --> 01:19:00,160
- Jae Suk got eliminated.
- He is out.

2326
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:01,970
Jae Suk is out.

2327
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:04,440
He came to frame Jae Suk,

2328
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,900
so he became flustered
upon learning the news.

2329
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:07,110
That's not true.

2330
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:09,040
Think about what I did today.
I played the games diligently.

2331
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,040
I found so many hints.

2332
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,720
It's either you or Haha.

2333
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:16,220
(Se Chan says he isn't the culprit.
Haha deduces for a while.)

2334
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:20,730
(Haha noticed something.)

2335
01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:24,360
- Suk Jin, I am not that smart.
- It's a man.

2336
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:27,030
You know that. I am not that smart.

2337
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:28,820
I found so many hints.

2338
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:29,860
(Everyone got fooled...)

2339
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:33,190
(by the culprit who is hiding
among the members.)

2340
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:36,940
(Who is the real culprit?)

2341
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:39,180
Haha!

2342
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:41,940
(He blurted out the name, Haha.)

2343
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:44,480
That's what you get if you type
the characters in Korean.

2344
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,220
That's what you get if you type
the characters in Korean.

2345
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:51,410
(There is a keyboard
under the monitor.)

2346
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:55,450
(Ha)

2347
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:57,990
(Haha)

2348
01:19:58,450 --> 01:20:01,100
(A few hours ago)

2349
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:05,100
(Suk Jin found a laptop.)

2350
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:08,610
(From the start,)

2351
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:12,330
(the laptop had files in the bin.)

2352
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:15,870
(But everyone focused on
the files on the wallpaper.)

2353
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,980
(In the bin was...)

2354
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:23,440
(a video named "CCTV 3.")

2355
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:30,390
(The culprit was Haha.)

2356
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:34,320
(9:33am,
10 minutes before the crime)

2357
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:36,120
(In the room the youngest producer
got called to...)

2358
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,270
There you are.

2359
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:41,310
(was Haha.)

2360
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:42,860
There you are.

2361
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:44,780
(The youngest producer
put on an emotional performance.)

2362
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:45,830
Hey.

2363
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:48,610
What's up with you?

2364
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:50,870
Give me some information.

2365
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,740
I can't do that.

2366
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:53,820
Hey.

2367
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:58,780
It's nothing hard.
I will buy you meat, okay?

2368
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:00,020
(Haha threatened him to provide
information on the missions.)

2369
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,730
Give me some information.

2370
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:03,360
You punk!

2371
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,690
(But when he refused,
Haha began to beat him up.)

2372
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:06,790
You punk!

2373
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:09,400
(The man who is 168cm tall
became violent.)

2374
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:13,970
(He took out
the assistant producer in anger.)

2375
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:16,610
(Haha committed a crime by mistake.)

2376
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:18,030
Hey, Jong Seo.

2377
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:20,310
Jong Seo.

2378
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:23,200
(The youngest producer ran out
in order to survive.)

2379
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,320
(In the end, he got eliminated.)

2380
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,820
(His dying messages were
"A higher-up" and "Producer...")

2381
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:30,580
(because Haha's YouTube Channel
is "Producer Haha.")

2382
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,950
It's all over me.

2383
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:34,120
(Blue blood splattered
on Haha's clothing.)

2384
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:36,320
It's all over me.

2385
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,060
I should change
into Young Jin's clothes.

2386
01:21:41,290 --> 01:21:45,190
(Thus, he left the crime scene.)

2387
01:21:46,030 --> 01:21:47,860
Aren't you wearing the same clothes
as Young Jin?

2388
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:50,230
He bought 2,
so I asked him to give me 1.

2389
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:51,570
(There was something he did
as soon as he got imprisoned.)

2390
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:52,940
All right.

2391
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:54,740
What is this?

2392
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:57,200
(CCTV videos
are stored in this laptop.)

2393
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,280
Look at this.

2394
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,720
There is a CCTV video.

2395
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,520
Let's erase it.

2396
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,020
(Haha found a video of himself.)

2397
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:08,820
There we go. Okay.

2398
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,080
(He hurriedly erased the file.)

2399
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,290
They won't suspect me now.

2400
01:22:11,290 --> 01:22:12,490
Shall I break the laptop?

2401
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:17,030
Soul. Song. Dream.

2402
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:18,730
They refer to my family.

2403
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:24,730
(Haha realized that
the last part refers to his family.)

2404
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:27,780
(He quickly got rid of the letter.)

2405
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:35,820
(He discarded other hints
as soon as he found them.)

2406
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,980
I need to watch out for Ye Ji.

2407
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:39,190
She is really good
at finding the hints.

2408
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:41,280
- It's suspicious.
- What is it?

2409
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,390
(Ye Ji found a crucial hint
before she got eliminated.)

2410
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:44,530
Germany.

2411
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,990
Germany.

2412
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:49,030
(Haha was born in Germany.)

2413
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:50,990
(She got eliminated in the end.)

2414
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:52,860
(Haha took Ye Ji out
and hid his identity.)

2415
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:53,990
Germany.

2416
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:55,400
(Haha took Ye Ji out
and hid his identity.)

2417
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:00,610
(He quickly discards
the sunglasses.)

2418
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,440
If this gets out,
I will get caught for sure.

2419
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:09,940
Think about what I did today.
I played the games diligently.

2420
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:12,020
I found so many hints.

2421
01:23:12,410 --> 01:23:16,820
According to my deductions,
it's Haha.

2422
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,730
Haha isn't here.

2423
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:20,560
- Haha.
- Have you seen Haha?

2424
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:22,400
- I think it's Haha.
- Have you seen Haha?

2425
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,190
(I think it's Haha.)

2426
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:26,570
This is really bad.

2427
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:29,010
Hold on. In that case...

2428
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:31,230
(Haha is under too much suspicion
to get through the last trial.)

2429
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:33,140
Where should I go?

2430
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:35,480
Where should I go? Hey, then...

2431
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:39,350
The last trial will take place at 4 p.m.

2432
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:43,610
I just need to hold out until then.

2433
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:45,260
It will be over
if I don't show up, right?

2434
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,480
(He decides to hold out
by not showing up.)

2435
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,930
(He refuses to go to trial.)

2436
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:52,530
I will hide well.

2437
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:55,270
I just need to hold out until 4 p.m.

2438
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,430
- Let's go over there.
- Yes.

2439
01:23:57,430 --> 01:23:59,470
- Let's go find him.
- Where is Haha?

2440
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:02,230
Inmates of Running Prison,

2441
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:04,330
the second trial will begin
in five minutes.

2442
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:05,980
Please gather around.

2443
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:08,180
Let's hurry up and catch Haha.

2444
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:10,740
Let's catch him.
Won't there be the last trial?

2445
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:12,280
There will be, right?

2446
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:15,540
- It works the same way as before.
- We'll gather again?

2447
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:16,820
- But not everyone is there, right?
- Maybe not everyone will gather.

2448
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:18,260
- The culprit may avoid the trial.
- Exactly.

2449
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:19,560
- He might not come.
- Yes.

2450
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,430
Haha will definitely run away.

2451
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:24,230
(The other inmates also realized
that Haha might flee.)

2452
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,230
Hey, catch Haha.

2453
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:27,690
It's Haha!

2454
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:29,270
Haha is the culprit!

2455
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:30,490
Dong Hoon!

2456
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:31,490
(The chase began.)

2457
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:32,940
Isn't Haha there?

2458
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:35,470
He was with me earlier.

2459
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:37,440
He stabbed me in the back.

2460
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,480
(He feels betrayed.)

2461
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:40,730
- I can't believe this.
- What do I do now?

2462
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:42,010
Where should I hide?

2463
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:44,010
(He's not allowed to hide
in the building for fairness' sake.)

2464
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:45,980
I just have to hold out until 4 p.m.

2465
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,780
We're running out of time.
This is bad.

2466
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:48,890
Where is the map?

2467
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,020
Gosh, that sly punk.

2468
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,520
My feet hurt. Darn it.

2469
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,730
- Find him!
- This is driving me nuts.

2470
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:57,320
I think they're looking for me.

2471
01:24:57,820 --> 01:24:59,060
Gosh, this feels never-ending.

2472
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:00,150
Haha!

2473
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:02,770
- Where are you?
- They're here.

2474
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:06,490
(Haha is getting cornered.)

2475
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:11,700
There. He's over there.

2476
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:14,010
I found him. He's over there.

2477
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,280
- We're running out of time.
- Suk Jin.

2478
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,320
- Where?
- Go straight!

2479
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:21,650
- He must be there.
- Straight!

2480
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:23,940
They found him. I heard it.

2481
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,560
- Haha!
- Where?

2482
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,410
- This way.
- Hurry up!

2483
01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:29,080
Where is he?

2484
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,080
(But at that moment...)

2485
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,790
- It's over. Darn.
- Where is he?

2486
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:34,430
(The last bell rang.)

2487
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:38,230
All inmates of Running Prison,
please come to the court.

2488
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:39,790
(The race ended.)

2489
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:41,140
Coward, come out.

2490
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,230
- We failed.
- Didn't you find him?

2491
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:46,900
- What?
- Didn't you catch him?

2492
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:48,700
- We couldn't catch him.
- He hid.

2493
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:49,940
This is ridiculous.

2494
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:51,520
Dong Hoon hid.

2495
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,720
We failed to catch the culprit.

2496
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,320
(Haha is
the winner of today's race.)

2497
01:25:58,610 --> 01:26:01,230
It was so hard to make someone else
look like a culprit.

2498
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:04,360
I almost got caught in the gym.

2499
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:06,990
Had he read the letter once more,
it would've been over.

2500
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:08,400
(Had Jong Kook read the letter
once more, it would've been over.)

2501
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:09,990
(Haha survived to the end
after the unprecedented escape.)

2502
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:11,230
Good job.

2503
01:26:11,230 --> 01:26:13,230
(Haha survived to the end
after the unprecedented escape.)

2504
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,860
Dong Hoon, come out. You coward.

2505
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:18,530
This is a huge place,
and he's so small.

2506
01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:21,350
How could we have found him?

2507
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,440
(The heart of the global economy)

2508
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:25,610
(Wall Street)

2509
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:28,020
- I'll be at the top of Wall Street.
- Oh, my gosh.

2510
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:31,360
(Running Man goes to New York!)

2511
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:32,890
(They're all jerks!)

2512
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:34,320
(A week earlier)

2513
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,730
(There's a quote
about stock investment.)

2514
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:37,230
(Jump in when you hear wailing.)

2515
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:39,190
(The American
stock investment dream)

2516
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:41,820
(Prepare yourselves
with the new members!)

2517
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:43,820
Mom, I'm sorry
that I didn't study hard.

2518
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:47,070
(You must not stop studying
if you want to make investments.)

2519
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:48,770
One, two, three.

2520
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:52,530
(You must be mentally strong enough
to endure continuous declines!)

2521
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:54,330
It could fall
just as that banner did.

2522
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:57,110
(Hope helps to turn a crisis
