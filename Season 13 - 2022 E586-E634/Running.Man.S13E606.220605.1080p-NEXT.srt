00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,810
(Last February)

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,550
(With the stock investment craze,)

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,440
(2021 Running Man
Investment Contest took place.)

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,180
(The self-proclaimed masters
simulated stock investments.)

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,050
(They made investments
in their own ways.)

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,050
The small investors are gathering.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,850
(All they can count on
is information.)

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,070
(They bought information
at Information Exchange.)

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,590
(The small investors
started their investments.)

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,770
(When the Watch-Night bell rings,)

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,370
(the stock prices of the year
are released.)

12
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,800
(The results of their investments
in the first year)

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,410
(Some investors earned money,)

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,440
(and some investors lost money.)

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,980
Why did you not trust me?

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,260
(The novice investors' investment
with all sorts of human emotions)

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,760
- Please. Biotechnology.
- Yes!

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,490
(F Biotechnology, G Foods)

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,990
(The investment contest
turned into madness.)

20
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,340
(The young and rich investor
dreamed of a new life.)

21
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,360
(When you see others' success,)

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,610
(you get jealous.)

23
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,330
- I can't believe this.
- Yes!

24
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,000
- Okay!
- Look at that.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,610
- I invested in biotechnology.
- I'm young and rich!

26
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,520
(It was like a party
when the stock prices soared.)

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,110
(J Shipbuilding)

28
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,310
B Entertainment
increased by 100 percent.

29
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,690
(Suk Jin went all in
on the shipbuilding stocks.)

30
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,980
(Ji Suk Jin went broke
after investing in shipbuilding.)

31
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,360
(He proved that he's got
the hand of Minus.)

32
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,860
(The investment contest
ended in great success.)

33
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,970
(A year later, the year 2022)

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,870
(The KOSPI reached below 2,600
hitting a 17-month low.)

35
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,420
(The uncertainty continues
until the second half of the year.)

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,020
(The investment gurus are gathered
again to break through the crisis.)

37
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,280
- Hey.
- Hello.

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,520
Hello.

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,690
- What are we doing today?
- Running Stock Investment Club.

40
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,950
We're investing in stocks today.

41
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,060
- My gosh.
- I love it.

42
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,750
- Investment?
- Gosh, this is...

43
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,890
- About stock investment...
- Is this a seminar?

44
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,120
So Min invested 500 dollars...

45
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,420
in coins and made some money.

46
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,890
- Right.
- It went up to 640 dollars.

47
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,100
But it's minus 24 percent now.

48
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,300
You should've sold them.

49
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,110
- It wasn't long ago.
- Right.

50
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,400
- I told you to sell them.
- It plummeted.

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,300
- She didn't listen.
- Did you invest in coins?

52
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,270
That's how things work
for coin and stock investment.

53
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,800
Once the price increases...

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,550
- Did you make a profit?
- No, I didn't.

55
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,980
- I didn't, but...
- Suk Jin said...

56
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,020
- Suk Jin.
- What?

57
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,140
You haven't made
any profit for 20 years.

58
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,290
That's not true.

59
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,520
- It's not like that.
- It's just strange.

60
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,890
I have a bigger picture.

61
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,890
He's a pushover.

62
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,330
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

63
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,980
Why are you wearing your blanket?

64
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,700
- This is...
- It's a patchwork quilt.

65
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,230
- They look like colored paper.
- It's not like that.

66
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,890
You can wear pants like these if you
make money on the stock market.

67
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,990
- Suk Jin.
- You always say that.

68
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,700
- These are designer clothes.
- I feel like crying.

69
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,770
Why?

70
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,010
You're Kim Young Man,
the origami master.

71
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,140
Mr. Kottakji.

72
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,640
Gosh, I don't want
to say this, but...

73
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,800
- What did you say?
- He's Kim Young Man.

74
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Mr. Kottakji.

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,350
We have Kim Young Man here.

76
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,450
You can wear pants like these
if you succeed.

77
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,710
I should make an origami crane
with your pants later.

78
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,890
Do you know anything
about stock investment?

79
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,480
Do you know
anything about this club?

80
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,520
I heard the stock prices
are falling a lot these days.

81
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,580
- Right.
- Are you all right?

82
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,360
- Is it bad for you?
- It's terrible.

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,230
- It's really bad.
- I invested in a few stocks,

84
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,330
and they all fell a lot.

85
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,700
I recently invested in a few stocks
with no information.

86
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,890
- It's the same every week.
- It's all in blue.

87
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,770
- That's why...
- They all should get up.

88
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,230
our production staff
rarely check their phones now.

89
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,770
When the market was thriving,

90
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,010
- Right.
- even during the shoot,

91
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,800
the cameramen checked
their phones like this.

92
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,270
Exactly.

93
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,300
- They were like this.
- Right.

94
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,710
They were so happy.

95
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,170
- It was all red.
- They worked with a smile.

96
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,290
But now it's nothing like that.

97
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,980
- It's in recession.
- They don't even touch phones.

98
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,260
There's an old saying
about stock investment.

99
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,420
"Invest when people struggle."

100
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,180
- Exactly. I remembered the saying.
- This is what people say.

101
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,050
But you're the one who's struggling.

102
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,360
I'm struggling.

103
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,800
I invested even more
while I was struggling.

104
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,700
You should just do the opposite
of what Suk Jin does...

105
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,100
- when you invest in stocks.
- Right. Just do the opposite.

106
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,390
I made an investment
following Suk Jin.

107
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,610
- What is it?
- Right? Se Chan did it too.

108
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,330
- The investment.
- That thing?

109
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,700
- I'm counting on it, Suk Jin.
- Gosh.

110
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,510
What is it called?
Unicorn? Star start?

111
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,450
- You mean a start-up?
- What is a unicorn?

112
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,080
I don't know.
He said something like that.

113
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,520
Let me tell you
what a unicorn means.

114
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,110
It's a company that's worth
over a billion dollars.

115
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,180
We hope it will be a unicorn.
But it's not one yet.

116
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,790
- It has a promising future.
- That's our hope.

117
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,890
- I didn't even know.
- It has a clear vision.

118
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,980
- Suk Jin...
- It doesn't have a horn yet.

119
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,150
Suk Jin also told me about it.

120
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,700
I thought about it, but I didn't
invest in it because of Suk Jin.

121
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,830
(I didn't invest in the company
because Suk Jin did.)

122
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,440
See? Jae Suk is wise.

123
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,890
- Jae Suk never follows him.
- It's not like that.

124
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,530
- It's your decision to make.
- Sure.

125
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,530
You shouldn't make an investment
just because of what I say.

126
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,530
It was my decision.

127
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,900
So I asked Suk Jin.
"What are you going to do?"

128
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,900
"I'll go for it."
So I decided to give up.

129
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,450
Sometimes Suk Jin does this.

130
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,970
- What?
- He sends some videos...

131
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,180
about investments and real estate.

132
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,280
He wants me to study.

133
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,020
- But Suk Jin is...
- You know people like this.

134
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,690
There's a student who studies hard
for his exam.

135
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,950
But he doesn't even know
what the test will be on.

136
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,990
So he doesn't do well on the test.

137
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,760
Suk Jin is steady though.

138
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,430
The land he bought 20 years ago
still remains the same.

139
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,440
That's just amazing.

140
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,790
- Hey.
- What?

141
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,290
- That's my sore spot.
- It is true.

142
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,770
- That's my sore spot.
- Land prices have increased a lot,

143
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,900
but the price of yours didn't go up.

144
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,900
That's really interesting.

145
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,180
I heard land prices increase
from one generation to the next.

146
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,540
- What?
- From one generation to the next.

147
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,540
- So will it go up after I die?
- Yes.

148
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,700
It will happen in his next life.

149
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,210
- Will it go up after I die?
- It will go to your son.

150
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,970
It's good for your son.

151
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,540
The price will go up
when your son inherits the land.

152
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,410
Your work is going well though.

153
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,410
Right.

154
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,620
You can't have it both ways.

155
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,490
- I can't have it all.
- You can't.

156
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,190
And your love life is going well.
I mean, with your wife.

157
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,260
- What?
- Your love life with your wife.

158
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,260
It's still hot.

159
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,520
"It's still hot."

160
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,790
(He claims
their love is still burning.)

161
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,200
He's so good at lying.

162
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,510
He's a good liar.

163
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,400
No. It's true.

164
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,640
I guess our love is burning
after all these years.

165
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,380
- My gosh.
- No one...

166
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,840
seems to believe that.

167
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,970
You don't understand.
Do you think I'm lying?

168
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,250
No one is jealous of him.

169
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,250
- He's just saying that.
- They think he's just saying that.

170
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,690
We had the Running Man
Investment Contest last year.

171
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,780
And we led the prosperous time
in the stock market.

172
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,790
- Right.
- Last year,

173
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,220
- things were going well.
- It was really good.

174
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,760
It was a masterpiece.

175
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,160
All those who invested in stocks...

176
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,500
They all made profits.

177
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,270
- They made a lot of money.
- Everyone was happy.

178
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,440
Se Chan made hundreds
of thousands of dollars...

179
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
- only with 500 dollars.
- Right.

180
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,510
How much did you make?

181
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,180
I could buy a fancy car.

182
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,140
Right. You made
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

183
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,380
So we are going to the US this time.

184
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,640
The US?

185
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,910
(The investment gurus are
going to the US this time.)

186
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,180
- The US?
- Really?

187
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,190
I don't know anything
about the US market.

188
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,280
The US market?

189
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,750
The US stock market?

190
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,760
(They are going to Wall Street,
the financial center of the world.)

191
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,220
Before you go to the US,

192
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,260
we will have a seminar.

193
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,590
- Okay.
- And we have two big investors...

194
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,220
who will join the seminar today.

195
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,330
- Really?
- Who are they?

196
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,590
- Experts?
- All right.

197
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,000
Please bring in
the big investors now.

198
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,330
I know one of them. Seriously...

199
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,770
I bet they are experts.

200
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,970
My gosh.

201
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,450
Hang on.

202
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,670
Gosh, Sae Ho.

203
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,240
- It's Young Ji.
- Hey, Young Ji.

204
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,180
- What?
- Sae Ho.

205
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,890
- My gosh.
- Young Ji.

206
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,220
- Nice to meet you.
- Come here, Young Ji.

207
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,910
What is going on?

208
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,390
- Hello, Young Ji.
- Hi.

209
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,890
- Hey.
- Wait. Sae Ho.

210
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,530
Gosh, he reeks of perfume.

211
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,620
We don't need a peddler.

212
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,700
Gosh, that's so strong.

213
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,100
- Wait. Gosh, you reek with perfume.
- Look at his bracelet.

214
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,600
Look at his bracelet.
Gosh, that's a strong smell.

215
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,360
What are you wearing?

216
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,540
I'm sorry.

217
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,770
- Please slow down.
- Gosh, it's so strong.

218
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,060
I'll count to three.

219
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,010
Please don't say it
all at the same time.

220
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,450
- What's the copper bracelet?
- It's not a copper bracelet.

221
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,580
- This is...
- Copper prices fell a lot.

222
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,740
- It's not a copper bracelet.
- Did you melt coins to make it?

223
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,280
I didn't melt coins.

224
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,790
I went to a department store.

225
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,910
- Did you buy it?
- I went to a department store...

226
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,290
and bought it for myself.

227
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,180
Gosh, it hurts.

228
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,420
I want you to stay quiet.
We have Young Ji here.

229
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,220
I just don't get a chance
to explain myself.

230
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,700
- You don't have to say anything.
- Young Ji.

231
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,360
I've never seen Sae Ho...

232
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,490
- feel so nervous before.
- He pretends to feel nervous.

233
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,660
He always seems confident.

234
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,600
But he was stamping
his feet anxiously earlier.

235
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,930
- He couldn't stand still.
- The thing is...

236
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,950
I feel nervous during the opening.

237
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,580
- Because we all come at him.
- I know they will come at me.

238
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,280
He's wearing the sneakers again.

239
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,350
- Really?
- Right.

240
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,610
- What is the brand?
- It's Chanel.

241
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,950
I was told that I should
look like a successful man.

242
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,850
Do you invest in stocks?

243
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,180
Stocks?

244
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,590
- He does.
- I do.

245
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,180
But I need to watch my mouth.

246
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,330
Is your investment going well?

247
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,200
- You know it.
- What do we know?

248
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,920
Well... It's not like...

249
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,930
- This is all I can say.
- He's got more wrinkles.

250
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,700
I bet things are not going well.

251
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,910
- It's going well.
- Is it?

252
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,010
I got smile-wrinkles.

253
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,660
- Smile-wrinkles?
- Doesn't Sae Ho look scary?

254
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,430
Something has changed.

255
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,410
- Are you tanned...
- Did you get tanned?

256
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,740
- He got tanned.
- Or do you have a liver problem?

257
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,080
- I think he has a liver problem.
- Did you get tanned?

258
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,150
Your skin gets dark
when you have a liver problem.

259
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,170
He looks drunk.

260
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,520
You have wrinkles on your forehead.

261
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,980
It looks like you have jaundice.

262
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,180
- He seems jaundiced.
- My gosh.

263
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,410
By the way,

264
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,050
you guys are unbelievable.

265
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,230
I have a healthy liver.

266
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,000
I recently had a blood test,
and I'm very healthy.

267
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,920
- That's TMI.
- What about your hair?

268
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,320
Is it greasy
because you didn't wash it?

269
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
It's not like that.

270
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,160
I put some hair grease
and wax on my hair.

271
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,770
I saw a cow licking his hair.

272
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,040
Do we have a cow here?

273
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,510
- Young Ji is funny.
- Young Ji is joining us.

274
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,140
- Young Ji and I are very close.
- Right.

275
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,110
- We used to live together.
- What?

276
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,150
(Did you two live together?)

277
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,480
She means a TV show.

278
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,980
- It was "Roommates."
- The SBS TV show.

279
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,910
Young Ji, I was startled.

280
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,180
Young Ji wants to attract
people's attention.

281
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
- Did it work?
- It's for a thumbnail image.

282
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,550
- I was surprised.
- It's for a preview.

283
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,820
So is something going on
between you two?

284
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,160
He's not interested in Young Ji.

285
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,590
- He liked Nana back then.
- It's for a thumbnail image.

286
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,690
He liked Nana.

287
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,230
- He liked Nana.
- He was interested in Nana.

288
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,770
- He really liked her.
- That's true.

289
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,160
- I'm sorry.
- It's true though.

290
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,290
- He liked her for real.
- He liked her?

291
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,660
He liked her for real.

292
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,300
I heard he had asked her out.

293
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,410
- Right.
- That's...

294
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,570
That's TMI.

295
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,010
- That's TMI.
- He says it's TMI.

296
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,910
- We all know that.
- I've never...

297
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,040
said that on TV.

298
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,710
You sang "Confession"
in a karaoke room for her?

299
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,880
- That was for Jang Do Yeon.
- I see.

300
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,390
How many women were there?

301
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,040
So you like tall women.

302
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,120
Actually,

303
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,550
it doesn't have to be a tall woman.

304
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,920
I just liked them.

305
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,230
Wait. This is upsetting.

306
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,580
Why do you not like So Min?

307
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,420
- I don't like him either.
- So Min is tall.

308
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,590
Why do you hate her?

309
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,870
- I don't like him either.
- I...

310
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,090
I never said that I hated her.

311
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,190
- You two will make a cute couple.
- The thing is,

312
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,870
I just feel like
So Min is making jokes.

313
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,370
So I'm just doing the same thing.

314
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,700
- Why would I...
- I wanted to set you up with her.

315
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,110
What if I'm serious?

316
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,700
- What if I'm serious?
- Are you serious?

317
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,440
(He asks if she's serious,
pointing his finger at her.)

318
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,910
Why would you talk to her like that?

319
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,620
- Wait.
- He sounds so fastidious.

320
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,180
I don't like...

321
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,450
- the idea of these two dating.
- Actually,

322
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,580
this is TMI, but my parents...

323
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,920
like So Min a lot.

324
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,160
- Parents like me.
- She's so cheerful.

325
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,420
Then you should let
your parents have dinner with her.

326
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,060
- Me...
- Without you.

327
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,770
My parents and her?

328
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,910
My father also likes Sae Ho.

329
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,010
- He likes Sae Ho?
- He does.

330
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,670
Then both your parents
should meet up without you guys.

331
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,010
Only the parents.

332
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,170
- Only the parents without us.
- Right.

333
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,170
The families can meet up
and talk about marriage.

334
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,670
What perfume are you wearing?

335
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,310
It's a foreign brand.

336
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,520
You should throw it away.

337
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,180
Wait.

338
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,810
- Why would he throw it away?
- Throw it away.

339
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,630
Why...

340
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,790
- Why would he throw it away?
- It smells like cattle feed.

341
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,130
It's just like a stock investment.

342
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,130
You shouldn't throw it away
when you are told to.

343
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,090
I'd think,
"Should I throw it away now?"

344
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,320
(Groaning)

345
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,460
(He pinches Sae Ho
for the 2nd time.)

346
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,590
Stay quiet.

347
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,830
- Let Young Ji talk.
- Okay.

348
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,930
- Let her talk.
- It's Young Ji's time.

349
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,640
- It's Young Ji.
- Young Ji.

350
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,800
Hey.

351
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,940
Young Ji is so bright.

352
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,570
- What was this?
- What was that?

353
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,780
I wanted to look cheerful.

354
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,040
- He sounded so depressed.
- Right.

355
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,180
Your skin tone is
different from his.

356
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,080
Young Ji, did you go on a diet?

357
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,450
- You seem...
- Did you lose weight?

358
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,360
I've been losing some weight.

359
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,660
- I see.
- Why?

360
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,400
Is that because of
your stock investment?

361
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,690
- No. The stocks are fine.
- Really?

362
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,660
I invested in two companies.

363
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,090
And they are blue-chip stocks.

364
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,660
I've invested in them
for a long time.

365
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,540
I believe they will grow over time.

366
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,110
- And I don't check the prices.
- In stock investment,

367
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,040
nothing is steady.

368
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,840
- Why would you...
- Just say something good.

369
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,620
- That's how things work.
- She studied and made her choice.

370
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,340
She doesn't know anything
about stock investments.

371
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,250
Even blue-chip companies are
influenced by the flow.

372
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,340
What flow?

373
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,550
- He can't even talk right.
- The investment flows.

374
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,860
Did you end up like this
because you know a lot about stocks?

375
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,920
Of course.

376
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,030
Anyway, I have experienced failure.

377
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,130
You know what? I think
Suk Jin and Sae Ho...

378
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,530
look down on each other.

379
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,870
(Suk Jin and Sae Ho
look down on each other.)

380
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,660
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize, you punk.

381
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,140
They are two tankers.

382
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,140
- You have rough hands.
- I know. They are chapped.

383
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,880
- They criticize each other.
- All right.

384
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,930
Don't wear a fake watch.

385
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,980
Why would I wear a fake watch
on an SBS TV show?

386
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,380
- Don't wear things like that.
- Okay.

387
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,280
- This is it.
- Is that it?

388
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,310
You're done.

389
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,040
This is all you have, right?

390
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,520
Yes. This is all I have.

391
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,390
- You're done.
- I'm done.

392
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,550
The ending is somewhat lukewarm.

393
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,760
That's what Sae Ho always does.

394
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,030
There's nothing big.

395
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,270
You need to find something...

396
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,870
- to laugh at on your own.
- That's right.

397
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,590
I just give you some sources.

398
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,200
And you need to collect it yourself.

399
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,510
The nine of you are
gathered together...

400
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,780
with the dream
of going to Wall Street in New York.

401
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,070
I'm like DiCaprio.

402
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,540
You guys are genius investors.

403
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,170
- What?
- My gosh.

404
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,020
You will leave for New York
this afternoon.

405
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,940
- We will be busy.
- Before you leave,

406
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,080
you will have a seminar here.

407
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,580
- Will there be a seminar?
- Yes.

408
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,400
After each session, the members
who do a great job will get points.

409
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
As you might know,
you can use the points...

410
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,920
to buy information
for your stock investment.

411
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,400
It's important to buy information.

412
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
- Right. I watched it too.
- It is very important.

413
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,700
Let's go downstairs
for the seminar then.

414
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,070
- Okay.
- Let's go.

415
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,670
What is this?

416
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,790
- Are we studying again?
- Do we have to study?

417
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,890
Study?

418
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,020
(Don't give up. It's not too late
to escape from Empty Heads.)

419
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,680
Gosh, this feels familiar.

420
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,260
- Aren't you used to this?
- I'm used to this.

421
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,530
- You and So Min.
- I don't want to memorize words.

422
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,730
I won't be able to sleep tonight.

423
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,130
I will have to use my brain.

424
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,500
Gosh, this is so...

425
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,030
Young Ji is Empty Head.

426
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,290
She's the new Empty Head.

427
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,690
(She sighs looking at books.)

428
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,700
I'm in trouble.

429
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,870
Did you do well at school, Young Ji?

430
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,930
I was good in elementary school.

431
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,410
Everyone was good
in elementary school.

432
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,340
In elementary school, we learned
Korean language, math, and so on.

433
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,300
- I was in second place in school.
- Really?

434
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,670
- Second place?
- I gave only two wrong answers.

435
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,410
- You were good.
- She studied in New Zealand.

436
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,910
- Do you speak good English?
- No.

437
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,120
- Young Ji is like a native speaker.
- Really?

438
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,790
- Just say you are.
- Oh, right.

439
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,360
- Just say you are.
- Oh, right.

440
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,530
What are you doing?

441
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,690
Is that what you do?

442
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,770
I speak good English.

443
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,630
Sae Ho, you speak English, right?

444
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,370
- English?
- He's pretty good.

445
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,460
I can carry on a basic conversation.

446
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,510
Do you know
what "E" of e-mail stands for?

447
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,910
- I won't say anything.
- Why not?

448
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,040
- Tell us.
- I think I'm being looked down on.

449
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,540
- What does "E" of email stand for?
- Gosh.

450
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,280
- Do you know the answer, Young Ji?
- English?

451
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,840
Gosh, he says English.

452
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,980
What did you say?

453
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,150
- English.
- He says English.

454
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,250
Isn't it English mail?

455
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,490
He's Empty Head.

456
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,490
English?

457
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,860
- He's just making a joke.
- He's serious.

458
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,990
- I'm a comedian.
- English mail.

459
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,860
- You know I'm a comedian.
- You should be serious.

460
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,550
- That wasn't a joke.
- Hey, excuse me.

461
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,590
- "Hey, excuse me."
- Excuse me.

462
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,630
- Excuse-me mail?
- Excuse me.

463
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,420
All right.
Before you leave for New York,

464
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,000
you will take a class
to survive on Wall Street.

465
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,300
It's called
Empty Head Economics Class.

466
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,610
- I'm not good at this.
- Do you remember the quiz you had?

467
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

468
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,570
(Running Man Quiz Championship
took place last fall.)

469
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,440
(The Empty Heads had
private tutors before the quiz.)

470
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,680
(- "The Tale of Hong Gil Dong."
- Hohyeonghoje.)

471
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,120
(The tutors tried hard
to teach the Empty Heads.)

472
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,950
(He was under a lot of stress
teaching himself.)

473
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,660
(And Se Chan did a great job
after the private tutoring.)

474
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,430
(He gave a lot of correct answers.)

475
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,270
(Screw the education system
of Korea!)

476
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,110
(Empty Head Tutoring Quiz showed...)

477
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,010
(the double face
of the Korean education system.)

478
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
There will be teams...

479
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,580
of 1 top student
and 2 Empty Head students.

480
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,990
- A team of three?
- I need a tutor.

481
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,910
The top students will teach
the 2 students for 20 minutes.

482
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,420
And the six of you will
have the quiz competition.

483
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,490
(The 6 students will have a quiz
after 20 minutes of study.)

484
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,950
Who are the Empty Heads?

485
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,530
The teachers remain the same.

486
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,630
Jong Kook, Suk Jin, and Jae Suk.

487
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,820
- Got it. Learn from me.
- I see. Okay. Understood.

488
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,460
- You know I'm a good tutor, right?
- Well...

489
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,770
I taught her what could be asked
on the test back then.

490
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,700
- I'll be a star tutor again.
- Right.

491
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,200
Only the six empty heads will
take a quiz after the lesson.

492
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,440
A team gets 1 point when only 1
on the team gets a question right,

493
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,170
- and three points if both do.
- Both have to get it right.

494
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,280
- Okay. Got it.
- I understand.

495
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,890
- It'll be hard for both to do it.
- I'm glad I'll have a teammate.

496
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,180
- It won't be hard.
- The questions will cover...

497
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,290
the entire social studies textbook
for the 1st semester of 6th grade...

498
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,160
that contains
the basic knowledge of economics.

499
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,290
- I see.
- That's easy.

500
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,030
- That's offensive.
- That's so easy.

501
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,190
Last time, you studied
what fifth grade students learn.

502
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,870
- We've moved up, right?
- Right.

503
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,900
- Now, I'll announce the teams.
- Okay.

504
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,370
- Teacher Yoo Jae Suk will teach...
- Who are they?

505
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,540
Se Chan and Sae Ho.

506
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,110
- We're all comedians.
- My gosh.

507
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,570
- I'll teach my junior comedians.
- We're all comedians.

508
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,650
- Let's join our forces. Comedians!
- Comedians!

509
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,440
- This is great.
- Let's study hard.

510
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,150
- Jong Kook's students are...
- Yes.

511
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,680
- Ji Hyo and Haha.
- Okay.

512
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,120
(Kim Jong Kook's class:
Haha, Song Ji Hyo)

513
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,620
- I'm a great teacher.
- And Suk Jin will teach...

514
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,760
So Min and Young Ji.

515
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,020
- Oh, my.
- You know I'm a good teacher.

516
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,050
- Jong Kook's students are good too.
- Let's do this.

517
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,630
- They are, indeed.
- You have 20 minutes.

518
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,630
- Twenty minutes? Okay.
- Yes. Start studying.

519
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,690
- We can start studying now, right?
- Yes.

520
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:12,950
- Sit down.
- Please sit in the middle.

521
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,000
- Right. Sit in the middle.
- I don't mind.

522
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,190
Shall I sit in the middle?

523
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,000
- I'll sit in the middle.
- All right.

524
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,040
(Teacher Yoo has his 2 favorite men
as his students.)

525
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,130
Jae Suk.

526
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,130
You two have to memorize everything.

527
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,240
I'll follow your lead.

528
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,010
- Okay?
- I'm doomed. I'm not smart.

529
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,710
All right. Let's take a look.

530
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,980
(Unit 1 is modern history
and politics.)

531
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,540
You should know...

532
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,070
- what a revolution means.
- A revolution.

533
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,810
"It's to change a nation's
foundation and system completely."

534
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,640
- A revolution.
- This is the most important point.

535
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,350
- It's to make a change.
- A revolution changes everything.

536
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,260
- It changes everything.
- Shouldn't we study economics?

537
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,530
Focus. This will be asked
in the quiz.

538
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,200
- Will it? Okay.
- It covers the entire book.

539
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
It changes everything.

540
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,530
"In 1863, the Gettysburg Address..."

541
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,170
- You should memorize this.
- Will this be asked too?

542
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,200
- It could be.
- Pennsylvania?

543
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,630
Yes, the Gettysburg Address.

544
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,130
This is a speech
delivered by Lincoln.

545
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,210
- Lincoln?
- Yes.

546
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,440
- Abraham Lincoln.
- I see.

547
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,070
- Abraham Lincoln.
- Okay.

548
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,370
- Have you never seen him before?
- What?

549
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,900
- You mean, Lincoln?
- This is Lincoln.

550
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,340
I know who he is. He's...

551
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,800
- He's a former president of the US.
- the first president of the US.

552
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,840
- He's not the 1st president.
- That's George Washington.

553
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,110
- Oh, it's not him.
- Let me tell you about him.

554
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,610
Just listen to what I say
as your teacher.

555
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,080
- You're a student too.
- Just zip it.

556
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,260
- Why would you teach me?
- You're a student just like him.

557
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,580
- I'm the teacher.
- Exactly.

558
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,620
I don't think I can do this.

559
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,190
- Memorize what I tell you.
- You're too hard on us.

560
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,460
- Just memorize it as I said.
- Okay, I'll do that.

561
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,530
- We only have 20 minutes.
- Okay.

562
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,170
- Let's memorize this one.
- Se Chan, you're doing great.

563
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,390
- Abraham Lincoln.
- The Gettysburg Address.

564
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,700
(Meanwhile,
Se Chan is in the teacher's favor.)

565
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,290
Now, let's move on
to the April Revolution.

566
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,440
- This is important.
- The April Revolution.

567
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,560
The April Revolution.

568
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,360
Why did it happen, Suk Jin?

569
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,780
The April Revolution... Well...

570
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,980
You don't have to know why.

571
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,570
- Why would you get upset?
- No, it's not like that.

572
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,540
You don't have to learn
why the April Revolution happened.

573
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,110
Why? We have only 20 minutes,
you know.

574
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,820
You two just have to memorize
the terms I tell you.

575
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,460
Okay. Hey, memorize this name.
Jurgen Hanzpeter.

576
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:52,930
Write it down.

577
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,970
Jurgen Hanzpeter... This man...

578
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,230
It's Hinzpeter, not Hanzpeter.

579
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,390
- Oh, right. It's Hinzpeter.
- Jurgen Hinzpeter.

580
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,040
I have poor eyesight.
It's Hinzpeter.

581
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,060
You must have good eyesight.

582
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,360
He let the world know
about the pro-democracy movement...

583
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,370
- in Korea.
- You know, right?

584
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,630
- Jurgen.
- Jurgen Hinzpeter.

585
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,680
- Jurgen Hinzpeter.
- Jurgen Hinzpeter.

586
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,810
Jurgen Hin... "Hin" as in "white."
Memorize it like this.

587
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,520
- "Hin" as in "white."
- Hinzpeter.

588
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,610
- Hinzpeter.
- Okay?

589
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,690
Hinzpeter.

590
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,880
You two are studying so hard.
I'm impressed.

591
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,150
- "Peter" like Peppertones.
- Sorry?

592
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,650
- How do we study all this?
- Yes?

593
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,790
- You can do it.
- But...

594
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,860
There could be many things
you don't know.

595
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,360
(He's the type
who eats sweets before studying.)

596
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,090
We've done this before, right?

597
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,860
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

598
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,060
I think this will be asked.

599
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,010
I think we'll be asked
what FTA stands for.

600
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,900
- Free trend...
- Oh, right. That...

601
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,640
- agreement.
- It's trade, not trend.

602
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,310
- Free trade agreement.
- Yes, it's trade.

603
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,370
On what page is FTA?

604
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,420
It's at the back.
Why did you skip to that page?

605
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,450
This will definitely be asked.

606
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,920
- Memorize this.
- Quiet down. Memorize these two.

607
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,220
What are the basic concepts
of democracy?

608
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,260
What are the basic concepts?

609
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,460
Human dignity, freedom,
and equality.

610
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,700
Correct. And...

611
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,170
What are the principles
of democracy...

612
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,540
- Universal suffrage,
- I mean, democratic election.

613
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,290
direct suffrage, secret ballot...

614
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,710
- Imagine we eat jjajangmyeon.
- Okay.

615
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,510
I have a universal portion size.

616
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,780
- We all eat jjajangmyeon equally.
- Equally.

617
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,250
- And it's delivered directly to us.
- Directly to us.

618
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,040
The person who paid is a secret.

619
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,720
- Oh, I get it.
- Does it make sense to you?

620
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,080
- This will help you memorize it.
- That's a great idea.

621
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,650
Let's say we eat jjajangmyeon.

622
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,650
- Universal suffrage.
- We eat a universal portion of it.

623
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,230
We all eat jjajangmyeon equally.

624
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,700
- What does it mean?
- Direct suffrage.

625
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,090
- No, equal suffrage.
- Right, equal suffrage.

626
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,770
- To whom is it delivered? Correct.
- Directly to us.

627
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,200
- Who pays?
- It's a secret.

628
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,390
(The elite student said,
"It's a secret.")

629
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,500
- It's easy, right?
- Yes.

630
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,010
- It's a great idea.
- It's easy, right?

631
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,170
What does universal suffrage mean?

632
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,570
Every citizen of Korea over 18 has
the right...

633
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,900
- to vote.
- That's universal suffrage.

634
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,540
Now, what does equal suffrage mean?

635
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,600
- Every citizen has...
- Just one vote.

636
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,920
I was explaining...

637
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,680
- Don't cut him off.
- That wasn't my intention.

638
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,720
- Why would you...
- Are you the teacher?

639
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,140
- I was...
- Keep it down, please.

640
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,810
- Why would you interrupt me?
- Come on. Be quiet.

641
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,520
Sae Ho keeps acting like a teacher.

642
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,650
- I was just actively participating.
- Gosh.

643
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,230
That's not necessary.
Just memorize it.

644
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,990
- You're not a teacher.
- Get out if you'll keep doing this.

645
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,460
He's acting up when he's a student.

646
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,050
- I'm trying to teach you...
- What kind of teacher...

647
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,860
- Just listen to me as Se Chan does.
- Take notes.

648
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,540
- All you did was read the book.
- Take notes.

649
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,790
That's all you did.

650
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,170
- You didn't teach us anything new.
- I gave you the key points.

651
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,270
- I was explaining to you.
- The key points.

652
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,510
Se Chan is doing well.

653
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,540
- I see. I'm sorry.
- He's a good teacher.

654
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,600
Right.

655
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,140
I mean, we have only 20 minutes,
but our pace is too slow.

656
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,010
- Be quiet.
- It's fast enough.

657
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,280
Get lost if you're going to
keep going on like this.

658
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,980
- Don't say that.
- "Get lost."

659
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,310
- You...
- Let's move on.

660
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,310
- Exactly.
- Our pace is too slow.

661
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,110
- Be quiet.
- This is very important.

662
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,020
- Please keep it down.
- You're too loud.

663
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,520
Why are you speaking so loudly?

664
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,050
- Sae Ho, you're too loud.
- And there's direct suffrage.

665
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,080
- We can't focus.
- I told you earlier, right?

666
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,260
- Everyone has a direct vote.
- Correct.

667
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,790
- Every citizen has...
- No one can vote for you.

668
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,090
Isn't that obvious?

669
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,200
- You're so hard on me.
- We're running out of time.

670
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,860
- Yes. Got it.
- You're being trained intensely.

671
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,940
Understood. Direct suffrage.

672
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,630
"Public hearing" is
an important term.

673
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,900
You should memorize the terms
in a box like this.

674
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,600
- "It's a public conference..."
- "It's a public conference..."

675
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,300
"to hear the opinions of experts..."

676
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,480
"before a policy decision is made."

677
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,800
A public hearing,
a public conference.

678
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,680
- "There may be precedents..."
- Darn.

679
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,750
- Gosh. They're actually studying.
- It's okay. You can skip that part.

680
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,750
Of course, they should.

681
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,990
I can't stop yawning.

682
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,990
What makes you yawn?
Isn't this so fun?

683
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,930
- "A public hearing..."
- The National Assembly, the court.

684
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,430
Things like this are so intriguing.

685
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:16,390
You know, Jong Kook used to be
a thug before he started studying.

686
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,540
He's enjoying this so much.

687
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,670
- He's enjoying teaching us.
- Yes.

688
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,860
Memorize "fair trade" as well.

689
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,060
- Okay. Now...
- I didn't know he liked studying...

690
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,800
- I'm impressed. I guess...
- Let's move on.

691
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,100
- Come back and sit down, you punk!
- It means to agree on it.

692
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,640
You guys are studying so quietly.

693
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,720
- You mean, us?
- It looks so nice.

694
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,920
- That's right.
- We have great concentration.

695
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,190
Now, we're going to...

696
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,920
(Yawning)

697
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,260
- Did you just yawn?
- Don't yawn.

698
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,850
- You made me feel sleepy.
- Go out and wash your face.

699
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,380
- Wash your face.
- I can't. I'm wearing makeup.

700
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,790
Se Chan is studying now.

701
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,670
I really don't like your attitude.

702
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,970
- I'm sorry.
- Look at the other students.

703
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,890
- And your breath smelled so bad.
- That's right.

704
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,360
Gosh. Why would you say that?

705
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,330
You shouldn't do that
during a class.

706
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,600
Hey, how could you...

707
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,440
- Meet me on the rooftop later.
- Be quiet.

708
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,180
Hey, go easy on me today.

709
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,300
(Licking his finger)

710
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,520
Sorry, but don't lick your finger
before turning pages.

711
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,190
I can smell your saliva,
which is bad.

712
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:11,460
- Gosh, you're so annoying.
- It smells so bad.

713
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,650
- Just leave.
- What's wrong with it?

714
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,760
I can do whatever I want
with my own book.

715
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,320
Where is your manager?
Where's Sung Ho?

716
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,690
He left to grab something to eat.

717
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,260
Gross domestic product.
You should memorize this.

718
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,850
Gross national income.

719
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,790
(GDP, the total value of final goods
produced during a period of time)

720
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,390
- GP... I mean, GDP.
- GPA. I mean, GDP.

721
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,900
Yes. There's another one
other than GDP.

722
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,400
- GPS.
- It stands for...

723
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,440
"GPS?"

724
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,800
"Divided into three branches."
You know this one.

725
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,950
You learned this, right?
The last one.

726
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,140
Three separated... Triad?

727
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,920
- Gosh. That's a gang.
- Three...

728
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,020
The separation of powers.

729
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,880
- What's the legislative branch?
- The National Assembly.

730
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,920
- The National Assembly.
- Correct.

731
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,190
- The judicial branch?
- Courts.

732
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,260
- Courts.
- Correct.

733
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,620
Don't just repeat what he says.

734
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,460
And what's the government?

735
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,500
- The executive branch.
- Correct.

736
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,000
You can win the quiz if you know it.

737
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,320
Let's do our best, Se Chan,
so we won't be called empty heads.

738
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,770
What's the opposite
of direct election?

739
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,670
- Diagonal election?
- Indirect election.

740
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,170
- Like straight and diagonal lines?
- Yes, diagonal election.

741
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,010
Direct election means
that the voters vote directly.

742
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,100
You have three minutes left.

743
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,340
- Gosh. We're in trouble.
- Gosh.

744
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,570
- You punk!
- What?

745
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,540
This is difficult.

746
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,840
(Everyone started cramming.)

747
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,580
Studying makes me yawn.

748
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,760
My gosh.

749
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,050
(Serious)

750
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,760
So Min, you look so cool
since you're focusing on studying.

751
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,820
- She's taking it seriously.
- She looks so cool.

752
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,200
It's because I'm not good at
memorizing things.

753
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,820
I'm so tired.

754
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,200
- Me too.
- Why are you tired? Enjoy it.

755
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,170
We'll begin
as soon as we finish preparing.

756
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,540
I'll tell you
what to memorize again.

757
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,010
- Se Chan, memorize what I say.
- Okay.

758
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,330
- I bet you will...
- Don't just talk to him. Teach me.

759
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,740
- All right.
- Okay.

760
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,450
Haha, what are the four principles
of the democratic election?

761
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,420
- SEUD.
- That's right.

762
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,380
- Secret ballot, equal suffrage,
- Correct.

763
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,490
- And?
- universal and direct suffrage.

764
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,610
- Everyone.
- Good.

765
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,580
- Just remember this one.
- Please come and sit here.

766
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,820
- Please come out now.
- Wait. Give us a moment.

767
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,000
- Please come out.
- Please.

768
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,530
Teacher Ji.

769
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,530
Yes?

770
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,820
Teacher Yoo.

771
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,470
- Memorize the terms in the front.
- A residents' referendum.

772
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,330
The local government officials
elected by the residents...

773
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,790
- Teachers.
- Memorize this one too.

774
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,270
- It should be carried out...
- Everyone.

775
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,010
- Please come out.
- Okay.

776
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,240
Let's go, everyone.

777
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,400
Okay. Done.

778
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,710
Everyone, please be seated.

779
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,870
I'm so nervous.

780
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,780
You did a great job.

781
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,020
Good job.

782
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,540
(The 20-minute study time is over.)

783
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,020
- Direct election.
- Correct.

784
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,350
The separation of powers.

785
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,760
- Teacher Kim.
- The separation of powers.

786
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,730
- The judicial branch...
- Got it.

787
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:30,760
(They cram information into their
students' brains to the end.)

788
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,730
Please bring your chair...
Teacher Ji.

789
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,790
- The legislative branch. Okay.
- Please be seated.

790
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,890
- It's the government.
- The executive branch.

791
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,090
That's the separation of powers.

792
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,240
Please sit down.

793
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,560
- You've got this.
- Stop it already.

794
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,270
- What are you talking about?
- Gosh, seriously.

795
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,600
They should study
to the last minute.

796
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,240
You and your students were too loud.

797
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,400
We weren't.

798
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,370
My students couldn't focus
because of you guys.

799
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,750
- That's...
- Gosh.

800
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,180
That's your students' fault.

801
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,540
No. You were too loud.

802
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,690
- It's his students' fault?
- I'm just saying...

803
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,580
- What?
- His students are to blame?

804
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,920
- What did you just say?
- That's ridiculous.

805
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,610
- What did my kids do wrong?
- You're a teacher.

806
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,350
- How could you blame the students?
- Let's begin the quiz already.

807
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,260
- Let's begin before we forget.
- What's your problem?

808
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,850
- I'm speechless.
- What? You punk, how dare you?

809
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,290
- Did you call him a punk?
- Stay away from me.

810
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,390
I'm a teacher,

811
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,000
- Mister, what's the problem?
- and he pointed his finger at me.

812
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,790
But you're not his teacher,
so he can call you "Mister."

813
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,090
- Right.
- That's not the point.

814
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,300
- You're not my teacher.
- Let's begin now, please.

815
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,170
Now, I'll give you the questions,

816
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,680
and we'll see how well
the three teachers taught them.

817
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,800
- Okay. Let's begin.
- Let's go.

818
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
- But...
- I don't have to be funny, right?

819
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,680
- You don't have to.
- I don't have to be funny, right?

820
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
- I won't try to be funny.
- Right.

821
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,220
But you never tried to be funny.

822
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,250
Pardon me?

823
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,290
A team gets 1 point if 1 member is
correct, and 3 points if both are.

824
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,420
- Okay.
- Okay. Good.

825
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,760
If you cheat,
your team loses two points.

826
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,490
- Come on. None of them will cheat.
- Okay. Let's go.

827
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,960
- Se Chan, be confident.
- We can do this!

828
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,860
Since this is a team competition,
cheating won't be tolerated...

829
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,170
- under any circumstance.
- Of course.

830
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,790
- Show me your palms.
- What's wrong with you? Gosh.

831
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,170
- He's ridiculous.
- We would never do that.

832
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,170
- And why didn't you see theirs?
- Exactly.

833
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,670
- Hey, show me your hands.
- Where do you think you're going?

834
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,100
- Show me.
- Mister.

835
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,440
- Show me.
- What are you doing?

836
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,600
- Mister.
- Show me your palms.

837
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
- Why would you look at their hands?
- Hey.

838
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,100
- What are you doing now?
- We'll forget what we learned!

839
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,280
- Let me take a look.
- Gosh. What are you doing?

840
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,580
- Maybe she hid it in her hair.
- She'd never write it on the scalp.

841
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,140
- So Min might've done it.
- Kids usually write answers here.

842
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,050
- How could she even read it?
- Show me.

843
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,790
I forgot everything. Darn it.

844
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,580
- I forgot everything too.
- I forgot everything.

845
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,850
- Good.
- I forgot everything.

846
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,500
- Give us the question, please.
- Okay.

847
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,700
Let's begin.

848
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,460
Here's your first question.

849
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,890
What is the speech
in which Abraham Lincoln said,

850
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:22,400
"Government of the people,
by the people, for the people,"

851
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,210
"shall not perish from the earth?"

852
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,630
(In what speech did Abraham Lincoln
say, "Government of the people,")

853
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,070
("by the people, for the people,
shall not perish from the earth?")

854
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,680
Oh, good. They know the answer.

855
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,370
- Of course, they know.
- Okay.

856
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,340
Wait. What's with those looks?

857
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,490
- You know the answer, right?
- You know the answer.

858
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,220
(You just have to memorize this.)

859
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,490
("Government of the people,
by the people, for the people...")

860
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,490
(It's the Gettysburg Address
delivered by Lincoln.)

861
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:46,430
(The scary teacher told them
to memorize the Gettysburg Address.)

862
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,090
Does it end with the word "speech?"

863
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,170
- There's a name for the speech.
- I told you about this many times.

864
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,060
A speech?

865
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,330
We should write
the name of a speech?

866
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,400
It's so easy.

867
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,710
- Write down the answer.
- Wait.

868
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,800
Where was this speech delivered?

869
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,010
Does it end with the word "speech?"

870
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,300
You guys know the answer, right?

871
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,010
You know the answer.
You learned this.

872
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,140
- I told you earlier...
- All right.

873
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,340
(Meanwhile, Young Ji and So Min...)

874
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,220
(started writing the answer
without hesitating.)

875
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,690
- You know the answer.
- The name of the speech...

876
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,790
You wrote it, right?

877
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,580
You wrote it, right?
My students know the answer.

878
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,190
(Right then, Se Chan starts
writing the answer too.)

879
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,230
All right.

880
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,030
- Five.
- Yes. That's great.

881
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,260
- You wrote it, right?
- Four.

882
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,790
- Three.
- You don't remember that?

883
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,820
- Two.
- Come on.

884
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,500
- One.
- Good.

885
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,130
Now, reveal your answers.
Show your answers.

886
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,770
- Is this the correct answer?
- Now, reveal your answers.

887
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,770
(So Min and Young Ji wrote,
"The Gettysburg Address.")

888
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,270
(The answer: The Gettysburg Address)

889
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,970
- Is this the correct answer?
- Gertzburg.

890
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,780
- Gosh.
- Hey.

891
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,800
(Se Chan almost got it right.)

892
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,800
- Gosh.
- What...

893
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,920
She wrote, "The LA Speech."

894
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,570
- "The amazing speech."
- "The amazing speech."

895
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,580
(The amazing speech)

896
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,580
(Haha wrote, "The amazing speech.")

897
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,520
The answer is
"The Gettysburg Address."

898
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,150
- So...
- He wrote, "Gertzburg." Gosh.

899
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,590
- What's "Gertzburg?" Darn it.
- Gertzburg...

900
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,150
- I thought...
- What's that?

901
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,360
Great job.
I told you it would be asked.

902
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,860
(The Gettysburg Address)

903
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,040
(Both of Jong Kook's students
got it wrong.)

904
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,860
Can his answer be aired?
"The amazing speech?"

905
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,240
Hey, what's "The LA Speech?"

906
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,100
My gosh.
It's the Gettysburg Address.

907
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,800
- Why did you...
- Hey, Se Chan.

908
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,300
- I'm sorry.
- What is "Gertzburg?"

909
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,040
Gosh, I'm so stupid.

910
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,370
My students,
show your answers again.

911
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,110
- Why...
- Both of them got it right.

912
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,420
- That's not important.
- I'm proud of you.

913
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,490
Here goes the next question.

914
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,880
- The next question... Hey.
- Give us an easy one.

915
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,430
Make sure
to get the second one right.

916
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,700
What is the production
of comparatively light goods...

917
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,530
- such as food, textile goods,
- Great.

918
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,590
- and paper?
- This is good.

919
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,700
- Okay.
- Such as food,

920
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,000
(What's the industry of light goods
such as food and paper?)

921
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,670
(The amazing LA siblings write
the answer right away this time.)

922
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,240
(Teacher Ji is sure
that his students know the answer.)

923
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,450
(What's light industry?)

924
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,450
"Of comparatively light goods..."

925
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,040
"such as food, textile goods,
and paper."

926
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,580
(Teacher Ji with bad eyesight
barely read it to them.)

927
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,850
What's the industry...

928
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:56,290
(Jae Suk read it clearly
to his students too.)

929
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,580
(Now, heavy chemical industry!)

930
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,050
- I learned this back then.
- Right.

931
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,890
(China...)

932
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,320
(It has nothing to do with China.)

933
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:09,600
(Jae Suk also compared it
to the heavy chemical industry.)

934
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,900
- I see.
- Okay.

935
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,980
- Don't give them any hints.
- I told you about the light goods.

936
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,540
- Write down the answer.
- Five, four,

937
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,010
- three, two,
- Hurry up.

938
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,510
- Hurry!
- One. Show your answers.

939
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,980
Okay. Good. Show your answers.

940
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,790
(The answer: Light industry)

941
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,250
(Happy)

942
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,250
(Both of them wrote,
"light industry.")

943
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,760
(Both of Team Jong Kook's members
got it right as well!)

944
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,420
- Okay.
- Show your answers.

945
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,880
(How did Team Jae Suk do?)

946
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,030
- Show your answers.
- Gosh, he's so stupid.

947
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,350
- Okay.
- My gosh.

948
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,290
(Se Chan wrote,
"heavy cheminal industry!")

949
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,330
- Good job, you guys.
- Isn't it the correct answer?

950
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,940
- He didn't even write that right.
- What's "heavy cheminal industry?"

951
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,800
(Se Chan created a new word
that doesn't exist.)

952
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,510
Se Chan, I taught you that one.

953
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,570
- The light goods.
- Light industry!

954
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,180
Now, I remember that, Sae Ho.

955
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,510
I got confused because you talked...

956
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,140
- about heavy chemical industry.
- I guessed them all, right?

957
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,720
But I told you
about the light industry too.

958
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,250
Besides, it's "chemical,"
not "cheminal."

959
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,640
- Gosh, seriously.
- We're the aces.

960
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,840
"Cheminal?"

961
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,050
- What's "cheminal?"
- "Cheminal."

962
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,690
- I too can be funny if I want to.
- Okay. They got it right.

963
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,650
- What a shame.
- Don't try to be funny.

964
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:06,090
- Stay calm.
- Sir, please count down slowly.

965
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,960
- Stay calm.
- It's okay.

966
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,500
Your students are stupid.

967
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,090
- Stay calm. What did you just say?
- Your students are...

968
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,290
- They're stupid.
- Don't say that.

969
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,060
- You've crossed the line.
- Gosh.

970
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,540
It's because their teacher is not
competent enough.

971
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,300
- Gosh, seriously.
- They must have different talents.

972
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,710
I impressed myself.

973
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,510
- I guessed all the questions.
- My head hurts.

974
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,870
- Ready.
- It's okay.

975
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,800
Write the basic principles
of the democratic election.

976
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,610
- Okay. You know the answer, right?
- I told you about this, right?

977
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,610
I taught you this one.

978
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,580
(Write the basic principles
of the democratic election.)

979
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,080
- Jjajangmyeon.
- I taught you this earlier.

980
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,020
Jjajangmyeon.

981
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,760
We all eat jjajangmyeon...

982
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,390
(Could the jjajangmyeon method
have helped them memorize it?)

983
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,730
- Ssaebssaeb, I taught you this.
- You know it, right?

984
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:43,930
- Should I write all of them?
- Listen.

985
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,500
They might not have understood
the question.

986
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,790
No way. It's not confusing at all.

987
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,770
Gosh. That's not the correct answer!

988
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,800
What are you doing?

989
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,440
- You can't tell him that.
- That's not the correct answer!

990
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,980
(Teacher Yoo shouts angrily.)

991
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,800
- He's not allowed to do that.
- You can't do that.

992
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,710
- All right. Listen, everyone.
- Darn it.

993
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,920
- He just...
- You got a warning.

994
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,750
- Can you repeat the question?
- Ssaebssaeb.

995
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,290
- It's about elections.
- Don't say anything.

996
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,750
- Oh, right. Give me a second!
- It's about elections.

997
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,080
- Three, two,
- SEUD?

998
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,310
- Yes, that's right.
- one. Show your answers.

999
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,580
- You know this.
- Four!

1000
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,290
- Three, two,
- SEUD?

1001
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,650
- Yes, that's right.
- one. Show your answers.

1002
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,150
(Secret ballot, universal suffrage,
direct suffrage, equal suffrage)

1003
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,500
(The answer: Universal, equal,
direct suffrage, secret ballot)

1004
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,890
(Universal suffrage, equal suffrage,
direct suffrage, secret ballot)

1005
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,540
(The jjajangmyeon method worked.)

1006
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,790
- What's the last word?
- "Direct suffrage."

1007
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,330
- "Direct suffrage."
- Did you write, "Straight?"

1008
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,510
No, it's "direct."

1009
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,600
Free and equal suffrage,
and secret ballot.

1010
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,180
Is it "direct?" I'm relieved.

1011
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,440
Only Se Chan got it wrong.

1012
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,540
- What?
- Okay.

1013
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,280
- Se Chan.
- Only Se Chan...

1014
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,810
(Shaking his head)

1015
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,040
- Gosh. What's his problem?
- I told you it was about elections.

1016
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,450
- Empty Head!
- Listen.

1017
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,150
- Freedom is a concept of democracy.
- I did an amazing job, right?

1018
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,690
- It's universal suffrage.
- This is giving me a bad headache.

1019
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,080
- Hey.
- My gosh.

1020
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,690
- I knew all of the answers.
- You see,

1021
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,430
Se Chan put too much information
into his brain.

1022
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,590
Jae Suk, I'm having a bad headache.

1023
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,090
- It was too much for him.
- That's...

1024
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,770
I did an amazing job, right?
I guessed all the questions.

1025
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,770
Right? What do you think?
You respect me, right?

1026
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,800
I really do.

1027
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,540
- SEUD. Good job.
- I wrote, "direct."

1028
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,300
- Yes. You did well.
- I got it right.

1029
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,510
Great job.

1030
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,040
- Se Chan, it was too much for you.
- It was too much for me.

1031
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,610
Guys, you're doing great.

1032
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:06,610
It was too much for you.

1033
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,280
Here goes the next question.

1034
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,640
- Please count down slowly.
- Before that...

1035
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,880
Teachers, you gave your students
too many hints.

1036
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,790
- I didn't give them any hints.
- Right?

1037
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,650
- Don't give them any hints.
- Seok Sam.

1038
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,690
You gave them a huge hint.

1039
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,500
- I didn't do that.
- Wait.

1040
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,000
You're sitting
too close to the students.

1041
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,590
- But they're not my students.
- Let's switch the seats.

1042
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,390
- No, you shouldn't sit there.
- You can't do that.

1043
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,590
- No.
- You can't do that.

1044
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,770
- You can't sit here.
- Let's switch the seats.

1045
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,770
This is the best...

1046
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,800
- This is the right arrangement.
- Indeed.

1047
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,400
- This is just right.
- Teacher Kim, sit over there.

1048
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,040
- You two switch seats.
- Oh, me?

1049
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,070
- Okay. I'll sit here.
- I didn't tell them anything.

1050
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,900
- Let's prevent him from talking.
- Right. Let's stop him.

1051
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,950
- I can't give them any hints.
- This is good.

1052
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,480
Sae Ho, I feel like
I'm going to throw up.

1053
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,250
- I'm so nervous right now.
- I'm having a bad headache.

1054
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,380
- Me too.
- My head hurts.

1055
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,310
My heart is beating like crazy.
Please hurry up and continue.

1056
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,460
We're so nervous.
Please continue quickly.

1057
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,050
- Right. Let's stop him.
- I can't give them...

1058
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:52,700
(Leaning forward)

1059
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,890
Hey, what are you doing, you punk?

1060
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,890
I just turned around...

1061
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,090
(Hey, what are you doing, you punk?)

1062
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,290
(I just turned around...)

1063
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,130
- Don't do it.
- How dare you call him a punk?

1064
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,800
- How could you do that?
- Don't intimidate the students.

1065
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,540
He's 41 years old.

1066
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,710
- I felt impatient.
- I feel dizzy.

1067
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,280
- I was too impatient.
- How dare you?

1068
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,900
- Okay. Let's go.
- Here we go.

1069
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,510
- We've got this!
- Se Chan.

1070
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,220
- Let's do this!
- You two are doing great. Okay.

1071
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,290
- Now...
- Gosh, seriously.

1072
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,110
What are the market conditions...

1073
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,220
where a single company controls
the entire market...

1074
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,690
- I don't know this one.
- and the one...

1075
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,250
where more than two companies
dominate the market?

1076
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,900
- I don't know the answer.
- What?

1077
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,900
- And the one...
- I taught you this earlier.

1078
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,400
where more than two companies...

1079
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,300
- dominate the market?
- I taught you this one.

1080
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,300
- What?
- I taught you.

1081
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,340
(Monopoly and oligopoly are
the market conditions...)

1082
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,610
(where a single or a few companies
control the market.)

1083
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,130
(Only Jong Kook told his students
to memorize the terms.)

1084
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,800
- It's often mentioned in the news.
- Just...

1085
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,900
- think about the meaning.
- Don't say anything.

1086
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,210
- Five.
- Oh, gosh.

1087
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,210
- Four.
- We talked about it.

1088
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,250
- Three.
- Don't.

1089
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,420
- Two.
- I read it to you guys.

1090
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,880
- Show your answers.
- Be confident.

1091
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,880
- I read it to you guys.
- "Market manipulation?"

1092
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,090
- Hey!
- Be confident.

1093
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,250
- I read it to you guys.
- I have no idea.

1094
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,400
(Suk Jin's students are
overly confident.)

1095
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,300
- My gosh.
- "Market manipulation?"

1096
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,300
(She must've thought of something
that's crafty.)

1097
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,820
- "Market manipulation?"
- Isn't it "production rate?"

1098
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,690
- "Market manipulation?"
- Isn't it "production rate?"

1099
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,270
(He even misspelled the words.)

1100
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,270
(Sae Ho wrote,
"Catching 2 birds with 1 stone.")

1101
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:12,610
(His answer is even worse.)

1102
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,840
- I told you about this.
- I thought this was correct.

1103
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,500
Ji Hyo, show your answer.

1104
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,670
- Come on. I told you about this.
- Monopoly and oligopoly.

1105
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,070
- Monopoly and oligopoly.
- Oh, right. I remember that.

1106
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,190
Hey, I told you about this
several times.

1107
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,090
- They all got it wrong.
- I read it to you.

1108
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,250
We skipped this part.

1109
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,690
- We didn't learn this.
- You learned the fair trade act.

1110
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,090
- We didn't learn it.
- We didn't learn this.

1111
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,130
- What a shame.
- We didn't learn this.

1112
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,860
It was in the bottom left corner,
but I told them...

1113
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,960
- to memorize it.
- Come back.

1114
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,250
They didn't know the answer.
Stop pretending...

1115
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,090
- you taught them.
- We couldn't have covered it all.

1116
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:39,090
- But I read it several times.
- They didn't know the answer.

1117
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,190
Only you're saying
that you taught them.

1118
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,900
Didn't your teachers teach you that?

1119
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,960
- No, we didn't learn it.
- No, he didn't.

1120
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,130
- Gosh, you guys.
- Monopoly and oligopoly.

1121
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,770
- Monopoly and oligopoly.
- Monopoly.

1122
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,770
- But...
- I taught them.

1123
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,270
What's the point of teaching them?
They didn't remember it.

1124
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,550
The result is the same.

1125
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,980
Still, you should've taught them.

1126
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,340
Don't be ridiculous.

1127
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,380
Our teacher likes to study
more than he likes to teach.

1128
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,860
- Mister.
- Gosh.

1129
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,550
- Yes?
- Make me a paper crane.

1130
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,190
- Make me a paper crane.
- Come on.

1131
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,750
- Make me one.
- I'm not...

1132
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,090
- the teacher that you think I am.
- Give it a try.

1133
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,190
- The tutors aren't kidding around.
- Right?

1134
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,130
- Here we go.
- Focus, guys.

1135
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,900
None of that matters
if they don't know the answer.

1136
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,170
Here we go.

1137
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,900
In October of 1972,

1138
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,070
a new constitutional order...

1139
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,610
that permitted
the reelection of presidents...

1140
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,070
and promoted
an indirect election system...

1141
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,070
was issued.

1142
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,920
We went over this earlier.

1143
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,050
(Answer: The Yooshin Order)

1144
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,380
I mentioned this earlier.

1145
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,880
- Se Chan!
- Five.

1146
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,420
Look at So Min
write down the answer.

1147
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,690
Three.

1148
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,630
(They only have 5 seconds
to write down the answer.)

1149
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,860
- Se Chan!
- Five.

1150
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,650
Look at So Min
write down the answer.

1151
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,630
- She's smiling!
- Two...

1152
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,630
- Show me your answers.
- Yes!

1153
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,270
- The Yooshin Order.
- Right, the Yooshin Order.

1154
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,130
(Ji Hyo and Haha couldn't remember.)

1155
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,270
You're out.

1156
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,230
- Yes!
- The Yooshin Order.

1157
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,610
(Sae Ho wrote down
the correct answer.)

1158
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,070
I can't believe him.

1159
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,750
(Teacher's pet Se Chan
couldn't write down anything.)

1160
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,020
- You're out.
- This is too difficult.

1161
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,320
- Right before the quiz began.
- Unbelievable.

1162
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,840
You said you had this in the bag!

1163
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,210
(The Empty Head Sisters
answered correctly once again.)

1164
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,550
They're the best.

1165
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,750
(Other than monopoly and oligopoly,
she answered everything correctly.)

1166
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,090
So Min answered
every question correctly!

1167
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,650
Right, it's the Yooshin Order.

1168
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,590
So Min, I'm pleasantly surprised.

1169
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,630
- You don't even need to think.
- Me too!

1170
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,960
Young Ji, you too.

1171
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,630
Am I or am I not a spotter?

1172
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,960
I told you I could spot the answers.

1173
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,730
Spot your own gray hair, Suk Jin.

1174
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,480
Young Ji and So Min don't even need
to hear the entire question.

1175
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,940
I'm not stupid!

1176
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,440
I'm not an empty head!

1177
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,070
I hope your mothers
are watching this.

1178
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,880
Ladies, your daughters
have scored the most points.

1179
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,020
Do you see how smart my girls are?

1180
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,610
What? No, I haven't been able to.

1181
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,480
- My girls...
- I was too occupied with my boys.

1182
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,050
- Before he completed the question.
- I was occupied with my boys!

1183
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,730
How can I look at them
when I'm busy with my boys?

1184
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:51,020
Currently in the lead
is Team Suk Jin.

1185
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,630
Currently in the lead
is Team Suk Jin.

1186
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,300
(Groaning)

1187
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,270
- What's wrong with you?
- What's the matter?

1188
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,270
Why...

1189
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,770
- What was that?
- What's wrong with you?

1190
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,800
- Did you pull my chair out?
- Why would I do that?

1191
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,550
- Sit down properly.
- Be careful.

1192
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,750
- He pulled my chair out.
- Fine. Whatever.

1193
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,710
- Gosh.
- Here's the next question.

1194
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,520
This is one that every team studied.

1195
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,130
What is Article 1 Section 2
of the Constitution?

1196
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,550
- We've got this.
- What did you say again?

1197
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,020
Song Kang Ho recited it in a movie.

1198
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,230
- Come on.
- Seriously?

1199
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,020
What is Article 1 Section 2
of the Constitution?

1200
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,020
The longer one.

1201
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,070
Gosh.

1202
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,730
(What was it again?)

1203
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,730
You are allowed to rephrase.

1204
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,630
- I can't remember how it starts.
- My kids...

1205
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,070
will write it down word for word.

1206
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,940
- We went over it multiple times.
- Just a second.

1207
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,170
Think of the line from the movie.

1208
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,170
Article 1 Section 2.

1209
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,270
"The sovereignty of
the Republic of Korea shall reside..."

1210
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,000
"in the people,
and all state authority..."

1211
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,520
- "shall emanate from the people."
- "From the people."

1212
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:45,690
(It was gone over
by the other tutors too.)

1213
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,050
- Hurry, will you?
- Four.

1214
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,210
- That's right.
- Wait. I'm still writing it down.

1215
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,520
- Then...
- You know how it goes.

1216
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,750
Wait. I'm writing it down.

1217
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,230
Stop. That's enough.

1218
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,150
- Count it down!
- Give them five more seconds.

1219
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,920
- Stop the clock.
- No, give them ten more seconds.

1220
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,690
- Stop the clock.
- Wait. I'm writing it down.

1221
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,500
- Must we get it word for word?
- Time is up.

1222
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,570
Show us your answer.

1223
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,710
- Time is up.
- It being long worries me.

1224
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,000
He got it wrong.

1225
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,480
- I'm still writing.
- Show us your answer.

1226
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,980
- We'll check each answer.
- He got it wrong.

1227
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,170
The sovereignty
resides in the people.

1228
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,170
Check each answer individually.

1229
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,480
- The sovereignty...
- The people speak of power.

1230
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,190
What could the people possibly say?

1231
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,290
I'll read mine.

1232
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,320
- I'm almost in tears.
- The sovereignty resides...

1233
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,320
in the people...

1234
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,050
- and the power...
- You're reading it differently.

1235
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,550
- You read it differently.
- His is incorrect.

1236
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,820
- So Min got it wrong.
- Really?

1237
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,400
- Young Ji's too.
- Yours is incorrect.

1238
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,590
Let's see what my kids wrote.

1239
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,340
The sovereignty of Korea
shall reside in the people...

1240
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,270
- Only those two score points.
- Yes!

1241
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,670
The sovereignty of Korea
shall reside in the people...

1242
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,900
and all state authority
shall emanate from the people.

1243
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,380
- They wrote it word for word.
- I said it'd be in the quiz.

1244
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,520
I'm almost in tears.

1245
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,210
- My kids...
- This is too much knowledge...

1246
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,480
for you to swallow.

1247
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,020
But I had it memorized.

1248
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,960
- Me too.
- Exactly.

1249
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,730
It's odd that they
actually got it right.

1250
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:58,690
What do you mean?
They wrote it down word for word.

1251
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,320
I'm surprised considering
how stupid they are.

1252
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,130
They wrote it down word for word.

1253
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,130
They couldn't possibly memorize it.

1254
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,230
What do you mean?

1255
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,230
- I know those two and...
- Mr. Ji, hold on.

1256
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,570
I say this as an educator myself.

1257
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,070
You're too old-fashioned.

1258
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,170
- Exactly. He's the worst.
- That's not it.

1259
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,770
- I know how they usually are.
- Also,

1260
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,000
- I mentioned this earlier.
- Don't rain on their parade.

1261
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,110
Even though
they should get the credit,

1262
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,070
- you only complimented yourself.
- Teachers like them...

1263
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,710
- will lead to...
- Can't you see I'm talking?

1264
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,610
(Can't you see
that your teacher is talking?)

1265
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,880
Teachers like them will lead to...

1266
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,050
(He suddenly tells Sae Ho off.)

1267
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,980
- I was talking just now.
- He's angry.

1268
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:30,730
- That seemed old-fashioned too.
- Really?

1269
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,500
- But the student...
- Please don't yell at them.

1270
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,000
- Sit back down!
- Don't yell at the kids.

1271
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,020
I'm impressed by the two of you.

1272
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,170
- I was almost in tears just now.
- Right?

1273
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,040
Aren't you the ones who wrote
LA Speech as an answer?

1274
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,770
She wrote LA Speech.
I wrote the awesome speech.

1275
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,270
Those are different.

1276
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,440
- I wrote LA Speech.
- And together...

1277
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,210
it's the awesome LA Speech.

1278
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,550
- Let's wish them luck.
- Good luck.

1279
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,710
- Good luck.
- Let's go!

1280
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,790
Which institution
deals with cases...

1281
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:03,250
- regarding the constitutional law?
- This one you know.

1282
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,900
I notified you of this
right before the quiz began.

1283
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,020
(Se Chan starts
to write something down.)

1284
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,630
Jae Suk's an intimidating teacher.

1285
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,400
That's it. That's the one.

1286
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,540
(Se Chan starts
to write something down.)

1287
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,070
(The other students
write down their answers too.)

1288
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,540
- Five, four...
- This one...

1289
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,500
- Seriously?
- Three, two...

1290
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,770
- Give me some more time.
- One.

1291
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,380
- You've got this.
- The Constitutional Court.

1292
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,440
Okay!

1293
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,150
(Both members of Team Jae Suk
answer correctly.)

1294
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,420
(Answer: The Constitutional Court)

1295
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,790
- We didn't learn this one.
- You'll win anyway.

1296
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,190
- You've got this.
- The Constitutional Court.

1297
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,550
- Okay!
- Impeachment?

1298
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,550
(She wrote down
anything that came to mind.)

1299
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,820
The answer is
the Constitutional Court.

1300
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,630
- I got it right.
- Only So Min got it wrong.

1301
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,630
You have the same teacher,
so what is the matter with you?

1302
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,800
No, he didn't teach us this word.

1303
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,400
You didn't go over this.

1304
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,130
He didn't teach us this word.

1305
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,670
(A loud victory celebration)

1306
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,500
His answer shouldn't
have been allowed.

1307
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,270
He was out of time.

1308
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,340
No way.

1309
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,940
- Nicely done.
- There are nine judges in total.

1310
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,520
- That's right.
- Stay put, will you?

1311
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,250
- Nicely done, guys.
- Hold on.

1312
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,150
Stay put, will you?

1313
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,960
- Nicely done, guys.
- Hold on.

1314
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,610
Who are you to tell my kids
to stay put?

1315
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,130
- Why...
- Because they're loud.

1316
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,860
Can't you see how quiet my kids are?

1317
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,920
(They are so quiet.)

1318
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,250
There's nothing wrong
with enjoying...

1319
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,570
- the victory.
- It's nothing to be proud about.

1320
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,630
- You're way out of line.
- The court is way above us.

1321
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,300
Mr. Kim?

1322
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,960
(The student keeps talking back,)

1323
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,230
(so he threatens him with a kick.)

1324
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,980
Mr. Kim, are you one
to pack a punch?

1325
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:29,840
- Do you pack a punch?
- I do.

1326
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,050
I don't!

1327
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,670
What on earth is going on?

1328
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,320
Mr. Kim, he's about to hit me.

1329
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,340
- You scoundrel.
- He's hitting me.

1330
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,790
- What do you mean?
- Sit back down.

1331
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,150
Why should I listen to you?

1332
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:42,880
- Look at how modest my kids are.
- Nine.

1333
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,130
There are nine judges.

1334
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,020
- And six must agree...
- For the case to be ruled on.

1335
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,300
That's it! Nicely done.

1336
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,460
How smart of you.
You're at the top of your class.

1337
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,570
Let's get this next one right.

1338
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,860
You need to
answer this one correctly.

1339
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,540
Here's the next question.

1340
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:58,400
Name the three basic
democratic values.

1341
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,500
This is the one!

1342
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,800
(The three basic democratic values)

1343
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,380
- This one you know.
- This is the one!

1344
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,480
- Five...
- You know this.

1345
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,570
- Four...
- The countdown's too fast.

1346
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,570
- This is the one.
- It's too fast.

1347
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:09,190
- Come on.
- You're counting down too fast.

1348
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,650
(Answer: Freedom,
equality, and human dignity)

1349
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:14,090
(Se Chan doesn't even
need to stop and think.)

1350
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,150
- All right. Two, one, hold it up.
- It's too fast.

1351
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:19,250
- Hold it up.
- Show me your answers.

1352
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,820
- Okay, hold it up.
- Hold it up now.

1353
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,960
- Seriously?
- Did I get it wrong?

1354
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,820
Why is love one of the basic values?

1355
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,170
(Freedom, equality, and love)

1356
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,460
(Love is added out of nowhere.)

1357
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,940
- I thought it was love.
- Yes!

1358
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,040
- He wrote down "love"
- Love?

1359
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,840
Love!

1360
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,440
I can't believe you guys.

1361
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,380
- You guys are the best.
- Nice.

1362
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,750
You're not giving me
enough time to write it down.

1363
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,770
You guys are the smartest.

1364
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,440
(Even the Empty Head Sisters
wrote down the correct answer.)

1365
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,090
- So Min, I can't believe it.
- This is amazing.

1366
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,210
You're the best.

1367
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,750
- Being smart makes you sexy.
- If only I had studied in school!

1368
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,960
Smart and sexy.

1369
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,960
- It was a laugh, right?
- Smart and sexy.

1370
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,190
"Dignified as humans"
doesn't seem quite right.

1371
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,000
- What are you talking about?
- That's wrong.

1372
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,130
That is incorrect.

1373
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,900
- That's wrong.
- That is incorrect.

1374
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,570
- It should be "human dignity."
- That should be incorrect.

1375
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,840
- Hold on a second.
- How is this wrong?

1376
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,900
They mean the same thing.

1377
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,800
Human and human nature
are two different words.

1378
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,130
- They're different.
- They mean different things.

1379
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:09,250
I know that,

1380
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,800
but they have similar meanings.

1381
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,250
Objectively speaking,

1382
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,150
- they aren't the same.
- They aren't.

1383
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,090
(According to the textbook,
Haha gave the wrong answer.)

1384
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:17,710
- They aren't the same.
- Jae Suk.

1385
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,480
- What...
- What do you think you're doing?

1386
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,820
What's with him?

1387
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,110
- They aren't the same.
- Jae Suk.

1388
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,360
(Crashing)

1389
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,250
- What was that?
- What's with him?

1390
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,650
- You...
- Why did you kick that?

1391
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:28,730
Hold on a second.

1392
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:29,900
Is this allowed?

1393
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,570
You made our teacher mad!

1394
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,770
- He should be reprimanded.
- Why did you kick it?

1395
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,300
- He's scaring me.
- Why did you kick that?

1396
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,770
I pushed it...

1397
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,270
- but it got knocked over.
- Why...

1398
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,130
Is he a thug?

1399
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:43,250
I was only trying
to push it to the side.

1400
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,070
Production isn't the same
as productivity.

1401
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,570
The same goes for
human and human nature.

1402
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:47,820
The teachers aren't people
to mess with.

1403
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,340
What Haha wrote
is completely different.

1404
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,020
Why would you leave this here?

1405
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,610
That's my chair, you know.

1406
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,050
No, it's mine.

1407
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:55,820
- Can you make me a jewelry box?
- Let's take our seats.

1408
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:57,820
You...

1409
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,190
- Make me a jewelry box.
- You did well. It's all right.

1410
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,900
He keeps on asking me
to make something.

1411
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,420
Here we go.

1412
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,190
- It's all right.
- There are only two questions left.

1413
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,190
Only two questions.
I think you can ask them a few more.

1414
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:09,440
The points you have scored are
13, 16, and 14 respectively.

1415
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,730
It's doable.

1416
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:12,000
- We can win this.
- Just one more correct answer.

1417
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,900
Let's at least get second place.

1418
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,380
- You guys did it.
- We've been...

1419
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,650
on a roll, right?

1420
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,900
Just maintain the lead.

1421
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,920
- He's pressuring us.
- How is it that...

1422
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,840
they were tutored by the principal?

1423
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,920
- Exactly.
- He just told us to memorize it...

1424
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,650
which is the way of the old.

1425
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,050
Here we go.

1426
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,150
My head is killing me.

1427
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:32,820
What is the money earned in business
after accounting for the expenses?

1428
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,000
- I taught you this one.
- Me too.

1429
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,020
- I mentioned a name.
- It was on top of...

1430
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,540
- the right hand corner.
- Three, two,

1431
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,270
- one. Show us your answer.
- I mentioned this too.

1432
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,720
- Show us your answer.
- The answer's profit.

1433
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,160
- Yes. It's profit.
- Profit.

1434
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,860
- Profit.
- Oh, no.

1435
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,090
The answer is profit.

1436
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:06,140
(So Min wrote the same wrong answer
as Ji Hyo.)

1437
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,340
Ji Hyo.

1438
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,430
- Ji Hyo.
- It's okay. "Net income" is fine.

1439
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:10,910
Ji Hyo wrote "net income."

1440
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,570
I wrote the same thing.

1441
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,570
We're pure.

1442
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,110
Wait. We might make it then.

1443
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,720
We're still last place.

1444
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,280
We explained it,
but you couldn't remember it.

1445
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,450
Why does our teacher
keep blaming us?

1446
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,780
- Sir, why do you keep blaming us?
- Hey.

1447
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,050
They had a good start,
but that was all.

1448
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,550
I taught you,
but you didn't remember.

1449
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,720
You just studied
the first few chapters.

1450
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,220
- The teacher keeps blaming us.
- Like a sponge.

1451
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,930
But this teacher is no joke.

1452
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,760
What's the point of teaching you?

1453
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,030
Let's get this right.

1454
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,740
The world only acknowledges
the number one.

1455
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,300
Sit down, sir.

1456
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,640
- Yes.
- Let's sit, teachers.

1457
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,950
You got this. Let's go.

1458
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:54,140
- This is the last question.
- Okay. It's done.

1459
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,820
We can turn the tables
if both of them get it right.

1460
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:02,320
Who is the German journalist
who took a risk to film a video...

1461
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:07,260
to reveal the truth of the May 18th
Democratic Uprising...

1462
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:11,390
in Gwangju in 1980 to the world?

1463
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,030
- Sorry? A German what?
- His name?

1464
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,070
A German journalist.

1465
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:16,240
- We can turn the tables.
- Wait.

1466
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,740
(Jurgen Hinzpeter)

1467
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,550
(Suk Jin who just kept saying
the name to make them memorize it)

1468
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,700
It's written here.

1469
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,450
(Jae Suk who gave them
a detailed and thorough explanation)

1470
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:30,320
(They definitely heard his name,
"Jurgen Hinzpeter.")

1471
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,050
The name of the person?

1472
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,260
A German journalist.

1473
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,530
- Okay. We can turn the tables.
- Wait.

1474
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:37,280
(If both of them get it right,
they can turn the tables.)

1475
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,450
We can turn the tables.

1476
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,800
(Will they be able to turn tables
with Mr. Yoo's teaching?)

1477
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,950
We can turn the tables.

1478
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:42,890
- Three.
- We can turn the tables.

1479
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:44,490
Three.

1480
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:45,590
Two.

1481
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,760
- One.
- Wait.

1482
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,110
Jurgen Hinzpeter.

1483
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:50,030
(Jurgen Hinzpeter)

1484
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,880
- Jurgen Hinzpeter. That's correct.
- Jurgen Hinzpeter.

1485
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,340
- Hinzpeter.
- It's "Hinz."

1486
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:54,610
It's not "Hiz."

1487
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,470
Come on.

1488
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:58,180
- It's a relief.
- Isn't it "Hiz?"

1489
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,840
It's "Hinz."

1490
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,320
"Hinz."

1491
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,840
(So Min got it right.
Young Ji got it wrong.)

1492
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,320
We're tied.

1493
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,090
It's good. We're tied.

1494
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,990
Who is "Karnayle Wale?"

1495
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,680
(Both Ji Hyo and Haha got it wrong.)

1496
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,860
- Oh, no.
- We're tied then.

1497
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,930
We need one more question.

1498
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:16,890
Jurgen Hinzpeter.
Only Sae Ho and So Min got it right.

1499
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,430
Okay. It's good. We're tied.

1500
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:19,660
"Jurgen Pepper?"

1501
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,030
We got first place.

1502
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:23,510
(Team Suk Jin won 1st place.)

1503
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,800
This is unusual.

1504
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,840
- Both teams are in second place.
- Give us the last question.

1505
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:30,550
You got this.

1506
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,840
- You got this.
- This is a one-on-one battle.

1507
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,640
This is the last question
that will decide the ranking.

1508
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,990
- I'll make sure it's fair.
- Good.

1509
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:40,050
We'll be looking at the front.

1510
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,430
No, I'll be just looking here.

1511
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,590
(Another quiet battle
between teachers started.)

1512
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,660
- Do I have to look that way?
- Do as you want.

1513
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,820
- I'll look here.
- Okay.

1514
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,530
- Good luck.
- Speak slowly, please.

1515
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:50,860
Here it is.

1516
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,930
What's the election system
where candidates are elected...

1517
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,300
by a certain number of electors?

1518
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,470
- It has come.
- It's done.

1519
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:01,030
(What's the election system
where candidates are elected...)

1520
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,610
(by a certain number of electors?)

1521
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,820
(It seems Sae Ho got it.)

1522
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,680
- Ssaebssaeb.
- What? Hold on.

1523
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,740
(Se Chan looks confused.)

1524
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,720
(Direct election
and indirect election!)

1525
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,760
(He definitely explained about
direct and indirect elections.)

1526
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,200
- This is an election system.
- Why are you telling them?

1527
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,030
- Why are you telling them?
- I think we'll make it.

1528
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,360
The other team doesn't know.

1529
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,530
(It seems Team Jong Kook
isn't sure.)

1530
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,360
- The other team doesn't know.
- They know it.

1531
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,470
Two.

1532
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:33,380
(But Teacher Kim also gave them
a detailed explanation about it.)

1533
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,640
(The memorization battle
among the four students)

1534
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,050
(The team with more members
who got it right will be 2nd place.)

1535
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,280
- It's either of the two.
- They know it.

1536
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,550
- Didn't they say this before?
- I didn't hear it.

1537
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,490
Yes. We made it.

1538
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,590
They got it right.

1539
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:46,990
(Yes! We made it!)

1540
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:48,130
Se Chan, show us.

1541
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:50,050
(Sae Ho got it right as well.)

1542
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,950
(How about Se Chan?)

1543
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,160
- Se Chan didn't get it right.
- "Coup d'etat."

1544
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,260
(Coup d'etat?)

1545
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,490
He's eliminated.

1546
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:59,360
Indirect election. That's right.

1547
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:00,740
It's all good.

1548
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,860
(Team Jong Kook won.)

1549
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,240
- We won!
- Indirect election.

1550
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,430
(The 2nd place is happier
than the 1st place.)

1551
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:07,610
That's right.

1552
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:10,110
- It's all good. Indirect election.
- We're done.

1553
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:11,840
Direct election and indirect election.
I made use of it here.

1554
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,180
Indirect election. Yes. That's it.

1555
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,450
Gosh.

1556
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,280
- Indirect election. Yes. That's it.
- Earlier...

1557
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,180
Hey. Today,

1558
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,660
I don't feel good.

1559
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,780
You told me off about my attitude
of learning earlier, and you...

1560
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,360
- Okay.
- It's a pity.

1561
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,450
It's all good.

1562
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,700
Team Suk Jin, the 1st place,
gets 15 points.

1563
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:30,070
Team Jong Kook,
the 2nd place gets 10 points.

1564
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,070
We made it.

1565
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,570
Team Jae Suk,
the 3rd place gets 5 points.

1566
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:34,660
I wrote everything.

1567
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,740
(They are precious points that will
help them when buying stocks.)

1568
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,470
You wrote everything.

1569
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,470
"Indirect election" is here.

1570
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,910
Let's take a picture
to commemorate, Mother.

1571
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,450
(Suk Jin's promotional photo
to hand out near cram schools)

1572
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:44,570
Get up.

1573
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:45,820
Let's take a picture to commemorate.

1574
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,640
We did it.

1575
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,140
I can do it. I'm not a fool.

1576
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,680
- I think I became ten years older.
- No. You did well.

1577
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,130
- I can do it.
- Now, as you used your brain,

1578
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,890
- let's go upstairs to eat.
- It's done.

1579
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:58,320
- I'm not hungry at all.
- We didn't do well.

1580
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,430
We didn't do well.

1581
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:00,550
(It's time to move on
to the next seminar.)

1582
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:01,630
Nice.

1583
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,590
The scholarship student.
The top student.

1584
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:05,970
It's okay. Things are going well.

1585
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:07,160
- It's good.
- We're last place.

1586
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,570
I'm proud, guys.

1587
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,910
- You met a good teacher.
- Gosh.

1588
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:14,640
- That's enough. Come on.
- Mother, we made it.

1589
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,140
He's bragging so much.

1590
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:17,570
I'm not bragging.

1591
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,110
- It's just...
- We were just confused.

1592
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,640
These guys are less capable.

1593
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,220
- You taught them 100 questions.
- Sorry?

1594
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,660
They just got ten right.
And you call yourself an amazing teacher?

1595
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,180
He wants to get credit.

1596
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,990
So he was like,
"These guys are less capable."

1597
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:29,530
I made them succeed.

1598
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:31,930
- Don't flatter yourself.
- Mother, don't misunderstand.

1599
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:33,220
That's not what I mean.

1600
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,890
After playing one game...

1601
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,240
- I can't remember well.
- Everyone got ten years older.

1602
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,760
It's much better to do something
with our bodies.

1603
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,300
- For real.
- That's better.

1604
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,760
Why are you so down?

1605
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,470
- But Se Chan...
- My head hurts so much.

1606
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:48,700
Se Chan forgot
as soon as he learned earlier.

1607
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,200
He forgot it right away.

1608
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:51,820
You guys studied together.

1609
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:52,910
You were good.

1610
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:55,390
He was nodding
as he wanted to please the teacher.

1611
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:56,640
"Okay."

1612
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,110
- Gosh. Sae Ho...
- He did write them down though.

1613
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:02,130
should've created
a good environment to learn.

1614
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:05,200
He was yawning.
His bad breath distracted me.

1615
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,220
- My nose and my eyes were burning.
- I don't have bad breath.

1616
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,890
- My eyes were burning.
- I brushed my teeth so many times.

1617
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:12,160
I couldn't focus.

1618
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,970
What do you mean I have bad breath?

1619
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,740
I brushed my teeth. Are you saying
that I should see a doctor?

1620
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:18,470
- That's enough.
- Probably because he lost weight.

1621
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:19,640
Really?

1622
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,300
It's important to know the image of
a company to earn money from stocks.

1623
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,380
- Yes.
- Right.

1624
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:26,450
That's why we prepared
this second seminar.

1625
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,610
It's What Image training
for gaining insight.

1626
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,090
- What Image?
- What Image?

1627
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,260
It sounds fun.

1628
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,660
It is similar to "Like Image."

1629
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,090
However,

1630
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,930
we'll show you a person,
which is the keyword of the round.

1631
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:44,840
And you should defend yourself
using the image of the person.

1632
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,140
(The member who was attacked
should defend with the image.)

1633
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,470
For example, I said Kim Jong Kook.

1634
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:50,530
And I went, "Jae Suk, four."

1635
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:53,570
Then you should go,
"muscles" related to him.

1636
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,180
And the next person who was attacked
should do the same,

1637
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,550
using another image of Jong Kook.

1638
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:57,640
Really?

1639
00:52:58,410 --> 00:52:59,470
Really?

1640
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,970
It sounds difficult.

1641
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:03,550
We'll divide you into two teams.

1642
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:05,860
- Team Young Ji and Team Sae Ho.
- Really?

1643
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:09,280
Young Ji,
pick four members you want.

1644
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,490
- Four?
- Four.

1645
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:12,220
A person with an image you can come
up with many words from is nice.

1646
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:17,570
First, Se Chan.

1647
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:18,590
- Me?
- Yes.

1648
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:19,640
- That's right.
- Him?

1649
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,640
Good.

1650
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,300
For your information,
Jae Suk sucks at this game.

1651
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,260
- Yes.
- Then I choose So Min.

1652
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,640
So Min.

1653
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:29,240
I'm sorry, but don't we usually
take turns to pick members?

1654
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:31,570
- If she picks all the members...
- Right.

1655
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:34,220
- Stay still.
- Just let her choose.

1656
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,990
- Ji Hyo.
- Nice.

1657
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:38,050
And my teacher, Suk Jin.

1658
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,680
Suk Jin is bad too.

1659
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,890
I think you chose the wrong members.

1660
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:43,360
Okay. I like it.

1661
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,430
It's good.

1662
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,930
- It's good.
- It's good.

1663
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,700
- I like it.
- I like it, Sae Ho.

1664
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,720
Let's go.

1665
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,890
I think you chose the wrong
combination of members.

1666
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:51,070
- No.
- It's fine?

1667
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:54,090
I think we can do well
as we're calm.

1668
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:56,640
The ones who always insist
are in this team.

1669
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,200
What do you mean we insist?

1670
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,930
- Insist? That's too harsh.
- We're logical.

1671
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,840
These guys are experts
at making a scene.

1672
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,950
- Sir.
- You guys are experts at it.

1673
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,140
- What scene?
- We're just capable.

1674
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:07,240
What scene did we make?

1675
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,090
They make ridiculous claims.

1676
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:11,450
- We're logical and persuasive.
- Of course.

1677
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:12,590
They're strong.

1678
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:13,610
Yes. They're strong.

1679
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:15,660
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

1680
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:18,300
Sae Ho will go first.
The first person...

1681
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,950
- is Se Chan.
- Se Chan.

1682
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,200
That's neat.

1683
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,760
(Keyword: Yang Se Chan)

1684
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,260
- It's about Se Chan.
- Se Chan.

1685
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:26,660
- If it's four... Wait.
- This is hard though.

1686
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,970
That's right.

1687
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:30,110
There are only four beats.

1688
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:31,930
Ssaebssaeb.

1689
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,610
- Should we go?
- A fool.

1690
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:35,470
- We can't overlap, right?
- No, you can't.

1691
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:36,950
It can be a long word.

1692
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,340
- Okay.
- Okay.

1693
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,450
- It can be a sentence.
- Good.

1694
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:41,110
- Nice.
- I got you.

1695
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:42,490
- Let's go.
- Here I go.

1696
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:43,820
- Okay.
- Bring it up.

1697
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,860
- What image
- What image

1698
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:48,760
Ji Hyo, two.

1699
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,530
Protruding mouth.

1700
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,130
Sae Ho, five.

1701
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,450
Five? Okay!

1702
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,820
(Sae Ho, five?)

1703
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,160
This is it.

1704
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,490
- I'm sorry about this.
- This is it. Okay.

1705
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:00,260
Excuse me. You know...

1706
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:03,260
- This is not it. I was thinking...
- We won.

1707
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,200
- of the strawberry game.
- They'll lose anyway.

1708
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,470
Ji Hyo lost it after the quiz.

1709
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,010
You said that yourself.

1710
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,110
Let that go please.

1711
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,110
- No.
- No.

1712
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,240
- No.
- We can't do that.

1713
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,970
- Let that go please.
- No.

1714
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,450
Mr. Kim. We can't do that.

1715
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:16,320
Play it right. Come on.

1716
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:18,090
We'll start with Ji Hyo.

1717
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:20,160
I'm going first.

1718
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,030
The next person is Kim Jong Kook.

1719
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,390
Kim Jong Kook. Okay.

1720
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,550
- Kim Jong Kook.
- It has to be now.

1721
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:28,220
- Let's do this.
- Okay. Good.

1722
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:31,200
- What image
- What image

1723
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,890
Jae Suk, three.

1724
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:34,490
Jong Kook.

1725
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:36,700
Come on.

1726
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,970
(He suddenly calls Jong Kook.)

1727
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:39,640
Come on.

1728
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,700
What's wrong with you?

1729
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,340
Attack Jae Suk from now on.

1730
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,380
- Attack Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk, three.

1731
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,320
He got everything wrong.

1732
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,550
- "Jong Kook?"
- Seriously?

1733
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:51,450
- I wasn't expecting it.
- Just say muscle.

1734
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,610
I wasn't prepared. I'm sorry.

1735
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,260
Why weren't you prepared?

1736
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,550
- Why weren't you prepared?
- I'm sorry.

1737
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:58,990
(Jae Suk starts apologizing.)

1738
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:00,720
- What were we doing?
- It's my fault.

1739
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,090
I will never do that again.

1740
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:03,220
Focus.

1741
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,430
Yes, sir. I am sorry.
I will never do that again.

1742
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,240
- At least one.
- You can do it, Jae Suk.

1743
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,800
- Yes, sir.
- Think about two things.

1744
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,610
- Yes, sir.
- Sit down.

1745
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:12,910
Jong Kook is feeling better
with his apology.

1746
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:13,970
Yes, sir.

1747
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:17,300
He's nervous
about this game the most.

1748
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,240
- Let's go with yours.
- Yes.

1749
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,410
The keyword is still Jong Kook.

1750
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:22,410
Here we go.

1751
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:23,990

1752
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:25,610

1754
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:29,550
(The intro is getting long.)

1755
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,030
What image

1756
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,550
- Image
- What image

1757
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:34,260
It's not Lee Mi Ja

1758
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,570
Let's get the beat first.

1759
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:37,260
- Who are you
- What image

1760
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,990
Who are you

1761
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:42,200
I'm Ji Suk Jin

1762
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,910
Hurry up

1763
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:47,110
Whatever it is, hurry up

1764
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:50,380
Lee Mi Ja also watches Running Man

1765
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,970
Does she? Hello

1766
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:54,510
(Suk Jin suddenly says hello.)

1767
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:56,890
Please join our show

1768
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:00,160
We want to see you
We're your big fan

1769
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,530
- Come on
- What image

1770
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:04,280
- What image
- What image

1771
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:05,860
Jae Suk, four.

1772
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:09,260
- Jong Kook...
- Seriously.

1773
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,990
(Jae Suk says the name again.)

1774
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:13,390
- No.
- It's boring.

1775
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,970
It's boring.

1776
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:17,140
- Wasn't that weird?
- Jong Kook again?

1777
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,410
You got the beat though.

1778
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:19,430
I am sorry.

1779
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:21,410
- You were...
- My bad.

1780
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:23,610
- practicing just until now.
- It's my fault.

1781
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:26,280
- I will never do that again.
- Why would you say Jong Kook again?

1782
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,510
- I will never do that again.
- He's driving me crazy.

1783
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,450
- The rally doesn't go on.
- No.

1784
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:32,390
- Let's play among us.
- Gosh.

1785
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:34,260
They keep coming after me.

1786
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,630
- That's why...
- Then you should be prepared.

1787
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:38,530
- Prepare yourself.
- Go say something to them.

1788
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,820
The next keyword is So Min.

1789
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,470
- So Min.
- It's So Min?

1790
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:44,570
- Think about So Min's images.
- Okay.

1791
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:47,860
Innocence.

1792
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:49,760
- So Min.
- Go.

1793
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,610
What image

1794
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:55,280
- What image
- What image

1795
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:56,640
Young Ji, three.

1796
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:58,610
Slim.

1797
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:00,070
Jae Suk, three.

1798
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,280
Slim...

1799
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,390
Come on.

1800
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:03,510
Hey!

1801
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:06,510
(It's Jae Suk again.)

1802
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:07,990
This is not fun.

1803
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:10,220
- Hang on.
- It's getting annoying.

1804
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,220
Come here.

1805
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,630
Do it for at least once.

1806
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,260
Play without me.

1807
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:15,930
- This is too much.
- Go on without me.

1808
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,220
- Jae Suk is terrible at it.
- Play without me.

1809
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,700
He's terrible.
I want to play the game.

1810
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,700
- Play without me.
- Jae Suk. Go lie down.

1811
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,700
Go lie down in the back.

1812
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,200
Gosh.

1813
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,010
- This is wrong.
- Come here.

1814
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:28,510
I told you to think about one.

1815
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:30,970
I told you to think about two,
didn't I?

1816
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,740
- He's terrible.
- He's so bad.

1817
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,090
I could say ribbit.

1818
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:37,320
- I told you to prepare two things.
- I should've said ribbit.

1819
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,280
- Why did I do that?
- There's more.

1820
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,660
Why did I do that?

1821
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:43,220
- But...
- Why didn't I say ribbit?

1822
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,430
Gosh.

1823
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:45,720
Let's try So Min again.

1824
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,030
- It's So Min again.
- It's So Min. Go.

1825
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:52,530
- What image
- What image

1826
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,300
Suk Jin, three.

1827
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,970
(Keyword: So Min)

1828
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:57,510
Cute.

1829
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:58,530
(He barely defends himself.)

1830
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:00,880
(Laughing)

1831
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:04,640
(He's lost for words.)

1832
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:06,340
- Good job.
- What's wrong with you?

1833
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,410
Good job.

1834
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:11,110
- What kind of game is this?
- Gosh.

1835
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:13,110
This is no image game.

1836
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:14,910
- It's over.
- How come I never get to play?

1837
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:16,030
It's over.

1838
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:19,450
Let young people play without them.

1839
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:21,200
- Let young people play.
- Let's play without them.

1840
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,990
- Can only the MZ Generation play?
- Jae Suk.

1841
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,800
- Your face turned red.
- Only the MZ Generation.

1842
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,590
- I...
- Why did you turn red?

1843
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:30,070
Let them have some coffee.
The rest of us will play.

1844
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,970
Let's start.

1845
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,300
- Let's start.
- I can do it now.

1846
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,340
The next keyword is Jae Suk.

1847
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,610
- Jae Suk.
- That's me.

1848
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,780
- Jae Suk's image?
- Se Chan. You go first.

1849
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,010
The keyword is Jae Suk.

Nipples.

1856
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,160

1858
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:57,890

Young Ji, three.

1866
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:13,740
(Keyword: Jae Suk)

1867
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,890
(She fails to defend.)

1868
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:17,990
(They did it.)

1869
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,320
- That was fun.
- Hey.

1870
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,180

That's how you play.

1873
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,320
Jae Suk is amazing.

59:58,199 --> 01:00:00,699
We said nipples three times.

1874
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,030
And he endured it.

1875
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,590
- I don't mind. They're mine.
- You don't mind?

1876
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:33,800
We still won.

1877
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:35,140
- That was more like it.
- Good job.

1878
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,430
That was tense.

1879
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:37,760
- We did it.
- That was a good one.

1880
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,880
I got goosebumps. I never thought
it'd go on for that long.

1881
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,530
We did it.

1882
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:42,800
- Yes!
- Let's do this.

1883
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,610
The next keyword is Young Ji.

1886
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,610
Go.

1887
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:51,780

(Four...)

1895
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:09,910
What was that?

1896
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:11,140
I was thinking New Zealand.

1897
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,700
- No.
- New Zealand.

1898
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:13,800
New Zealand.

1899
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,300
- Look.
- That was a good move.

1900
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,180
- New Zealand.
- That's too long.

1901
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,300
New Zealand.

01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,510
She studied in New Zealand.

1903
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:22,720
Then just say study abroad.

1904
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,510
Okay. I'll do that next time.

1905
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:26,220
But you can't.

1906
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,990
How bad is it?

1907
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:29,550
- Play like the last time.
- Yes.

1908
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:31,360
Okay. I'll play like the last time.

1909
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,160
Next person is Haha.

1910
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,220
- Let's go with Haha.
- Haha?

1911
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,320
- Me?
- Yes.

1912
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,430
- Do I go first?
- Yes.

01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,990
- Suk Jin.
- Okay.

1921
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:58,140
Were you introducing him?

1922
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:59,910
Dream!

1923
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:00,910
Why?

1924
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:02,130
- Next is...
- What about him?

1925
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:04,550
- Right back at me?
- Of course.

1926
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:05,820
Suk Jin. Why are you so nervous?

1927
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,200
- Dream!
- Dream!

1928
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,300
- Next is Dream!
- Calm down.

1929
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:13,970
Gosh. Fine. Bring it on.

1931
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:17,760
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

1932
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,800
Hang on.

1933
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,910
- Jong Kook will start first.
- Do I start?

1934
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:25,640
- What image
- What image

1935
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,090

01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:38,430
Jong Kook.

1940
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:40,360
(Jong Kook.)

1941
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,760
Se Chan, three.

1942
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:44,800
Woman. Jong Kook, one.

1943
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,640
Big eyes. Se Chan, four.

1944
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,640
Double eye lids.

1945
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,010
(Se Chan succeeds in defending.)

1946
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,200
Jong Kook, two.

1947
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,240
(Jong Kook, two.)

1948
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,410
Jong Kook, two.

1949
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:57,380
- Wait...
- Okay.

1950
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:00,820
(Jong Kook fails.)

1951
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:01,910
That was a good one.

1952
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:03,410
Go blame him.

1953
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:05,720
I was thinking.

1954
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,550
- I can't repeat the same word.
- Do you think I wasn't thinking?

1955
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,630
Because I can't repeat
the same word.

1956
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:12,320
You think I didn't know that?

1957
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:14,630
Jae Suk is raising his voice.

1958
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:15,930
- That's not it.
- You need to do better.

1959
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:16,930
Some...

1960
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:18,490
Why are you quiet?

1961
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:20,140
- I agree.
- Am I right?

1962
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:22,160
- I was losing focus.
- Yes.

1963
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,260
Why are you quiet
when Jong Kook got it wrong?

1964
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:25,610
- But...
- Don't you agree?

1965
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:27,070
Right? Am I wrong?

1966
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,610
- You're not wrong.
- See?

1967
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:30,180
The next keyword is Sae Ho.

1968
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:31,640
- Sae Ho.
- An image about me.

1969
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,380

1970
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:36,340
- What image
- What image

1971
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,490
- Ji Hyo, four.
- Designer brand.

1972
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:40,860
Jong Kook, three.

1973
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,660
Show off. Se Chan, four.

1974
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:47,890
(He's off beat.)

1975
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:49,630
- Hang on.
- He ignored it.

1976
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:51,360
You took it too far.

1977
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,970
- What?
- You ignored it.

1978
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:54,140
- You took it too far.
- It's serious.

1979
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,760
- Jong Kook.
- That was wrong.

1980
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,140
Why are you all quiet?

1981
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:58,880
- Why are you quiet?
- He was completely off.

1982
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,610
- You let that go?
- Why are you quiet?

1983
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:02,640
It was iffy.

1984
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,800
It wasn't iffy at all.

1985
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,010
- Jae Suk. Why are you quiet?
- It was iffy.

1986
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:08,280
- It was iffy.
- He just pushed me.

1987
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,320
My goodness.

1988
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:13,450
- "Show off."
- Look.

1989
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:15,660
If I was wrong, say I was wrong.

1990
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:18,490
I didn't say anything
because it was iffy.

1991
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:19,990
Why are you quiet?

1992
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:21,890
- It was iffy, wasn't it?
- "Show off."

1993
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:22,990
Let us try it one more time.

1994
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:24,990
- Apologize.
- It was iffy.

1995
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:26,140
- Sorry.
- Suk Jin.

1996
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:27,490
Do you have to cross your arms?

1997
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:29,360
- It's not that serious.
- I said I'm sorry.

1998
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,640
He just apologized.

1999
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,640
Get up
and bring your hands together.

2000
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,380
- Why should I?
- Why do you demand it?

2001
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:35,510
Sit down.

2002
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:37,180
He's old enough.

2003
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:38,450
I'm old enough.

2004
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:39,640
Get up.

2005
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,340
Sit down. Why are you up?

2006
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,450
- Choose one.
- Choose what?

2007
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:43,820
Are you going to get up
or should I sit down?

2008
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:45,050
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

2009
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,220
- Okay.
- He's listening to you.

2010
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:49,360
- There.
- He's obedient.

2011
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,890
Currently, it's 7 to 7. It's a tie.

2012
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,030
- I know.
- No way.

2013
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:54,200
- I love this game.
- This is the last round.

2014
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,530
- Let's do this.
- Let's win.

2015
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:57,130
Since it's the last round,
the keyword is Jae Suk.

2016
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,430
- Okay.
- Jae Suk. Good.

2017
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:00,240
- Really?
- Okay.

2018
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,240
(Jae Suk's image will
determine the winner.)

2019
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,140
(Which team will it be?)

2020
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:05,740
Wait. I have to choose one.

2021
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:06,740
Let's go.

2022
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,470
- What image
- What image

2023
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:10,200
(The last round begins.)

2024
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,740
- What image
- What image

2025
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:13,610
(Keyword: Jae Suk)

2026
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,740
Suk Jin, four.

2027
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:15,910
Mapo.

2028
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:17,990
Suk Jin, four.

2029
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,990
(He fails in the speed of light.)

2030
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:21,760
- Come on.
- What was that?

2031
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,820
Let me go again.

2032
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:24,720
- It was a sudden attack.
- Let me off this once.

2033
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,450
- He was in a daze.
- Let me off this once.

2034
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:29,260
- What was "Mapo?"
- What was that?

2035
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,430
Let me off this once.

2036
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:32,070
You let him off.

2037
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,660
If they accept your apology,
we will let you off.

2038
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:34,800
Apologize then.

2039
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,110
We can't let him off.

2040
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:37,340
- Apologize.
- I will apologize.

2041
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:38,800
Apologize formally.

2042
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:39,910
Sorry.

2043
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:41,240
- Apologize formally.
- We can't accept that.

2044
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,010
What did you say earlier about
how an apology should be?

2045
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,470
- Apologize sincerely.
- How should you apologize?

2046
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:45,780
I have a suggestion then.

2047
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,610
Apologize to us like this.

2048
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,610
"I am terribly sorry."

2049
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:50,950
"I won't do it again."

2050
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:53,010
"I am terribly sorry."

2051
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:54,390
"I won't do it again."

2052
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:56,390
(Hopping)

2053
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:58,630
- That's a good idea.
- Apologize like this.

2054
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,160
- That's a good idea.
- Go ahead, Suk Jin.

2055
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,550
- Go outside the door like that.
- Hurry up.

2056
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:02,990
- We can accept that apology.
- Hurry up.

2057
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:04,070
Hurry up and do it.

2058
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:05,360
We can accept that apology.

2059
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,660
Hurry up and do it.

2060
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:07,840
Wouldn't it be better to lose?

2061
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,070
- No.
- No.

2062
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:11,110
- Of course not.
- It's too much.

2063
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:12,280
- The result depends on it.
- He should do that much.

2064
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,340
Please do it.

2065
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,780
- That's right.
- Think of it as a comedy skit.

2066
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:16,840
- "I am terribly sorry."
- Please do it.

2067
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,320
- "I won't do it again."
- Then hop away.

2068
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:20,820
- Do it politely.
- Then hop away.

2069
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:22,450
- Do it politely.
- Don't show your back.

2070
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:23,840
- Don't show your back.
- That's right.

2071
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:25,180
"I am so sorry."

2072
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,490
I am sorry.

2073
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:30,160
- No.
- Put your hands together.

2074
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:31,680
- For goodness' sake.
- Think of it as a comedy skit.

2075
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,630
"I am so sorry."

2076
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:35,990
"Misters, I am so sorry."

2077
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:38,660
"I won't do it again."

2078
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,090
My goodness.

2079
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:44,930
(He becomes soft-spoken.)

2080
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:46,200
My goodness.

2081
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:50,410
I didn't know this would happen.

2082
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:51,950
I am so sorry.

2083
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:55,640
My goodness. I am sorry.

2084
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,220
You have to do everything here.

2085
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,640
You have to do everything here.

2086
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:00,910
- That doesn't count.
- Come on.

2087
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:02,550
- That doesn't count.
- It should be good enough.

2088
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:03,720
It should be good enough you punk.

2089
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,260
- That doesn't count.
- What else do you want me to do?

2090
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,450
Why did you hit him?

2091
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:07,990
Why did you hit me?

2092
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,260
- It should be good enough.
- No.

2093
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:10,320
Don't be absurd. That doesn't count.

2094
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,660
- Forget it.
- We won then.

2095
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,590
- Won't you accept his apology?
- We won't accept it.

2096
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:15,240
- We won't accept it.
- But he apologized.

2097
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,240
You won.

2098
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,760
- Okay.
- Okay.

2099
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:20,280
- You guys did nothing!
- It wasn't anything hard.

2100
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,180
- What was that?
- It wasn't anything hard.

2101
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:24,200
- You should have done it properly.
- You ruined it.

2102
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,280
- You just had to do this.
- Why didn't you do it?

2103
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,550
Seriously.

2104
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:28,680
Why didn't you do it?

2105
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,640
"I am terribly sorry.
I won't do it again."

2106
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,990
- Why didn't you do it?
- It wasn't anything hard.

2107
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:35,590
I am not the type to bow to someone.

2108
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,220
- Forget it.
- That's a lie.

2109
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:40,630
Thus, this team will receive points.

2110
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:41,890
- We don't have good energy.
- Seriously.

2111
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:43,590
You must be hungry...

2112
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:45,220
- due to the busy seminar schedule.
- Yes.

2113
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:48,660
To help you get adjusted,
we prepared a local meal.

2114
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:49,970
- Is it pizza? Burger?
- I think it's pizza.

2115
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:51,530
- The food will be brought in.
- Bring it in.

2116
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:52,910
But Sae Ho is...

2117
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:54,910
a model for a burger brand.

2118
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:56,010
Really?

2119
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:57,910
- So he has to eat separately.
- What?

2120
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,780
Are we eating burgers?

2121
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,110
- No.
- We aren't eating burgers.

2122
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,050
- The contract covers Western food.
- Really?

2123
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:06,180
You should have divided the terms
into smaller categories.

2124
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:07,820
I am not that influential yet.

2125
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:12,550
- Those are ribs.
- The dishes look so tasty.

2126
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,390
- My goodness.
- Outback Steakhouse.

2127
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:17,070
(It's a meal
for the hungry investors.)

2128
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:18,660
It's my favorite dish, garlic steak.

2129
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:21,390
- I love steak.
- Garlic steak.

2130
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:22,910
Sae Ho, please step aside.

2131
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:24,070
Sae Ho.

2132
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:25,430
- Step aside.
- Step aside.

2133
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:27,840
You should have prepared
Korean food or something.

2134
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:31,840
(The menu is up to the advertisers.)

2135
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,010
- It's nice.
- Thank you for the food.

2136
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,180
- Seriously.
- Thank you for the food.

2137
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,950
- Sae Ho, you can't be in the shot.
- Really?

2138
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:39,160
(The model of the burger brand
gets chased away.)

2139
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,320
- It's the tenderloin.
- I experienced the same thing.

2140
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:44,320
A Korean meal. It's nice too.

2141
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:47,130
Enjoy the food comfortably.

2142
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,300
- It's nice.
- Thank you for the food.

2143
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,400
- This is the New York steak.
- Yes.

2144
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:53,940
Look at the meat. Look at this.

2145
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,490
- Try this one.
- Dip it in the sauce.

2146
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,660
- This one.
- This one?

2147
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:58,530
The steak is so tasty.

2148
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:00,980
(The monsters of product placement
are actually impressed.)

2149
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,740
It's so juicy.

2150
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:04,680
- It's still good.
- It's tasty, right?

2151
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,440
- Gosh, it's nice.
- Outback Steakhouse is the best.

2152
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:08,150
The soup is nice.

2153
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:09,520
It's no wonder
the chain is number one.

2154
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:11,910
Is Sae Ho receiving a penalty?

2155
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:13,410
This is the tenderloin.

2156
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:16,690
It's nice. The soup is really nice.

2157
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,230
(He enjoys the hot soup by himself.)

2158
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:21,430
Isn't it customary to prepare
a different menu...

2159
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:22,990
if you know about
a guest's limitations?

2160
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,900
I get that we are in New York,
but there must be other dishes.

2161
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,970
- Be quiet. Let us eat in peace.
- I am sorry.

2162
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:29,970
My goodness.

2163
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:32,200
Jae Suk, please eat
the Toowoomba pasta.

2164
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,030
- This one?
- Yes.

2165
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:35,340
- We are eating so much.
- What's the name?

2166
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:36,880
- Toowoomba pasta.
- Toowoomba pasta.

2167
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:39,180
- The sauce is thick.
- It's a dish I eat by myself.

2168
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:40,410
Don't be ridiculous.
We can share it.

2169
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,440
No. If you butt in,
they will have to film it again.

2170
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:43,610
No way.

2171
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:44,890
- Don't be ridiculous.
- It's true.

2172
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,650
(It's true.)

2173
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:49,480
- My goodness.
- That's funny.

2174
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:52,190
- That's funny.
- You can't eat it.

2175
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,630
- Hey. Don't be ridiculous.
- I need to eat it by myself.

2176
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:54,820
They need a shot by myself.

2177
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:55,990
(The advertisers want a shot
of Jae Suk by himself.)

2178
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:57,520
Choowoom...

2179
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,660
- It's Toowoomba pasta.
- Toowoomba, not Choowoomba.

2180
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,470
I ate Toowoomba pasta so often
back in the day.

2181
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,360
- Do they do deliveries?
- Yes.

2182
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,230
- Like this? Do they do deliveries?
- Yes.

2183
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,240
It would have been nice
if Sae Ho could eat with us.

2184
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:12,610
Look at this.

2185
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,650
Why are you not blending in
with us today?

2186
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:18,240
- Will you keep doing things alone?
- Seriously.

2187
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,190
Will you keep eating alone
like an A-list celebrity?

2188
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,410
The soup is nice.

2189
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:22,760
(The celebrity who loves
seaweed soup finishes eating.)

2190
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:24,730
The flight to New York
will leave in a few hours.

2191
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:26,850
- We will finally leave.
- We will finally leave.

2192
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:29,820
- This makes me a bit excited.
- New York

2193
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,690
- I am excited.
- New York State of Mind

2194
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:35,230
- Your points have piled up.
- Okay.

2195
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,840
Now comes the last schedule.

2196
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:39,380
It's called the Ants' Photo Time.

2197
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,230
- Photo Time?
- The Ants' Photo Time.

2198
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:43,570
The Running Man members
have tried something similar.

2199
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:45,240
- You need to be in the angle.
- I know what it is.

2200
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:46,570
Do you see this camera?

2201
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,770
What it films
will show up on the monitor.

2202
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:50,240
The camera will spin.

2203
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,890
Then it will stop
in the count of three.

2204
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:54,720
- We need to be in the angle.
- All the members of your team...

2205
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,450
need to be in the angle.

2206
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:57,820
- Okay.
- It's a team competition again.

2207
01:10:57,930 --> 01:11:01,100
Among eyes, nose, and mouth,
two need to show.

2208
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:02,350
- Two or more.
- Okay.

2209
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:03,860
One team will go at a time.

2210
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:06,060
The number of teammates
who are in the shot...

2211
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,970
- will be the points you receive.
- Okay.

2212
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:11,860
But half of the opposing team
can disturb the process.

2213
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:13,380
- Really?
- It won't be easy.

2214
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:15,180
- Not many people will succeed.
- The disturbers in the shot...

2215
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,810
will be counted for the points.

2216
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:19,910
So they need to disturb
without appearing in the shot.

2217
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:22,020
- We just need to be in the shot.
- Yes.

2218
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:25,190
- It's over.
- Jong Kook's team will win.

2219
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:27,260
I won't be so aggressive.

2220
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:28,910
May I pick the teammates this time?

2221
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:30,520
No. There is a separate rule.

2222
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:32,730
- Stop getting ahead of yourself.
- Why are you acting up?

2223
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:34,820
- Leave it up to the producer.
- Can't I ask a question?

2224
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:36,560
Why are you acting up?

2225
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,470
- Isn't that what the show is about?
- Acting up?

2226
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,530
- Acting up?
- Of course not.

2227
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,600
- This show is about the quiet talk.
- That's right.

2228
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:44,340
- Manners.
- Yes.

2229
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,140
- That's right.
- Do you think we acted up?

2230
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:47,380
- Do you think we acted up?
- You should just be quiet.

2231
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:48,440
I didn't mean it like that.

2232
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,770
As for the teams,

2233
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:51,570
they will change for each round.

2234
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:52,610
(The teams will change
for each round.)

2235
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:55,520
We will ask you a question
with two possible answers.

2236
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,090
People who choose
the same thing will be a team.

2237
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:59,520
- Okay. It's about the character.
- That's nice.

2238
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,720
That's really nice.

2239
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,280
- What's so nice about it?
- Sae Ho.

2240
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,630
What's so nice about it?
Your reactions are too much.

2241
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:05,900
- It's nice.
- They are too over-the-top.

2242
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,560
All right. Here comes the question
that will divide the teams...

2243
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:10,630
- for the first round.
- What is it? Let's hear it.

2244
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:13,160
- You will sit down or stand up.
- Okay.

2245
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:16,060
- Please imagine the situation.
- Imagine.

2246
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,310
Whom would you choose
as So Min's husband?

2247
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:19,310
- So Min's husband?
- So Min?

2248
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:20,900
- Sit down for Se Chan...
- So Min?

2249
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,140
and stand up for Sae Ho.

2250
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,680
(Whom would you choose
as So Min's husband?)

2251
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,150
(Sit down for Se Chan
versus Stand up for Sae Ho)

2252
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:27,410
- Both are good options.
- Do I choose as well?

2253
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:28,610
- I choose as well, right?
- Yes.

2254
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:30,690
- Come on.
- So Min's husband.

2255
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:32,240
Why do we keep choosing
So Min's husband...

2256
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,810
- among comedians?
- Why are my options so bad?

2257
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:35,720
- Why are my options so bad?
- I will stay quiet.

2258
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,450
It's a bit strange.

2259
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,630
- Why are they all comedians?
- So Min has no interest.

2260
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:42,660
- It might be her fate.
- Right.

2261
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,690
Sit down for Se Chan...

2262
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:45,730
and stand up for Sae Ho.

2263
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:46,860
Hold on.

2264
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,940
- I don't know whom to choose.
- Think about it.

2265
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:50,730
- Okay.
- Sit down for Se Chan.

2266
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:51,970
- Stand up for Sae Ho.
- Stand up for Sae Ho.

2267
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:53,140
- My husband.
- It's a matter of pride.

2268
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,270
What do you think?

2269
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,680
I need to think about it.

2270
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,570
One,

2271
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,520
- two, three.
- This is driving me crazy.

2272
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:13,760
Five people chose Se Chan.

2273
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,760
Why didn't you choose yourself?

2274
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,460
(Disappointed)

2275
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:18,960
I thought Jong Kook would stand up.

2276
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,930
- Why didn't you choose yourself?
- I thought he would stand up.

2277
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:21,930
Me too.

2278
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,560
Se Chan,
the fact you stood up means...

2279
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:26,930
- you want her to marry Sae Ho.
- Hey.

2280
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:30,710
- You always told me to date So Min.
- But...

2281
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:32,140
in this situation, it's Se Chan.

2282
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:34,580
- Five people should come over here.
- Will they date now?

2283
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,710
- Please put this on.
- Yes.

2284
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:37,810
Okay.

2285
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:39,680
What kind of a question was that?

2286
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,660
Please share your reasons.

2287
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:42,810
Sae Ho...

2288
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,680
- is full of self-love.
- Self-love.

2289
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:47,630
- He loves himself more.
- Yes.

2290
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,050
- His character isn't compatible...
- That's right.

2291
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,170
with So Min's.

2292
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:52,960
You have a point.

2293
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,060
- But Sae Ho...
- But once I date someone,

2294
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:56,870
I get rid of self-love.

2295
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:58,510
Can you give us an example?

2296
01:13:58,510 --> 01:13:59,800
Tell us about something you did.

2297
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,970
- For example...
- Okay.

2298
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:03,840
Have you ever been
in a relationship?

2299
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,640
- He isn't lying.
- Come on.

2300
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,580
You know what it means
to be in a relationship, right?

2301
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:08,970
You share...

2302
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:11,310
- lovely moments.
- She and I kissed, okay?

2303
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:14,850
Sae Ho once dated a girl
from Suncheon.

2304
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,120
I heard that he showers women
with gifts.

2305
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,830
My first love
I dated at the age of 20...

2306
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:21,020
was from Suncheon.

2307
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:22,760
- Ms. Suncheon.
- A long-distance relationship.

2308
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:25,260
- A long-distance relationship.
- I had a missed call,

2309
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,800
so I called and said,
"Honey, you called."

2310
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,130
"Mister, what are you up to?"

2311
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,370
- Did her father answer the phone?
- Yes.

2312
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:30,630
- Her father.
- No. It was her.

2313
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:32,460
- She is from Suncheon.
- "Mister, what are you up to?"

2314
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,910
- Wasn't it her father?
- Wasn't it her father?

2315
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:36,430
- Did she say that?
- Yes.

2316
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:37,710
- She said that.
- "Hello."

2317
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:39,100
"Mister, what are you up to?"

2318
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,470
- "Really?"
- "Did you have a meal?"

2319
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:42,310
"Yes, I did. Did you?"

2320
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:44,490
"Yes, I had Korean dishes."

2321
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:45,990
- Really?
- Yes.

2322
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:48,460
- "I miss you a lot, mister."
- Are you serious?

2323
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,680
- Did you date a middle-aged woman?
- No.

2324
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,380
- She used...
- She was his age.

2325
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:54,350
- a dialect.
- Was she his age?

2326
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:56,920
She asked me what I ate
and I told her that I had pasta.

2327
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,760
"You shouldn't eat pasta."

2328
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,170
"Your health comes first, okay?"

2329
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:02,870
- Are you serious?
- I am serious.

2330
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:04,910
- Was she younger than you?
- She was my age.

2331
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:05,910
That's Sae Ho's love.

2332
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:08,210
- That's right.
- He is sweet.

2333
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:10,770
One time, he was seen
at Apgujeong-dong.

2334
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:11,770
He was seen with a model.

2335
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:13,300
Yes. He was seen with a model.

2336
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:14,840
He walked like this.

2337
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:17,140
You put your arm around her.

2338
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:18,310
- Yes.
- I wanted to stand out.

2339
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:19,790
I wanted to stand out.

2340
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,710
(He barely managed
to put his arm around her.)

2341
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:24,210
Don't lie. There is no way
she was that tall.

2342
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:25,990
How did you kiss her?

2343
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:27,020
I jumped.

2344
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:30,500
I told her to close her eyes
and jumped.

2345
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,200
(A brief kiss required
some serious jumping skills.)

2346
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,460
- He is warmhearted.
- You could keep kissing her.

2347
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:35,700
- He has kissed someone.
- He is warmhearted.

2348
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:36,700
It couldn't be
a serious kiss though.

2349
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,800
I am touched
that he has kissed someone.

2350
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,370
In conclusion,

2351
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:42,470
- don't date anyone in this circle.
- Why not?

2352
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:43,740
- Then...
- You are out of their league.

2353
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,050
- Then where will I meet someone?
- No, she isn't.

2354
01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:46,210
I will introduce you to someone.

2355
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:47,450
- You?
- Like who?

2356
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:49,640
Your younger friends
are in their 50s and 60s.

2357
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,490
How will So Min date someone
in his 50s or 60s?

2358
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:53,050
- Hey.
- That's worse.

2359
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:54,550
My younger friends
aren't in their 60s.

2360
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,850
They are in their 60s.

2361
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,260
I am 100 percent sure
he will ask So Min,

2362
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:58,420
"Miss, did you have a meal?"

2363
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:00,920
(The man who is her dad's age
will surely do that.)

2364
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,160
- "Where are you?"
- That won't work.

2365
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,420
That's right.

2366
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:06,330
- "What do you like?"
- He should be in his 30s or 40s.

2367
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:07,930
- That's right.
- Seriously.

2368
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,130
- All right. Get ready.
- This is ridiculous.

2369
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:12,300
The three members
can disturb them together.

2370
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:13,630
Can they begin right away?

2371
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:15,080
- All right.
- Look after Young Ji.

2372
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,300
Let's begin. Move the camera.

2373
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:19,270
Be ruthless.

2374
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:21,120
- Let's go.
- Don't go easy on them.

2375
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,580
Protect Young Ji.

2376
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:24,170
All right. One,

2377
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:25,750
two,

2378
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:27,340
- three.
- Where is it?

2379
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:28,490
- Where is it?
- Three,

2380
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:29,850
- two,
- I can't see.

2381
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:30,920
one.

2382
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:32,550
- What?
- Is this allowed?

2383
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:33,920
Young Ji and Se Chan succeeded.

2384
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,200
(Team Sae Ho got 2 points!)

2385
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,390
- Okay.
- Is this allowed? He covered...

2386
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:40,560
- So Min.
- He covered my glasses.

2387
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,090
More people succeeded
because you lifted up the camera.

2388
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:43,130
Really?

2389
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:44,460
The shot covers a wider area
than I expected.

2390
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:45,930
Is covering the face allowed?

2391
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:48,080
- Two people can disturb.
- Two disturbers.

2392
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,300
- Two.
- Camera.

2393
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:51,140
- Let's begin.
- Let's go.

2394
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:53,050
- Let's go.
- The shot covers a wide area.

2395
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:54,840
- Go.
- No. Get in there.

2396
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,120
- Go. Which way is it facing?
- Okay.

2397
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,510
- One,
- Here.

2398
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:58,680
- two,
- Here.

2399
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:00,010
- three.
- It's here.

2400
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:01,710
- Three, two,
- It's here.

2401
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:02,760
- one.
- It's here.

2402
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:03,920
- There we go.
- Okay.

2403
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:08,850
Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, and Jae Suk.
Three members succeeded.

2404
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:10,350
- Three.
- We won.

2405
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:12,370
I covered his face.

2406
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:14,170
- Here comes the second question.
- Okay.

2407
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:16,130
You are having a get-together
for the first time in a while,

2408
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,170
so you need to pick
the person you will sit with.

2409
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:20,060
Sit down for the nagging Jae Suk...

2410
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,170
and stand up
for the harassing Jong Kook.

2411
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:23,210
(Sit down
for the nagging Jae Suk...)

2412
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:24,240
(versus Stand up
for the harassing Jong Kook)

2413
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,270
It's hard.

2414
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:26,840
Sit down for nagging?

2415
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,120
Sit down for the nagging Jae Suk.

2416
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:29,340
Stand up
for the harassing Jong Kook.

2417
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,090
Follow your heart.

2418
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:32,140
- One,
- This is hard.

2419
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:33,340
- This is hard.
- two,

2420
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:34,420
three.

2421
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,920
(6 people choose Jong Kook
and 2 people choose Jae Suk.)

2422
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,130
Three.

2423
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,680
(Sighing)

2424
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,420
Haha sat down.

2425
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:44,630
Jong Kook, Haha sat down.

2426
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:45,960
- Sit down.
- I didn't sit down.

2427
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,390
- You sat down.
- You sat down.

2428
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:48,870
- I almost sat down.
- Sit down.

2429
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:50,460
- You sat down.
- Sit down.

2430
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,510
Three people chose Jae Suk.

2431
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:53,960
- Okay.
- The rest chose Jong Kook.

2432
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,240
- Really?
- Do we play by ourselves?

2433
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,300
Yes. The three of you are a team.

2434
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,380
- I see.
- Really?

2435
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:00,100
Let's hear about your reasons.

2436
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:03,080
When I am drinking happily,

2437
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,450
- I don't want to be harassed.
- I don't do it continuously.

2438
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:07,010
It will kill the joy of drinking.

2439
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:09,880
You say that
because you haven't experienced...

2440
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,520
- Jae Suk's nagging.
- That's right.

2441
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,180
- Have you experienced it?
- Does his nagging tire you out?

2442
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:16,920
It doesn't tire me out,
but he calls me.

2443
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:19,520
He calls me on Sunday morning.

2444
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,960
"Where are you?"
"I am at home in Mapo-gu."

2445
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:24,260
"Hey! You are a young man!"

2446
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:26,010
"You shouldn't be holed up
in the house."

2447
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,910
"You should go out
and enjoy the beautiful weather."

2448
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:29,840
- "Go out and run."
- I don't do that.

2449
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,300
- I don't do that.
- "Okay."

2450
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:34,050
I hurriedly put on my clothes
and go outside.

2451
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,550
"Where are you?"

2452
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:37,380
"Jae Suk, I came outside." "Hey!"

2453
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:40,590
"Don't you care about fine dust?
Go back inside!"

2454
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:43,160
It's the way we bicker.

2455
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,160
- That's right.
- Thus,

2456
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,180
we talk on the phone
3 or 4 times a day.

2457
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,420
- We do that.
- Morning...

2458
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:49,660
- Morning, afternoon, and evening.
- Morning, afternoon, and evening.

2459
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:50,830
Then there are special occasions.

2460
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:52,060
- Do you ever fail to pick up?
- What?

2461
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,220
Do you ever fail to pick up?

2462
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:54,460
He keeps his phone on silent mode.

2463
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:56,170
- Have you ever screened his calls?
- Silent mode.

2464
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:57,240
- Yes.
- Yes or no.

2465
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,260
- Yes or no.
- I bet he does it.

2466
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:00,760
- Sit down for "yes..."
- And stand up for "no."

2467
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:02,410
Have I ever screened his calls?

2468
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:03,510
Yes.

2469
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:07,340
(He has screened his calls.)

2470
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:09,050
Of course. Yes.

2471
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:10,750
- I have done it once.
- Of course. It's understandable.

2472
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:12,050
- It was because of work.
- Of course.

2473
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:13,290
- I was in the middle of a shoot.
- Of course.

2474
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:15,620
Haha, why did you choose Jae Suk?

2475
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,590
- I don't say much to you.
- To be honest,

2476
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:19,090
I could pick neither.

2477
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:20,590
But you do the same.

2478
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,700
- Do I nag?
- That's right.

2479
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:23,960
- You nag the younger ones.
- That's right.

2480
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,300
- Me?
- You nag so much.

2481
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,930
- You nag so much.
- You nag the younger ones.

2482
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,300
You don't know what
they are sick and tired of, right?

2483
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,040
They are sick and tired of you
talking about life.

2484
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,600
You little punks!

2485
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:36,470
- He talks about his struggles.
- I did it for your sake.

2486
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:37,840
- He talks about his struggles.
- Seriously.

2487
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,050
He doesn't stop.

2488
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:41,640
- He talks about money too.
- That's right.

2489
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,080
It sounds like
he wants to borrow money.

2490
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,250
- Me?
- Don't talk about money.

2491
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:45,380
He talks about money.

2492
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,180
Hey, don't make things up.

2493
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:48,510
Don't make things up.

2494
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:51,050
I don't like it
when Haha pretends to be cool.

2495
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:54,460
He pretends to be nice.

2496
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:56,630
- "Yaman!"
- He pretends to be hip.

2497
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:57,720
- He pretends to be hip.
- "Yaman!"

2498
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,370
- He pretends to be hip.
- He always does that.

2499
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,340
Seriously.

2500
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:04,540
"You can call me anytime."

2501
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:06,370
I am sorry.

2502
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:10,080
- The six members will go first.
- Okay.

2503
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,710
- Two...
- Here.

2504
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:13,450
- Which way is it facing?
- Check the camera.

2505
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:15,270
- Three.
- Where is it?

2506
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:16,450
- Three,
- Let go.

2507
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:18,090
two, one.

2508
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,050
Only So Min succeeded.

2509
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:21,680
(Only So Min succeeded.)

2510
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:23,460
- Okay.
- Why...

2511
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:24,590
You were too close to the camera.

2512
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:26,460
- You blocked everyone.
- You did well.

2513
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:28,500
- You blocked everyone.
- Hey.

2514
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,260
I had to be in the angle.

2515
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:31,670
You should have backed off.

2516
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:33,260
- You blocked everyone.
- Hey,

2517
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:34,870
- you did well.
- Only So Min succeeded.

2518
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:36,930
- Only Haha succeeded.
- Okay.

2519
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:38,300
I should have covered his face.

2520
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,630
We did well.

2521
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:41,340
- It's the last round.
- Okay.

2522
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,600
Let's go.

2523
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,340
Choose the one you would rather be
stranded on an island with.

2524
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,640
Suk Jin, the burden
who complains a lot.

2525
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,750
So Min, the distraction
who has no survival skills.

2526
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:52,880
(Stand up for So Min
versus Sit down for Suk Jin)

2527
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,450
- All right.
- Which option is sitting down?

2528
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,920
Sit down if you would rather be
with Suk Jin.

2529
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:58,830
Stand up if you would rather be
with So Min.

2530
01:20:58,830 --> 01:20:59,830
I would be a better choice.

2531
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:01,020
This is...

2532
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,590
This is very simple.

2533
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:03,920
Just see them as individuals.

2534
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,170
Don't think about the gender.

2535
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:07,330
You will be stranded
on an island with this person.

2536
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:08,890
Sit down for Suk Jin.

2537
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,500
One, two, three.

2538
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,710
(Will it be Suk Jin
who complains a lot?)

2539
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:14,460
- Okay.
- Three.

2540
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:18,300
- So Min would be better.
- Go to an island with him.

2541
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,450
So Min would be better.

2542
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:20,880
- Let's hear about your reasons.
- Why?

2543
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,080
It would be nice to be with me.

2544
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:24,210
- I would talk all night long.
- I chose him for that reason.

2545
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:25,510
- Me too.
- I would talk all night long.

2546
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:27,640
It would be like listening
to a radio show.

2547
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:29,590
But he would laze around...

2548
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:31,420
- while you work.
- He would complain a lot.

2549
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:32,550
- He wouldn't do anything.
- He would complain a lot.

2550
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:34,700
I know Suk Jin too well.

2551
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,200
Toward the end...
"Suk Jin, we should do this."

2552
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:39,130
"No, I am just going to die."

2553
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,220
"I am just going to die."

2554
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,930
(Suk Jin will be too bothered
to live.)

2555
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:44,090
- "You do it."
- "Go on without me."

2556
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:45,430
"This is it for me."

2557
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:48,510
- It would be so sad to bury you.
- "I can't do this any longer."

2558
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,130
"It would be so sad to bury you."

2559
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:53,580
I would cut down wood
and make a raft.

2560
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,950
I would do my best to escape.

2561
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:57,140
You would use that raft
for his dead body.

2562
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:58,840
(He would pass away on the raft.)

2563
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,090
- Now comes...
- Okay.

2564
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:01,880
- the last round.
- Let's win.

2565
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,180
We can win.

2566
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:05,050
Suk Jin and Sae Ho will be
the disturbers.

2567
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:06,290
Okay. Here we go.

2568
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:07,290
(Team So Min will go.)

2569
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:08,590
So Min, don't move to the front.

2570
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,000
Let's begin.

2571
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,760
- Study the camera.
- Take it slow.

2572
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,200
We don't need to move now.

2573
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,890
- Don't move to the front.
- We have three seconds.

2574
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,200
Are there only two disturbers?

2575
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,870
(Screaming)

2576
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,800
Suk Jin.

2577
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,010
(This old man can't do much.)

2578
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:22,100
What's up with him?

2579
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:23,130
One,

2580
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:24,670
- two...
- Suk Jin.

2581
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:26,470
Go in front of Jong Kook.

2582
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,250
- Two,
- Go in front of Jong Kook.

2583
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:30,450
three.

2584
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:34,250
- Three, two, one.
- I was disturbing the wrong person.

2585
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:36,760
You got three points.

2586
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,490
(Team So Min got 3 points.)

2587
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:40,290
Two,

2588
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:42,200
- one.
- I was disturbing the wrong person.

2589
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,870
(The old man used his power
on his teammate.)

2590
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:46,500
- Are you okay?
- You got three points.

2591
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,460
Hey, who hurt Sae Ho?

2592
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,630
Sae Ho is hurt.

2593
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:52,910
- What's wrong?
- It's okay.

2594
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:54,010
- What's wrong?
- Are you okay?

2595
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:55,100
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

2596
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,580
(One-eyed)

2597
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:59,210
I think a thumb entered
my eye socket.

2598
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,910
- It was an optical illusion.
- Hey.

2599
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:02,450
An optical illusion?

2600
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:03,620
It wasn't an optical illusion.

2601
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:04,640
Can you see it?

2602
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,090
- All right.
- I can see it.

2603
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:08,810
Who will be the three disturbers
from this team?

2604
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:10,660
- All right.
- Three men should go.

2605
01:23:10,850 --> 01:23:11,920
- All right.
- Okay.

2606
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,490
- Okay.
- Haha too?

2607
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:15,550
Three men? Isn't that too cowardly?

2608
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:16,760
That's too cowardly.

2609
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:17,800
Not at all.

2610
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:18,920
The camera will move now.

2611
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:22,800
- Not yet.
- Form a scrum.

2612
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:24,040
Form a scrum.

2613
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:26,740
Form a scrum.

2614
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,380
(Each member gets taken out.)

2615
01:23:31,550 --> 01:23:33,410
What's this?

2616
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:35,420
Let me go in front of the camera.

2617
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:37,420
- One,
- What is this?

2618
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:38,420
(The cheerleaders steal the shot.)

2619
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:39,640
two...

2620
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,810
(Even the cameramen watch.)

2621
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,680
(They are held tight.)

2622
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:47,220
Let me go in front of the camera.

2623
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:48,350
Three.

2624
01:23:48,350 --> 01:23:49,590
What are you doing?

2625
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:51,130
Let me go in front of the camera.

2626
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:52,260
Three.

2627
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,590
(He gets pushed out the door.)

2628
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:55,800
Three.

2629
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,170
What are you doing?

2630
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:59,040
(They couldn't even go
near the camera.)

2631
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:00,540
The end.

2632
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:02,240
- You got zero points.
- Nice.

2633
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,470
We did it.

2634
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,550
- We did it.
- Okay.

2635
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:07,100
- Okay.
- It's over.

2636
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:09,120
- He went out?
- The three in the front...

2637
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,250
What was that?

2638
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,490
- He went out.
- My gosh.

2639
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:14,590
You can't push me out like that.

2640
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,350
- What?
- He pressed...

2641
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:18,220
- my temple like this.
- Are we allowed to do this?

2642
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:20,290
- What did I press?
- Where did you go during the shoot?

2643
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:22,850
Someone... My goodness.

2644
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:24,550
- You went out.
- What's wrong with you?

2645
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:25,720
This is too harsh.

2646
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,130
- My gosh.
- How many people?

2647
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:28,130
It was zero.

2648
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,130
It's done.

2649
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,130
The three of you
should go to a deserted island now.

2650
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:33,130
Go to a deserted island.

2651
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:34,260
The three of you
to a deserted island.

2652
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:35,410
My goodness.

2653
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:38,450
So each of you got your points.

2654
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:39,710
- Okay.
- I didn't earn many points.

2655
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:42,810
I will announce your points
when you get to New York.

2656
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:44,270
- Okay.
- Let's go to New York.

2657
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:45,920
I'll see you in New York.

2658
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,920
- Let's go to New York!
- New York

2659
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:51,120
(They get on the flight
to New York like that.)

2660
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,290
(And they arrive at New York.)

2661
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:57,220
(The financial center
of the world, New York)

2662
01:24:57,220 --> 01:25:00,090
(And the most fierce place of all)

2663
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:03,840
(Wall Street in New York)

2664
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,910
(A large sum of money is
going around in a second.)

2665
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:10,710
(And there's a stock trading firm
for Koreans on the outskirts.)

2666
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:12,970
(Running Stock
Investment Club is here.)

2667
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:14,010
Let's go.

2668
01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:17,170
- This is nice.
- It's a perfect day to invest.

2669
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:19,010
- My gosh.
- My goodness.

2670
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:20,920
- Hey, Michael.
- Gosh.

2671
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,010
(Are there Americans?)

2672
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:25,760
- Hi.
- Michael, long time no see.

2673
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,760
(This place looks
like a global financial center.)

2674
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,460
(Welcome to RM
Investment and Securities)

2675
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:30,630
- The company.
- Thank you for the chart.

2676
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:32,520
(The traders seem familiar
as if we saw them on "Surprise.")

2677
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:35,000
- But it's 136.
- No.

2678
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,130
- Sell all.
- All right.

2679
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:39,040
(RM Investment and Securities
only deals with petty stocks.)

2680
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,630
(But things are fierce
just like Wall Street.)

2681
01:25:41,630 --> 01:25:44,100
I'm sure it will soar next month.

2682
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:47,410
(Welcome to Wall Street.)

2683
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,880
(And RM Investment
and Securities is here.)

2684
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,490
(Long time no see.)

2685
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:54,450
- Do you even know who he is?
- Are you from Hong Kong?

2686
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:55,620
- Yes.
- Hong Kong.

2687
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:57,920
- Hi.
- It's been a while, Michael.

2688
01:25:58,090 --> 01:25:59,420
What is going on?

2689
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:01,630
- Hey, James.
- Hi.

2690
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:03,520
(Chris, Sam)

2691
01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:05,390
- This is so...
- Long time no see.

2692
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:06,630
- What am I supposed to do?
- Hey.

2693
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:07,720
Hi.

2694
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:09,000
My name is Sae Ho.

2695
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,560
(Laughing)

2696
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,010
Are you up for the challenge?

2697
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:13,240
John?

2698
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,970
- Are you up for the challenge?
- Yes.

2699
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,100
- Yes.
- Yes? Okay.

2700
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:17,510
- Good.
- All right.

2701
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:18,550
(He's fluent in English.)

2702
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:20,170
My name is Young Ji.

2703
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:22,250
- Young Ji? I see.
- Young Ji. Yes.

2704
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,170
- I don't like you.
- All right. Investors.

2705
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:25,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

2706
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:27,420
Has it begun?

2707
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:29,490
- What do we do?
- Now you will start...

2708
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:32,260
investment with 500 dollars.

2709
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:33,920
- We get 500 dollars?
- Okay. It's finally beginning.

2710
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,300
You will trade in dollars.

2711
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,090
- Okay.
- It sounds great.

2712
01:26:37,090 --> 01:26:38,890
- This is...
- My heart is beating high.

2713
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,390
(The US...)

2714
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:41,560
(stock market...)

2715
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:43,040
(is opening!)

2716
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,410
(One said...)

2717
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:50,740
(that investment resembles life.)

2718
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:52,640
What is a foreigner doing here?

2719
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,970
(English is the one
that catches up with them.)

2720
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:57,510
(If you're prepared
for the US stock market,)

2721
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:59,010
(make good use of the information.)

2722
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:01,010
- Enemy.
- Enamel?

2723
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:04,210
(If you don't have information,)

2724
01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:06,660
(follow your guts.)

2725
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:10,130
(Money goes its way
by fair means or foul.)

2726
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:12,220
(And time never stops.)

2727
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:15,240
(If there's a record low,)

2728
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:17,500
(there must be a record high.)

2729
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:19,600
(Once the bell rings,)

2730
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,010
(the rise and fall
of your life change.)

2731
01:27:22,010 --> 01:27:24,740
(Who will be the one
who laughs in the last?)

2732
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,270
(The year 2022.)

2733
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:27,710
(The stock prices of this year.)

2734
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:28,710
(Please open it.)

2735
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:30,420
