1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,370
(The center of the global economy,
Wall Street)

2
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,600
(On the outskirts of Wall Street,)

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,370
(there's RM Investment
and Securities for Koreans.)

4
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,750
(Running Stock
Investment Club is here.)

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,970
Okay.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:21,970
Let's go.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,450
- This is nice.
- It's a perfect day to invest.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,790
- My gosh.
- My goodness.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,180
- Hey, Michael.
- Hi.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,560
- Michael.
- Long time no see.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,080
- Hi.
- Do you even know who he is?

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,260
- Are you from Hong Kong?
- Yes.

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,290
- Hi.
- It's been a while, Michael.

14
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,030
(Welcome to RM
Investment and Securities)

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,830
(This place is...)

16
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,760
- You said it would go up.
- You were sure of it.

17
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,660
You told me it would go up.

18
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,260
(Great sums of money change
hands in the blink of an eye.)

19
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,010
(Watch the global economy closely
with your every nerve bristled up.)

20
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,330
Use your phone.
This is why we have a phone.

21
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,710
Hello?

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,250
I'm sorry, sir.

23
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,540
Yes.

24
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,150
I'm sure it will soar next month.

25
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,750
Okay. Bye.

26
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,650
- Hi.
- Hi.

27
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,760
- Hi.
- Long time no see.

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,080
- Hi.
- Hi.

29
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,080
It's been so long.
I haven't seen him for a while.

30
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,460
Hey, James.

31
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,550
Hi.

32
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,490
(Chris and Sam, not James)

33
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,990
- This is like Wall Street.
- Long time no see.

34
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,490
- Long time no see.
- Hey.

35
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,270
- Hi.
- You working out?

36
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,910
- Yes.
- Good.

37
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,770
Hey, this is John.

38
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,300
I know him. Nice to meet you.

39
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,410
- They're all very annoying.
- Nice to meet you.

40
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,050
My name is So Min.

41
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,380
- Sorry?
- So Min.

42
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,440
Alex.

43
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,270
- Alex?
- My name is Young Ji.

44
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,790
- Young Ji?
- Yes, Young Ji.

45
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,740
- I see.
- All right. Investors.

46
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

47
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,490
Has it begun?

48
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,760
We're finally here.

49
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,460
We're here. It was a long flight.

50
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,630
After a long flight,
you finally arrived.

51
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,720
Flying in economy was darn hard.

52
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,160
- Finally, we are...
- It was darn hard.

53
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,630
Come on. Speak more elegantly.

54
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,190
- It was darn hard.
- Just say you're very tired.

55
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,570
Now that
all the global losers are here...

56
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,910
(The global small investors arrived
safely.)

57
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,970
Are you a cowboy?

58
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,130
- You punk.
- No.

59
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,770
- He's dressed as Tae Jin Ah.
- No.

60
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,600
He rode all the way here on a horse.

61
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,010
He was very fast.

62
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,350
I'm an investor from Texas.

63
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,710
- He's like a tourist in Disneyland.
- From Texas.

64
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,650
- You know him, right?
- I'm sorry, but...

65
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,050
He's a stock market tycoon.

66
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,320
Mr. Lim Ha Ryong is here.

67
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,690
(Mr. Ji Ha Ryong)

68
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,790
- No, you're wrong.
- Come on, Mr. Tae Jin Ah.

69
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,030
- He's Waiter Song Ji Hyo.
- You look different in that hat.

70
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,630
- Gosh. What's this?
- Waiter Song Ji Hyo?

71
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,920
- He's Waiter Song Ji Hyo.
- Waiter Song!

72
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,420
- Don't be ridiculous.
- He has a name tag.

73
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,320
- Why am I a waiter?
- You're Waiter Song Ji Hyo.

74
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,100
- This is New York fashion style.
- Hey, I'd like to pick up my purse.

75
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,440
I'm going home now.
Where's my purse?

76
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,370
- Can I get a beer, please?
- Excuse me.

77
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,810
Are you
from a funeral service company?

78
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,100
- I'm Sandra.
- Okay. Sandra?

79
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,540
- Yes. I'm Sandra.
- Sandra?

80
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,510
You see, whenever we have
an episode related to economics,

81
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,540
you guys wear glasses.
And I don't like it.

82
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,480
- It makes me look intelligent.
- I understand that, but...

83
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,450
You guys wear glasses whenever it's
about studying or economics.

84
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,690
- How about this?
- It makes us look smart.

85
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,090
What do think about having a pen
in the chest pocket?

86
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,950
Isn't this the worst?

87
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,290
He's right.
All of you are wearing glasses.

88
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,890
Do you just dress like a thug...

89
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,100
regardless of the theme
of an episode?

90
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,230
- Exactly. He's dressed like a thug.
- How dare you call me a thug?

91
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,440
I'm not dressed like a thug.

92
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,870
- Sae Ho looks nice.
- Indeed.

93
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,970
- Is he on "You Quiz on the Block?"
- "You quiz?"

94
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,440
- You quiz?
- Step by step

95
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,600
"You quiz?"

96
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,100
- My fashion style? You quiz?
- Are you a used car dealer?

97
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,250
- I do everything that's productive.
- I see.

98
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,380
- Yes, ask me anything.
- Do you sell used cars too?

99
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,320
- I know someone in that field.
- He looks like a used car dealer.

100
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,440
- He's hilarious.
- You will start investing now...

101
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,010
- with seed money of 500 dollars.
- We'll get 500 dollars?

102
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,160
- Good, 500,000 dollars?
- Let's get this started.

103
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,420
We'll use Korean won.

104
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,130
- We have 500,000 dollars.
- It's worth 500 dollars.

105
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,450
I'll just think
that I have 500,000 dollars.

106
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,160
Invest the given money in stocks
for nine years...

107
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,130
from 2014 to 2022
to grow your assets.

108
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,340
Those are perfect years.

109
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,130
- Do you know much about stocks?
- Of course, I do.

110
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,380
We'll reveal the stock prices
of ten American companies.

111
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,700
Just as we did last time,
these are real companies,

112
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,040
and the stock prices are
based on real records.

113
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,880
- Okay.
- This is...

114
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,440
- You see...
- My heart is pounding already.

115
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,980
The only company I know is Tesla.

116
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,790
Also, although we won't tell you
the names of the ten companies.

117
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,920
But you all know
at least eight of them.

118
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,560
- Really?
- Are they that famous?

119
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,530
- They must be famous companies.
- They're good at this.

120
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,890
You have to predict the prices...

121
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,390
based on the social
and cultural issues in the year.

122
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,500
That's the key point.

123
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,600
Twenty minutes in the real world
equals one year in the simulation.

124
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,130
- Got it.
- You have to buy information...

125
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,730
and make investments
within 20 minutes.

126
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,510
When the bell rings,
we'll reveal the prices.

127
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,040
- Right. I remember that.
- Got it.

128
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,940
- It was thrilling.
- Yes.

129
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,380
Also, we'll give you the points...

130
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,190
- you earned last week.
- Okay.

131
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,710
Last time, we had a mission
once every three years, right?

132
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,120
- Yes. That's good.
- This time, there'll be no mission.

133
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,930
So you need to use
your points wisely.

134
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,280
- That's simple.
- You'll use it for ten years.

135
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,690
- That's right.
- I like that.

136
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,260
- I'll announce your points.
- Okay.

137
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,730
Jong Kook placed first...

138
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,320
- with 24 points.
- Really?

139
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,740
So Min and Jae Suk were tied
for second place.

140
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,030
- Okay.
- No way.

141
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,630
And Se Chan placed last
with eight points.

142
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,070
- How many points do I have?
- Eight points.

143
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,530
- What?
- I feel bad for Se Chan.

144
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,810
There are
three information exchange offices...

145
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,980
in the hallway over there.

146
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,210
You can visit any of them
to get information.

147
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,250
- I see.
- Good.

148
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,320
You can get level 1 information
with 1 point,

149
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,990
level 2 information with 3 points,

150
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,580
and level 3 information
with 7 points.

151
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,580
- Level three information?
- Seven points?

152
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,730
The level one information
provides...

153
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,190
(The content
of the level one information is...)

154
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,360
a piece of information
from that year written in English.

155
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,630
(Information from the year
written in English)

156
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,030
- Written in English?
- How are we...

157
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,390
- One-point information has...
- In English?

158
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,200
a news headline about the company
written in English.

159
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,440
- It sounds like a good deal.
- That's right.

160
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,380
Although it doesn't tell you
whether it will go up or down,

161
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,110
- it gives you a hint.
- A news headline?

162
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,380
Next, three-point information has...

163
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,210
the same news headline
written in Korean.

164
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,550
- Oh, three-point information?
- Yes.

165
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,640
And seven-point information has...

166
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,010
the same information
written in Korean, and tells you...

167
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,120
Information on the price?

168
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,630
- if the price will go up or down.
- Really?

169
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,450
- Okay.
- That's the best one, obviously.

170
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,950
- I'll buy it and invest all I have.
- But...

171
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,060
it doesn't tell you how much
the price will go up or down.

172
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,590
- I understand.
- It only tells us if it'll go up.

173
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,730
Whether the price will
go up or down.

174
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,170
As soon as we reveal
the stock prices of 2014...

175
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,940
and the time in the calendar starts
to pass, you may begin.

176
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,030
- Okay.
- Got it.

177
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,610
Kim Yoona from South Korea won
a silver medal.

178
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,200
- And shoot!
- Shoot!

179
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,070
Goal!

180
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,210
Pope Francis's visit to Korea...

181
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,140
The fear of Ebola, the fatal virus,
has spread across the world...

182
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,080
For the fourth time, ISIS...

183
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,640
The protests in Hong Kong...

184
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,060
- are heating up every day.
- They're continuing the protest,

185
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,450
occupying the central area.

186
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,920
We'll announce the stock prices now.

187
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,070
Reveal the companies
and the stock prices.

188
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,030
(Stock Market of 2014,
A IT: 28 dollars, B IT 33 dollars,)

189
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,070
(C Automobiles: 11 dollars,
D Automobiles: 50 dollars,)

190
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,100
(E Biotechnology: 15 dollars,
F Biotechnology: 82.5 dollars,)

191
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,100
(G Fashion: 33 dollars,
H Sports: 33 dollars,)

192
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,340
(I Media: 49.5 dollars,
J Airlines: 28 dollars)

193
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,780
(Stock Market of 2014)

194
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,100
I think I know all these companies.

195
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,820
- The IT companies...
- Are the prices...

196
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,110
- converted to Korean won?
- Yes.

197
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,890
- I don't know any of them.
- I'll just have to follow my guts.

198
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,020
- I have no idea.
- You know all of these companies.

199
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,460
- That's the whole point.
- But I have no idea.

200
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,820
- If you know...
- The IT companies...

201
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,050
- We hid the names intentionally.
- Of course.

202
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,960
You can guess the companies
easily with the information on them.

203
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,290
- Those are the actual prices.
- Yes.

204
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,290
- Do you remember the prices?
- Yes, of course.

205
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,140
Is F Biotechnology Ferrari?

206
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,140
No, that letter has nothing to do
with the company name.

207
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,710
It's not the initial
of the company name.

208
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,740
- J Airlines must be Boeing.
- Is Tesla on the list?

209
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,840
Tesla is the only company I know.

210
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,580
Tesla is on the list.

211
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,880
- Is it?
- Really?

212
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,040
- I think it is.
- I Media.

213
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,780
- Tesla shares weren't expensive.
- Was it worth nine dollars...

214
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,190
- It wasn't so expensive, right?
- No, it wasn't.

215
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,420
I'll invest in the company in 2017.

216
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,630
- I'll invest everything I have.
- Really?

217
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,290
- In 2017,
- You'll invest everything?

218
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,530
I'll invest in C Automobiles
or D Automobiles.

219
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,490
- You mean, Tesla?
- Yes, Tesla. Back then...

220
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,330
Which one is Tesla? C or D?

221
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,360
I think it's C.
It must be C. It almost failed once.

222
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,570
- It could be C.
- For example...

223
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,340
(They will start making investments
for a year.)

224
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,400
Let's go.

225
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,210
Hold on. I think
I should get some information first.

226
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,900
We can go to get information now,
right?

227
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,540
- Do we have 20 minutes?
- Can we go to get information now?

228
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,110
You have 20 minutes.
Time is passing.

229
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,910
- I'll go and get some information.
- You should spend it wisely.

230
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,280
- Everyone is getting busy.
- I'll be right back.

231
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,090
So Min, stop walking like a model
because you're dressed like that.

232
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,420
Come on. It's strange.

233
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,400
(She walks around the office,
immersed in her character.)

234
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,420
What did you say?

235
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,860
- Okay. Let's go.
- She's walking arrogantly.

236
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,230
(The small investors are going to
the information exchange offices.)

237
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,510
- Which office gives which level?
- We're here.

238
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,840
I can decide in there? I see. Okay.
I'm going in now.

239
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,320
(Surprised)

240
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,910
- They're foreigners.
- Foreigners?

241
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,980
What is this?
Why are they foreigners?

242
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,150
Se Chan.

243
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,890
Hi.

244
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,090
- What's going on?
- I was surprised too.

245
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,130
This is not right.

246
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,850
Why are they all foreigners?

247
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,630
- Are they all foreigners?
- Sorry. See you.

248
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,830
(The arrogant investor said goodbye
hastily as well.)

249
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,960
- This is bad.
- Did you get information, So Min?

250
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,200
No, they're all foreigners.

251
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,070
- Why are they all foreigners?
- They're all foreigners.

252
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,140
Where is Information Exchange?

253
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,440
Why are they foreigners?

254
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,440
I don't speak English.
Why did they bring foreigners?

255
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,170
- Do we have to speak English?
- Yes.

256
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,010
(Haha took up his courage to enter.)

257
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,740
- Hi.
- Hello. Welcome.

258
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,840
- Have a seat.
- Yes. Long time, no see.

259
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,280
- Long time, no see.
- Yes.

260
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,410
Tom?

261
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,640
- Alex.
- Alex? Yes.

262
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,820
Just kidding.

263
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,820
- How have you been?
- What?

264
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,350
- How have you been?
- Well... Just...

265
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,880
Well... All... The same day...

266
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,660
- Investments doing good?
- Sorry?

267
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,850
Investments doing okay?

268
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,720
- Yes, I'm okay.
- Okay.

269
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,940
(The Wall Street trader tries to
figure out what he means.)

270
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,730
How can I help you?

271
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,810
(Level 1 and 2: Simple information,
Level 3: Specific information)

272
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,270
C...

273
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,640
C Car.

274
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,450
It's 1 point
for the level 1 information, right?

275
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,580
I'll use one point.

276
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,240
Do you want level one?

277
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,450
Yes, C Automobiles.

278
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,610
(An article about the company
in English will be revealed.)

279
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,640
Your first hint.

280
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:23,250
"C Automobiles manufacturer
announced that it would recall..."

281
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,090
"their vehicles having been..."

282
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,620
"complained for
faulty-devices issue."

283
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,830
- "Issue?" I see.
- Yes, a problem.

284
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,040
(C Automobiles announced a recall
due to a faulty-devices issue.)

285
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,840
- "Recall?"
- "Recall."

286
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,130
Call again.

287
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,100
Yes, that's right.
Isn't it a good thing?

288
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,240
Very good?

289
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,340
I don't know.

290
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,640
(You have to interpret the hint
on your own.)

291
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,880
"Having been complained..."
Right. "Complained."

292
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,460
(He found a familiar word.)

293
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,610
Too much complaining.

294
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,460
Oh, I see. Okay.

295
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,250
The people in high positions
decided to recall the product.

296
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,350
And people made complaints.

297
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,720
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

298
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,470
- Good luck. All right.
- Thanks for the good hint.

299
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,070
Thank you. See you.

300
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,070
- Hi.
- Yes, please do.

301
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,340
This is my office.

302
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,870
My name is Sandra Jeon.

303
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,870
- Sandra Jeon?
- Yes.

304
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,310
That's funny. My name is John.

305
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,840
- John?
- Yes.

306
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,920
- We have the same name?
- John and Jeon.

307
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,550
- John and Jeon.
- Yes.

308
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,790
- Yes.
- Yes.

309
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,920
(It's good to see you, my friend.)

310
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,820
I'd like to get the level three
information on C Automobiles.

311
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,690
- Seven points, right?
- Seven points will be deducted.

312
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,350
- Yes.
- This will be a tough one, right?

313
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,750
So you're...
Oh, this is a Korean one.

314
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,350
Can you read it?

315
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,460
No, I can't speak Korean.

316
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,930
- "Jadongcha."
- "Jadongcha."

317
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,040
- "C Automobiles..."
- "C Automobiles..."

318
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,340
"announced that it would recall..."

319
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,910
Oh, okay. I don't know.

320
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,470
- It's too fast.
- Difficult?

321
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,500
"Jangchi."

322
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,540
But this question is for you.
It's not for me.

323
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,580
Oh, sorry.

324
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,550
He's speaking too fast.

325
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,840
"Vehicles having been complained
for faulty-devices issue."

326
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,610
"Thanks to C Automobiles' proactive
approach, the stock price rises."

327
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,060
(Level three information
on C Automobiles)

328
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,250
(The stock price
of C Automobiles goes up?)

329
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,800
So the price goes up.

330
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,350
Due to a flaw in the mechanism?

331
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,120
"Having been complained..."
Right. "Complained."

332
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,540
They recalled their vehicles,
and there were complaints.

333
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,810
(Level three information
on C Automobiles)

334
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,910
(The stock price
of C Automobiles goes up!)

335
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,270
- You are handsome.
- Thank you. You are very pretty.

336
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,410
- Thank you so much.
- Yes.

337
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,970
Passing compliments.

338
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,920
- I want to check it.
- You punk.

339
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,610
- You're disappointing me.
- I'm serious.

340
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,610
(She walks back full of confidence.)

341
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,460
Just tell me the item.

342
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,480
- C Automobiles.
- Tell me what you saw.

343
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,850
(Jeon So Min's account balance)

344
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,990
I'll spend 500 dollars
on C Automobiles.

345
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,670
(She puts all her money on
C Automobiles with the information.)

346
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,990
- Hello.
- What?

347
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,070
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

348
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,730
- Hi.
- Hi. What is your name?

349
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,810
What's your name?

350
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,440
- David.
- David?

351
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,310
- Yes, David.
- Suddenly, David?

352
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,710
- Yes, David.
- Oh, I see.

353
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,340
My name is Robin.

354
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,740
Robin Williams?

355
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,220
- Yes. Of course.
- Robin Williams?

356
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,970
- Yes. Same.
- Yes.

357
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,190
- Nice to meet you.
- Good. He's dead.

358
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,510
Oh, I didn't know.

359
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,930
- Are you sure?
- I'm a fan of his.

360
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,690
- Are you a fan? Me too.
- Yes. I'm sad.

361
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,220
Me too. He was amazing.

362
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,060
- An amazing comedian.
- Amazing.

363
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,470
Are you amazing too?

364
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,670
Maybe...
In the stock market? Amazing.

365
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,470
- Really? Me too.
- Yes.

366
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,540
- You too?
- Yes.

367
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,940
- Are you an expert?
- Yes. I'm professional.

368
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,310
Really.

369
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,000
- Why are you laughing?
- He speaks Korean.

370
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,910
Why are you laughing?

371
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,310
(Flustered)

372
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,870
I want E Biotechnology.

373
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,550
E Biotechnology. Level One.

374
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,820
- I'll have Level One Information.
- Okay.

375
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,610
- "E Biotechnology..."
- Yes.

376
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,250
"published its Earning Surprise."

377
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,620
(E Biotechnology
published its Earning Surprise.)

378
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,220
Earning Surprise?

379
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,330
- Please... One more.
- Thank you.

380
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,220
Here you go. "E Biotechnology
published its Earning Surprise."

381
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,670
"Published."

382
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,470
Published? Public?

383
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,940
"Its Earning Surprise."
Earning Surprise is...

384
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,540
bad news, right?

385
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,550
- It could be bad news.
- Bad news. Earning Surprise.

386
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,240
- I feel it. It's like "Wow!."
- It's like "Wow!"

387
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,110
- Yes.
- Earning Surprise.

388
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,640
Yes. So it's good or bad.

389
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,980
Published. What does publish mean?

390
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,160
(Impressed)

391
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,850
Are you making fun of me?

392
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,020
Published.

393
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,990
- Nice to meet you.
- Step into my office.

394
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,020
- Michael?
- Jordan.

395
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,800
- Jordan?
- Michael Jordan. John.

396
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,300
- Jordan? I see.
- Jeon.

397
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,840
- Se Chan.
- Se Chan?

398
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,390
Yes. I'm Yang Se Chan.

399
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,940
- Okay.
- My boyfriend.

400
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,970
She's a friend.

401
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,100
- Yes.
- Okay.

402
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,340
Give me good information.

403
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,680
Okay. I will give you
the best information.

404
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,340
Yes. And...

405
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,820
- IT.
- IT? Which IT?

406
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,960
- A.
- A IT? Can we do that?

407
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,660
Is A IT good?

408
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,660
A IT? They are all good.

409
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,350
- No good?
- They are all good.

410
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,490
The good?

411
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,890
Let me read it out loud for you.

412
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,890
"A IT announced that
they would newly provide..."

413
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,340
"the streaming TV service."

414
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,760
TV service?

415
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,570
- Yes. Would you like to read it?
- Yes.

416
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,730
There you go.

417
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,370
They started a new service?

418
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,500
"This IT company started
a TV service."

419
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,340
Good. Nice information?

420
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,840
Nice information?

421
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,450
Do you like TV services?

422
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,840
TV services? Yes.

423
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,420
Then it's nice to you.

424
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,010
"Nice to you?"

425
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,720
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes. Nice to meet you too.

426
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,960
(Suddenly he's glad to meet him.)

427
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,720
- TV service, man.
- TV service.

428
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,990
- Netflix?
- Maybe. I mean...

429
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,800
- Maybe?
- I just don't know.

430
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,170
Amazon?

431
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,260
(Surprised)

432
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,310
Amazon?

433
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,440
Graph. Hey.

434
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,340
- The graph of A IT...
- Yes?

435
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,080
The graph goes up or down?

436
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,920
Well, I don't have a graph.

437
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,820
So I don't know. If it's up or down.

438
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,010
I can't tell you.

439
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,560
- Hey. Jordan.
- Yes.

440
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,060
Is your condition up or down?

441
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,120
- Me?
- Yes.

442
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,960
I'm all over the place.

443
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,590
I can't decide if I'm up or down.

444
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,120
Gosh, this is so hard. Okay.

445
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,970
Jae Suk, I didn't speak
a word of English.

446
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,760
(Stock Market of 2014)

447
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,230
- I think B IT is...
- This is a fraud.

448
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,630
I bet there will be
a dramatic turnaround.

449
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,000
I should get the information
about B IT.

450
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,180
Secret information.

451
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,680
Oh, my goodness.

452
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,380
"Oh, my goodness?"

453
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,290
- What was that?
- Get out.

454
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,820
- Get out.
- What? Oh, my goodness?

455
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,060
- What was that?
- Get out.

456
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,750
"Decided to..."
They decided... "To partner."

457
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,930
"With Google, the leading company."
I see. "Leading."

458
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,090
(The hint about B IT has
some words that sound promising.)

459
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,840
- Okay.
- Winning.

460
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,710
- You are handsome and smart.
- No.

461
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,860
(Is this information
a favorable factor?)

462
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,040
And a rich man.

463
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,730
Okay.

464
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,470
(Jae Suk goes into the next room.)

465
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,370
- Hi. Welcome.
- Yes.

466
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,140
What would you like to know?

467
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,610
- What kind of information?
- B IT.

468
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,290
- B IT? Okay.
- Yes.

469
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,820
What level would you like?

470
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,060
Seven.

471
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,480
- Seven coins.
- Seven. Okay.

472
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,430
Yes.

473
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,830
(B IT partnered with G company,
the leading US portal site...)

474
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,230
(for exposure to search engines
and had their stock price increase.)

475
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,760
- Is it good information?
- Good. So...

476
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,310
- Amazing?
- Yes, amazing.

477
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,570
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

478
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,680
- I'm very happy.
- That's good.

479
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay, Robin. See you.

480
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,270
- Nice to meet you.
- All right.

481
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,740
I need to hide this.

482
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,080
(Yoo Jae Suk's account balance)

483
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,840
I'll invest in B IT.

484
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,980
(He invests
half of his money in B IT.)

485
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,690
I should be a man about this.

486
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,560
I'll go all-in on B IT.

487
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,850
- This is nerve-wracking.
- I'll invest all in B IT.

488
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,090
I bet H Sports is Under Armour.

489
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,590
- John, long time no see.
- Hey. Come on in.

490
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,490
- Yes. We're here.
- Yes.

491
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,670
I'm interested in sports.

492
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,860
- Okay.
- H.

493
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,130
Yes, there's a space...

494
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,840
"H Sports to Model Stephen Curry."

495
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,470
I see. Okay.

496
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,680
(It's good news that they signed
a contract with Stephen Curry.)

497
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,550
- So good.
- You know about sports?

498
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,710
It's done.

499
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,870
Curry?

500
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,950
"To Model Stephen Curry."

501
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,640
(Jong Kook gets
the same information.)

502
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,790
My goodness.

503
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,480
(Now they know
what H Sports exactly is.)

504
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,720
(And there's someone eavesdropping.)

505
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,970
(The investor from Texas)

506
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,700
Yes!

507
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,900
Okay.

508
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,200
Okay. Got it.

509
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,560
Okay.

510
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,640
(Yoo Jae Suk's account balance)

511
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,470
I'll put half of my money
into H Sports.

512
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,410
(He invests half of his money
in H Sports.)

513
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,570
Yes. Sell them all.

514
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,380
Half in B IT.

515
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,310
And the other half in H Sports.

516
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,950
(Jong Kook buys the same stocks.)

517
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,720
(And there's someone
who's eavesdropping on him.)

518
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
First, 33 dollars...

519
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,050
B IT...

520
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,430
and the rest on H Sports.

521
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,820
- It's right there.
- I'll go get some information.

522
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,900
- You can't do that.
- Okay.

523
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,960
Hi.

524
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,370
- Hello. Welcome.
- My name is Se Chan.

525
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,900
Se Chan, nice to meet you.

526
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,730
- What's your name?
- My name is Robin.

527
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,870
- Romance?
- Yes.

528
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,870
- Wow, Romance? Sounds good.
- So romantic.

529
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,270
- Good?
- Yes.

530
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,640
Give me information.

531
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,040
What kind of information
would you like?

532
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,350
- J.
- J company?

533
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,420
(J Airlines entered the
registry of S and P 500 Index.)

534
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,980
"Entered the registry
of S and P 500 Index."

535
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,010
Five hundred?

536
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,460
"S and P 500."

537
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,690
(J Airlines entered the
registry of S and P 500 Index.)

538
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,390
- What do you think?
- Index?

539
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,660
Yes. Do you understand?

540
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,320
Index. S and P. Five hundred?
S and P.

541
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,820
- Five hundred.
- Entered.

542
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,370
- Angel?
- Entered.

543
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,440
Enter?

544
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,640
I don't know what it means.

545
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,870
- I don't understand any word.
- Entered.

546
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,730
(The black thing is letters,
and the white thing is paper.)

547
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,410
Index...

548
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,410
Five hundred. Index.

549
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,150
- Jong Kook.
- This isn't good?

550
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,450
Jong Kook, what does index mean?

551
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,420
What is index?

552
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,350
An index is the thing you use
instead of a gas stove.

553
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,480
That's an induction heater.

554
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,780
That's not it.

555
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,430
- Tell me what it is.
- Index?

556
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,480
- That's kitchen furniture.
- What's an index?

557
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,600
- Index is like a gas stove.
- It's kitchen furniture.

558
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,820
You know what it is.

559
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,560
What is an index?

560
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,030
"The registry of S and P 500 Index."

561
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,490
(Investor Ha got the same hint.)

562
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,030
- In 2015.
- What's S and P?

563
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,800
Anyway, is it good news?

564
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,410
Maybe.

565
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,210
I'll buy ten stocks of H Sports.

566
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,540
(He follows his hunch
and invests in H Sports.)

567
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,540
Then I'll invest
the rest in J Airlines.

568
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,620
- Let's go.
- J Airlines.

569
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,650
(Se Chan invests all his money
in J Airlines...)

570
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,720
(with faith in the index.)

571
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,160
It looks really nice.

572
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,930
You're not supposed to see this.

573
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,320
- No?
- You shouldn't look at mine.

574
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,520
- Sae Ho, you can't see this.
- I didn't see it. I'm already done.

575
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,020
- You won't see it, will you?
- I'm finished too.

576
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,630
- Get lost.
- Where did you invest?

577
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,700
- Get lost?
- I... Are you done?

578
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,260
- Yes.
- I invested in three companies.

579
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,640
- Three companies?
- Are you done?

580
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,870
- Can I say it?
- Which information did you get?

581
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,830
- What information did you get?
- Is it okay to tell him?

582
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,110
- Just tell me one thing.
- I can't.

583
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,610
- Only one thing.
- I'm not supposed to say it.

584
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,570
So Min, did you
make your investment?

585
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,650
- So Min is over there.
- So Min is there.

586
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,270
I'm sorry.

587
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,810
I just talked to So Min.

588
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,080
- Gosh, this is hard.
- Are you done?

589
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,810
- It's chilly in here.
- It will be announced now.

590
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,050
Let's do this, Ha Dong Hoon.

591
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,080
Let's go.

592
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,160
Gosh, I'm nervous.

593
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,280
I want to make it big.

594
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,900
We will make it big.

595
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,630
Please.

596
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,760
Gosh, this is really...

597
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,970
This isn't a good time
to invest in automobile companies.

598
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,700
- Automobile companies will be...
- I think...

599
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,060
- in 2017...
- you should get on my good side.

600
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,060
- Why?
- I know exactly...

601
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,070
how the stock prices of Tesla go.

602
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,230
- You do?
- Yes.

603
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,800
Then invest your own money
and be rich.

604
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,910
I'll do that.

605
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,950
Don't ask me for advice.

606
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,010
I won't.

607
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,680
I can't wait to watch
the match between you two.

608
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,080
- He's just...
- He's totally...

609
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,920
Our salaries are totally different
on Wall Street.

610
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,050
Is that so?

611
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,660
- My bonus...
- Do you work on Wall Street?

612
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,520
I do work on Wall Street.

613
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,990
He's just at his in-laws' house.

614
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,470
Don't be ridiculous.

615
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,370
- Last year...
- Honestly, I'm not sure.

616
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,230
- Last year...
- It's the 28th.

617
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,030
(The stock price of 2015
will soon be revealed.)

618
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,760
My heart is thumping.

619
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,640
- Here we go.
- White snow falls

620
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,940
(Which stocks will bring joy
to the investors?)

621
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,740
Make me happy just this once.

622
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,740
(Which stocks will bring joy
to the investors?)

623
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,310
- Here we go.
- Let's go!

624
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,540
- Here we go.
- B IT.

625
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,190
All right.
Gosh, I just got the chills.

626
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,720
I doubt there will be
a big difference.

627
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
(Invested half in H Sports
and half in B IT)

628
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,160
- Guess who it's endorsing.
- Come on.

629
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,690
- Just this once.
- Let's go.

630
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,720
Let me be in the money.

631
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,130
- B IT.
- Come on.

632
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,700
(Haha and Se Chan invested
most of their money in J Airlines.)

633
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,230
Here are the stock prices for 2015!

634
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,530
(The stock prices are revealed.)

635
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,760
Plus 67 percent!

636
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,270
(Stock Market of 2015)

637
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,350
(B IT, H Sports, J Airlines)

638
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,180
(J Airlines: plus 100 percent)

639
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,540
No way!

640
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,450
(J Airlines: plus 100 percent)

641
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,690
I might just die!

642
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,510
Kill me already. This is crazy.

643
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,460
(H Sports, B IT: plus 67 percent)

644
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,930
Plus 67 percent.

645
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,690
- Plus 67 percent!
- Nice.

646
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,900
(H Sports, B IT: plus 67 percent)

647
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,720
Sae Ho, bring it in.

648
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,100
- No way.
- I might just die!

649
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,260
- Plus 67 percent.
- Kill me already. This is crazy.

650
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,830
What's with J Airlines?

651
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,830
(Haha and Se Chan
won big with J Airlines.)

652
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,440
- J Airlines
- No way.

653
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,970
- Gosh.
- I can't believe it.

654
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,540
Plus 100 percent.

655
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,850
Hey, excuse me.

656
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,070
- S and P.
- Okay.

657
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,450
Five hundred Index.

658
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,240
I love you, Robin!

659
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,240
Yes, come on.

660
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,810
Robin, I love you!

661
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,120
(Robin, make some noise!)

662
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,780
- S and P 500.
- You made my day.

663
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,460
- Very good.
- Yes.

664
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,250
Good. Yaman.

665
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,720
Boombastic!

666
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,560
Mine is only at a plus 20 percent.

667
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,830
(The others are bitter
even though they saw profit.)

668
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,910
I didn't earn a lot.
Only a 20 percent profit.

669
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,970
Darn it.

670
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,640
(Hur Young Ji's account balance:
685 dollars)

671
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,210
- H Sports is at plus 67 percent.
- Right.

672
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,300
- Is that all you bought?
- That and B IT.

673
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,350
- Good.
- This is all in?

674
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,620
Yes, I invested everything in them.

675
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,190
Jae Suk and I made
the same investment.

676
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,740
- Everything in B IT?
- Yes.

677
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,850
We made the exact same investment.

678
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,280
- What about you?
- But...

679
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,750
(Yoo Jae Suk's account balance:
830 dollars)

680
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,520
It sure is a joy.
How much do I currently have?

681
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,690
You're at plus 67 percent.

682
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,460
Plus 67 percent must put me...

683
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,720
near a million dollars.

684
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,900
Did you say 50? I meant 70.

685
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,940
- Amateurs!
- It is now...

686
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,990
- the year 2015.
- Guys, move over.

687
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,910
Let's do this.

688
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,440
What are your predictions
for H Sports this year?

689
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
- Let me see.
- You see...

690
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,070
Has a new year begun?

691
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,720
- Yes, just now.
- Already?

692
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,850
I didn't expect the IT company
to see that big of a dip.

693
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,350
- How much are you at?
- Hi.

694
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,480
- Hi.
- Is that iced Americano?

695
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,190
Yes, it is. If you want some coffee,
there is coffee over there.

696
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,720
Is there a coffee station?

697
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,820
- Yes.
- Thank you.

698
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,020
Help yourself.

699
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,660
Stop striking up conversations
with those passing by.

700
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,720
You can't even probably end one.

701
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,490
How much is the coffee?

702
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,790
This one?

703
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,470
- If you want...
- Coffee price is going up.

704
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,470
Is it free?

705
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,070
Do you want to invest in coffee?

706
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,140
Free? The best coffee?

707
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,270
Thank you.

708
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,910
(Giggling)

709
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,950
Don't strike up conversations
if you can't end them properly.

710
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,070
Thank you.

711
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,080
(There's a newfound confidence
in Se Chan's English.)

712
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
Thank you.

713
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,360
Hello and welcome back.

714
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,360
Well, my friend...

715
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,860
- Is he good?
- Yes.

716
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,550
Your information made me a rich guy.

717
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,600
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, thank you.

718
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,320
- My information is so good.
- Thank you.

719
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,430
A IT, please.

720
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,100
- A IT?
- Yes.

721
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,900
Thank you. "A IT..."

722
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,410
"announced the releasement
of wireless earphones."

723
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,650
Earphones?

724
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,420
What is "release?"

725
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,740
(No way!)

726
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,450
What is "release?"

727
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,810
(I know which company this is!)

728
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,360
Thank you.

729
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,360
Earphones. Gosh, A IT.

730
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,080
- Earphones.
- Do you love me?

731
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,100
Yes. How about a kiss?

732
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,100
- No? Okay.
- Dangerous.

733
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,820
Thank you. A IT.

734
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,700
A IT must be Apple.

735
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,760
Okay, thank you.

736
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,910
Earphones will be released.
Wireless earphones.

737
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,030
I will invest everything in A IT.

738
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,950
(He sold his J Airlines' stocks
to buy A IT's stocks.)

739
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,620
The bean sprouts. The phones.

740
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,850
A IT is Apple.

741
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,740
Please make sure
my investments are kept hidden.

742
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,690
I'm selling information!

743
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,430
- Here.
- The bottom three went up.

744
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,050
H, I, and J.

745
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,360
I learned new information,
so if you share what you know...

746
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,720
- Sure.
- It'll be perfect for us.

747
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,520
In 2017... It was in English,

748
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,640
but this single word
is a game changer.

749
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,900
- Here.
- But...

750
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,910
Haha, I'll make you rich.

751
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,370
- Suk Jin, you don't want in?
- No.

752
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,410
- Okay.
- What is it?

753
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,730
- What should I buy?
- Buy B IT's stocks.

754
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,380
- What?
- B IT.

755
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,110
- B IT.
- Are you sure?

756
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,770
B IT is Apple.

757
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,850
How do you know that B IT is Apple?

758
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,810
What listening device
did they release?

759
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,080
Wireless earphones?

760
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,190
Is that A IT or B IT?

761
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,280
B IT.

762
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,280
- B IT?
- Yes.

763
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,020
Wait. When did he pass away?

764
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,360
- Who?
- Its founder.

765
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,050
- That isn't important.
- Steve Jobs.

766
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,260
Just invest in it. Whatever.

767
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,490
- Young Ji.
- Did you go all-in?

768
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,530
Yes.

769
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,370
A diversified portfolio
is what we should build,

770
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,000
but we all have
a long way to go today.

771
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,440
We need to take risks,
fatten our wallets,

772
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,470
and then build
a diversified portfolio.

773
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,650
I would've believed you
had you not been talkative.

774
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,770
You talk too much.
That's why I don't believe you.

775
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,310
Darn it. Should I trust him?

776
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,010
B IT...

777
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,460
Hey, for the price of two points,

778
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,290
I'll share the information I have.

779
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,820
What do you mean?
I need these for myself.

780
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,520
How about one point?

781
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,440
This time around...

782
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,940
You can trust me.

783
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,410
So Min, for the price of one point,
I'll share my information.

784
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,800
Okay, thank you.
So Min, come this way.

785
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,350
Se Chan, me too.

786
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,740
- I want in.
- Okay.

787
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,120
Here you go. C Automobiles is Tesla.

788
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,080
Since that's the case,
you should go all-in.

789
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,190
- Isn't it too early?
- No, in 2015...

790
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,620
- Trust me.
- From what I know...

791
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:36,160
- I heard about C Automobiles and...
- You heard it too, right?

792
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,790
- It was parting ways with England.
- Right.

793
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,700
(So Min received information
on C Automobiles.)

794
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,640
(Level one information
on C Automobiles)

795
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,940
(What's this?)

796
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,730
(Young Ji received
the same information.)

797
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,440
Is Brexit a place?

798
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,270
(At the time, they didn't know
what Brexit was.)

799
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,010
- It was parting ways with England.
- Right.

800
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,650
- Brexit...
- You heard it in English.

801
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,720
- No, wait.
- You heard wrong.

802
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,510
It means that
they signed a contract.

803
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,740
- No, wait.
- You heard wrong.

804
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,550
(It's favorable news.)

805
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,930
- It was bad for the company.
- No, it was good.

806
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,430
The States and England
parting ways...

807
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,460
No, it's favorable news.
They now own an exclusive contract.

808
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,670
Trust me!

809
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,790
- It's good news.
- I heard it in English,

810
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,370
(Favorable news?)

811
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,900
I'll invest everything
in C Automobiles.

812
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,140
(So Min ends up
falling for Se Chan's lies.)

813
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,210
Se Chan, did you go all-in?

814
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,570
Yes. It's good news.

815
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,570
Really?

816
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,000
It saw a dip in stock price, right?

817
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,950
It'll need time to recover from it.

818
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,450
No way!

819
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,080
The fact that it was
published in the news says it all.

820
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,250
You'll see a result
the very next day.

821
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,630
This is driving me crazy.

822
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,190
(Se Chan manages to fool
So Min and now Young Ji.)

823
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,720
I'll invest everything I have
in C Automobiles.

824
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:52,470
(And just like that,
Se Chan fools three people.)

825
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,730
(I Media: plus 44 percent)

826
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,440
I Media saw a sizable rise as well.

827
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,770
- Level 1 information on I Media.
- Level 1.

828
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:02,950
"Rumor has it that Disney,"

829
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,810
"a major media
entertainment company,"

830
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,350
"is taking over I Media."

831
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,810
(Level 1 information on I Media)

832
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,740
- This is I Media, right?
- Yes.

833
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,720
Gosh. "Rumor has it that..."

834
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,220
- "Rumor has it that..."
- My gosh.

835
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,460
(Level one information on I Media)

836
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,320
My gosh.

837
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,630
What does that mean?

838
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,860
My gosh.

839
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,520
My gosh.

840
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,830
(He responds like an Angeleno.)

841
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,640
There you go. Good.

842
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,030
Yes, M and A.

843
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,330
- M and A?
- Disney!

844
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,910
"A major media
entertainment company..."

845
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,000
"is taking over I Media."

846
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,070
- An M and A.
- That's right.

847
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,680
So Disney took over this company.

848
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,280
Yes! Okay, thank you.

849
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,310
(He also thinks
that it's good news.)

850
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,930
- Very good.
- Goodness.

851
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,050
(They both received information
on I Media.)

852
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,460
I can guess which companies
are which now.

853
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,720
I've been on a roll up until now.

854
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,370
Is it time to go big?

855
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,140
(Kim Jong Kook's account balance)

856
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,560
I'll invest everything I have
in I Media.

857
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,060
- I Media?
- Yes, I'm going all-in.

858
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:08,710
The winner is the one
who laughs at the very end.

859
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,540
I'll invest everything I have
in I Media.

860
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,010
- I Media?
- Yes.

861
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,740
It's December, so please hurry.

862
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,920
Let's go!

863
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,850
I just hope
I got it right once again.

864
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,550
Just so you know,
what I heard was huge.

865
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,630
What is it?

866
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,550
- Did you go for I Media?
- Yes.

867
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,320
- I Media?
- Yes, I Media.

868
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,720
- I went all-in.
- I Media?

869
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,930
- I Media.
- Really?

870
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:28,990
Just so you know,

871
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,530
(There's good news for I Media?)

872
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,830
- I Media.
- Yes?

873
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,060
I'm going all-in.

874
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,170
- Will you sell what you have?
- Yes, everything.

875
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,530
- That's right.
- What is Suk Jin up to?

876
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,040
You can't make an investment
after hearing that.

877
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
That's not fair.

878
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,010
- Once you make a purchase...
- This shouldn't be allowed.

879
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,450
What is he up to?

880
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,720
He made a purchase
after hearing us talk.

881
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,080
We shouldn't have said anything.

882
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,540
How is this allowed?

883
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,250
You only have yourselves to blame.

884
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,310
- I never coerced you to speak.
- But...

885
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,550
Should I drag him out of here?

886
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,630
You should watch what you say.

887
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,700
- Seriously?
- You shouldn't be so talkative.

888
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,320
- Unbelievable.
- How is it my fault?

889
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,820
To be able to hear isn't a crime.

890
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,520
- Was this your plan all along?
- Having ear holes is not a crime.

891
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,670
It's just that I might make
some other holes in your body.

892
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,440
You should blame
yourselves for talking.

893
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,300
It was his plan
to wait for someone to talk.

894
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,330
I could've done the same, you know.

895
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,470
- I could've done that too.
- The bell hasn't rung yet.

896
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,650
- Unbelievable.
- No way.

897
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,650
I have a feeling that
one will hit rock bottom.

898
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,270
- All right.
- Here we go.

899
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,450
Let's do this.

900
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,240
Come on!

901
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,920
(Jong Kook, Jae Suk, and Suk Jin
invested everything in I Media.)

902
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,220
(Se Chan invested everything
in A IT.)

903
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:30,460
(And they received false information
from Se Chan.)

904
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,250
- Come on.
- Show us.

905
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,220
- Please let me be lucky.
- Open.

906
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,290
(Stock Market of 2016,
B IT: minus 60 percent)

907
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,470
(C Automobiles: minus 17 percent,
I Media: plus 23 percent)

908
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,260
Open!

909
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,230
Yang Se Chan, that jerk.

910
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,180
(B IT: minus 60 percent)

911
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,000
- What happened?
- Hey.

912
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,040
- What happened?
- Gosh, seriously!

913
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,120
(The victims were completely
fooled by Se Chan's lie.)

914
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,220
What happened?

915
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,480
- You. Come here.
- What happened?

916
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,390
Take a look at that yourself!

917
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,420
(A IT: plus 11 percent)

918
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,480
I Media.

919
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,720
- We're the sole winners here.
- I Media.

920
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,050
(Jong Kook and Jae Suk
made profits through I Media.)

921
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,630
Gosh, Ji Seok Sam. My gosh.

922
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,670
Thank you.

923
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,700
(Suk Jin made profits thanks to
the last-minute cheating.)

924
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,970
It's so annoying!

925
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:15,610
Se Chan! This is so annoying!

926
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,670
Why are you blaming me?

927
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,710
(What is this?)

928
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,940
(Cho Sae Ho's account balance:
726 dollars)

929
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,270
(Haha's account balance:
418 dollars)

930
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,970
(He lost half of his money
because of Sae Ho's false info.)

931
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,650
It's your fault
for becoming clouded...

932
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,180
after hearing information
from someone else.

933
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,010
Why are you blaming me?

934
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,390
- You. Come here.
- My information was correct.

935
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,550
- My English...
- I'm going to kill you.

936
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,320
- My English is bad.
- So annoying!

937
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,900
Se Chan! This is so annoying!

938
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,930
How much did you invest?

939
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,700
I went all-in!

940
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,560
- It's not looking bad. Just wait.
- What do you mean?

941
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,790
That old fox.

942
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,440
- Why that...
- I'm not going to trust him again.

943
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,970
- Did you invest in I Media?
- Yes.

944
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,530
- Did you invest all your money?
- I went all-in on I Media.

945
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:52,940
- Gosh.
- Why?

946
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,380
(Suk Jin survived by picking up
information from others.)

947
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,000
- You're so sly.
- What about you?

948
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,270
You should figure out
whether my information...

949
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,850
is true or not.

950
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,220
I'm going to kill that jerk.

951
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,120
Ji Hyo, I went all-in
because I believed in Se Chan.

952
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,660
- Gosh, Se Chan!
- Se Chan.

953
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,660
Everyone is crying here.

954
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,660
(Everyone is crying here.)

955
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,820
Everyone is crying.

956
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,490
- You can't trust anyone...
- How can you trust...

957
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:15,630
- a sly guy like him?
- in Wall Street.

958
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,060
- How can you trust anyone?
- You lost your money too?

959
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,260
Otherwise, Suk Jin would have...

960
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,760
- Look! A homeless.
- She's...

961
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,470
She's gone broke.

962
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,830
(So Min ended up on the streets.)

963
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,210
Please be more strict.

964
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,330
What Suk Jin did
is considered cheating.

965
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,610
The bell hadn't rung then.

966
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,970
- Look here.
- Listen.

967
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,620
We thought we were wrapping up.
You can't change it last minute.

968
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,720
- There's no such rule.
- You stole the info from us.

969
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,720
I went all-in because they said
I Media would flourish.

970
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,890
- My gosh.
- This is incredible.

971
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,920
I made some money thanks to you.

972
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,960
- This is incredible.
- This is driving me crazy.

973
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,900
- I can't believe this can happen.
- It's 2016.

974
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,050
Hey, if investing in stocks
was that easy,

975
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,050
everyone would be rich.

976
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,970
This is why you can't sleep
when you invest in stocks.

977
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,400
- You are seriously...
- The economy was bad in 2016.

978
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,410
You told me info on B IT,
but you invested in A IT.

979
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,610
I'm going to kill you.

980
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,610
You're such a jerk.

981
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,650
You're a jerk. You...

982
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,270
You should end up in jail.

983
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,570
Follow me.

984
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,180
(Cho Sae Ho's account balance:
726 dollars)

985
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,480
(He lost his money when he didn't
even get false information.)

986
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,690
(He's bruised along
with his account balance.)

987
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,750
I don't know.

988
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,320
I lost maybe about half.

989
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,160
(He lost all the money he made
by investing in H Sports.)

990
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,250
I'm sorry to hear that.

991
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,400
It's okay.

992
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,430
I think the automobile industry
will flourish soon.

993
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,320
- But that's...
- No, it's too soon.

994
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,700
- Is it C or D?
- It's too soon.

995
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,370
- Everyone is...
- You have no idea.

996
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:31,030
dying to find out
which one is Tesla.

997
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,770
Jae Suk! Darn you.

998
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
"Darn you?"

999
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,210
(They're desperate to find
the initial for Tesla.)

1000
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,040
Se Chan.

1001
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,950
You told me C Automobiles is Tesla.

1002
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,120
I'm not sure yet.

1003
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,620
- Gosh, you!
- I'm not sure.

1004
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,120
So Tesla is...

1005
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,160
I know hot tips on Tesla.

1006
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,080
From 2017...

1007
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,020
I'll give you the info
if you come to me.

1008
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,250
Can you be quiet?

1009
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,630
Why would I be here
if I were to keep quiet?

1010
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,260
I'll give you information on Tesla
from 2017 if you give me a coin.

1011
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,290
- B IT.
- All right. B IT.

1012
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,300
(Desperate Haha purchases
Level 1 info on B IT.)

1013
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,940
- Level One for now.
- Level One? All right.

1014
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,500
It's 2017. Newly inaugurated...

1015
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,210
President Trump is active
on B IT's SNS.

1016
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,300
(Level 1 info on B IT)

1017
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,040
- Is that a good thing?
- I don't know.

1018
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,390
Just tell me that much.

1019
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,390
- I can't.
- Come on.

1020
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,450
- Come on!
- I can't.

1021
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:20,790
Is it good or bad?

1022
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,850
(Asking for insider info
by bribing him with R coin)

1023
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,080
Is Trump?

1024
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,350
All right. So Running News 2017.

1025
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:29,470
Newly inaugurated President Trump
is active on B IT's SNS.

1026
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,640
- My gosh. Yes.
- Yes!

1027
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,060
- Trump?
- Trump.

1028
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,230
- Donald Trump?
- Trump.

1029
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,370
Active on...

1030
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,700
SNS.

1031
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,430
- Yes.
- B IT?

1032
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,350
- On B IT?
- On B IT.

1033
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,850
- Wow, oh, my gosh.
- Yes.

1034
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,220
- It's good news!
- This is...

1035
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,810
- I don't know if it's good news.
- It's good news!

1036
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,980
It could be good news.

1037
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,410
This is crazy.

1038
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,080
I got some crazy info.

1039
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,410
(Information Exchange)

1040
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,330
I figured out which company B IT is.

1041
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,520
B IT.

1042
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,660
It's Twitter.

1043
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,500
(Suk Jin induced it
from the hint, "Trump's SNS.")

1044
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,390
You're going all-in? Do you want me
to help just one last time?

1045
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,470
- Go away!
- No, it'll be the last time.

1046
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,970
- I'm serious.
- Go away! Don't mess with me.

1047
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,600
Do you want to go all-in
on this company with me?

1048
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,330
Let me help you.

1049
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,870
I feel bad for you,
so let me give you help.

1050
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,250
- No, thanks. I...
- Come here.

1051
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,770
- I'll show you investing in it.
- No, I...

1052
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,180
I will live my life...

1053
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,410
- What's wrong with him?
- Mister, what's wrong?

1054
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,890
Mister, what's wrong with you?

1055
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,390
He bumped himself into the bench
while trying to help me.

1056
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,430
- He bumped himself into it?
- He did.

1057
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,480
Isn't he so funny?

1058
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,790
He's dying to show off,
so he's all over the place.

1059
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,330
- He's acting up, isn't he?
- He's going all over the place...

1060
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,330
offering information.

1061
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,730
He insists on sharing
the info he knows.

1062
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,000
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Earlier,

1063
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,500
he was saying...

1064
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,640
that he'd share information
if we gave a coin to him.

1065
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,730
(Suk Jin acted up and bluffed
that he knows info on Tesla.)

1066
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,540
That's how stocks are like.

1067
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,930
You never know what will happen
with stocks.

1068
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,640
But I'll help you out this time.

1069
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,770
Come here.

1070
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,250
No one is following him.

1071
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,850
No one is following him.

1072
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,020
Young Ji.

1073
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,120
You can invest in the company
I invest in.

1074
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,080
- Then show me.
- I'm seriously...

1075
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,180
I need to see you investing in it.

1076
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,790
- I'll start my investment.
- Okay.

1077
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,500
- Don't tell anyone about it.
- Okay.

1078
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,700
- Come here.
- Okay.

1079
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,100
I'll go all-in on B IT.

1080
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,890
For real?

1081
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,910
Don't tell anyone.
I'm helping you out one last time.

1082
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,230
(Suk Jin actually went
all-in on B IT.)

1083
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,180
- Come.
- Really?

1084
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,810
In return,

1085
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,500
you should spread a rumor
that B IT won't do well.

1086
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,770
- Okay.
- Hurry. All right?

1087
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:27,950
Yes, I got it.

1088
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,890
I'll sell all of them
and go all-in on B IT.

1089
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,290
I'm going all-in on B IT.

1090
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,480
Which one do you think is Tesla?

1091
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,660
- C Automobiles or D Automobiles?
- Others are waiting.

1092
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,790
(Other investors are still trying to
figure out which company is Tesla.)

1093
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,850
- Right?
- C Automobiles.

1094
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,290
- Level 2. Yes.
- Level 2?

1095
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,100
(Ji Hyo purchases Level 2
information on C Automobiles.)

1096
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,270
C Automobiles appoints a new CEO...

1097
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,970
who transformed a large furniture
company into a global company.

1098
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,180
He transformed
a large furniture company...

1099
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,810
into a global company?

1100
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,770
What does it mean?

1101
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,580
C Automobiles...

1102
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,870
Is it Tesla?

1103
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,720
- No?
- I don't know.

1104
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,250
- Please.
- I don't know.

1105
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,580
(It's vague information to confirm
C Automobiles as Tesla.)

1106
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,390
I'll divide my investment...

1107
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,060
into C and D Automobiles.

1108
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,950
- You'll divide it? Are you sure?
- Yes.

1109
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,290
They might
suddenly invest differently.

1110
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,430
Is C Automobile doing well?

1111
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,370
Is C Automobile doing well?
How do you know that?

1112
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,540
(The hacker overheard
another piece of information.)

1113
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,640
Is it Tesla?

1114
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,040
I got the information.

1115
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,410
What level?

1116
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,770
Level Three?

1117
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,870
- How well is it doing?
- Sorry?

1118
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,640
- How well is it doing?
- Well, that's...

1119
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,370
(Suk Jin was tempted
by Ji Hyo's false information.)

1120
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,950
- Okay?
- Oh, that's why you're rich.

1121
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,660
- Yes.
- Yes, that's why you're rich.

1122
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,080
C Automobiles.

1123
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,230
(C Automobiles)

1124
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,830
- You ready? Take a look.
- Yes. Thank you.

1125
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,500
(Is the information Ji Hyo received
a good one or a bad one?)

1126
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,160
(C Automobiles
appoints a new CEO...)

1127
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,770
(who transformed a large furniture
company into a global company.)

1128
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,770
(However, as he has no experience
in managing automobile companies,)

1129
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,770
(the investors are withdrawing
their investment.)

1130
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,930
(Their stock price falls.)

1131
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,000
That's a lot of information.

1132
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,160
Suk Jin, I have a question.

1133
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,580
Suk Jin.

1134
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,430
Did Tesla...

1135
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,180
acquire any other companies?
Did they expand their business?

1136
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,120
They have several businesses.

1137
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,810
They're exploring Mars too.

1138
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,750
What about it?

1139
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:09,910
- Sorry?
- Why did you ask?

1140
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,310
I just saw a piece of information
on it.

1141
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,810
So is Tesla C or D Automobiles?

1142
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,020
What is it? Is it C or D?

1143
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,890
- So from the start, we should've...
- I think it's C Automobiles.

1144
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,250
- You think it's C Automobiles?
- Yes.

1145
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,830
From what I saw, it's C Automobiles.

1146
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,830
- You think it's C Automobiles?
- Yes. It's C Automobiles.

1147
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,200
Then its price will increase a lot
in 2017.

1148
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,770
Then it must be C Automobiles.

1149
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,060
(Se Chan encourages him to
invest in C Automobiles...)

1150
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,370
(even though he knows
that its price will drop.)

1151
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,500
I'll sell...

1152
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,500
half of B IT's stocks.

1153
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,770
(Ji Suk Jin's account balance)

1154
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,220
And I'll invest in C Automobiles.

1155
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,910
- All of it?
- Yes.

1156
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,040
(Suk Jin ends up falling for it.)

1157
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,480
I'll invest in D Automobiles.

1158
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,720
(Se Chan goes all-in on D
Automobiles after fooling Suk Jin.)

1159
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,910
I'll go all-in on D Automobiles.

1160
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,060
- D Automobiles?
- Yes.

1161
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,060
Gosh, I can't tell this time.

1162
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,230
No, I'll invest
in one of the automobile companies.

1163
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:56,290
I'll invest in B IT
and D Automobiles.

1164
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,660
(He invests in B IT and
D Automobiles based on his hunches.)

1165
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,930
E Biotechnology, please.

1166
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,270
- E?
- E Biotechnology?

1167
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,040
Running News 2017.

1168
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,810
Trump wins
the Presidential Election.

1169
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,680
Here you go!

1170
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,180
(Level 1 info on E Biotechnology)

1171
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,250
What do I do?

1172
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,580
(Trump won the election?)

1173
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,620
Trump...

1174
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,660
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

1175
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,950
(Sae Ho is sure that it's good news
after seeing the word, "win.")

1176
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,060
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

1177
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,830
- Oh, you know?
- Okay.

1178
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,950
- Okay.
- I don't know, but...

1179
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,450
I'm not sure. "Win?"

1180
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,140
I'll buy 35 stocks...

1181
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,370
of E Biotechnology.

1182
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,370
Which one are you going to sell?

1183
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,870
I'll sell everything else.

1184
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,540
Will H Sports be a jackpot?

1185
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,810
(Haha is still not over H Sports.)

1186
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,980
- I'll go all-in on H Sports.
- H Sports?

1187
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,350
(Haha's account balance)

1188
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,790
I'm broke now.
I don't know how this will go.

1189
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,350
Ji Hyo.

1190
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:53,980
G Fashion.

1191
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,330
Hold on.

1192
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,350
(Get lost!)

1193
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,350
How dare he try to con me.

1194
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:01,060
Why would you act so cheap
in Wall Street?

1195
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:04,700
That's the year Trump
became the president of the US.

1196
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,160
(Yoo Jae Suk's account balance)

1197
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,200
I'll invest in I Media.

1198
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,770
(He invests in I Media again
based on what he knows.)

1199
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:12,040
It's December, so please wrap up.

1200
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,640
(December 21, 2016)

1201
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,100
We're almost there!

1202
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,540
- We're almost there.
- It's hot.

1203
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,620
- A new year will dawn.
- The New Year's Bell will ring.

1204
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,250
- Let's see!
- Since their prices dropped...

1205
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,250
Isn't it about time they go up?

1206
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,390
(Suk Jin invested in C Automobiles,
thinking it's Tesla.)

1207
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:29,350
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

1208
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,020
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

1209
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,330
- Feliz Navidad
- Feliz Navidad

1210
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,160
Let's go!

1211
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,520
Feliz Navidad

1212
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,770
(The stock market in 2016
was down overall.)

1213
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,830
(How will the stock market
be like in 2017?)

1214
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,770
- It's the new year!
- Happy New Year!

1215
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,970
- Make some noise!
- It's the new year!

1216
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,430
The US stock market of 2017...

1217
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,080
is open!

1218
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,080
- E Biotechnology!
- I Media!

1219
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,520
(Stock Market of 2017)

1220
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,540
(E Biotechnology: plus 400 percent,
I Media: plus 100 percent)

1221
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,480
(I Media: plus 100 percent)

1222
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,660
- E Biotechnology!
- I Media went up by 100 percent?

1223
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,790
- I Media!
- How did it go up by 100 percent?

1224
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:08,870
(C Automobiles: minus 10 percent,
D Automoblies: plus 50 percent)

1225
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,000
It's open!

1226
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,060
(E Biotechnology Sae Ho invested in
went up by 400 percent.)

1227
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,100
(E Biotechnology!)

1228
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,910
(Dealer Cho hit the jackpot!)

1229
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:22,910
I Media!

1230
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,540
(Wailing)

1231
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,870
F Biotechnology
went up by 400 percent?

1232
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,080
E Biotechnology
went up by 400 percent?

1233
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,180
(Cho Sae Ho's account balance:
3,500 dollars)

1234
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,520
Four hundred percent?

1235
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,220
- How did this happen?
- You made it?

1236
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,220
- You punk!
- Is it a good thing or a bad thing?

1237
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,080
- He...
- It's a jackpot!

1238
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,060
He told me that E Biotechnology's
price would drop.

1239
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,450
Did you buy it or not?

1240
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,520
You lost your money again.

1241
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,770
Gosh, E Biotechnology...

1242
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,370
(Haha's account balance:
225 dollars)

1243
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,540
Is this for real? I have no info
on biotechnology at all.

1244
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,970
You bought E Biotechnology.

1245
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,230
Fifty percent isn't bad.

1246
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,160
(Yang Se Chan's account balance:
1,518 dollars)

1247
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,480
It's not bad.

1248
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,980
C Automobiles' price dropped!

1249
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,700
(Ji Suk Jin's account balance:
1,216.8 dollars)

1250
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,270
Why did you lie to me?

1251
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,270
I didn't. It was doing well.

1252
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,140
Check out the amount of money
you earned in 2017,

1253
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,020
and we'll begin a mission
where you can earn some points.

1254
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,450
I told you!

1255
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,830
- This is amazing!
- There is...

1256
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:11,180
There's a beggar here.

1257
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,930
- I should buy C Automobiles'.
- So Bal.

1258
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,270
I told you to invest in I Media.

1259
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:19,160
Everyone, you don't have to be
disappointed just yet.

1260
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,660
The US stock market's boom
is just starting.

1261
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,040
That's right. It's just starting.

1262
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,040
The percentage of increase
will be much bigger from now.

1263
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,870
- Of course.
- What we earned was chicken feed.

1264
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:31,810
- These two over here...
- Did they go bankrupt?

1265
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:34,140
- They're almost bankrupt.
- What happened?

1266
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,540
What? You jerk!

1267
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,810
- I'm sorry.
- Why...

1268
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:38,480
- You're so mean.
- Please keep your manners.

1269
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,790
- I really want to punch him now.
- It's infuriating, isn't it?

1270
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,560
- I really trusted him.
- I really did too.

1271
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,520
- He has no conscience at all.
- He's going to...

1272
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,020
I thought he'd have a conscience,
at least.

1273
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,060
Goodness.

1274
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:52,160
We'll reveal the ranking of 2017.

1275
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,640
Bring in the chart.

1276
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,640
(Current Asset Ranking)

1277
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,470
- Jae Suk.
- How did the bottom three...

1278
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,470
end up there?

1279
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,370
Young Ji, So Min, and Haha.

1280
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,100
(The three gullible ones
are at the bottom.)

1281
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,850
- Right.
- Whose information did you get?

1282
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:06,480
- What happened to Seok Sam?
- Where is he?

1283
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,390
- You were so...
- You bluffed so much.

1284
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,140
- But he's...
- He bluffed so much, but...

1285
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,480
Compared to how much he bluffed...

1286
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,790
- His ranking is...
- He's in fifth place.

1287
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,810
- What on earth...
- I'm in third place.

1288
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,790
It hasn't even begun yet.

1289
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,290
It's your last chance
to earn additional points.

1290
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,870
It's a mission to train
to stay composed...

1291
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:25,020
when you impulsively
want to buy or sell stocks.

1292
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,700
It's called You Insulted Me.

1293
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,830
You Insulted Me?

1294
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,430
We'll pick a member,

1295
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,040
and the rest of you should come up
with a sentence...

1296
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,500
that will infuriate them
on the board.

1297
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,600
All right.

1298
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,270
The one who upset the selected
member the most gets three points.

1299
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,450
The next 2 will get 2 points each.

1300
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:45,910
You'll be understanding
even if it upsets you, right?

1301
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,830
I can't assure that.
Jong Kook is the type...

1302
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,830
who loses his temper sometimes.

1303
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:53,930
It can be anything,
whether it be a nickname or such.

1304
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,230
- We can even write a letter?
- It doesn't matter.

1305
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,370
We can write a letter.

1306
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,140
The first member is Jong Kook.

1307
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,100
All right. I don't mind them
unless they're facts.

1308
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,600
There are a few things...

1309
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,060
- I can think of.
- Of course.

1310
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,310
I don't mind unless they're facts.
Let me tell you this in advance.

1311
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,140
I don't care unless they're facts.

1312
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:09,980
I won't even look at it.

1313
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,870
- You won't even look at it?
- Of course.

1314
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:12,870
But I wrote a fact.

1315
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:15,620
- Sure. That's only your opinion.
- You should add another one.

1316
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,580
This is a fact. Wait. Let me add...

1317
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,850
Jong Kook, you don't get upset
with things like this, right?

1318
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,310
Of course not.

1319
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,350
Tell him not to hit us.

1320
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,180
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

1321
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,060
Those who want to go first,
go ahead.

1322
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,060
- Should I go first?
- Sure.

1323
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,100
- Jae Suk.
- Yes.

1324
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,100
I can tell
what they're going to say.

1325
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,990
You're horrible in soccer.

1326
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,850
You know you're
a terrible soccer player, right?

1327
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,890
Quit it. If you didn't have money,
they wouldn't let you join.

1328
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,830
(If you didn't have money,
they wouldn't let you join.)

1329
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,830
All right. I'll go next.

1330
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,000
- Say it right away.
- I knew he'd say that.

1331
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,160
So it doesn't affect me.

1332
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,220
Do you actually like soccer?

1333
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,740
- Doesn't it upset you?
- Not at all.

1334
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,140
- Why?
- I knew they'd talk about soccer.

1335
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,100
Why would you like soccer?

1336
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,140
(His face is hardening.)

1337
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,970
- Let me reveal mine too.
- They're all talking about soccer.

1338
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:01,000
- It's about soccer, isn't it?
- You're a princess, aren't you?

1339
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,540
You're worse than me in soccer.

1340
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,720
(Princess Jong Kook
tries to stay composed.)

1341
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,120
It doesn't affect me at all.

1342
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:12,290
He's the worst celebrity
soccer player.

1343
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:14,450
That's fine. It's quite funny.

1344
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,060
- It's hilarious.
- Is it?

1345
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,790
- The worst celebrity soccer player.
- It's hilarious.

1346
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:18,930
Mine is really boring, to be honest.

1347
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,200
- I saw it, and it's really boring.
- It's okay. Go ahead.

1348
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,890
- Go ahead. Let's hear it.
- Go ahead.

1349
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:25,200
Jong Kook, open your eyes.
Can you even see me?

1350
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,040
That's intense.
It's quite offending.

1351
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,100
- Is it?
- Yes, it is.

1352
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,140
It's no fun but offending?

1353
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,540
- That is...
- It's offending?

1354
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,600
- His comment is offending?
- He was upset with ours.

1355
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,000
He was upset with ours.

1356
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,500
But that's a fact.

1357
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,040
I'm sure he was upset
with our comments.

1358
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,180
- Not at all.
- Pick them in the order...

1359
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,310
- of the most offending ones.
- Of course.

1360
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:42,890
- I'll say mine.
- It's Young Ji.

1361
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:44,850
Jong Kook, you smell like
a chicken farm.

1362
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,160
(I smell like a chicken farm?)

1363
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,330
- She's good.
- That's a good one.

1364
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,330
You're good.

1365
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:53,060
- It's so offensive.
- She's the best at it.

1366
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,290
That was a good one.

1367
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:55,700
- Jong Kook.
- Good job.

1368
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,270
He must've had
so much chicken breast.

1369
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:58,700
- Young Ji.
- Young Ji, good one.

1370
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,790
He smells like chicken?

1371
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,770
- Young Ji is good.
- Like the smell of eggs.

1372
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:02,910
She knows how to offend people.

1373
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,040
It's not a fact.

1374
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,700
Pick a member
who was most offensive.

1375
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,350
That will be Young Ji.

1376
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,140
Young Ji's was most offensive.

1377
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,640
- What about second place?
- Second place...

1378
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,020
You should skip the comments
on soccer.

1379
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,120
The worst soccer player.

1380
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,310
- The worst celebrity soccer player.
- No, not that one.

1381
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,390
They wouldn't let you join
if you had no money.

1382
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:20,450
Not at all. That was the worst one.

1383
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:24,560
- You look upset.
- No, it didn't affect me at all.

1384
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,620
But they'll really
not let you join...

1385
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,700
- if you have no money.
- That's not true at all.

1386
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,620
- You see? You're a princess, right?
- No, I'm not.

1387
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,270
- Do you like soccer?
- That's not true.

1388
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,660
- Why?
- But it's true.

1389
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,830
It's true that you're bad at soccer.

1390
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,000
- No. That's not true.
- I'm serious.

1391
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,430
He's never seen me
play soccer properly.

1392
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:37,000
- You sound upset already.
- No, not at all.

1393
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,540
- You're a horrible soccer player.
- Not at all.

1394
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:41,080
- I saw it last time.
- I'm fine because I know I'm good.

1395
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,000
- No, I'm good at it.
- You play soccer like this.

1396
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,450
- Like this.
- I'm good at it.

1397
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:47,970
- You shot it to the wrong place.
- That's not true.

1398
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,350
No, I shot it properly.

1399
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:50,680
- You seem very upset.
- No, I'm right.

1400
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,680
No. Not at all.

1401
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,410
You should earn a lot
if you want to play soccer.

1402
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,680
I already have plenty of money.

1403
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:56,450
- I'm earning a lot already.
- You should earn a lot.

1404
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,750
- He's so annoying.
- You should earn a lot...

1405
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,160
- if you want to play soccer.
- I already have plenty of money.

1406
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:00,290
You should pick second places now.

1407
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:02,160
- He wouldn't look this way.
- Let me see.

1408
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,830
- He wouldn't look at us.
- Hey.

1409
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:06,140
- He's upset. He's clearly upset.
- I'm totally fine.

1410
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:08,370
- You're clearly upset.
- Not at all.

1411
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:11,500
If they were a pro, like
Lee Young Pyo, I'd be hurt.

1412
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,100
- But they don't know soccer.
- But you're crossing your legs.

1413
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:16,450
- He's very upset.
- Not at all.

1414
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,250
- Yes, you are upset.
- We can feel it.

1415
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,620
It's clear that you're upset.

1416
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,080
I need to pick 2 members
for 2nd place, right?

1417
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,140
I hate that comment.
"Open your eyes."

1418
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,560
- You win second place.
- Me?

1419
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,580
- Also...
- What do you mean?

1420
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,180
- This is...
- He got mad because of us.

1421
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,390
- He got mad because of us.
- I know.

1422
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,720
Aren't you going to give points
to Young Ji's comment?

1423
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,290
- I gave her 1st place.
- He gave her 1st place.

1424
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,600
- She's in first place.
- He did? Okay.

1425
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,470
- He's the worst.
- He gave her first place...

1426
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:39,640
as soon as he started.

1427
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,370
- As soon as he started.
- Oh, I see.

1428
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:42,600
(He must've been confused
because of the chicken farm smell.)

1429
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,700
I was so startled.

1430
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,040
Next is Se Chan.

1431
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,040
- It's my turn?
- Yes.

1432
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,310
I'll be fine with them.

1433
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:51,540
We need to focus on the points
that would offend Se Chan.

1434
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,120
I don't know those points though.

1435
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,810
This could become an issue,

1436
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,450
so please edit it out
if it's inappropriate.

1437
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:58,520
What is it? Is it that bad?

1438
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,680
There's no such thing.
He's being ridiculous.

1439
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:02,390
- I'm serious about this one.
- Try me.

1440
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:03,990
You want me to go first?

1441
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:06,220
- Haha, you go first.
- Let's see what it's about.

1442
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,500
This actually happened.

1443
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,060
Edit it out
if it's too inappropriate.

1444
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:11,200
I got your permission.

1445
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:13,930
You stole Dream's bicycle, right?

1446
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,640
(You stole Dream's bicycle, right?)

1447
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:19,770
- Gosh, that's...
- No, it actually happened.

1448
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,750
- I have the footage.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1449
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,810
- Come on.
- You have the footage?

1450
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,450
- You think I'd steal a kid's bike?
- Yes.

1451
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:26,970
- It's the red one.
- You think I'm a bicycle thief?

1452
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,720
- It's gone.
- That's ridiculous.

1453
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,080
- I'm serious. It's really gone.
- That's nonsense.

1454
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,660
- But this is...
- If I report it, you'd be arrested.

1455
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,560
Mine is similar to his.
Let me read mine next.

1456
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,060
You stole money
from my wallet earlier, right?

1457
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,350
(You stole money
from my wallet earlier, right?)

1458
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,620
- Why would you make me a thief?
- You stole my cash last week, no?

1459
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,390
- Darn it! That's nonsense.
- You are...

1460
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,290
- Why would you...
- You'll offend me with those?

1461
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,870
- Why would you steal a bicycle?
- All right.

1462
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,040
- Next.
- Can I go next?

1463
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,470
- But I'm not sure if it's right.
- Go ahead.

1464
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:55,350
I want to land a knee kick
on your teeth from time to time.

1465
00:48:55,350 --> 00:49:00,720
(I want to land a knee kick
on your teeth from time to time.)

1466
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,620
- She's good.
- That's intense.

1467
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,080
(She wants to push in his
protruding teeth by kicking them.)

1468
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,660
- She's good.
- It's funnier because she said it.

1469
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,390
- That's intense.
- Like this.

1470
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:12,020
- Young Ji is intense.
- Are you a hate commenter?

1471
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,790
- She's good with it.
- She's like a hate commenter.

1472
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,270
It's infuriating.

1473
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:17,930
Mine was weak compared to hers.

1474
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,700
It's upsetting although it wasn't
directed at me.

1475
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,790
That hurts.

1476
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:21,870
She wants to kick his teeth...

1477
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:26,200
What is that?

1478
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,970
(A portrait of Se Chan)

1479
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,270
- What is that?
- It looks just like him.

1480
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:33,080
What's that? Why are my teeth...
Is that a potbelly or what?

1481
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,180
At least she drew his eyes
like jewels.

1482
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,310
- He has pretty eyes.
- They are like jewels.

1483
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,350
His eyes are glistening.

1484
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:41,220
- I have a double chin.
- The answer is Yang Se Chan.

1485
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:43,930
Se Chan, you play golf diligently.

1486
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,450
But it doesn't suit you.

1487
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,890
(Jong Kook's hate comment is mild.)

1488
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:48,350
- Okay.
- Ji Hyo.

1489
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,870
If you think about it,
he isn't mean...

1490
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,140
to people he cherishes.

1491
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,970
- Jong Kook, don't you have...
- He treats me differently.

1492
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:56,330
- much affection for me?
- Seriously.

1493
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,930
- I can't believe you.
- He is serious about golf.

1494
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,000
Please choose the winners.

1495
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,200
Young Ji's comment places first.
Nothing beats that one.

1496
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,250
Young Ji's comment.
Everyone acknowledges it.

1497
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,770
Haha's comment places second.

1498
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:06,810
Put it back.

1499
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,140
- Jong Kook's comment.
- Okay.

1500
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,850
- Thank goodness.
- Is the golf comment that annoying?

1501
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:12,910
- It's golf.
- I can't believe it.

1502
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,060
- It's golf.
- You did it to win brownie points.

1503
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,220
- This is ridiculous.
- I won fair and square.

1504
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,520
- I am sensitive about it.
- Jong Kook pressured him.

1505
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,220
- That shouldn't be allowed.
- Jong Kook pressured him.

1506
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,500
He didn't pressure me.

1507
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,750
Up next is Jae Suk.

1508
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,120
I will be objective.

1509
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,970
Your body is so cute.
It's just like Dream's.

1510
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:27,660
- Gosh.
- It's true.

1511
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,540
You are a flippant man
with a hopeless face.

1512
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,640
- You are uglier than me.
- My goodness.

1513
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,000
(An attack on his looks
makes him lose his cool.)

1514
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,450
- That's so aggravating.
- That's truly aggravating.

1515
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,640
Up next is So Min.

1516
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,140
So Min.

1517
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,620
There is a group chatroom
without you.

1518
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,540
(There is a group chatroom
without you.)

1519
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,120
- This one is true.
- Really?

1520
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,450
To be honest, we had a get-together
without you yesterday.

1521
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,660
- Gosh.
- Are you serious?

1522
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,660
No. It's a joke.

1523
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,850
Throw a white handkerchief.

1524
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,250
- Stop it.
- Give So Min...

1525
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,700
- a white handkerchief.
- So Min is really angry.

1526
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,120
- Shall we move on to Sae Ho?
- Sae Ho.

1527
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,500
Why is everyone so intent
on making a comment about me?

1528
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,930
I think your face got
athlete's foot.

1529
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,370
You should wash up more.

1530
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:03,810
(Athlete's foot on the face
will shock the academic circles.)

1531
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,580
- What?
- What are you doing?

1532
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:07,470
Why are you on the show
for two weeks?

1533
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,140
He really felt that blow.

1534
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,220
Hey. What's that?

1535
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,770
What's that? Come on.

1536
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,390
- It resembles you.
- It resembles you.

1537
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:17,540
- Come on.
- It resembles you.

1538
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,910
- It looks exactly like you.
- It resembles you.

1539
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,810
- Sae Ho.
- So Min drew well.

1540
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:23,390
- Suk Jin is last.
- Okay.

1541
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,120
You smell like grandpa
when you walk by.

1542
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,560
(It's an attack
on his age and smell.)

1543
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,620
You little...

1544
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:34,290
Suk Jin! What's wrong?

1545
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:36,470
That was bound to bring swear words.

1546
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:37,970
I was supposed to anger you.

1547
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,500
Suk Jin really became angry.

1548
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:41,500
(Ta-da)

1549
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,950
(She imagined how
Suk Jin would look in the future.)

1550
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,970
- Where is his hair?
- Hey.

1551
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,140
Why did you make me bald?

1552
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,370
- Where is his hair?
- I have a lot of hair!

1553
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,020
It's a secret
that he is losing hair.

1554
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,350
We don't have time for this.

1555
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:54,390
We need to hurry up and invest.

1556
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:56,250
The year is 2017.

1557
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,930
You will receive coins
at a new location.

1558
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:59,160
That's good.

1559
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,830
- Okay.
- That's good.

1560
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,060
All right.
Shall we enjoy investing again?

1561
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,240
(January 1st, 2017)

1562
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,410
- Will I be able to get back up?
- All right. I got it.

1563
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:13,040
(Sae Ho is currently 1st
in the asset ranking.)

1564
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,470
This is where it gets tricky.

1565
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,580
Let's just stay in the middle.

1566
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:19,950
(Jong Kook goes straight
to acquire information.)

1567
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:21,450
All right.
They will take a long time.

1568
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:22,640
- Welcome back.
- Hi.

1569
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:24,950
I will check out a hint of A IT.

1570
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,990
- A IT.
- B is...

1571
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,290
There you go. Oh, my gosh.

1572
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:32,290
(A IT released
a new product package.)

1573
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:36,660
If it was released to celebrate
the tenth anniversary...

1574
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,770
Could it be...

1575
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,160
Could it be iPhone?

1576
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,970
Hold on. That means
this top item was released in 2008.

1577
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,450
It's iPhone. Oh, my gosh.

1578
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:50,640
Oh, my gosh.

1579
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,040
I know that iPhone came out in 2008.

1580
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:54,640
Oh, my gosh.

1581
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:57,390
I will use all of my assets
to purchase the A IT stocks.

1582
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:58,750
Yes.

1583
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,160
(He is certain that A IT is Apple.)

1584
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:02,020
(Ji Hyo checks the information
on A IT as well.)

1585
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,620
Is this Apple?

1586
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:05,620
I have no idea.

1587
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,970
Sorry. Thank you.

1588
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,520
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

1589
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,140
- Let's work together again.
- Let's do that.

1590
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,870
- Our common enemy is Se Chan.
- Yes.

1591
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:16,930
We need to crush him.

1592
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:19,430
- That's what I think.
- A IT is Apple.

1593
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:20,910
(She shares that A IT is Apple.)

1594
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:22,810
A IT. It isn't B IT.

1595
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,310
Stop spreading false information.

1596
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,450
Okay.

1597
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,580
Sae Ho, can you move out of the way?

1598
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,390
(Can you move out of the way?)

1599
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,850
Are you bragging about your wealth
with your hands in your pocket?

1600
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:39,220
I am in a bad condition,
so please be understanding.

1601
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,390
Why are you in a bad condition?

1602
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:41,560
I couldn't make people laugh
earlier.

1603
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,270
- I couldn't do well.
- Don't get hung up on it.

1604
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,390
Sae Ho, that's
what's funny about you.

1605
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:48,770
- Really?
- Yes.

1606
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:50,060
- I am glad.
- That's what's funny about you.

1607
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,580
I couldn't badmouth people.

1608
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:58,470
Should I invest
in E Biotechnology again?

1609
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,580
This is the last round for me.

1610
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:04,290
It will be over for me
if I don't make money.

1611
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:05,350
How much money do you have left?

1612
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:06,790
I have 200 dollars left.

1613
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,850
In that case...

1614
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:12,660
In 2019, 2020, and 2021,

1615
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:14,890
the US stock market enjoyed a boom.

1616
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:18,470
It's a matter of finding the stocks
that will skyrocket.

1617
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,970
There is one company
everyone is looking for.

1618
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:23,640
Everyone wants to know
which one is Tesla.

1619
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,330
We don't know if it's
C Automobiles or D Automobiles.

1620
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:32,540
(Tesla was at the center
of the US stock craze.)

1621
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,790
(Is either C Automobiles
or D Automobiles Tesla?)

1622
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,580
- My nickname is Jisla.
- What?

1623
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:42,790
I applied for a car in 2017.

1624
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:44,060
I am sorry,
but please move out of the way.

1625
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,560
I am passing through.

1626
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,520
I applied for a car in 2017,

1627
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,120
so I know
all about Tesla's stock price.

1628
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,930
I am sorry, but please tell that
to the person who asked.

1629
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:54,290
I am talking to myself.

1630
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:58,430
I applied for a car in 2017.

1631
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:01,310
so I know how
the stock price changed then.

1632
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:03,540
I know whether it's C Automobiles
or D Automobiles.

1633
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:05,140
Excuse me.

1634
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:06,580
What do you want to learn?

1635
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,680
C Automobiles.

1636
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:10,850
"President Trump decides
to impose additional tariffs..."

1637
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:14,660
"on imported steel and aluminum
for the domestic economy."

1638
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,750
Economy?

1639
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:17,950
(C Automobiles, Level 1)

1640
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,500
President Trump.

1641
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,100
Domestic economy?

1642
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:23,370
Domestic.

1643
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:24,870
- Domestic.
- Domestic.

1644
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:26,470
This country.

1645
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,160
Country.

1646
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,060
- This is about the US.
- Yes.

1647
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,470
The US economy.

1648
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:33,700
Domestic is... This country.

1649
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,750
Did Trump fly economy?

1650
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,850
- Trump.
- Trump.

1651
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,370
- Taxes.
- Taxi?

1652
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:45,040
- Taxes.
- Taxes.

1653
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:47,850
Domestic economy.

1654
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,680
This is important. "Imported."

1655
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,060
C Automobiles.

1656
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,790
- Will you go all in?
- Yes.

1657
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:55,160
It's the 15th.

1658
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,160
(Is C Automobiles Tesla?)

1659
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,330
Please wrap up.

1660
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:59,540
- Hi.
- Hey.

1661
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,660
- Welcome back.
- Hi.

1662
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,660
Last year was a miracle year.

1663
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,160
- Really? What happened?
- Yes.

1664
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,770
Plus 400 percent.

1665
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:10,250
- Plus 400 percent?
- Plus 400 percent. Yes.

1666
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,410
- I want to check one more thing.
- Okay.

1667
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,910
E Biotechnology.

1668
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,950
(He purchases
the level 1 information.)

1669
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:19,560
"President Trump
imposes additional tariffs..."

1670
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,220
"for the domestic economy."

1671
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,120
(E Biotechnology, Level 1)

1672
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,350
What is this?

1673
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:25,930
(E Biotechnology, Level 1)

1674
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:27,930
- Is it good?
- Well, I don't know.

1675
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,560
Which word are you talking about?

1676
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,870
What's "additional tariffs?"

1677
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:34,540
I don't know that one. I don't know.

1678
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,810
(Additional tariffs)

1679
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,270
(E Biotechnology, Level 1)

1680
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,240
It seems like a decision
that helps the domestic economy.

1681
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,580
I don't know.

1682
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,500
Will the stock price rise again
for E Biotechnology?

1683
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,140
Do you have any more money?

1684
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,680
Information on E Biotechnology...

1685
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:52,390
was about Trump doing something.

1686
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:54,520
Wouldn't the stock price drop
for E Biotechnology now?

1687
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,160
It might go up again.

1688
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,560
- Really?
- Yes. It might go up again.

1689
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,560
(It's hard to quit after a taste
of biotechnology stocks.)

1690
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,060
- Hello.
- Hello.

1691
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,290
I am looking for an SUV
I can use with my family.

1692
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,500
You are here to see an SUV.
Please come this way.

1693
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,970
- All right.
- Which one are you thinking?

1694
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:08,790
- I talked to my family about it.
- We have various options.

1695
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:10,060
We have everything from supercars.

1696
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,580
You look like someone
who is in the know.

1697
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,640
We have an incredible supercar
that just came in.

1698
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,950
- Is that so?
- If it's for the family,

1699
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:18,250
an SUV supercar will work well too.

1700
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:21,020
I am a model for a used car company.

1701
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,350
I am sorry.
I will have to buy a car there.

1702
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,640
Why did you even come here?

1703
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,020
I am sorry. I forgot.

1704
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,120
- Give it some thought.
- Okay. I am sorry.

1705
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,020
He wasted my time.

1706
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:32,250
I want to purchase the A IT stocks.

1707
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:33,560
A IT.

1708
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,700
I will use all of my money
to purchase the A IT stocks.

1709
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:36,770
(She is certain that it's Apple.)

1710
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,700
I will purchase 20 shares
of E Biotechnology stocks.

1711
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,410
I will use the rest
to invest in A IT stocks.

1712
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,370
- A IT.
- That will be 30 shares.

1713
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,370
Guys, I am feeling...

1714
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,870
particularly generous right now.

1715
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:51,540
If you want to succeed, come to me.

1716
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:54,040
Okay. I am struggling so much.

1717
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,140
How much money do you have?

1718
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:58,390
I have a little over 300 dollars?

1719
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:01,020
Will you trust me and follow me?

1720
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,250
I know exactly what I am doing.

1721
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:03,750
What will you invest in?
I will do what you do.

1722
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:04,750
Will you trust me and follow me?

1723
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,430
- Sure.
- I want to help you.

1724
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:07,430
Okay.

1725
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,870
I remember the stock price.

1726
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:11,370
In 2017,

1727
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:14,700
Tesla stocks cost about 70 dollars.

1728
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,060
Don't lie.
You will change it in the end.

1729
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,180
- No.
- Is it time to invest in it?

1730
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,600
(D Automobiles' stock price
is close to 70 dollars.)

1731
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:23,350
I will go all in on D Automobiles.

1732
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,750
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1733
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:26,970
All right.

1734
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,910
I will use all of my money
to invest in D Automobiles.

1735
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,390
- D Automobiles?
- Yes.

1736
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,350
All right.

1737
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:35,060
(Meanwhile,
Jae Suk heard something.)

1738
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,290
What is it?

1739
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:39,520
I will invest in B IT.

1740
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,790
- Will you use all of the money?
- Yes. B IT.

1741
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:43,970
(He thinks it's too early
to invest in automobiles.)

1742
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:45,470
- I invested all of my money, right?
- Yes.

1743
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:48,790
(He secretly invests
all of his money on B IT!)

1744
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,040
Gosh.

1745
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,540
(The long-term investor
of C Automobiles is in a daze.)

1746
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,500
Jae Suk, what did you invest in?

1747
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,500
(Jae Suk, what did you invest in?)

1748
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,600
B IT.

1749
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:02,120
Please take out half of the money
and invest in B IT.

1750
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,520
(She copies Jae Suk
and invests in B IT.)

1751
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,580
Please wrap up.

1752
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,060
It's Christmas again.

1753
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,060
It's Christmas.

1754
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,750
Merry Christmas.

1755
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,520
- Let's earn money one more time.
- Everyone.

1756
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,850
Let's earn money one more time.

1757
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,660
It's the end of the year.
It's December 25th.

1758
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:18,020
- Please.
- Merry Christmas.

1759
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,020
Please wrap up.

1760
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,700
Maybe I made a mistake.

1761
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,600
- I am nervous.
- If I fail again, I am done for.

1762
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,060
- It will be bad if I fail.
- In 2017,

1763
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,930
- I signed up...
- I hope I didn't make a mistake.

1764
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:27,310
for a car.

1765
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:28,540
Totally.

1766
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:30,250
- Please.
- Please let me succeed.

1767
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,470
- Please.
- Go up.

1768
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:32,680
- Go up.
- Let's go.

1769
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,310
- Tesla.
- Let's go.

1770
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:36,080
Please.

1771
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,410
Do you think it's Tesla?

1772
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:38,680
- Let's go.
- Please.

1773
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,720
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo invested
almost all in A IT.)

1774
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:40,950
- Please.
- Here we go.

1775
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:42,180
Maybe I should've invested
more money.

1776
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:43,290
(Jae Suk invested all money
in B IT secretly.)

1777
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:44,450
- Please. This is my last chance.
- Here we go.

1778
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:45,450
(Jisla is sure
about D Automobiles.)

1779
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,600
Please. I invested all I had in it.

1780
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:49,830
Suk Jin, I trust you.

1781
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,330
- It's okay. I made my own decision.
- Good.

1782
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,740
- The stock prices of 2018...
- So Min, I'm so nervous.

1783
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,830
- Please. I trust you, Jae Suk.
- Please go up again.

1784
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,870
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1785
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:01,270
- Let's go... What?
- Okay! 67 percent, So Min.

1786
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:03,470
(Stock Market of 2018)

1787
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:04,970
- Gosh.
- Ji Hyo.

1788
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:07,120
- I Media went up so much.
- C Automobiles went down again.

1789
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,020
- Ji Hyo, what do we do?
- Darn.

1790
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:11,390
Okay! 67 percent, So Min.

1791
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:12,850
(B IT: plus 67 percent)

59:57,929 --> 01:00:00,699
- I Media went up so much.
- C Automobiles went down again.

1792
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,750
- Let's go... What?
- Okay! 67 percent.

1793
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,160
(D Automobiles: minus 9 percent)

1794
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,390
- Darn it.
- My gosh.

1795
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:23,200
(D Automobiles that he assumed
to be Tesla fell.)

1796
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,500
- I Media went up so much.
- C Automobiles went down again.

1797
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,790
(D Automobiles: minus 9 percent)

1798
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:27,240
- Darn it.
- So Min.

1799
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,700
- Gosh.
- Ji Hyo.

1800
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:32,870
(A IT: minus 13 percent,
E Biotechnology: minus 50 percent)

1801
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,140
- It's okay.
- Sixty seven percent! Okay!

1802
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:36,580
- How did it happen?
- That's right!

1803
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:38,970
- That's right! Okay!
- I should've invested in I Media.

1804
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:40,120
In what company did you invest?

1805
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,990
Gosh, I should've invested
in I Media.

1806
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:44,450
So Min.

1807
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:46,120
I Media went up 100 percent.

1808
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,620
- It went up 67 percent. Okay.
- Great.

1809
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,120
I Media went up 100 percent?

1810
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,180
(Haha lost again.)

1811
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:51,680
- I didn't lose much.
- Good.

1812
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:54,020
I Media? I should've invested in it.

1813
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:55,060
(He made a profit
while the market was down.)

1814
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:56,120
Okay.

1815
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,470
The fluctuation is so big.

1816
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:02,330
- I'll help you out.
- You must've lost 50 percent.

1817
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:03,660
The stock market is down.

1818
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,930
Gosh, E Biotechnology.

1819
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,310
In what company did you invest?

1820
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:08,100
Mine didn't go up either.

1821
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:10,100
- Gosh, which one is it?
- You see...

1822
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,350
- Which one is Tesla?
- I should never invest in stocks.

1823
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:13,020
I realized that I should never
invest in stocks.

1824
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,020
Why? What's wrong?

1825
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,120
- I shouldn't...
- You pick a bad one.

1826
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,850
I keep choosing the company
whose shares dropped sharply.

1827
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:19,890
- All that I chose dropped.
- They all plummeted.

1828
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:21,310
(Song Ji Hyo: 638 dollars,
Cho Sae ho: 2,323 dollars)

1829
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,620
Gosh, I'm doomed. Darn it.

1830
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,490
(As E Biotechnology dropped
50 percent, he lost a lot.)

1831
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:27,620
I mean, I heard something about
President Trump. Why did it fall?

1832
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,720
(I mean, I heard something about
President Trump. Why did it fall?)

1833
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:32,470
Suk Jin, it said something about
President Trump. Why did it fall?

1834
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,870
It must've been bad news.

1835
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,370
But I can't...

1836
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:38,330
I can't give up on A IT. I'm sure...

1837
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,410
I heard from my friend
that it went back up.

1838
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,680
- Are you sure about it?
- Sorry?

1839
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:44,750
Are you sure about it now?

1840
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,850
- I think it's D Automobiles.
- What?

1841
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:48,520
This is our chance.

1842
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:50,910
- I only understood "Trump."
- Suk Jin.

1843
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:52,680
Let's go
and invest in D Automobiles.

1844
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,310
All right.
Let's go with D Automobiles.

1845
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:57,950
By the way, why did I Media
increase so much?

1846
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,750
My, everyone seems so serious.

1847
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,600
- Do you have a good feeling?
- That's it.

1848
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,060
I have D Automobiles now, right?

1849
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,160
I won't change anything.

1850
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,060
- Will you keep it as it is?
- Yes.

1851
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,330
I'll go all in on D Automobiles.

1852
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:10,930
I'll use all my money
to purchase the A IT stocks.

1853
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:14,200
- Suk Jin, I'll be here.
- Okay.

1854
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:15,950
Here we go. Please.

1855
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:17,870
Please.

1856
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,180
This is driving me nuts.

1857
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:20,540
- Let's go!
- Please.

1858
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,470
- All right.
- Please!

1859
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:24,350
The stock prices of 2019.

1860
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,750
Reveal the prices.

1861
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:26,950
(The stock prices of 2019 will be
revealed shortly.)

1862
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:28,810
Gosh. Darn it.

1863
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:30,680
What? Has it come out?

1864
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:33,020
What is it? Suk Jin.

1865
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:35,200
(A IT: plus 86 percent,
D Automobiles: minus 8 percent)

1866
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:37,120
- Has it come out?
- It's A IT.

1867
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,160
What is it? Suk Jin.

1868
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,220
(A IT: plus 86 percent)

1869
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:40,330
I should've invested in A IT.

1870
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,660
(A IT increased by 86 percent.)

1871
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,500
(D Automobiles: minus 8 percent)

1872
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,310
(D Automobiles's stock price
went down again.)

1873
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:50,950
What is it? Suk Jin.

1874
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:52,950
(Haha is too afraid
to check the price.)

1875
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:54,120
What did you purchase?

1876
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,080
Did you purchase A IT's stocks?

1877
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:59,910
(Cho Sae Ho's account balance:
4,306.5 dollars)

1878
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,560
Sae Ho, you're incredible.

1879
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:05,350
- It went up just as you said.
- Did he purchase A IT's stocks?

1880
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,750
A IT.

1881
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:07,830
I went all in on A IT.

1882
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:09,890
I told you it was going to go up.

1883
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,620
Suk Jin.

1884
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,060
(D Automobiles dropped
for 2 years in a row.)

1885
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,890
(He's swearing with his eyes.)

1886
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,430
I guess it's not Tesla.

1887
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:17,430
(I guess
D Automobiles is not Tesla.)

1888
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:19,540
This is good.

1889
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,470
I'm so excited!

1890
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:23,470
(The patient investor is on a roll.)

1891
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:26,810
- It must not be Tesla.
- And I...

1892
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,350
There's no way
that's Tesla's stock price.

1893
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:32,450
- It's never cost that much.
- Tesla...

1894
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:34,680
That makes no sense.

1895
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:36,720
- Jae Suk.
- I'm so excited!

1896
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,490
- I should've invested in A IT.
- Jae Suk.

1897
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,520
Shares of D Automobiles will go up.

1898
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,120
For two years in a row.

1899
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,330
It'll keep going up.

1900
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,970
(D Automobiles' stock price will
go up this year?)

1901
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:48,040
Can I sell my stocks?

1902
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:50,740
Gosh. I have to recover my loss.

1903
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:51,740
(Jae Suk is planning to get
reliable information.)

1904
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:55,470
D Automobiles.

1905
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:57,640
(He purchased
the level 3 information.)

1906
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:59,080
(COVID-19 raised the expectations
about eco-friendly cars.)

1907
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:02,020
(The stock price increased.)

1908
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:05,140
(The stock price increased
due to the rising expectations.)

1909
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,120
Tesla's stock price...

1910
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,410
didn't keep going up.

1911
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:11,850
The stock price of one of them will
skyrocket in 2019.

1912
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,620
We could make a huge profit
from investing in that company.

1913
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:18,000
- It's important to find it.
- We should find it.

1914
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:20,740
(Then is this year a good time
to purchase its stocks?)

1915
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,390
Thank you.

1916
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:26,370
- Gosh. Tesla must have...
- Well...

1917
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:27,870
I'd like to invest all my money
in D Automobiles.

1918
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,000
(Jae Suk decided to invest
in D Automobiles!)

1919
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,640
D Automobiles. Let's go with
something we can be sure about.

1920
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,870
(Jae Suk purchased
43 shares of D Automobiles.)

1921
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:33,120
I'll pull all out
and invest in D Automobiles.

1922
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,040
(Se Chan used all his money
to purchase D Automobiles' shares.)

1923
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,390
(He invested in D Automobiles
and suffered losses for 2 years.)

1924
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,520
All that I pulled out of went up?

1925
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:43,390
Haha, how much money do you have?

1926
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,450
Me? I'm dirt broke.

1927
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:49,470
I used all my coins.
I can't even get information.

1928
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:50,600
(He exchanged his points for cash.
He's broke now.)

1929
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,290
I should do something about it.

1930
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,560
- This won't work.
- I just have a feeling.

1931
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:56,970
Gosh. I'm so upset.

1932
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:58,660
This is ridiculous.

1933
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:00,870
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

1934
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:02,850
I think
you gave me false information.

1935
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:04,310
- D Automobiles.
- D Automobiles.

1936
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:05,950
- Two, four...
- Level one?

1937
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,520
"COVID-19 outbreak."

1938
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,540
(Level one information
on D Automobiles)

1939
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:10,750
What does "outbreak" mean?

1940
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:13,020
Break. Break out.

1941
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:14,220
(Level one information
on D Automobiles)

1942
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:15,350
Steak...

1943
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:16,720
Outbreak Steakhouse?

1944
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,720
- No.
- No.

1945
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:19,220
Oh, "outbreak?"

1946
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:21,020
(He must've lost his mind
as he lost his money.)

1947
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,830
- Who's the CEO?
- I mean...

1948
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:24,720
Maybe Tesla isn't one of them.

1949
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:27,560
I don't think it is.

1950
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,970
But this is...
What does this have to do with it?

1951
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:31,600
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

1952
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,770
Gosh, I'm so upset.

1953
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,580
Which one is Tesla?

1954
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,910
- Everyone is...
- When will Musk come out?

1955
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:41,640
Everyone is trying to find
Elon Musk.

1956
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:44,680
- Where on earth is Elon?
- Hey.

1957
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,580
- Where on earth is Elon?
- Hey.

1958
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:47,790
Hey.

1959
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,680
Mr. Choi.

1960
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:51,060
Mr. Choi.

1961
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,600
Is Tesla on the list or not?
Just tell me that.

1962
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,220
Come on.

1963
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:58,370
- Everyone is losing their mind.
- Where is Tesla?

1964
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:00,560
- Just tell me if it's on the list.
- Everyone...

1965
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,640
Everyone is talking about it.

1966
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:03,970
Hey, Hyo Im.

1967
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,740
Just tell me that.

1968
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,540
Is Tesla on the list or not?

1969
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:10,410
I don't think it's on the list.

1970
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:14,850
Won't IT stocks keep rising?

1971
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:16,810
- It's 2019.
- Yes.

1972
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,850
COVID-19 broke out in that year.

1973
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:23,720
- That's right.
- And that means...

1974
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,790
After the outbreak of COVID-19,
media stocks rose.

1975
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:30,390
(Hur Young Ji's account balance)

1976
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:31,620
I'll use all my money
to invest in I Media.

1977
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,000
(She went all in on I Media
hoping for a COVID-19 boost.)

1978
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:35,770
Everyone,
I will give you a good tip.

1979
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:39,060
At the end of 2019,
COVID-19 released.

1980
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:40,200
"Released?"

1981
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,540
Are you talking about an idol group?

1982
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,700
(The 19-member group Covid
released an album.)

1983
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,410
- Come on, Droducer Choi.
- "Droducer Choi?"

1984
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:49,020
- By the way...
- Why do I feel like I'm drunk?

1985
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,910
I feel like I'm drunk. Why...

1986
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:54,060
It must be Tesla
based on the information I got.

1987
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,450
(Where could Tesla be?)

1988
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:57,660
E Biotechnology.

1989
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,560
(Jong Kook came to get information
on E Biotechnology.)

1990
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,060
"COVID-19 outbreak."

1991
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,700
(COVID-19 outbreak)

1992
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,330
F Biotechnology.

1993
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:06,790
(He purchases information
on F Biotechnology as well.)

1994
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:08,290
Big news.

1995
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,430
"COVID-19 outbreak."

1996
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,660
Oh, okay.

1997
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,770
(Biotechnology companies
and COVID-19...)

1998
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:15,870
It's time...

1999
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:18,370
It's time to invest in Pfizer.

2000
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,120
(Jong Kook owns 18 shares
of D Automobiles.)

2001
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,950
I'll invest in E Biotechnology
and F Biotechnology equally.

2002
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:25,680
(He pulled out of D Automobiles
to buy the biotechnology stocks.)

2003
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:28,580
I'd like to... I'll go all in
on biotechnology stocks.

2004
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:30,220
- Biotechnology stocks?
- Yes.

2005
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:31,790
I'll purchase as many shares
of E Biotechnology as I can.

2006
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:34,700
(He went all in on E Biotechnology
once again.)

2007
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,390
I want to feel the joy.

2008
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:38,500
(I hope to feel the joy of getting
a 400-percent gain once again.)

2009
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,890
(C Automobiles)

2010
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:43,060
C Automobiles' stock price has never
increased until now.

2011
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,370
I think it will go up at least once.

2012
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:45,430
(So Min has invested
in C Automobiles for many years.)

2013
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:48,000
- I don't have any either.
- I don't know how much it'll go up.

2014
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,540
(Jae Suk feels bad for them,
and gives them a tip.)

2015
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:51,540
- What should we do?
- Right.

2016
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:53,370
- Go all in on D Automobiles.
- What?

2017
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:55,220
D Automobiles.
It's certain that it'll go up.

2018
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:56,640
I'm sure of it, but I don't know
how much it'll go up.

2019
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,490
Something else might go up more,
but we have no choice.

2020
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:01,790
(So Min made a profit
with Jae Suk's help last time.)

2021
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:03,020
Hey, Sae Ho.

2022
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:05,490
I'll pull out of C Automobiles
and invest in D Automobiles.

2023
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:07,560
(She changed her plan
and invested in D Automobiles.)

2024
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:08,930
Jong Kook.

2025
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:11,020
Do you think
Tesla is on the list or not?

2026
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,770
(Jisla, who's unsure,
asks for everyone's opinion.)

2027
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:13,830
It must be on it, right?

2028
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,200
- Yes, I think it is.
- But it doesn't make sense.

2029
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,830
Sir.

2030
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:19,310
- Mr. Ji.
- Yes?

2031
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:20,830
- Did you pull out of it?
- No.

2032
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,140
Right?
I'm too upset to pull out of it.

2033
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,080
I'm too upset to pull out of it too.

2034
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:26,470
Why...

2035
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,310
- There's no way it's not included.
- Wrap it up now.

2036
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:31,920
I'll pull out of B IT.

2037
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,990
(Haha seems to have
made a decision.)

2038
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:35,090
And...

2039
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:36,790
I'll use all my money
to invest in D Automobiles.

2040
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:39,460
I'll recover all my losses at once.

2041
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,220
I just...

2042
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,520
All I can see is the car company.

2043
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:46,760
It's my last chance.

2044
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:51,460
(He's invested in D Automobiles
for several years and lost a lot.)

2045
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,840
- I'll keep it as it is.
- Okay.

2046
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:55,130
I believe
that this company is Tesla.

2047
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:56,470
(Suk Jin owns 18 shares
of D Automobiles.)

2048
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:57,770
I can't think of anything else.

2049
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:59,710
I can't think of anything else.

2050
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:01,470
- I'm worried.
- Why?

2051
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:03,640
I'll go with Tesla alone.

2052
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,310
But it hasn't gone up yet.

2053
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:07,550
- Let's tear it again.
- Everyone.

2054
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:08,960
(Sae Ho invested in E Biotechnology
to hit the jackpot once again.)

2055
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,160
- Now...
- I hope I won't be in last place.

2056
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:13,850
Gosh. Wait.
I made the wrong decision.

2057
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,890
It was the year
of the COVID-19 outbreak.

2058
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,800
Gosh. This is driving me nuts.

2059
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:19,300
Please gather around.

2060
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,840
(Jae Suk, Se Chan, Suk Jin, and Haha
went all in on D Automobiles.)

2061
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:24,510
(December 30, 2019)

2062
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:26,740
(December 31, 2019)

2063
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:31,100
(The long-awaited 2020 has
finally begun.)

2064
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:37,490
(Everyone knows that 2020 was
the year of cataclysmic events.)

2065
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,590
A disease that started
in Wuhan, China...

2066
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:44,520
The number of new outbreaks
reached 90,000...

2067
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,830
Let's go.

2068
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:50,200
The stock prices of 2020
will be revealed.

2069
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,390
Musk.

2070
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:53,500
(The stock prices of 2020
are revealed.)

2071
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,760
Musk.

2072
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,840
(Screaming)

2073
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,870
So Min!

2074
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,800
(Stock Market of 2020)

2075
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,210
(D Automobiles,
F Biotechnology, I Media)

2076
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:04,970
(D Automobiles' stock price
rose by 1,100 percent.)

2077
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:07,270
So Min!

2078
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:10,290
(Haha's account balance:
5,940 dollars)

2079
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:11,590
(It's the big break
they have been waiting for!)

2080
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:13,380
It rose by 1,100 percent!

2081
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:15,990
So Min! It rose by 1,100 percent!

2082
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:17,990
So Min! We did it!

2083
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,960
Yes! We did it!

2084
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:24,500
(E Biotechnology)

2085
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,390
Thank goodness
I didn't buy a lot of stocks.

2086
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,840
I didn't buy a lot of stocks.

2087
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,840
(It's a small win compared
to the 1,100 percent increase,)

2088
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,040
- Big news!
- So Min!

2089
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,380
So Min!

2090
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,470
(Se Chan's balance is close
to 10,000 dollars.)

2091
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:40,270
So Min! It rose by 1,100 percent!

2092
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:42,920
It rose by 1,100 percent!

2093
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,590
(The earnings rate
of 1,100 percent is unbelievable.)

2094
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:47,590
- Yes! We did it!
- Tesla did it!

2095
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:49,120
I survived!

2096
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,830
- We did it!
- We did it!

2097
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:54,050
- We did it!
- Let's go!

2098
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,590
- We did it!
- Let's pick this up.

2099
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:57,700
- It rose by 1,100 percent!
- I earned 660 dollars.

2100
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,130
- That's incredible.
- Was it like that back then?

2101
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:02,500
- Seriously.
- Did it increase by 1,100 percent?

2102
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:03,910
- Money.
- How much do you have now?

2103
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:06,010
How much do you have now?

2104
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:07,740
My goodness.

2105
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,710
- Hey.
- Do you have over 10,000 now?

2106
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:13,380
I love it. I did it.

2107
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:17,950
I decided not to invest
in D Automobiles this time.

2108
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,180
How much do you have now?

2109
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,290
Do you have over 10,000 now?

2110
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:24,380
(Tesla investors' balance
increased by 11 times.)

2111
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,160
Life is all about
getting a big break.

2112
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,020
That's right.

2113
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:30,870
Is this the power of stocks?

2114
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,020
It rose by 901 percent.

2115
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,060
(Yoo Jae Suk's account balance:
28,380 dollars)

2116
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:35,430
(Jae Suk's balance is close
to 30,000 dollars.)

2117
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:36,560
Did it increase that much?

2118
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,930
Everyone, what did I tell you?

2119
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:43,380
I bought a car from that company.

2120
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,100
I know so much about it.

2121
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,270
You earned a lot of money, right?

2122
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:47,550
Yes. I have 6,000 dollars now.

2123
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:48,880
(Haha avoided going bankrupt.)

2124
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,380
Tesla was bound to be successful.

2125
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,380
I should have trusted in Tesla.

2126
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:53,960
(Jong Kook went from D Automobiles
to E Biotechnology.)

2127
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,880
I invested in it two times
and took out the money this time.

2128
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,380
The rankings
must have changed a lot.

2129
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,390
Suk Jin.

2130
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:02,720
I mean...

2131
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,390
It was going too slow.

2132
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:07,000
(Cho Biotechnology used to be
in 1st place.)

2133
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:10,300
I am too depressed today.

2134
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,240
I will pay 50 dollars
for the Choi Hong Man impression.

2135
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:14,840
Really?

2136
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:17,470
Hello, I am Choi Hong Man.

2137
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:18,880
- Okay.
- It's nice to meet you.

2138
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,450
- Okay.
- I am in your care.

2139
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,010
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

2140
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:24,290
E Biotechnology.

2141
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,310
Let's see some specialties.

2142
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:29,120
Do we have two rounds left?

2143
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,720
- Yes.
- It's so fun to invest in stocks.

2144
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,460
Why does Coca-Cola taste like
alcohol?

2145
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:39,300
We have two rounds left, right?

2146
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,630
The remaining rounds
will make a difference.

2147
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:44,760
Jae Suk, shall we invest
in D Automobiles again?

2148
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,740
Jae Suk, will the price rise again?

2149
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:48,510
It will rise again.

2150
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:50,380
It will rise again.

2151
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:51,880
But...

2152
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,010
there is biotechnology.

2153
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:56,140
Seriously.

2154
01:12:57,090 --> 01:12:59,250
Will it be biotechnology or...

2155
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,660
I will buy coins.

2156
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:01,660
(Will it be biotechnology
or D Automobiles?)

2157
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:07,850
One of those biotechnology companies
could be Pfizer.

2158
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,090
That's right.

2159
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:13,170
("Due to the COVID-19 Vaccines,
the Stock Prices Rise")

2160
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:14,340
(COVID-19 vaccines definitely made
the stock prices rise.)

2161
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:15,760
I will need to go with my hunch now.

2162
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,040
I didn't even think about Pfizer.

2163
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,770
- I will need to choose one.
- Time for diversified investments.

2164
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:23,600
Diversified investments.

2165
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,050
- Hi.
- Hello.

2166
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:26,380
(Jong Kook is interested
in investing in vaccine stocks.)

2167
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:27,510
How is it going, man?

2168
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:30,050
Top and bottom. F Biotechnology.

2169
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:33,790
Let's take a look.
Running News, 2021.

2170
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:36,590
President Biden says
90 percent of American adults...

2171
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:38,020
will be vaccinated.

2172
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:39,660
Okay.

2173
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:43,670
(Level one information
on F Biotechnology)

2174
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,520
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

2175
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,930
Thank you. No problem.

2176
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:48,540
(Jong Kook is certain that
F Biotechnology released vaccines.)

2177
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,560
I will invest all of my money
in F Biotechnology.

2178
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,540
You have 105 dollars left.

2179
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:55,170
(He eats carbohydrates
due to stress.)

2180
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:57,080
- Buy E Biotechnology stocks.
- E Biotechnology?

2181
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:59,470
Shall we buy information
on F Biotechnology?

2182
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:01,210
(Jae Suk and Se Chan are
also interested in F Biotechnology.)

2183
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:03,680
- F Biotechnology.
- Shall we do that?

2184
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:06,620
F Biotechnology.

2185
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:07,680
(He purchases level 3 information
on F Biotechnology.)

2186
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,920
F Biotechnology.

2187
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,790
(President Biden's announcement
about vaccinating Americans...)

2188
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:12,680
(makes the stock prices rise
for biotechnology companies.)

2189
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:15,130
(F Biotechnology's stock price
goes up.)

2190
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:16,550
I get it.

2191
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,920
Perhaps it's too early...

2192
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,800
We need to invest
all we have in F Biotechnology.

2193
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:22,890
Really?

2194
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:24,240
Instead,

2195
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,240
I will spread false information.

2196
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:29,710
I won't say anything
about F Biotechnology.

2197
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:33,210
People earned a lot of money,

2198
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:35,010
so don't say anything
about F Biotechnology.

2199
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,840
Wouldn't that be too dangerous?

2200
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,850
No. I will take care of it.
Just go on your way.

2201
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,380
I didn't hear anything.

2202
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:47,550
I will invest everything
in F Biotechnology.

2203
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:49,920
(Jae Suk invests everything
in F Biotechnology.)

2204
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,520
Use all I have
to buy the F Biotechnology stocks.

2205
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,200
- Okay.
- F Biotechnology.

2206
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,870
Don't let anyone see it.

2207
01:14:57,670 --> 01:14:58,840
Sae Ho.

2208
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:00,600
- You like designer brands, right?
- Yes.

2209
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:04,080
Then you should invest in fashion.
Invest some money.

2210
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,010
- It's the end of October.
- What should I invest in?

2211
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:08,210
(He spreads false information
in a careless manner.)

2212
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:10,710
- I will invest in biotechnology.
- Biotechnology.

2213
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:12,880
I will invest all I have
in E Biotechnology.

2214
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,010
(He insists on E Biotechnology.)

2215
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:18,330
Jae Suk, please give me
some information.

2216
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:19,880
(Ji Hyo bribes Jae Suk
for information.)

2217
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,130
Give me something.

2218
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:23,420
F Biotechnology.

2219
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,740
Will the stock price rise further?

2220
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:27,740
Yes.

2221
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:29,760
F Biotechnology.

2222
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:33,130
Black market dealings
are rampant here.

2223
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:35,340
- It's a mess.
- It's a mess.

2224
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:36,340
(These investors specialize
in black market dealings.)

2225
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,600
Mr. Ji.

2226
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,140
Diligent investments led to success.

2227
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:42,080
D Automobiles' stock price
will rise to four figures.

2228
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:45,450
(Suk Jin wants
to invest in D Automobiles again.)

2229
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:46,450
We have to go all in.

2230
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:47,710
- Now?
- Now.

2231
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,180
Will the price go up again?

2232
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:50,290
Again?

2233
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,490
I will wait outside. Close the door.

2234
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:53,520
Welcome.

2235
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,550
(Suk Jin enters
the Information Exchange.)

2236
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,330
- You don't have...
- Excuse me.

2237
01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:59,000
Please take good care of Mr. Ji.

2238
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,090
Please take good care of him.

2239
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:03,910
- Are you ready?
- Yes. I am a rich man.

2240
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:06,460
- Eleven times.
- A rich man?

2241
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:08,010
This time...

2242
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:11,010
is a very important time.

2243
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,340
What?

2244
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,640
- D Automobiles.
- Okay.

2245
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,310
Seven coins.

2246
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:18,050
(He purchases level 3 information
on D Automobiles.)

2247
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:19,990
Okay.

2248
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,460
"The skyrocketing stock prices
of D Automobiles..."

2249
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:24,130
"makes the investors warn
of the stock market bubble."

2250
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:25,720
"But a rush of private investors..."

2251
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:29,220
(Will the stock price rise again
for D Automobiles?)

2252
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:30,390
"makes the price go up further."

2253
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:33,800
(The stock price will rise again.)

2254
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,090
Is that good information?

2255
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,840
Yes. Good.

2256
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:38,800
(Meanwhile, Haha)

2257
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,630
Listen.

2258
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:42,710
This is how you invest in stocks.

2259
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:44,640
You earn and lose.

2260
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,840
(He makes a nonsense speech
about stocks.)

2261
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,510
You study the situation
in various ways...

2262
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:50,120
and aim for a big break.

2263
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,490
The price of the stocks I bought
rose by 1,100 percent.

2264
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:53,490
(The icon of big breaks, Haha)

2265
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:55,990
Suk Jin, how did it go?

2266
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:58,130
How was the information
that was worth seven coins?

2267
01:16:58,260 --> 01:16:59,350
Please wrap it up.

2268
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:01,130
- Seven coins.
- We should switch companies.

2269
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:02,460
- Really?
- We should switch companies.

2270
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:03,630
Seven coins.

2271
01:17:03,630 --> 01:17:06,130
(He betrays Haha right away.)

2272
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:07,460
Two rounds remain.

2273
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:09,370
The bubble will burst.

2274
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:10,370
(Suk Jin gives Haha
false information.)

2275
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:11,670
The bubble will burst.

2276
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,260
We should switch companies.

2277
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:15,670
- What should we invest in?
- That's the question.

2278
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:17,670
We have to invest everything.

2279
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,800
Shall we receive information
in English?

2280
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:22,250
- I will sell everything...
- I don't need it.

2281
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:24,340
- and invest in F Biotechnology.
- Stop talking nonsense.

2282
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,050
I will spend less money
on I Media...

2283
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:29,090
- Let's go!
- and all in E Biotechnology.

2284
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:32,160
- Hot dog.
- Please wrap up.

2285
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,920
(It's time to wrap up.)

2286
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:35,350
Haha.

2287
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:37,060
- What?
- What should I do?

2288
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,760
What is it? Suk Jin, come on.

2289
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,630
You are so mean.

2290
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:42,960
How could you betray me?

2291
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:44,870
How could you do this to me?

2292
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:47,880
- Shall we go together?
- Yes! How could you betray me?

2293
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,100
Looking at your face
made me feel guilty.

2294
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,410
How could you think to do
something like that?

2295
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:52,840
Will the price go up again?

2296
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:54,580
- Yes.
- Will the price go up again?

2297
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:55,810
Keep the stocks as they are.

2298
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:57,090
(He tells Haha the truth.)

2299
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:58,380
Why did you do that?

2300
01:17:58,510 --> 01:17:59,750
For a second,

2301
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,350
I wanted to fool you.

2302
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:02,760
(Laughing)

2303
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:05,160
But your face looked so innocent.

2304
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:08,520
I invested all of my money
in that company, right?

2305
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:10,460
- Yes.
- All right.

2306
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:16,170
This is the group of people
who earned money with Jisla.

2307
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,910
Merry Christmas.

2308
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:20,770
- Okay.
- Merry Christmas.

2309
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,340
Let me succeed once again.

2310
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:25,210
All right.

2311
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:26,640
Mr. Haha, do you trust me?

2312
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:28,120
Mr. Ji.

2313
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,580
(Suk Jin and Haha invested
in D Automobiles.)

2314
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:32,250
- E Biotechnology will rise too.
- This is driving me crazy.

2315
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:33,250
(Se Chan and Jae Suk are
big E Biotechnology shareholders.)

2316
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,510
- Biotechnology in general will.
- Here it comes.

2317
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:36,420
- Let's go.
- Here it comes.

2318
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,160
- All right.
- Let's go.

2319
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,380
Let me lie down in happiness.

2320
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:41,050
- Let's go.
- Here it comes.

2321
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:42,720
- Let's go.
- Here it comes.

2322
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:43,720
(How will the stock market be
in 2021?)

2323
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,130
- Please.
- Let's go.

2324
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:46,300
I am so nervous.

2325
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:51,370
The stock prices of 2021...

2326
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:52,800
will be revealed.

2327
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,170
(The stock prices of 2021
are revealed.)

2328
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:56,580
- It rose.
- Good.

2329
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:58,250
(Stock Market of 2021)

2330
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:01,770
(D Automobiles, E Biotechnology,
F Biotechnology)

2331
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:03,620
(F Biotechnology)

2332
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:06,590
(F Biotechnology's stock price
rose by 50 percent.)

2333
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:08,210
- Thank goodness.
- We did it.

2334
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,490
E Biotechnology.

2335
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:13,460
(D Automobiles' stock price
rose by 67 percent!)

2336
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,260
- Look at that.
- E Biotechnology.

2337
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:17,720
(And...)

2338
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,890
(E Biotechnology)

2339
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:22,870
(E Biotechnology betrayed him
again.)

2340
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:26,040
E Biotechnology!

2341
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,040
E Biotechnology.

2342
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,670
- No way.
- E Biotechnology.

2343
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:31,580
(He lost one-third of his asset.)

2344
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:36,050
Now comes one last year.

2345
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:37,840
- This is the last.
- Yes. It's the last.

2346
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,420
Gosh, this is what's important.

2347
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:41,680
You should predict
the stock prices of this year.

2348
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,990
- The stock prices of this year?
- Yes.

2349
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:45,590
- This year?
- This year?

2350
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,500
It's about this year.

2351
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:51,870
(The stocks on NYSE plunged with
concerns about economic stagnation.)

2352
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:53,800
(Due to the economic stagnation
and inflation shock,)

2353
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:58,010
(the world stock markets
have plummeted.)

2354
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:00,600
In the year 2022,

2355
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:02,880
with the end of COVID-19...

2356
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:07,420
With the end of COVID-19, the stocks
of fashion companies went up.

2357
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:09,580
It has gone up by 300 percent?

2358
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:10,590
(That makes it even harder to
predict the stock prices this year.)

2359
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:12,510
What's important is the last year.

2360
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:14,510
I have to take risks
if I want to win first place.

2361
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:18,920
How many of us will get a penalty?

2362
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:21,960
What's important is
not to get a penalty now.

2363
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:25,130
Jae Suk. If it includes this year,

2364
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:26,700
things are terrible for the media.

2365
01:20:26,830 --> 01:20:29,170
- And even the automobile companies.
- The stocks of Tesla fell a lot.

2366
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:32,430
How was it this year?

2367
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:35,270
It went down.
Tesla's stock price declined.

2368
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:36,270
I found a dime.

2369
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,210
This year must be the real trap.

2370
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:42,950
The year 2022 is really tricky.

2371
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:44,310
(They are trying to figure out
safe items in order to survive.)

2372
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:45,950
I bet it's J Airlines and G Fashion.

2373
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:48,260
I'm thinking of J Airlines too.

2374
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,490
Gosh, didn't he have a lot of money?

2375
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:54,220
How did it plummet like this?

2376
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,050
Whose account is this? Sae Ho?

2377
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:58,220
It does look like
you're in New York.

2378
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,090
This is Sae Ho's account.

2379
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:01,090
(Gobbling up the New York hotdog)

2380
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:03,200
- It looks like New York.
- There you go.

2381
01:21:03,710 --> 01:21:06,410
(The K-stockbroker has got
the wrong idea about the US.)

2382
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:07,930
I feel bad for him.

2383
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:09,040
(I feel bad for him.)

2384
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,050
(The stockholder of E Biotechnology
is worried sick.)

2385
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:13,410
Gosh, E Biotechnology.

2386
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,750
(The stockholder of E Biotechnology
is worried sick.)

2387
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:16,120
Gosh, E Biotechnology.

2388
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,950
Come on over

2389
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:20,620
(He greets Sae Ho
without knowing how he feels.)

2390
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:23,490
Oh, you look like
you just got run over by a bus.

2391
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:26,130
- Are you feeling okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

2392
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:27,420
What can I do for you?

2393
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,520
- Please show me E Biotechnology.
- Okay.

2394
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,020
(Please show me E Biotechnology.)

2395
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:33,330
Okay. This is E Biotechnology.
Quick. Read it.

2396
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:34,500
This one's your last lifeline.

2397
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,890
This is my last time.

2398
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,170
"Running News 2022."

2399
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:39,170
(He's still hung up
on E Biotechnology.)

2400
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:41,270
(Please...)

2401
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:44,710
"US Stock Exchange announces
CPI for this year."

2402
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:48,840
(US Stock Exchange announces
CPI for this year.)

2403
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,990
"The US Stock Exchange announces
CPI for this year."

2404
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:53,620
Good news?

2405
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:55,850
I don't know.

2406
01:21:56,990 --> 01:21:58,050
Please tell me.

2407
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:00,630
I know. I want to help you.
But I just don't know.

2408
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:02,520
I have no more money.

2409
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,500
I don't have any money either.
But I just don't know.

2410
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:08,590
- Okay. I have no coins.
- All right.

2411
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,590
Good.

2412
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:10,910
- His tie...
- E Biotechnology...

2413
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:13,540
- makes me cry and laugh.
- You...

2414
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:15,930
I'm back.
I'll invest in E Biotechnology.

2415
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:17,300
- All your money?
- Yes.

2416
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:19,910
- All of them.
- How much do you have?

2417
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:22,270
Sae Ho. How much is your seed money?

2418
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:23,510
I have about 2,000 dollars.

2419
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:24,590
- You have 2,000 dollars?
- Yes.

2420
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:26,810
I'll give you 100 dollars.
Will you polish my shoes?

2421
01:22:26,810 --> 01:22:27,850
(I'll give you 100 dollars.
Will you polish my shoes?)

2422
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,420
- Where?
- What? Look at him.

2423
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:31,660
Just give me your shoes.

2424
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,130
Give me. I'll do that.

2425
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:35,630
- I have no reason to say no.
- Okay.

2426
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:37,420
- How much can you give me?
- I said 100 dollars.

2427
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:39,130
Put it on here.

2428
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:41,040
(He starts polishing
Se Chan's shoes right away.)

2429
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,540
Polish mine too.

2430
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:43,540
(Throwing)

2431
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,130
(Working hard)

2432
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:47,130
Put it on here.

2433
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,840
Aren't you the one who succeeded
with E Biotechnology?

2434
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,380
- Sae Ho.
- Hello.

2435
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:52,410
Hello. Please have a seat.

2436
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:53,810
- I'm fine.
- Please sit.

2437
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:54,810
I'll do it later.

2438
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:55,840
- Put it on here.
- Do you have coins?

2439
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,590
I don't have coins or anything.

2440
01:22:58,210 --> 01:23:01,590
All I have is this piece
of newspaper. Put it on here.

2441
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:03,010
- I'm sorry.
- Put your foot on here.

2442
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:04,380
- I'm busy.
- Sir.

2443
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,520
He had like tens
of thousands of dollars.

2444
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,680
I don't want to have
my shoes polished.

2445
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,420
- Pay me at least ten dollars.
- My gosh.

2446
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:11,020
Thank you.

2447
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,090
- Here.
- All right. E Biotechnology.

2448
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:14,870
E Biotechnology.

2449
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,430
Sae Ho keeps saying
E Biotechnology the whole time.

2450
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:19,840
With E Biotechnology, at first...

2451
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,080
I know. You made 400 percent.

2452
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,950
I made 400 percent.
So I can't give up on it.

2453
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:25,510
I bet E Biotechnology will rise.

2454
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:27,580
You don't have much time left.
Make sure to use your coins.

2455
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:29,620
- Okay. I'll go use up my coins.
- How many do you have, Young Ji?

2456
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:31,420
Hang on. I need to take a risk.

2457
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,140
What's the most promising item?

2458
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:35,490
H Sports.

2459
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:37,490
(Mr. Ji checks the investment items
for the last time.)

2460
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:39,220
C Automobiles is still cheap.

2461
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,850
(C Automobiles is still cheap.)

2462
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,020
I should go with the tide.
I'll go with C Automobiles.

2463
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:44,370
The only thing.

2464
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:46,000
It's been growing recently.

2465
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
(He's interested in C Automobiles
that shows a recent growth.)

2466
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,500
I should jump onto a running horse.

2467
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:54,340
And I should avoid
grabbing a knife that's falling.

2468
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:56,170
I will withdraw all my money
from Tesla.

2469
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:58,580
I'll withdraw all of them.

2470
01:23:58,770 --> 01:24:01,620
I'll go all-in here.
This is the final battle.

2471
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:02,970
(He's in 2nd place now,
so he takes a risk to be the 1st.)

2472
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:04,840
I should take the road not taken.

2473
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:06,920
I'll go with C Automobiles.

2474
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,050
- Go all-in?
- I'll go all-in. I have to.

2475
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:10,420
C Automobiles.

2476
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,160
(He chooses C Automobiles
only with his gut feelings.)

2477
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,160
(Yoo Jae Suk's
account balance: 42,570)

2478
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:15,700
The stock market in 2022...

2479
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:18,760
is not so promising.

2480
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,370
So I need to manage the money well.

2481
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:24,430
The IT... I have no idea
What B IT is.

2482
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:25,430
(B IT catches his eye.)

2483
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:26,430
(B IT: minus 16 percent)

2484
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:28,510
I have no time. B IT.

2485
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:29,630
Hang on.

2486
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:31,600
B IT.

2487
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:34,310
"Elon Musk rises..."

2488
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:36,380
- "as its major shareholder..."
- "Elon Musk rises as..."

2489
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:39,140
"buying stake in B IT."

2490
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:41,620
(Elon Musk rises as its major
shareholder buying stake in B IT.)

2491
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,210
(Thinking carefully)

2492
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:44,850
What is a shareholder?

2493
01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:46,220
(Elon Musk rises as its major
shareholder buying stake in B IT.)

2494
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:47,330
Twitter!

2495
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:48,520
(Twitter!)

2496
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,060
(Twitter's stock price went up when
Musk became its major shareholder.)

2497
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,590
- B IT.
- All of them?

2498
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:53,630
Yes.

2499
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:55,340
(He invests all his money in B IT.)

2500
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:58,240
I think... Gosh, I figured out
what it is at the last moment.

2501
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,510
B IT. I'll buy 100 stocks.

2502
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:01,670
- A hundred?
- Yes.

2503
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:03,630
- J Airlines.
- Okay.

2504
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:05,140
About 100 stocks.

2505
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:08,080
I'll divide it in half
and put the half in J Airlines.

2506
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:10,170
Put 50 percent in B IT,
30 percent in J Airlines,

2507
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:11,990
- and 20 percent in G Fashion.
- Okay.

2508
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:14,010
- You can keep 50 dollars.
- Okay.

2509
01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:16,010
Thank you for taking care of this.

2510
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:18,830
I'll see you in Korea
after I succeed.

2511
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:20,130
I'm running a risk.

2512
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:22,920
What if the stock price plummets?

2513
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,020
- I don't know.
- Seriously,

2514
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:26,370
I used my coins
to get this information.

2515
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,200
Close my account.

2516
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,130
I don't know.
I risk my life for this.

2517
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:33,560
- We don't know it.
- I'll go all-in.

2518
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:34,930
Please wrap things up now.

2519
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:37,010
- This is the last day.
- Don't blame me.

2520
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,250
Are you going to...

2521
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:41,310
I don't invest in stocks,
so I have no idea.

2522
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:42,310
(Jong Kook has no information, so
he hasn't made his investment yet.)

2523
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:44,640
- I'll invest in Apple.
- We don't know it yet.

2524
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:46,510
I'll invest in Apple. A IT.

2525
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:48,760
Half in A IT and
the other half in F Biotechnology.

2526
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:49,990
A IT and F Biotechnology.

2527
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:51,420
One more in F Biotechnology.

2528
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,160
- F Biotechnology?
- Yes.

2529
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:56,000
Please gather around.
I'll announce the final prices.

2530
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,760
- Okay.
- It's the 29th.

2531
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,830
- The 29th?
- Finally.

2532
01:25:58,830 --> 01:25:59,920
- It's the new year.
- Oh, no.

2533
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,340
- Let's go.
- This is driving me crazy.

2534
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:02,540
(It's time to announce
the stock prices of this year.)

2535
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:03,590
E Biotechnology!

2536
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:05,240
Let's go.
I jumped on a running horse.

2537
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,240
(Suk Jin and Jae Suk made risky
investments at the last minute.)

2538
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,430
- I jumped on a running horse.
- Let's go.

2539
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:08,970
- All right.
- That's C Automobiles.

2540
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:10,300
It's this year.

2541
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:12,640
This will determine the rankings.

2542
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:14,120
(Yoo Jae Suk's account balance)

2543
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:16,510
(Jae Suk's B IT?)

2544
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:20,010
(Suk Jin's C Automobiles?)

2545
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:25,160
(Or Sae Ho's E Biotechnology
that he's kept with perseverance?)

2546
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:29,700
(Who will be the winner to laugh?)

2547
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:30,870
Please show us.

2548
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:32,590
(The stock prices of this year
are revealed.)

2549
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:33,890
(The stock prices are
being adjusted.)

2550
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:35,340
(Stock Market of 2022)

2551
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:37,430
(B IT: plus 22 percent,
C Automobiles: plus 100 percent)

2552
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:39,540
(E Biotechnology: minus 45 percent)

2553
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:40,880
- It went up!
- I did it.

2554
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,630
- It's 100 percent!
- J Airlines...

2555
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,380
- It's 100 percent!
- It's 22 percent.

2556
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:45,470
Good.

2557
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,050
- It's 22 percent!
- My goodness.

2558
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:50,620
(Jae Suk's B IT
went up by 22 percent.)

2559
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:51,680
It's 22 percent!

2560
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:53,620
(Three items went up
in this plummetting market.)

2561
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:55,160
(Jong Kook's A IT also went up
by 29 percent.)

2562
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:56,310
They all went down.

2563
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:57,720
B IT and C Automobiles. Okay!

2564
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,020
- E Biotechnology.
- E Biotechnology!

2565
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:01,330
(E Biotechnology: minus 45 percent)

2566
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:03,420
(Passing out)

2567
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:04,800
- My goodness.
- Okay.

2568
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:05,800
(E Biotechnology: minus 45 percent)

2569
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,500
(The end of Sae Ho's
E Biotechnology)

2570
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,500
(He experienced paradise
and fiery pit with E Biotechnology.)

2571
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,500
I think I'm the winner.

2572
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:11,600
I got none of them.

2573
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,600
(E Biotechnology: minus 45 percent,
F Biotechnology: minus 67 percent)

2574
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,800
(The girls in the lower ranks went
down with the biotechnology stocks.)

2575
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,910
- It all went down.
- Thank you.

2576
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:16,770
- Biotechnology.
- Thank you.

2577
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:19,300
I made 10,000 dollars
at the last moment.

2578
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,140
- Thank you.
- Show us the results.

2579
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:22,210
Let's check your rankings.

2580
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:24,140
- I'm so nervous.
- I finally see the light.

2581
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:25,510
It went up at the last minute.

2582
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:26,550
I'm doomed.

2583
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:27,760
I went all-in on C Automobiles.

2584
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,510
I might win first place.

2585
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:31,520
(I might win first place.)

2586
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:33,830
- All right.
- Everyone.

2587
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,260
- The results are in.
- Okay.

2588
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:36,260
Is it interesting?

2589
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:37,420
- All right.
- Is there a twist?

2590
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:38,720
Young Ji, come over here.

2591
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,330
- Did the rankings change?
- The first place.

2592
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:41,500
- Okay.
- Jae Suk.

2593
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,800
(Who is the 1st place,
the master of stock investment?)

2594
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,800
I bet it's Suk Jin.

2595
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:47,970
He made 51,820 dollars.

2596
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:50,910
(He made 51,820 dollars
only with 500 dollars.)

2597
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:52,010
It's Yoo Jae Suk.

2598
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:53,600
(Yoo Jae Suk is the 1st place.)

2599
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,120
I couldn't beat him.

2600
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,580
- The second place.
- Congratulations.

2601
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:58,990
Ji Suk Jin who made
39,600 dollars.

2602
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:01,010
I knew it.

2603
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:03,160
- At the last minute...
- That was so close.

2604
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:07,330
The 3rd place is Yang Se Chan
who made 15,840 dollars.

2605
01:28:07,330 --> 01:28:09,590
(3rd place, Yang Se Chan
with 15,840 dollars)

2606
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:11,720
- Yes!
- The fourth place is...

2607
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,260
Haha who made 12,650 dollars.

2608
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:15,260
(The 4th place is Haha.)

2609
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:17,130
- You had only 200 dollars.
- I came from behind.

2610
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:18,260
- How did you do that?
- I was the last.

2611
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:19,340
From 200 to 12,000 dollars.

2612
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:21,130
I made a comeback using my coins.

2613
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:22,430
The fifth place is Jeon So Min.

2614
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:23,740
Gosh, So Min.

2615
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:25,510
- So Min, that's so cool.
- So Min, well done.

2616
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:27,250
The sixth place is Kim Jong Kook.

2617
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:28,750
- Yes.
- All right.

2618
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:31,120
Now we have
the 7th, 8th, and 9th places.

2619
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,310
(Now there are three people
in the lower ranks.)

2620
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:34,590
- I'm doomed.
- The seventh place is...

2621
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:36,990
Hur Young Ji with 2,204 dollars.

2622
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:39,850
Wait. What's with
the biotechnology guy?

2623
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:42,020
(Anxious)

2624
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:44,760
Isn't he the biotechnology guy?

2625
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:47,000
E Biotechnology.

2626
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,700
Wasn't he the first place
in the middle of the race?

2627
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:49,870
- He was doing really well.
- All right.

2628
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:53,370
Ji Hyo and Sae Ho are
the 8th and 9th places.

2629
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:55,170
Please. I don't want to be the last.

2630
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:56,340
The last is...

2631
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:03,360
(Who will be the last
to get the penalty today?)

2632
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:04,900
Cho Sae Ho.

2633
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,770
- Sae Ho.
- Ji Hyo, you survived.

2634
01:29:06,770 --> 01:29:08,070
(Cho Sae Ho is the last.)

2635
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:09,070
(The biotechnology guy ends up
getting the penalty.)

2636
01:29:09,070 --> 01:29:10,530
- Ji Hyo, you survived.
- She survived.

2637
01:29:10,610 --> 01:29:12,360
- E Biotechnology!
- You survived.

2638
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:14,730
- I survived!
- You survived.

2639
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:16,440
(Ji Hyo survived
at the last minute.)

2640
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:18,350
- My gosh.
- She survived.

2641
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:19,700
(Joy and sorrow)

2642
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:21,370
E Biotechnology.

2643
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:23,370
Today's prize...

2644
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:26,410
Since this is about the US stocks,
we prepared something about the US.

2645
01:29:26,610 --> 01:29:28,860
The first place wins
the high-quality American beef,

2646
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:30,760
- the Black Angus beef set.
- My gosh.

2647
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,120
And the LA ribs.

2648
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,690
The second place gets
only the LA ribs.

2649
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:37,120
(The two investment geniuses
get the beef sets.)

2650
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,400
- And today's penalty...
- What is it?

2651
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,400
(Today's penalty is announced.)

2652
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,770
For being ignorant
of the US stock market,

2653
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:45,810
you will write a letter
of apology in English.

2654
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:47,200
Oh, no.

2655
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,980
(Writing a letter of apology
in English)

2656
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:51,010
Oh, no.

2657
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:52,370
- That's the worst.
- In English?

2658
01:29:52,370 --> 01:29:53,510
- What?
- He needs a translator.

2659
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:55,610
But Sae Ho needs to leave now.

2660
01:29:55,610 --> 01:29:58,190
So I want you to take a video
of you writing it down...

2661
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:00,220
and send it to me.

2662
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:01,410
Sae Ho has aged suddenly.

2663
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:03,280
- A letter of apology in English?
- Sae Ho.

2664
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:05,530
Your face has got all wrinkly.

2665
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:07,100
- He's got a lot of wrinkles.
- A letter of apology in English?

2666
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:08,690
I can't even write it in Korean.

2667
01:30:08,690 --> 01:30:09,990
In cursive letters.

2668
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,270
I'd like to apologize...

2669
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:18,360
to those who supported me and
my family for disappointing them.

2670
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:20,940
"The letter of apology. Reflection."

2671
01:30:21,370 --> 01:30:22,640
"Cho Sae Ho."

2672
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:24,400
"I'm sorry, everybody."

2673
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,850
"I feel bad for everyone."

2674
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,910
"It was my mistake."

2675
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:29,040
"My mistake."

2676
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,020
"I think it was so easy."

2677
01:30:31,610 --> 01:30:33,860
"I thought it would be easy."

2678
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:35,610
"But it wasn't."

2679
01:30:35,690 --> 01:30:37,120
"But it wasn't like that."

2680
01:30:37,730 --> 01:30:39,120
"Then I failed."

2681
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,790
"So I failed."

2682
01:30:41,190 --> 01:30:42,260
"So..."

2683
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:43,820
"I hate myself."

2684
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:44,900
"I hate myself."

2685
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,100
"Please give me one more chance."

2686
01:30:47,230 --> 01:30:48,570
"Please give me one more chance."

2687
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:50,730
"I will do my best next time."

2688
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:53,070
"I will do my best next time."

2689
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,870
"I want to go to Running Man."

2690
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,650
"I want to go to Running Man."

2691
01:30:58,180 --> 01:31:01,220
"I'm really sorry, everybody.
One more time."

2692
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:04,390
"Again, I'm really sorry
to everyone."

2693
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:06,040
(Sae Ho's bad day is over
with his lame English.)
