1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,860
(June, 2022)

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,970
(SBS Variety Center moved
to Sangam-dong.)

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,030
(The new home of SBS variety shows
including Running Man)

4
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,270
(Nice lounges for friendly talks)

5
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,080
(Editing rooms with
the cutting-edge equipment)

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,540
(This is where SBS variety shows
will improve further.)

7
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,650
(On the 15th floor,)

8
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,190
(at the end of the long hallway,)

9
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,850
(there's the new office
of Running Man.)

10
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,490
(And two days before the shoot...)

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,460
(The producer is calling someone.)

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,880
- Hey, Bo Pil.
- Hello, Mr. Ji Suk Jin.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,550
- What?
- Mr. Ji Suk Jin.

14
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,050
- Why are you being like this?
- This is Running Man.

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,120
- Are you filming now?
- Yes.

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,490
(Laughing)

17
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,990
Then I should change my voice
for the TV show.

18
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,180
Bo Pil, I'm done.

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,650
Hello, Mr. Yoo Jae Suk.

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,980
- What?
- This is Running Man.

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,930
What is going on?

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,790
The standby
of our shoot on Monday...

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,170
will be between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.

24
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,230
Between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.?

25
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,510
You can come anytime
within the time.

26
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,710
From 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.? There's
a big difference between the two.

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,480
Is it my choice?

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,570
Yes. It's up to you.
You can come anytime you want.

29
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,210
This is like the Game of Wits.

30
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,450
Anytime within the three hours?

31
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,450
- Yes. You can come anytime.
- Which is better?

32
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,290
Going early or late?
Can you give me a tip?

33
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,430
Is it better to go fast or late?

34
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,820
Gosh, which is better?
Please tell me.

35
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,600
Why are you giving me
such a hard time?

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,020
Do you want me to think
of Running Man all day?

37
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,790
If it's between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.,
that means 8 a.m..

38
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,730
No. You can come anytime you want.

39
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,680
That doesn't make sense.
You say it's from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m..

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,070
My goodness.

41
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,480
- Between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.?
- Yes.

42
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,770
- And I can go anytime I want?
- Yes.

43
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,680
- I see.
- You can do as you like.

44
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,920
It's your choice.

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,290
You don't have to worry about me.

46
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,290
(He just accepts the situation
as it is.)

47
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,580
And our office moved to Sangam-dong.

48
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,160
Jae Suk, you love Running Man.

49
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,550
- What?
- I know you love it.

50
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,570
(What?)

51
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,100
Well... Yes. I guess.

52
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,630
With your love for our show,

53
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,800
I'd like you to bring a small gift
for our new office.

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,540
(Laughing)

55
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,540
- You can bring one gift each.
- Okay.

56
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,280
It'd be nice
if it doesn't exceed 100 dollars.

57
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,950
The price...

58
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,540
Can't I just offer my heart?

59
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,110
I'd like you to express your heart
with something physical.

60
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,550
Of course.

61
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,320
Then I'll see you on Monday.

62
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,660
Hang on.

63
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,920
What time does the shoot begin?

64
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,500
Did you talk to the other members?

65
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,290
I really want to talk
to someone on the phone.

66
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,200
My phone...

67
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,890
Our writer, Hyo Im
will give you a call.

68
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,440
What time should I get there?

69
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,540
I have a call coming in.
I have to go now.

70
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,100
Who is it? Wait. Tell me who it is.

71
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,170
I'm serious.

72
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:17,070
(The first morning in Sangam-dong
finally draws on.)

73
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,660
(The members can come anytime
they want between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.)

74
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,580
Hello.

75
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,950
(Hello.)

76
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,700
(Se Chan arrives at the lobby
at around 8 a.m.)

77
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,730
Does it begin right away?

78
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,390
Se Chan, you arrived here at 8:01 a.m.

79
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,170
- I'll put the microphone on you.
- Okay.

80
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,470
- Am I going up?
- Yes. Tag the card and go up.

81
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,730
It's Running Man's office
on the 15th floor.

82
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,280
On the 15th floor? Okay.

83
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,480
I want to try tagging the card.

84
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,640
(I want to try tagging the card.)

85
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,420
I'm the first one to arrive.

86
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,880
(He's on the 15th floor
where the office is.)

87
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,540
Is this it?

88
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,350
My gosh. That's me.

89
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,790
(He finds the photo of him
as soon as he enters.)

90
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,500
Hello. Where is it? Here?

91
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,200
This place is really nice.

92
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,000
My gosh. Why is it so good?

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,670
(The country boy is impressed
by the modern facilities.)

94
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,800
(Surprised)

95
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,910
(Amazed)

96
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,540
(Fascinated)

97
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,950
(My goodness...)

98
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,540
Look at this. It looks amazing.

99
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,580
(The country boy is on a field trip
to the broadcast station.)

100
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,590
Is this it?

101
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,590
(Is this it?)

102
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,790
Hello. Is this it?

103
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,660
Gosh, this is really nice.

104
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,960
This place is great.
Why is it so nice?

105
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,620
Is this really Running Man's office?

106
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,270
Gosh, it has a great view.

107
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,900
The view relieves all my stress.

108
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,100
(It looks over
the panoramic view of Seoul.)

109
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,930
This place is so pleasant.

110
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,910
It's really nice.

111
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,170
This is why you can come up
with such fun ideas.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,980
Seriously, you can come up
with fun ideas in a place like this.

113
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,650
You can't do that in a small room.
I know it because I have meetings.

114
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,350
You just can't. You need
a pleasant place like this.

115
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,750
Is it a good thing
that I arrived early?

116
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,960
I'll explain later.

117
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,460
I bet it's a good thing.
That's nice.

118
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,250
There was no traffic jam
on my way here.

119
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,100
There was no traffic jam.

120
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,360
The size of my gift...
I guess they will explain later.

121
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,540
I tried to get you something useful
that others won't bring.

122
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,060
It's a gift with good taste.

123
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,980
You can cook frozen food in this.

124
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,540
Like frozen dumplings.

125
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,370
It's not sponsorships.
I bought it myself.

126
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,650
We gave you the same model
as a prize before.

127
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,440
No. That's not true.

128
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,020
- I'm serious.
- No, Bo Pil.

129
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,220
We gave you the same thing.

130
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,090
No. I think I gave it
to someone else.

131
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,230
Seriously, I bought this myself.

132
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,590
I can show you the receipt.
I don't want you to doubt me.

133
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,460
(While the firstcomer is busy
giving an explanation...)

134
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,600
(The second one shows up at 8:07 a.m.)

135
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,210
What? Hello.

136
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,210
(Jae Suk arrives at 8:07 a.m.)

137
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,770
So this is the new office.

138
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,300
(He's the kind of person who
arrives early at a time like this.)

139
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,170
- My gosh.
- Hey.

140
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,350
Jae Suk.

141
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,580
My goodness.

142
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,670
- You're here.
- Hey. What?

143
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,610
- Did you bring an electric cooker?
- No.

144
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,090
It's an air fryer.

145
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,720
- What?
- An air fryer.

146
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
An air purifier?

147
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,810
I brought an air purifier.

148
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,720
Hang on. This costs
more than 100 dollars.

149
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,730
Of course it does.

150
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,920
No, you can't...

151
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,420
Then I would've brought
something more expensive.

152
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,550
Hey.

153
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,120
I was told it should
cost less than 100 dollars.

154
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,190
So I bought something
that costs 80 dollars.

155
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,290
This is a big conference room.

156
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,190
A model that costs 100 dollars
would be too small for this.

157
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,060
But that's the rule.

158
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,000
- It can't be helped.
- Thank you, Jae Suk.

159
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,500
What? You're welcome.

160
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,350
What's going on? I was just...

161
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,240
This is Samsung.

162
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,980
- This is a good one.
- It's Samsung.

163
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,940
You two must be curious
about the gathering time.

164
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,090
- Sure.
- There must be something.

165
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,310
- We came early, right?
- Yes. We should get a benefit.

166
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,660
So I will tell you...

167
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,350
what we are doing today.

168
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,790
Good. You should tell us.

169
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,790
- You two came really early today.
- Yes.

170
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,060
Today, the time you come to work...

171
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,290
will decide the time
you get off work.

172
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,700
It's called
I’ll Get Off Work First Race.

173
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,100
What's that?

174
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,140
Just like an ordinary office worker,

175
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,140
you will get off work
after working for eight hours.

176
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,230
- Eight hours?
- Yes.

177
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,910
Seriously?

178
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,800
- But...
- Yes?

179
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,910
(But...)

180
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,510
It's not like first come,
first served.

181
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,510
Why not?

182
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,150
It's only fair that the first one
to come leaves first.

183
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,040
Se Chan who came here first...

184
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,720
- arrived at 8:01 a.m.
- Right.

185
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,180
- After 8 hours, it will be 4:01 p.m.
- Right.

186
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,760
At 4:01 p.m.,
one of you will get off work.

187
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,590
And at the average time
of the five members,

188
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,900
five of you will get off work.

189
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,830
Lastly, eight hours after the time
the last one shows up,

190
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,600
one of you will get off work.

191
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,770
(If the last one shows up at 11 a.m.,
one of them will leave at 7 p.m.)

192
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,270
(That means, the time they
get off work is decided randomly.)

193
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,910
That's not fair.

194
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,170
The law says we should work
eight hours a day.

195
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,850
Thanks to you two, the first
and average times are moved up.

196
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,110
It will be the worst
if I become the last one to leave.

197
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,820
- If I leave after four...
- You were the first one to arrive,

198
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,720
but you might be
the last one to leave.

199
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,720
If the last one to arrive...

200
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,090
leaves at four,
that person is really lucky.

201
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,480
- That's right.
- Yes.

202
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,120
What about this gift?

203
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,470
We will open the gifts together
and use them well.

204
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,160
Is it just a gift?

205
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,570
My goodness.

206
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,730
I thought...

207
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,730
we would at least use the boxes...

208
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,430
to play a game or something.

209
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,800
So we don't have
any privileges here today.

210
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,840
No.

211
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,650
- What's this?
- What nonsense is this?

212
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,240
Why are we doing this?

213
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,110
I didn't tell you to come early.

214
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,650
- What's with him?
- Your voice sounds...

215
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,110
Why do you sound so upset?

216
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,390
This is ridiculous.

217
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,480
It's better to come early anyway.

218
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
If we come late,
the average increases.

219
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
You're right.

220
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,330
My goodness.

221
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,960
I can't believe this.

222
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,600
- Hey, Jae Suk.
- Suk Jin.

223
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,340
- Se Chan and I are here already.
- Suk Jin.

224
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
- Where?
- At the broadcasting station.

225
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,940
- Okay.
- You have to come right away.

226
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,470
- You're the only one who's late.
- Where are you?

227
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,370
Don't lie to me.

228
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,350
Those who come early get a benefit.

229
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,580
If you come late,
you will get off work late.

230
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,510
- You're in trouble.
- Don't you dare lie to me.

231
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,010
- It's true.
- We're serious.

232
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,290
I was told to come by 11 a.m.

233
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,480
Just hurry and come.

234
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,150
- They just said that.
- They just said that.

235
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,020
Hey, I can't fly over there.
What am I supposed to do?

236
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,600
You should take today off then.

237
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,020
- You don't sound well.
- I didn't...

238
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,260
tell you to come flying.

239
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,260
Why would you say such a thing?

240
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,100
Hey, it's not like
I broke my promise.

241
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,360
- I just didn't go early...
- Why are you yelling?

242
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,810
- Early in the morning...
- Why are you yelling at us?

243
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,470
- If you come early...
- You're ridiculous.

244
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,470
Why are you yelling?

245
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,580
Do you really think
I'll believe what you say? Hey.

246
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,810
(He hung up.)

247
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,850
Let's call...

248
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,010
(He just hangs up on Suk Jin
with no hesitance.)

249
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,220
Call someone else.

250
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,290
Why is he...

251
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,190
Why do you keep calling me?

252
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,920
- Jae Suk.
- What?

253
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,750
I was talking, but why...

254
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,090
(I was talking, but why...)

255
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,890
Gosh, Suk Jin.

256
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm in a hurry now.

257
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,830
You take your time.
I should call Haha now.

258
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,470
This is really nice.

259
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,130
It's pretty.

260
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,000
It's so pretty.

261
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,760
Running Man.

262
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,810
Don't walk, but run. Running Man!

263
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,680
What? A plant...

264
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,920
- So Bal.
- What?

265
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,720
Gosh, a plant?

266
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,510
Congratulations.

267
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,140
Congrats on your new office.

268
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,320
But this is...

269
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,220
- They don't seem to like it though.
- Why not?

270
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,020
It will wither away.

271
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,850
They should grow it well.

272
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,060
You can look at it
when you have a meeting.

273
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,930
So Min, you just gave
the youngest staff...

274
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,700
- another work.
- They should water it.

275
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,570
- No.
- That's a lot of work.

276
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,390
"This is the source
of inexhaustible ideas."

277
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,970
"From Jeon So Min
who loves Running Man."

278
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,080
(She even prepared a card.)

279
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,040
- Did you prepare the card?
- Of course.

280
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,640
It blocks the camera.
Put it down here.

281
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,310
- Why?
- Just put it down.

282
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,770
- It does block the camera.
- We can't do this.

283
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,350
- It's blocking Jae Suk's face.
- Why?

284
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,450
So Min, put it down.

285
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,610
But it's pretty.

286
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,880
Hey, how much did it cost?

287
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,190
This is expensive.

288
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,220
- It has a few flowers.
- All right then.

289
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,960
- Should we eat some hangover soup?
- I'd love that.

290
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,700
- Do you want to eat here?
- Yes.

291
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,330
We have nothing else to do here.

292
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,860
It will be funny if we are
eating some hangover soup...

293
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,200
- when Suk Jin comes in.
- Let's eat seolleongtang.

294
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,700
We should order only three servings
and eat them.

295
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,260
Then Suk Jin would
want to eat it too.

296
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,500
(They will order only a few servings
to tease Suk Jin.)

297
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,100
- We want some hangover soup.
- He's the youngest one here.

298
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,470
Yes. Order only three servings.

299
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,740
- I want seolleongtang.
- Or seolleongtang.

300
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,610
There's a seolleongtang place
near here.

301
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,110
- Make it 4.
- Order 4 servings.

302
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,240
Order four servings
of Naju bone soup.

303
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,250
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

304
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,790
We should order only four.
And when Suk Jin shows up,

305
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,980
I'll say, "See? I told you
to come early."

306
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,290
(See? I told you to come early.)

307
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,330
All right?

308
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,220
- You have plans.
- Of course I do.

309
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,220
You've been planning
the whole thing.

310
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,100
- Of course I have.
- You are unbelievable.

311
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,040
That's your plan.

312
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,200
(All he thinks of is
how to tease others.)

313
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,670
Those who come late can't eat it.

314
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,270
I just can't wait. I hope
Suk Jin will come soon.

315
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,580
And the Naju bone soup.

316
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,440
- This place is really nice.
- That's a great plan.

317
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,400
(Ji Hyo shows up at 8:50 a.m.)

318
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,550
This is really nice.

319
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,510
- I can see Mount Nam.
- She's here.

320
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,820
- There's Mount Nam.
- She's here.

321
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,320
- Ji Hyo, come on in.
- What did you buy?

322
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,460
Did you buy alcohol?

323
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,610
No, I just...

324
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,790
What's with her?

325
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,960
Ji Hyo.

326
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,560
- Is that alcohol?
- It's a gift for the new office.

327
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,600
The thing is...

328
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,150
- What is this?
- While they work...

329
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,200
I bought it in different sizes.

330
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,800
- This is really good.
- Did you buy beer? Seriously?

331
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,600
They can drink it when they are
stressed out while working.

332
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,900
- I bought it myself.
- Did you buy it with your money?

333
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,500
The first four to come
will get to eat Naju bone soup.

334
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,550
- What about the rest?
- That's a great plan.

335
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,640
- Hang on.
- They have it here.

336
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,320
This is Ga Eun's seat.

337
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,510
This is so clean and nice.

338
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,820
Ga Eun has a lot of pencils in here.

339
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,960
- This is amazing. Look at this.
- So Min.

340
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,220
They have a lot of R money in here.

341
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,460
- Let's take some.
- We should take it.

342
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,480
(They found R money in the cabinet.)

343
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,830
- Hey.
- They have a lot of R money here.

344
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,700
- You should keep them.
- Keep these?

345
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,890
- Ten money each for early people.
- That's amazing.

346
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,040
(Master of mischief's second plan)

347
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,100
Your plan...

348
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,000
- Come here.
- I want this.

349
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,500
- This is really nice.
- With those R money...

350
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,770
This is fun.

351
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,440
- Here.
- Should we keep ten money?

352
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,850
They wouldn't believe it
if we had too many.

353
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,970
When should we take these out?

354
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,350
Suddenly...

355
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,370
You should pay
for the Naju bone soup with this.

356
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,240
After we order it?

357
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,510
(R money has become
the official currency.)

358
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,010
When Jong Kook sees this,
he will be like,

359
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,060
"It's all right. I don't care."

360
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,930
"I don't mind becoming the last."

361
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,930
- He's no fun.
- Congratulations.

362
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,170
- You startled me.
- What's this?

363
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,470
Congratulations.

364
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,600
- You startled me.
- What's this?

365
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,070
(Haha shows up at 9:11 a.m.)

366
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,860
- Hey.
- Why are you so late?

367
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,100
- I'm not late.
- We already have flowers.

368
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,210
- Haha.
- Yes?

369
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,540
This isn't a graduation ceremony.
What is all this?

370
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,580
Are you at a graduation ceremony?

371
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,870
- Hey.
- Why did you bring flowers?

372
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,050
Is Dream going to school?

373
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,740
- This looks nice.
- Congratulations.

374
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,380
Congratulations.

375
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,510
- Haha.
- You should put it here.

376
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,220
This is for Bo Pil.

377
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,610
I prepared this for you.

378
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,690
- Why are you flattering him?
- If you look closely,

379
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,020
you'll find something precious.

380
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,720
- Hey.
- Okay.

381
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,960
Hey.

382
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,830
Please have a seat.

383
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,930
- Sit.
- My goodness.

384
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,860
This place is really nice.

385
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,600
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Did you see the view?

386
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,840
- This is amazing.
- It has a great view.

387
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,630
We have something to celebrate.

388
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,730
(Do they have good news?)

389
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,870
So Min and Ji Hyo
shot a commercial together.

390
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,240
(Ji Hyo and So Min did
an ointment commercial together.)

391
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,310
Hey, you...

392
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,110
(The wound witches)

393
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,610
(They found a new job
as the wound witches.)

394
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,250
Hey, they took your job.

395
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,790
(The former wound fairy)

396
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,120
A lot of people asked me
if I was okay with it.

397
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,020
So I said...

398
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,930
- So Min, you should do this.
- So...

399
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,670
- We are the wound witches.
- We are the wound witches.

400
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,970
- I was the wound fairy!
- You will get better.

401
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,800
- This is not fair.
- Were you the wound fairy?

402
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,940
Yes. Se Hyeong and I were fairies.
And they are witches.

403
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,360
- We are witches.
- We are witches.

404
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,040
When I saw their commercial,

405
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,180
I was like, "That's mine."

406
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,600
(I was like, "That's mine.")

407
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
I did the same thing at home.

408
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,950
Jong Kook is calling me.

409
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,690
Hey, Jong Kook.

410
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,010
Why did you call me
so early in the morning?

411
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,850
- Where are you?
- I guess he's home.

412
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,880
Where do you think? I'm on my way.

413
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,690
- Hey.
- No!

414
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,220
You have to hurry and come.

415
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,760
Who would want
to go to work so early?

416
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,100
This isn't about whether
you want it or not.

417
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,390
It's first come, first served.

418
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,810
The last one to come
will get the penalty. Hurry.

419
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,840
- Really?
- Yes.

420
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,210
I kind of expected that, but...

421
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,340
- Yes.
- Well...

422
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,810
The penalty won't kill me, you know.

423
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,140
- I knew it.
- My gosh.

424
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,270
It's not funny at all.

425
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,110
- He's the worst.
- He said...

426
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,720
- exactly what you said he would.
- Right? I told you so.

427
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,790
He said it nicely
because he's in a good mood.

428
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,880
I'll go as soon as I can.

429
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,720
- I'm hanging up. Gosh.
- Okay.

430
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,790
Gosh.

431
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,490
- Seriously, he irritates me.
- I know, right?

432
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,330
He's just so annoying. Gosh, him.

433
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,390
All we can do is talk badly of him
behind his back.

434
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,810
You should've come a little earlier.
We ordered food.

435
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,810
What did you order?

436
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,000
- Beef bone soup.
- Naju bone soup.

437
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,210
You can order more for me now.

438
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,710
- Only four can have it.
- We can't.

439
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,370
- It's the benefit for the top four.
- Don't lie to me.

440
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,580
- It's true.
- I'm not lying.

441
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,820
It's true. There was a time limit
for ordering food.

442
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,980
- That's right.
- Stop annoying me.

443
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,220
- You should've come earlier.
- You chose to come late.

444
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,110
I came...
I mean, I followed the rule.

445
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,430
I'm sure
this is the rule that you made.

446
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,720
- Why would I make a fake rule?
- No.

447
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,800
- Haha.
- Our staff members are right here.

448
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,150
- Our food is here.
- It's here.

449
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,100
- Okay.
- Hello.

450
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,200
- Thank you.
- I'm excited.

451
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,800
- Okay.
- Good.

452
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,990
- I think you can have coffee.
- Haha.

453
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,400
- Haha, move over.
- You can have coffee.

454
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,630
- So that we can start eating.
- Move aside.

455
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,100
You were lying.
There's enough food for all of us.

456
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,580
- No, we have four servings.
- No, there isn't.

457
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,310
- Just move over there.
- Are you sure?

458
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,350
Yes.

459
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,970
For real?

460
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,320
- Yes.
- Yes, just as we told you.

461
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,140
- Give me four R money.
- Okay.

462
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,880
- Give me four R money.
- Four R money.

463
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
(He's starting to get confused.)

464
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,010
- You should've come earlier.
- It's a lie, right?

465
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,060
I'll order food too.

466
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,290
You can only pay with R money.

467
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,960
- You gave me three R money.
- Just a second.

468
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,100
(They're acting like
they have to pay for the food.)

469
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,460
(Is this for real?)

470
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,520
Okay.

471
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,100
Here are 16 R money,
4 R money from each.

472
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,310
You can't order food
if you don't have R money.

473
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,310
(Confused)

474
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,680
- All right. Let's enjoy it.
- Let's eat.

475
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,210
It looks so good.

476
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,580
I opened them all.

477
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,640
- Did you?
- Yes.

478
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,140
- But I... Are you serious?
- Yes.

479
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,110
I brought my old bag.

480
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,450
What are you talking about?

481
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,480
I'm serious.
I guess there were R money...

482
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
- in the new bag.
- Give it to me.

483
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,650
- The fact that he thought...
- Young Jin.

484
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,090
Check inside the new bag I received.
See if there's R money in there.

485
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,150
(We got him.)

486
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,700
I brought my old bag.

487
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,330
- Why didn't he trust us?
- No, the new one.

488
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,970
- I mean, why...
- I heard there was R money in it.

489
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,840
- We received R money in the office.
- They gave us the money here.

490
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,730
- We paid for the food with R money.
- Aren't there any R money in it?

491
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,000
(Aren't there any R money in it?)

492
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,310
There's only one mask in it?

493
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,980
(That's so sad.)

494
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,080
What's his problem?

495
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,850
Don't you have any R money
set aside?

496
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,910
Let's eat.

497
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,320
- Good.
- Let's eat. Is it good, Jae Suk?

498
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,490
- My, it's good.
- It's so good.

499
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,110
(It tastes even better
as they're fooling Haha.)

500
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,560
This is so good.

501
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,650
Haha, your phone is buzzing.

502
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,230
(Haha's stylist is
calling him back.)

503
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,330
Yes, Young Jin.

504
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,830
Haha, I just heard you shouldn't
use the old bag.

505
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,420
And there's no R money
in the new bag.

506
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,160
He's fussing around
because of R money.

507
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,860
Do you want the props
that you used before?

508
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,660
I see a few.
One of them says "fifty cents."

509
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,740
(I see a few.
One of them says "fifty cents.")

510
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,400
No, but put it somewhere safe.

511
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,750
- Okay.
- I'll text you.

512
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,210
- He and his staff are the same.
- Okay.

513
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,210
That's funny.

514
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,820
- Hey, when will Suk Jin come?
- Suk Jin?

515
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,850
- I hope he'll come shortly.
- I want him to come now.

516
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,520
I shouldn't finish my food
until he comes in.

517
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,210
- Exactly. When will he come?
- He's coming up now.

518
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,410
- Is he?
- Yes.

519
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,620
Then wait. I'm going to
put it in my mouth when he comes in.

520
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,090
(Then wait. I'm going to put it
in my mouth when he comes in.)

521
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,950
My gosh. He's just unbelievable.

522
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,620
- He even had it calculated too.
- The moment he walks in...

523
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,070
- He knows Suk Jin too well.
- I'll put it in my mouth.

524
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,770
- And he...
- Of course.

525
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,600
(Right then)

526
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Please come here
and put on a mic first.

527
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,870
- A mic?
- Yes.

528
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Suk Jin, you came in at 10:02 a.m.

529
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Yes.

530
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,520
They're going to make a fuss
over me coming later than they did.

531
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,210
(Jae Suk is on standby
with a big spoonful of food.)

532
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,880
Where is it?

533
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,110
(Meanwhile, Seok Sam arrived
on the 15th floor.)

534
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,650
Which way? That way?

535
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,650
I've never come up
on the 15th floor before.

536
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,390
Right. And you put it all
in your mouth.

537
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,100
Yes.
Then he'll probably be surprised.

538
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,070
- You went passed it.
- Sorry?

539
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,690
- You went passed it.
- Did I?

540
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,930
Where on earth is it?

541
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,570
- My gosh.
- What about the show?

542
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,460
- It got cold already.
- Just eat it, Jae Suk.

543
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,080
- Just eat it.
- No.

544
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,630
I'll wait until Suk Jin comes.

545
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,440
Here? Oh, this is it.

546
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,050
(Finally, he found the office
after a long detour.)

547
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,880
My gosh. I walked passed it.

548
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,640
What's going on?

549
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,260
Hey.

550
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,350
(What's going on?)

551
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,850
(Jae Suk's wish finally came true.)

552
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,120
What are you guys doing?

553
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,660
Gosh, seriously.

554
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,040
- Suk Jin.
- Yes? Why?

555
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,190
- Suk Jin.
- Why?

556
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,070
- Did you have breakfast?
- What are you doing?

557
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,200
- Did you have breakfast?
- I had some bread on my way here.

558
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,130
Hey, why don't you say hi?
You're gobbling down the food...

559
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,900
- with your head down.
- What's wrong with that?

560
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,080
What did you say?

561
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,350
Gosh, seriously.

562
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,850
- It's so good.
- What is so good?

563
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,440
Only the first four people
can have it.

564
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,550
But... What?

565
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,490
- Why...
- Suk Jin.

566
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,380
- Yes?
- Hurry up and find R money.

567
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,230
- You need R money.
- I'm not lying.

568
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,450
- Suk Jin, he's not lying. Look.
- I'm not lying.

569
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,950
- I'll show you.
- Look.

570
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,190
- That's a lie.
- You should find R money.

571
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,570
- Stop lying.
- I'm telling you the truth.

572
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,390
As if.
There's no way I didn't fall for it.

573
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,100
- What was that?
- What? That means you fell for it.

574
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,700
(There's no way
I didn't fall for it.)

575
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,200
- That means you fell for it.
- "There's no way you didn't?"

576
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,940
- You fell for it.
- That means you fell for it.

577
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,810
"There's no way
I didn't fall for it."

578
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,410
(His way of speaking transcends
time and space.)

579
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,980
- That was so funny.
- My gosh.

580
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,380
He must've come from the future.

581
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,350
"There's no way
I didn't fall for it."

582
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,790
The man from the future,
Ji Seok Sam.

583
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,290
Suk Jin is a time traveler.

584
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,350
(Seok Sam's time flows backward.)

585
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,950
- By the way, this is so tasty.
- Indeed.

586
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,350
- Does it taste that good?
- It's so refreshing.

587
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,070
It must be a famous restaurant
in Sangam-dong.

588
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,630
- Did you have breakfast?
- I'm having it right now.

589
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,040
What's wrong with him?

590
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,980
He asked me if I had breakfast
while watching me eat.

591
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,510
Did he come from the future or what?

592
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,640
Why did he ask me
if I had breakfast?

593
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,280
- What kind of question is that?
- I apologize for that question.

594
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,780
I just said it without thinking.

595
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,520
- There's no way he didn't.
- "There's no way I didn't say so."

596
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,850
(There's no way I didn't say sorry.)

597
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,090
Hey, why hasn't Jong Kook come yet?

598
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,150
(While the time traveler is trying
to pull himself together...)

599
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,120
(The lobby is empty.)

600
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,190
(The elevator stops.)

601
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,690
(Jong Kook came in at 10:43 a.m.)

602
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

603
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,270
My gosh.

604
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,240
- You're here.
- Why...

605
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,100
- Why didn't you come earlier?
- Why did you all come so early?

606
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,170
- You're empty-handed.
- Didn't you bring any gifts?

607
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,780
I did.
I brought a cafe gift certificate.

608
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,850
- You can put it here, Jong Kook.
- Where?

609
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,280
- Oh, I see.
- A gift certificate?

610
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,870
- He bought a gift certificate.
- That's nice.

611
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,380
Before we begin,
could you tell us...

612
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,320
- about your gifts?
- Okay.

613
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,150
- Sure.
- All right.

614
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,760
This is... Isn't it pretty?

615
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,060
I bought this
because it looked so nice.

616
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,350
- It's pretty.
- I like the color.

617
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,850
- You can open it like this.
- Suk Jin, it's so pretty.

618
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,960
- Isn't it pretty?
- It looks sophisticated.

619
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,330
- Yes, it's nice.
- A trash bin? That's a nice gift.

620
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,840
It's really nice.

621
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,340
- This morning...
- What is that?

622
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,010
It's an air purifier.

623
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,130
An air purifier?

624
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,170
- Isn't it expensive?
- To make sure to bring this,

625
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,870
I put this box in front of my room.
And Ji Ho got up early this morning.

626
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,210
- He opened it, right?
- I saw him opening the box.

627
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,140
I usually don't yell at him,
but I was so surprised.

628
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,290
"Hey!"

629
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,880
Ji Ho got startled.

630
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,210
(Ji Ho was taken aback.)

631
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,620
- You put it there.
- "Don't open that box."

632
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,450
"I'm going to take the box with me
when I leave home."

633
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,530
- He asked why I yelled at him.
- He must've been scared.

634
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,760
I said, "It wasn't like that."

635
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,070
(He shared a cute incident
that happened this morning.)

636
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,630
- I'm sorry, Ji Ho. Sorry, my son.
- Ji Ho...

637
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,860
- Ji Ho must've been startled.
- Yes, he was.

638
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,540
- He must've been startled.
- Yes, he was.

639
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,600
My, the air is so fresh now.

640
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,580
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

641
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,580
- I'll explain about the rules now.
- Okay.

642
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,370
Do you know what the term
"flexible working hours" means?

643
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,380
- Yes, I know.
- Pardon?

644
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,940
- No. Is it normal these days?
- "Flexible working hours."

645
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,140
- I don't know what it is.
- So...

646
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,990
- You can decide when to work.
- It means you can come in anytime,

647
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,290
- Really?
- work your daily work hours,

648
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,060
- and get off work.
- That sounds so reasonable.

649
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,120
That's so great.

650
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,620
- Can they come in really late?
- Yes.

651
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,000
- If they work the full shift.
- That's so nice.

652
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,420
- Night owls come in and leave late.
- Exactly.

653
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,540
That's so nice.

654
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,960
We're going to adopt this system
for today's shoot.

655
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,270
- You chose the time to come.
- Yes.

656
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,200
And you will stay for eight hours...

657
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,370
starting at the time
of your arrival.

658
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,200
But it's not that person
who actually goes home.

659
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,580
- What?
- That is...

660
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,280
- Gosh.
- Come on.

661
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,410
- I don't like this.
- Se Chan arrived at 8 a.m...

662
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,180
- That's right.
- Then someone goes home at 4 p.m.

663
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,710
- One of us will leave at 4 p.m.
- One of us can go home.

664
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,620
One person will leave at 4 p.m.

665
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,590
Five people will leave
at the average arrival time...

666
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,560
of the 5 members
from the 2nd to the 6th to arrive.

667
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,530
Lastly, eight hours
after the last person's arrival...

668
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,960
- It'll be 7 p.m.
- Yes.

669
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,120
One person will leave at that hour.

670
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,500
And we'll choose
the people to leave randomly.

671
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,810
- Got it.
- Also,

672
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,360
there will be group missions...

673
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,040
where you can shorten
the total hours to stay.

674
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,200
We can shorten the total hours?

675
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,010
- Let's do that.
- Let's do that.

676
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,370
(They're full of enthusiasm.)

677
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,370
Of course, we'll shorten it.

678
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,870
- Let's pull it off!
- This is fun!

679
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,020
We're good at group missions.

680
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,940
- Indeed. We're good at it.
- If you succeed,

681
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,490
you all can leave four hours earlier
than you're scheduled, for example.

682
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,990
- That's great.
- Hold on.

683
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,790
Since we were all getting excited,
I was going to let it go.

684
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,380
But Suk Jin said, "This is fun."

685
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,060
- I'm motivated, and it sounds fun.
- We haven't even started yet.

686
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,600
- What's fun about this?
- It sounds fun.

687
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,420
- Bo Pil hasn't told us about it.
- This is fun.

688
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,270
You see, he already saw
what happens in the future.

689
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,770
- He's a time traveler.
- Is he a time traveler?

690
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,630
- There's no way it's not funny.
- Is he a time traveler?

691
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,480
- Will this episode be funny?
- Very much so.

692
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,640
- Are you sure?
- It's insane.

693
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,010
- Will it be okay?
- It's insane?

694
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,820
- Will you be very funny?
- Well, I won't be good enough.

695
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,640
- But Ji Hyo will stand out today.
- Ji Hyo will?

696
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,850
- Really?
- Yes.

697
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,110
He saw the future.

698
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,410
- Ji Hyo.
- That's unexpected.

699
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,610
What did you do yesterday?

700
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,710
- What did you do yesterday?
- I stayed at home.

701
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,330
You're really getting
your money's worth with your home.

702
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,060
- You see, I...
- She makes the most out of it.

703
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,350
- I think she needs a larger place.
- She makes the most out of it.

704
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,420
Now, we'll bring in the board
with the getting off time on it...

705
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,160
and a clock.

706
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,160
The member to get off early can
leave at 4:01 p.m.

707
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,310
The members to get off on time can
leave at 5:04 p.m.

708
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,240
The member to get off late can
leave later than 6 p.m.

709
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,580
- That's the worst.
- That's too much.

710
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,870
- Hey, the group missions...
- I really don't want to work late.

711
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,850
- The last one leaves at 6:43 p.m.
- I hope I won't work late.

712
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,870
- The traffic is bad at that hour.
- Leaving on time is the best.

713
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,380
- What are the group games?
- I'll explain to you now.

714
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,590
Okay.

715
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,210
- Why are they empty?
- What is this?

716
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,380
- What is this?
- It's the map of the 15th floor.

717
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,530
The first mission...

718
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:43,260
that requires the ability to observe
and good memory is...

719
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,920
The Map
of the Variety Show Department.

720
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
- Where are we in the map?
- So Min, we saw it earlier.

721
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,270
- Try to remember the places,
- Oh, we're here.

722
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,270
and fill in the map
of the variety show department.

723
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,160
(The variety show headquarters
on the 15th floor of the building)

724
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,280
(Conference Room)

725
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,430
(The layout of the floor is
complex.)

726
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,370
(Program Office, "Master in the House")

727
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,080
(And more than 30 offices gathered
on the 15th floor.)

728
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,170
(Director's Office)

729
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,170
(Conference Room)

730
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,980
(On top of the complex layout,
many offices gathered on the floor.)

731
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,210
(Management Team)

732
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,410
(Every member looked around
when they entered.)

733
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,850
There it is. The room
for brushing teeth. My goodness.

734
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,530
Oh, my.
There's a room for brushing teeth.

735
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,530
(They looked around the floor
during the break as well.)

736
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,330
(And they even saw the map
at the entrance too.)

737
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,000
- Try to remember the places...
- Oh, we're here.

738
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,930
(How much could they remember?)

739
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,270
We'll let one of you go out...

740
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,100
to take a quick look around.
You'll have two chances.

741
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,630
If you fill in every blank
on the map correctly,

742
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,200
you'll cut your finishing hours
by 90 minutes.

743
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,170
For each wrong or blank answer,

744
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,910
you'll lose 10 minutes
from the total 90-minute reduction.

745
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,090
- We must fill in all the blanks.
- That is,

746
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,210
if you get 1 answer wrong,
you get an 80-minute reduction.

747
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,350
If you get 2 answers wrong,
you get a 70-minute reduction.

748
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,850
You will play pop-up pirate
to earn the time...

749
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,730
for the representative to go out
and look around.

750
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,920
I know four of them.

751
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,190
- I know a few too.
- I remember it clearly.

752
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,430
There's a restroom next to this.

753
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,430
- The teeth brushing room.
- Fill in as many as you can.

754
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,570
This one is
the chief director's office.

755
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,200
- Write it down.
- We must be precise.

756
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,930
- This is the restroom.
- Haha is right about this one.

757
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,280
There's a teeth brushing room too.

758
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,480
- And...
- Give me that.

759
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,280
- This is...
- Is this "Sleepover Club?"

760
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
I don't know. I saw it from afar...

761
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,580
- I saw "new variety show."
- Let me have a look.

762
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,640
- A match-making show.
- This is a phone booth.

763
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,110
- That one is a conference room.
- No, the phone booth was here.

764
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,680
- This one is the phone booth.
- This is... Hold on.

765
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,420
- A conference room and "CP 5."
- Right? Yes.

766
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,730
- This one is a conference room.
- I think that's right.

767
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,760
I didn't see the other side
when I arrived.

768
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,330
- Me neither.
- "Inkigayo" and...

769
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,190
- That one...
- No, it was here.

770
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,770
- It was here.
- Was it?

771
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,690
I think we need to send someone out.

772
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,300
- Hey.
- I think we should do that.

773
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,630
Here. You will play pop-up pirate.

774
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,170
For each sword you stick in
without making the pirate pop up,

775
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,200
- you will earn ten seconds.
- I see.

776
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,870
- If you stick in seven... Yes.
- Without making it pop up.

777
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,510
If you stick in 7 swords,
you get 70 seconds.

778
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,370
If you stick in 8 swords,
you get 80 seconds.

779
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,850
The more swords you stick in,
the longer you can look around.

780
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,750
- We get ten seconds for each.
- Okay. Let's do this.

781
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,950
Let's do this.

782
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,990
(The game begins.)

783
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,790
- Please don't pop up.
- Okay.

784
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,920
You earned ten seconds.

785
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,190
- Twenty seconds.
- Okay.

786
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,830
- Okay.
- Thirty seconds.

787
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,340
We need at least 3 or 4 minutes.

788
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,860
That's good.

789
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,070
- It won't pop up.
- Ten seconds is too short.

790
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,310
Go ahead.

791
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,960
- Okay.
- Good job.

792
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,870
- How much time do we have now?
- We have 50 seconds.

793
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,370
It's okay. That's long enough.

794
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,310
- Don't worry. We have enough time.
- No.

795
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,980
- We have enough time.
- Yes, we do.

796
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,980
- Nice!
- Sixty seconds.

797
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,440
- Sixty seconds is quite long.
- Let's try one more time.

798
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,520
Right. One minute is...

799
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,440
- Okay.
- One minute is...

800
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,560
(They obtained 70 seconds!)

801
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
Seventy seconds.

802
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,290
On which side do we have
more blanks? The right side?

803
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,560
Turn left when you go out.

804
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,620
- Okay!
- And go straight.

805
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,830
- Are we still in?
- To your left.

806
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,920
- Hey, this is...
- I think that's the bad one.

807
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,000
- What?
- Right.

808
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,360
- How much time do we have?
- Eighty seconds.

809
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,770
- Eighty seconds?
- It's okay.

810
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,660
Now, I'm going to choose
the member to go out...

811
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,460
- Your names are written on them.
- What?

812
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,900
- You'll pick one randomly?
- Your names are...

813
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,100
(The representative will be
chosen randomly.)

814
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,480
- You'll pick one randomly?
- That's not fair.

815
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,780
- Anyone but Suk Jin.
- I hope it's not me.

816
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,480
- This isn't fair.
- I hope it's not me.

817
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,640
(Anxious)

818
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,440
The first member to go out is
Jae Suk.

819
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,880
(Jae Suk has been chosen
as the representative.)

820
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,350
- It's okay. Don't worry.
- You can do this.

821
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,950
- It won't be hard.
- I'm not observant.

822
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,060
- It's okay.
- He's...

823
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,560
- really not observant.
- What's this? Is there a room here?

824
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,830
- Show me.
- Oh, you have to go around.

825
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,950
- I'm not observant at all.
- The chief director's office...

826
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,620
The teeth brushing room is
next to the empty office.

827
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,160
- And here...
- Check the teeth brushing room.

828
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,770
- Next to the teeth brushing room...
- You should check these.

829
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,960
- Check this one.
- Check just this side...

830
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,930
The three offices
next to the teeth brushing room.

831
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,160
We'll start timing
once you walk out the door.

832
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,810
- Got it.
- Three offices, Jae Suk.

833
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:17,840
- I should go this way, right?
- Three offices.

834
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,870
- Yes.
- Yes, that way.

835
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,580
- Good.
- Ready. Get set. Go.

836
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,580
(The countdown begins.)

837
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,640
You don't have to run.

838
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,210
"Guardians of the Ecosystem."

839
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,820
"New Match-making Show."

840
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,180
A conference room.

841
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,650
A conference room.

842
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,210
A conference room.

843
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,560
The teeth brushing room.

844
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,420
"My Little Old Boy."

845
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,600
"CP 3."

846
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,300
"DNA Singers."

847
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,690
"Golf Battle: Birdie Buddies."

848
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,360
"Invitation from Bachelor-agains."

849
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,690
Time's up.

850
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,960
"Invitation from Bachelor-agains."

851
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,660
"Guardians of the Ecosystem",
the new program.

852
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,370
- What?
- The new program.

853
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,430
- No, it's on this side.
- No.

854
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,780
- That side.
- Right?

855
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,980
- "Guardians of the Ecosystem."
- "Guardians of the Ecosystem."

856
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,200
The new match-making show.

857
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,350
- Where?
- Here?

858
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,670
No, it's right next to this one.

859
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,550
- "Guardians of the Ecosystem?"
- Then...

860
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,940
"Guardians of the Ecosystem" is
here, and this is the new show.

861
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,020
- This one is...
- This one is Running Man.

862
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,060
- Yes, that's right.
- Really?

863
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,590
- That's right.
- Are you sure?

864
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,180
- Running Man.
- "Guardians of the Ecosystem."

865
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,650
- It's "Guardians of the Ecosystem."
- The new show is here.

866
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,920
"My Little Old Boy" is here.

867
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,620
- Oh, here?
- "My Little Old Boy" is here.

868
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,850
- I see.
- And...

869
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,190
this one is...

870
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,890
"DNA Singers."

871
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,540
- Okay.
- Next...

872
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,340
"Golf Battle: Birdie Buddies."

873
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,070
- "Golf Battle: Birdie Buddies."
- "Golf Battle: Birdie Buddies."

874
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,840
And this one is "CP 3."

875
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,480
And this one is "CP 4."

876
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,400
- It must be "CP 5."
- That's... What was it?

877
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,080
- Come on.
- "Invitation from Bachelor-agains."

878
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,170
- "Invitation from Bachelor-agains."
- And...

879
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,180
that one is a conference room.
These two are conference rooms.

880
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,650
- A conference room.
- You checked so many of them.

881
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,110
- You did a great job.
- We can go to the other side.

882
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,060
- You did a great job.
- Right?

883
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,090
- We filled in many blanks.
- It's a conference room.

884
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,620
Jae Suk, you have a good memory.

885
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,420
- We have blanks here too.
- Right.

886
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,330
- This time, we should turn right.
- To the right.

887
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,770
- We can't check all of them.
- It might work out.

888
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,800
- Right. You checked so many.
- Look at this.

889
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,190
This is how good I am.

890
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,770
- You did a great job.
- That's easy. You had 80 seconds.

891
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,200
You had 80 seconds.

892
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,080
- That's 1 minute and 20 seconds.
- We got lucky in terms of that too.

893
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,780
I focused on this side.

894
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,550
You should've memorized all of them.

895
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,940
Now, you have one last chance
to send a representative out.

896
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,210
Now, I'll choose the last member
to go out.

897
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,210
(They're about to pull it off,
and have one last chance to go out.)

898
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,910
Oh, man. I'm too nervous to do this.

899
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,060
- Hey.
- Don't be like that. You can do it.

900
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,350
Six swords would be enough.

901
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,710
- That's a lot.
- I'll just go for it.

902
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,060
- Just do it. Hurry up.
- Okay.

903
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,260
Be careful.
We should get enough time.

904
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,350
- We need more than 1 minute.
- I think 60 seconds would be okay.

905
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,890
- We need more than one minute.
- Just stick it in.

906
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,960
- I'm not sure.
- Just stick it in!

907
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,620
- We need at least one minute.
- Let's go. Five.

908
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,740
Hey.

909
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,460
- Six.
- Okay. Let's keep going.

910
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,540
It's over now.

911
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,540
(After getting 50 seconds...
They already earned 100 seconds.)

912
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,370
(They currently have 100 seconds.)

913
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,080
- Take your time.
- Okay.

914
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,350
You might have written
a wrong answer too.

915
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,350
Yes. We know that.

916
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,080
- Okay. We stuck in 11 swords.
- Yes, We know that.

917
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,550
(They earned 110 seconds.)

918
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,490
- We have 110 seconds.
- You can memorize everything.

919
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,880
- Hey.
- If you go around...

920
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,950
The next member to go out is
Suk Jin.

921
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,760
(The last representative is
Suk Jin.)

922
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,880
- That's great.
- Wait.

923
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,920
- Suk Jin.
- What's great about this?

924
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
- Should I go this way?
- He has a lot of time.

925
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,150
- It's not great.
- He has a lot of time.

926
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,960
- How many rooms should I check?
- You should check this one.

927
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,190
- Here.
- Three, four...

928
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,270
- Make sure to check them all.
- Suk Jin.

929
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,890
- Next to "Sleepover Club?"
- Yes.

930
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,160
Between "CP 5" and...

931
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,100
- Suk Jin. Listen.
- In front of the elevator...

932
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,900
We have just a few to check.
Don't panic.

933
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,100
- Hold on. It's just...
- That's not a lot.

934
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,200
- Why are you so nervous?
- Why are you nervous?

935
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,870
- I'm not. This is our last chance.
- Don't we...

936
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,910
- have 80 seconds?
- We have 110 seconds.

937
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,680
Do we have 110 seconds?
You can memorize all of them.

938
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,380
- Next to "Sleepover Club..."
- Check the other side too.

939
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,560
Go around to the elevator,
and check the two rooms there.

940
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,060
- Two rooms. Yes, that's good.
- Right.

941
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,420
- I'll get going.
- Suk Jin, good luck.

942
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,770
- Suk Jin, check other rooms too.
- Ready.

943
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,270
Make sure you're checking
the right rooms.

944
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,530
"CP 5" is next to "Inkigayo."

945
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,630
I'm glad we got enough time.

946
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,900
Ready. Go.

947
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,270
- Hurry up.
- Turn right, and...

948
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,310
The chief director's office... What?

949
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,980
Wait. This is weird.

950
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,580
This is for a new show.

951
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,090
It's weird. There should be
a hallway... The chief director...

952
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,940
A new show is next to
the chief director's office.

953
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,290
A new show... It's weird.
Where is the hallway?

954
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,530
Oh, this is it.
I should go this way.

955
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,030
This is a conference room.
What? Hang on a second.

956
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,620
This is so weird.

957
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,190
Wait. Why... "CP 5..."

958
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,770
(Frozen)

959
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,890
What's going on?

960
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,270
"CP 5."

961
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,930
(The members remembered this room
from the start.)

962
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:08,930
"Sleepover Club."

963
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:09,930
"Same Bed, Different Dreams 2:
You Are My Destiny."

964
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,580
On "SBS Inkigayo", you sing,
"You Are My Destiny."

965
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,870
(You are my destiny)

966
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,050
While singing,
you go to a sleepover.

967
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,710
"SBS Inkigayo."

968
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,980
(It's hard to understand
his bizarre memorization method.)

969
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,850
Where is the elevator? Let's go.

970
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,410
- Get off, and the rooms...
- Ten.

971
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,820
- Nine.
- It's a conference room.

972
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,950
- Eight.
- A conference room.

973
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,560
Seven. Six.

974
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,090
- A conference room.
- Five.

975
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,230
- Four. Three.
- A conference room.

976
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,850
- Two.
- This is so confusing.

977
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,070
One, Time's up.

978
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,390
I spent 110 seconds already? No way.

979
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,740
- He'll do well.
- I'm worried that Suk Jin might...

980
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,930
fail to find this room.

981
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,660
I wish Jong Kook had been...

982
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,580
Jong Kook, I wish
you had been chosen this time.

983
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,930
- That was just perfect, right?
- When he arrived this morning,

984
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,440
Seok Soon went past this room.

985
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,170
- "Seok Soon?"
- She just called him "Seok Soon."

986
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,480
- Shouldn't we put a tracker on him?
- I mean, Suk Jin.

987
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,640
- It's so confusing.
- How did it go, Suk Jin?

988
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,990
I think that the map is wrong.

989
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,090
- Did we write the wrong answers?
- Two conference rooms on the right.

990
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,680
- Two conference rooms?
- Yes.

991
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,880
- That's great.
- What about the ones on the left?

992
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
- Next to "CP 2..."
- Next to this one.

993
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,420
We got that one right.
I'm sure of it.

994
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,650
- Suk Jin.
- What was here?

995
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,360
- You are my destiny...
- You saw "Master in the House", right?

996
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,070
- "You Are My Destiny?"
- It's here.

997
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,270
- We already wrote it.
- Right.

998
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,070
Having different dreams,

999
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,340
- "Sleepover Club."
- singing, "You are my destiny..."

1000
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,070
on "SBS Inkigayo." Right?

1001
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,810
- We already wrote "SBS Inkigayo."
- Exactly.

1002
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,900
- You should've checked here.
- He has his own way of memorizing.

1003
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,350
- Here. Next to "CP 5."
- I'm talking about Suk Jin.

1004
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,850
The director's office...
The director...

1005
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,370
- The director's office?
- The director's office?

1006
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,550
- The director's office.
- Wait. Was it here?

1007
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,790
- Well...
- She must have a larger office.

1008
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,940
- Come on, Suk Jin.
- Gosh.

1009
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,550
- Don't take a guess.
- You should've memorized it.

1010
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,110
- Suk Jin, that's the one.
- Right.

1011
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,060
- It's in the corner. It has a view.
- He says I'm right.

1012
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,830
- I think that's right.
- What are you doing?

1013
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,560
- Her office is a corner office.
- Right.

1014
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,530
Did you see "Master in the House"
next to "CP 1?"

1015
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,650
Did you not see "Master in the House?"

1016
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,860
When I left this office...

1017
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,360
- This map is not right.
- No. You're wrong.

1018
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,460
- No, nothing's wrong with the map.
- Anyway,

1019
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,160
- did you see "Master in the House..."
- Wait.

1020
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,430
- next to "CP 1?"
- Are you serious?

1021
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,840
- Can't you remember... Really?
- What about this one?

1022
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,280
- My gosh.
- This one is a conference room.

1023
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,630
You had a lot of time.

1024
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,580
We should think...

1025
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,820
that Suk Jin pulled it off
since he found his way back here.

1026
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,850
We should be grateful.

1027
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,110
No way.

1028
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,590
Suk Jin, why didn't you...

1029
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,210
- We should write "Master in the House."
- I remember that too.

1030
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,090
We just have to figure out
these 2... No, I mean, 3.

1031
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,260
- What's next to "CP 5..."
- You only remembered...

1032
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,920
- two conference rooms.
- What are you doing?

1033
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,350
I remembered
the director's office too.

1034
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,270
- Gosh. What did he do out there?
- Try to remember the rest.

1035
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,100
- Fill in the blanks...
- This one is "Master in the House."

1036
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,440
- It's "Master in the House."
- All the large rooms are...

1037
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,790
- conference rooms.
- Write it down.

1038
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,860
- She's right.
- And...

1039
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,440
- What are those two rooms?
- What are those?

1040
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,810
- What is it?
- Between "CP 5" and "CP 2."

1041
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,980
What is it, Suk Jin?

1042
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,980
"CP 1."

1043
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,750
- "CP 1" is here.
- I saw it before.

1044
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,670
- Why didn't you...
- Then...

1045
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,580
Okay. It must be "CP 6."

1046
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,480
- There's no "CP 6."
- Suk Jin, come on.

1047
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,580
Be precise.

1048
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,380
- Give us one more chance. He...
- Let us try again.

1049
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,690
- Give me ten more seconds.
- Suk Jin...

1050
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,960
- That's not allowed.
- But he...

1051
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,560
- Why did you pick Suk Jin?
- What is between these two?

1052
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,860
I'll go with this.
I remembered everything.

1053
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,900
- Show us the board.
- Okay.

1054
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,420
A room for a new show
next to the director's office.

1055
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,330
- I don't understand.
- I saw many rooms for a new show.

1056
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,360
- I'm not sure.
- What's that? Is it a blank?

1057
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,560
No, we filled in every blank.

1058
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,830
Jae Suk filled in
a lot of the blanks.

1059
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,270
- Right.
- Jae Suk did it all.

1060
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,310
Suk Jin, seriously?

1061
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,810
(Scoring)

1062
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,540
- The right side is correct.
- The right side?

1063
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,670
- Nice, Jae Suk.
- See?

1064
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,080
- The right side.
- We filled in all the blanks.

1065
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,850
- Okay.
- Nicely done.

1066
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,710
- What about the left side?
- The left side.

1067
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,290
- This is insane.
- How many did we get wrong?

1068
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,560
How could he not have remembered
any one of them?

1069
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,080
(This will determine
when they go home.)

1070
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,250
- Exactly.
- It's impossible.

1071
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,730
- You got four wrong.
- Four?

1072
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,960
(4 incorrect answers.)

1073
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,420
- Four?
- That's quite a lot.

1074
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,630
Two need to be swapped...

1075
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,900
and one of the places
doesn't exist anywhere.

1076
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,710
- The conference room.
- That must not exist.

1077
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,440
- We're at 50 minutes.
- Seok Sam was no help at all!

1078
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,710
You always have trouble
paying attention.

1079
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,580
- What's wrong with you?
- That's not it.

1080
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,420
The map seemed different
which had me flustered.

1081
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,080
- Right.
- So what now?

1082
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,610
You got four wrong,

1083
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,460
which means you were only able
to shorten the time by 50 minutes.

1084
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,920
It's now time for what
all workers await during the day.

1085
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,460
You will have lunch
at the office cafeteria.

1086
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,960
Shall we get going?

1087
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,730
- All right!
- Okay.

1088
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,860
We're off to the cafeteria.

1089
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,170
It's on the top floor.

1090
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,560
- I can smell the food.
- My gosh.

1091
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,500
It's like walking into a hotel.

1092
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,040
- No way.
- It's a buffet.

1093
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,080
Check out the view.

1094
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,610
The view is a work of art.

1095
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,900
What a generous company.

1096
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,810
- Nice!
- All right.

1097
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:12,920
Se Chan, isn't it like a hotel?

1098
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,750
- This place...
- Hi.

1099
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,350
Can I buy meal tickets
and eat here when I want to?

1100
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,380
- Here?
- Over here.

1101
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,690
So Min, let's go in.
Ji Hyo, come on.

1102
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,520
I love it here.

1103
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,560
I thought we were having lunch.

1104
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,420
(Anyone can tell
they're here to play a game.)

1105
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,190
- So Min, look.
- Where's our food?

1106
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,290
We came prepared for our meal,

1107
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,560
but that wasn't the case.

1108
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,940
We didn't invite you here on a tour.

1109
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,710
We thought we'd be getting lunch.

1110
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,330
- I thought we'd be having lunch.
- I'm in love.

1111
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,880
- What a generous company.
- This is incredible.

1112
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,750
You guys should work even harder.

1113
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,610
My gosh. We've made it big,
haven't we?

1114
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,270
Our lives are a success.

1115
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,480
Why are we having lunch
so early today?

1116
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,920
Oh, right. I arrived late today.

1117
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,750
That's right. Jong Kook,
it's lunchtime.

1118
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,020
I arrived late today.

1119
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,860
I was wondering why
lunch was being served so early.

1120
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,650
Se Chan has been here
for five hours already.

1121
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,330
- I ate earlier, but I'm hungry.
- Really?

1122
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,920
I had breakfast,
so I'm not that hungry.

1123
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,230
Today,

1124
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:07,270
you'll be having lunch
at the cafeteria.

1125
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,500
- A course meal is on the menu.
- Gosh.

1126
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,980
A full-course meal?

1127
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,810
It'll take about five minutes
for the meal to be prepared.

1128
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,580
If you suggest a game
that we find entertaining,

1129
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,420
we will deduct time off your clocks.

1130
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,940
- Really? Any ideas?
- The game...

1131
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,480
If we find the game reasonable...

1132
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,110
- It must be a group effort, right?
- Yes.

1133
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,750
- Something we can succeed in.
- Right.

1134
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,150
We'll deduct time off your clocks.

1135
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,480
How about jegichagi?

1136
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,330
No.

1137
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,250
How about a drawing game?

1138
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,670
- A drawing game?
- Yes, the drawing game!

1139
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,170
What's the drawing game?

1140
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,330
You know what it is.

1141
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,460
We each add to the drawing...

1142
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,110
and the last person has to guess
what it is.

1143
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,900
Oh, that?

1144
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,230
Jae Suk must've enjoyed
playing that game.

1145
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,880
(The game they played in
episode 605 was edited out.)

1146
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,850
(They each add to the drawing...)

1147
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:58,190
(and it must be guessed
by the last person.)

1148
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,060
(They scored zero points, but
they want to play the game again.)

1149
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,150
Who wants to guess the answer?

1150
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,900
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

1151
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,420
Jong Kook's better
at drawing though.

1152
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,920
It's not about the drawing
looking nice.

1153
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,060
What's the category?
Will it be a movie?

1154
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,730
- How about an idiom?
- A proverb.

1155
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,360
- A proverb.
- I agree.

1156
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,940
You can't write down any letters...

1157
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,270
- or how many syllables it is.
- Of course.

1158
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,170
- We know better.
- Of course.

1159
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,880
- We're good at these things.
- Exactly.

1160
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,250
No one is better than us
at cooperative games.

1161
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,650
We don't let idol singers
rip off our name tags.

1162
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,020
- Of course.
- We come out on top.

1163
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,810
We're absolute beasts.

1164
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,750
Why do you always go back to that?

1165
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,210
- K-pop idols...
- It's like a medal of honor.

1166
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,230
It was Suk Jin and me,

1167
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,690
- but they couldn't beat us.
- Exactly.

1168
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,190
- Suk Jin's a beast.
- And you're too fast.

1169
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,520
I never lose games
outside of Running Man.

1170
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,190
- I always win the prize.
- Exactly.

1171
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,100
- We win on other shows.
- I always win the prize.

1172
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,630
We dominate, don't we?

1173
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,060
(How good are they
at drawing though?)

1174
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,540
Here we go.
You will get three seconds each.

1175
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,730
And go.

1176
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,630
(A sparrow will always be tempted
when passing by a mill.)

1177
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,080
Three, two, one, next.

1178
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,580
Three, two, one, next.

1179
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,920
Give it to the next person.

1180
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,350
- Three, two...
- Give me the pen.

1181
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,110
- Seriously?
- Where's the pen?

1182
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,520
- I wasn't given a pen.
- Three, two,

1183
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,380
one. Next!

1184
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,960
Three, two, one, next.

1185
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,330
- There isn't enough time.
- Three...

1186
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,600
- Jong Kook will now guess.
- Three seconds isn't enough.

1187
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,400
- That was too fast.
- There wasn't enough time.

1188
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,460
Show him.

1189
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,830
Unbelievable.

1190
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,540
We were off to
a good start, you know.

1191
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,960
Three seconds isn't enough.

1192
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,630
- Hold on.
- Guess it right,

1193
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,670
and I'll call you a genius.

1194
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,670
Guess it right,
and I'll call you a genius.

1195
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,110
Who drew first?

1196
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,650
- You can't know that.
- No?

1197
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,610
- This is insane.
- Isn't that allowed?

1198
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,380
- Take a look.
- There wasn't enough time.

1199
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,690
- Guess what this could be.
- Haha, that isn't allowed.

1200
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,460
The proverb itself is quite tricky.

1201
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,810
- This must be a bird.
- Right.

1202
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,080
- Of course.
- That isn't allowed.

1203
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,150
- Why not?
- Isn't that allowed?

1204
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,230
He's allowed to talk on his own.

1205
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,730
There are many types of birds.

1206
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,920
Seriously!

1207
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,130
A proverb that includes a bird.

1208
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,060
Birds hear
what is said at night and...

1209
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,060
- No way.
- Of course not.

1210
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,060
It can't be that, right?

1211
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,540
Someone would've drawn a moon.

1212
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,000
This is Running Man, Jong Kook.

1213
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,540
- There are many types of birds.
- That's right.

1214
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,110
- It's one of them.
- Right.

1215
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,750
This is exactly why
we don't do cooperative games.

1216
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,400
- Why not?
- Why not?

1217
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,250
- No one can stop you guys.
- Have the pheasant and its egg.

1218
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,650
- What?
- How is this a pheasant?

1219
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,940
This can't be a pheasant.

1220
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,190
(He openly shares
his deduction process.)

1221
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,190
How is this an egg?

1222
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,210
- Is this a guessing game?
- No, wait.

1223
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,150
- It's small.
- Look at it.

1224
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,560
I'll give you 5 seconds. In 5, 4...

1225
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,750
(He just begins the countdown.)

1226
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,830
- Two...
- It's a sparrow.

1227
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,860
That's it!

1228
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,270
- A sparrow.
- What's the answer?

1229
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,360
It's a sparrow. Five,

1230
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,500
four, three...

1231
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,600
- A sparrow will always...
- Yes!

1232
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,630
Can a sparrow pass by a mill?

1233
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,960
Yes!

1234
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,040
- One.
- Can a sparrow pass by a mill?

1235
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,310
Yes!

1236
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,880
- That's correct.
- Why?

1237
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,150
But he said the correct answer.

1238
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,420
It means the same thing.

1239
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,710
He didn't include "tempted."

1240
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,080
- Just that?
- Let me guess the drawing.

1241
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,540
- That should be a win.
- You draw it instead.

1242
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,110
I'll guess the drawing instead.

1243
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,150
I only say this
because it's Jae Suk.

1244
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,520
You're not allowed
to deliberately stall.

1245
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,900
- Don't worry.
- I won't.

1246
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,150
We know better.

1247
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,400
- Here we go.
- All right.

1248
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,500
And go.

1249
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,730
(Once on the liver
and once on the gall bladder)

1250
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,790
Gosh.

1251
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,290
(Once on the liver
and once on the gall bladder)

1252
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,830
- Two, one.
- Wait.

1253
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,130
- Three.
- That's not it.

1254
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,880
- Two, one.
- Draw what's recognizable.

1255
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,130
- Draw what's obvious.
- Next!

1256
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,770
- Next.
- What on earth is that?

1257
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,540
What on earth is that?

1258
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,440
Seriously?

1259
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,110
- Three, two, one.
- What's going on?

1260
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,420
- Next.
- That's not it.

1261
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,380
- Three, two...
- Who's the issue?

1262
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,690
One, next.

1263
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,420
Haha, you're out. Thee, two...

1264
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,020
- Haha, you can't draw.
- Why not?

1265
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,650
Three, two, one, done.

1266
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,000
(No one listens to the director.)

1267
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,230
Darn it. How can one salvage this?

1268
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,100
- What on earth is this?
- Isn't it obvious?

1269
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,130
- Show us.
- But...

1270
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,940
- The top part is weird.
- Back and forth.

1271
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,560
It indicates us, doesn't it?

1272
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,310
- This is a flea, isn't it?
- What?

1273
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,480
It's not a flea.

1274
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,730
That's...

1275
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,810
- Check the far left.
- You can't say that.

1276
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:44,880
What's on the left?

1277
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,110
- Se Chan.
- What's below that?

1278
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,610
- What could this be?
- Look.

1279
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:51,040
Hold on. This can't be
a potato, right?

1280
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,190
- Of course not.
- Let me see.

1281
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,460
- Of course it isn't.
- No way.

1282
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,520
- How is that a potato?
- That isn't it.

1283
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,330
- It's not a potato.
- Of course not.

1284
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:00,600
This proverb describes
people like Se Chan.

1285
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,060
- Right.
- That's right.

1286
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,540
- All right. Five...
- But...

1287
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,790
- When I drink...
- It's who he is.

1288
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,210
- Jae Suk.
- When I drink a lot.

1289
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,460
Five, four, three, two, one.

1290
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,980
The liver.

1291
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,670
- Three, two...
- That's it.

1292
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,080
(He was able to figure out
that it's the liver.)

1293
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,580
Why covet a flea's liver?

1294
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,750
- What?
- That is incorrect!

1295
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,270
(Why covet a flea's liver?)

1296
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,750
- Who drew this?
- How is this a gall bladder?

1297
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,190
How is this a gall bladder?

1298
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,810
How is this a gall bladder?

1299
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,250
- It's a flea.
- Of course it's a flea.

1300
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,830
- That wasn't me.
- This is a flea.

1301
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:33,100
- I drew the liver.
- There should've been a person.

1302
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,100
Se Chan, come on.

1303
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,460
"Once on the liver
and once on the gall bladder."

1304
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,360
"Once on the liver
and once on the gall bladder?"

1305
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,730
So who drew the flea?

1306
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,960
Who drew the flea?

1307
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,130
That was So Min.

1308
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,440
- This is a flea.
- How is this not a flea?

1309
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,000
This can't be anything else
but a flea.

1310
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,380
You should be the first one to draw.

1311
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,710
- Swap seats.
- All right.

1312
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,480
- We'll do one more round.
- Right.

1313
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,980
- Here we go.
- Let's do this.

1314
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,440
(Another's rice cake looks bigger.)

1315
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,480
- Hey.
- Three.

1316
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,750
- Two.
- I didn't see what it was.

1317
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,980
- One.
- Next.

1318
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,150
- I really didn't see it.
- Show me.

1319
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,650
Two, one.

1320
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,960
- I really didn't see it.
- Three, two, one.

1321
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,790
- No, that's not it!
- Are you nearly done?

1322
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,630
- No, that's not it!
- What's wrong?

1323
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,130
- No, that's not it!
- Are you nearly done?

1324
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,130
- No, that's not it!
- Next.

1325
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,360
- No!
- Wait.

1326
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,440
- Two, one.
- Draw it over here.

1327
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,330
Three, two, one, next.

1328
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,130
- Gosh.
- Oh, no.

1329
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,770
- What on earth is this?
- Gosh.

1330
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,750
- Three, two...
- What on earth?

1331
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,110
- One.
- Are you kidding me?

1332
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,210
What on earth is this?

1333
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,880
This was an easy one!

1334
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,440
- How can one guess this?
- This was an easy one!

1335
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,610
- This isn't doable.
- It was an easy one.

1336
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,920
No, you can do this.

1337
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,420
Why is there an inequality symbol?

1338
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,060
- No clues are allowed.
- There's an inequality symbol.

1339
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,500
- Don't.
- He'll know this.

1340
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,500
- That was too obvious.
- You're almost there.

1341
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,630
The belly button
is larger than the belly?

1342
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,790
- That's not it.
- That is incorrect.

1343
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,100
- He has more time.
- It wasn't an official answer.

1344
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,440
It wasn't my official answer.

1345
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,230
Give it another closer inspection.

1346
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,130
- There are two people.
- Right.

1347
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,500
That's right.

1348
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,380
- Goodness.
- Give it another closer inspection.

1349
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,580
There are two people.

1350
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,810
This guy's looking at this guy.

1351
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,350
He's looking at him.

1352
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,350
- What?
- Suk Jin...

1353
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,580
The grass is greener
on the other side.

1354
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,190
(Laughing)

1355
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,350
What's your answer?

1356
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,880
It's not like we said anything.

1357
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,920
(The unprecedented clue
makes Jae Suk dizzy.)

1358
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,650
What?

1359
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:08,730
But this...

1360
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,130
You practically gave me the answer.

1361
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,600
- What did he say?
- What did he say?

1362
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,730
"The grass is greener
on the other side."

1363
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,690
"The grass is greener
on the other side."

1364
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,420
(He just gave Jae Suk the answer.)

1365
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,630
You can't just slip him the answer.

1366
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,060
That is incorrect.

1367
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:23,500
- Hold on.
- That's just wrong.

1368
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,880
- Come on.
- Seriously?

1369
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,710
- What was that?
- Ji Hyo, come on.

1370
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,110
- This was Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo!

1371
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:30,440
You should've drawn rice cakes
of two different sizes.

1372
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,150
- Exactly.
- This isn't acceptable.

1373
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,980
- Where's the inequality symbol?
- I was in a rush.

1374
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,920
Which is why you should've
been thinking straight.

1375
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,880
I was in a rush!

1376
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,210
- Then...
- Let's try it once more.

1377
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,210
You go first.

1378
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,250
Ji Hyo, take his seat.

1379
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,290
No, it's over.

1380
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:43,790
- One more round.
- Let us try it once more.

1381
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:45,230
It's time for the main event.

1382
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:46,860
Just give us another chance.

1383
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,500
- But we were having fun.
- What's the main event?

1384
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,790
Let's make this into a show instead.

1385
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:51,900
Fine, go on with the main event.

1386
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,130
Giving out clues is just as fun.

1387
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,670
It's funny how we give hints
to each other.

1388
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,710
But we can't give hints
like Se Chan does, can we?

1389
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,230
- "That's not it."
- I thought it was soft.

1390
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,330
- Please play it fairly.
- We should.

1391
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:04,580
All right. In this mission,
we'll provide a course meal.

1392
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,420
There are six courses in total.

1393
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,210
- Six?
- Each dish will be served.

1394
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,150
But there are eight dishes in total.

1395
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,520
And one of them is a random dish.

1396
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,520
- What?
- What do you mean?

1397
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,190
- One of them is difficult to eat.
- Oh, really?

1398
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:21,290
But since there are eight dishes,
no one could get it.

1399
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:22,860
- Right.
- We don't know who'll get it.

1400
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,960
If you finish the whole dish,

1401
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,460
we'll deduct 20 minutes per dish.

1402
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,670
Oh, we can still try
and eat the random dish?

1403
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:28,770
- Yes, you can.
- Even if we get it?

1404
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:29,770
That's right.

1405
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,710
- The chance is only one-eighth.
- Of course.

1406
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,810
Only one-eighth?

1407
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,540
It's only difficult to eat, right?
Not inedible?

1408
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,540
Yes, you can eat it.

1409
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,940
- We used edible ingredients.
- Of course.

1410
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,920
We're better than idols
when it comes to eating.

1411
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,270
- Yes, we are.
- Idols?

1412
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:42,690
They're always on a diet.

1413
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,020
Has he been harassed by them
or something?

1414
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,750
We can eat anything
no matter how difficult it is.

1415
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,750
We never lose to them.

1416
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:49,020
- We can just eat it.
- Yes, we can. It'll be easy.

1417
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,790
The first course
is fried tofu rice ball.

1418
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,190
- This is...
- Gosh, it looks so good.

1419
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,330
It's not much.

1420
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,460
- We can just easily eat it.
- It's doable.

1421
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,360
- It's fried.
- One of them is inedible?

1422
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,500
- That's right.
- We can easily eat it.

1423
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,600
- We can just hold back.
- Let's just hold back.

1424
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,500
Why don't we just take them as is
without choosing?

1425
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,630
Number two looks a bit off.

1426
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:07,710
Number two?

1427
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:10,650
One of them is...
Look at number five.

1428
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,440
- Number five?
- There are grains on the bottom.

1429
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,580
What about it?
Why is number three so big?

1430
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,940
There are grains of rice
on the bottom for number five.

1431
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,110
- Let's just eat them in this order.
- Sure.

1432
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,790
- Mine is number 2.
- Then I'll get number 1.

1433
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,560
- All right, then.
- Okay.

1434
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,880
- You can take them.
- Here. Number one.

1435
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,330
- Just give them to us in order.
- What about Ji Hyo?

1436
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,500
- I'll take number 2.
- Number 2?

1437
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,790
This is wasabi for sure.
Look at its color.

1438
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,460
- Number five is off. Look.
- It is the random dish.

1439
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,560
There are grains of rice
on the bottom.

1440
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,290
- Number five is...
- Look. It's all yellow.

1441
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,500
- You got that dish.
- Jae Suk.

1442
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,130
- Se Chan, Haha's is yellow.
- Oh, really?

1443
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,480
(Haha's rice ball
has become a target already.)

1444
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,810
- He got it.
- You want number six?

1445
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,380
- He got it.
- Anyone want to switch?

1446
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,540
No, thanks. You have it.

1447
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,580
- All right.
- I'll take number six.

1448
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,810
- All right.
- Oh, really?

1449
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,940
You can start your meal.

1450
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:50,750
- Thank you for the meal.
- Let's enjoy it.

1451
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:52,380
Let's eat it
with a strong mentality.

1452
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,980
(Taking a bite
with a strong mentality)

1453
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,020
(He smells it as though
he'd eat it with his nose.)

1454
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,020
(Then he plucks up his courage
and takes a bite.)

1455
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,540
(They all seem to be enjoying it.)

1456
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,630
It's good.

1457
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,040
It's delicious!

1458
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,630
- Mine is good.
- Mine is good too.

1459
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,000
Let's eat it
with a strong mentality.

1460
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,750
(Haha was a strong candidate
to get the random dish...)

1461
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,480
(based on its color alone.)

1462
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,610
It's good.

1463
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:22,880
It's delicious!

1464
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,610
- Mine is good.
- Mine is good too.

1465
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:26,880
- What's wrong?
- Just hold it in.

1466
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:28,560
- What's wrong, So Min?
- So Min.

1467
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,650
She doesn't look too good.

1468
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:32,290
- Mine is good.
- Mine is good too.

1469
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,690
- What's wrong?
- Just hold it in.

1470
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,360
- What's wrong, So Min?
- So Min.

1471
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,400
- She doesn't look too good.
- So Min.

1472
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,630
- Hold it in.
- What's wrong?

1473
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,130
- You should finish it up.
- Isn't it good?

1474
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,540
Think of happy things. What's wrong?
Is it spicy?

1475
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:44,540
It's good.

1476
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:45,940
So Min, what's wrong?
Why is your face red?

1477
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,440
(So Min's face has turned red.)

1478
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,150
So Min, you can do it.

1479
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:53,020
One of the rice balls
has a white capsaicin sauce.

1480
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,580
- So Min, be careful.
- A white capsaicin sauce?

1481
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,940
I think she's eaten some of it.

1482
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,750
- You can't eat it?
- Just eat it. It's good.

1483
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,230
- So Min, you can do it.
- So Min, you should finish it.

1484
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,130
You don't have to finish it
if it's not to your liking.

1485
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,730
- Hey.
- Eat it.

1486
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:11,020
- Push all the rice in.
- So Min.

1487
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:13,500
You should eat it.
How will you survive...

1488
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,770
in this world with such mentality?

1489
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:18,630
- You're discouraging her.
- Isn't he the worst?

1490
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:20,110
- He's so...
- Don't show it.

1491
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,250
If you show, then you'll lose
to the production crew.

1492
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:24,080
- Just eat it naturally.
- It's quite good.

1493
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,850
- Of course.
- We're going to succeed.

1494
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,350
- Okay!
- All right!

1495
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:29,040
So Min, since you finished it,
you succeeded.

1496
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,020
It's really spicy.

1497
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,290
- We're quite good.
- You're amazing.

1498
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:35,730
(Thanks to the encouragers,
she succeeded in eating it.)

1499
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:37,380
Is it that spicy?

1500
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,500
- Really?
- Oh, this is...

1501
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,830
The second course is steamed egg.

1502
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,730
- I love steamed egg.
- I want number six.

1503
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:44,900
Steamed egg is my favorite.

1504
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,330
Of course. As long as it's not bad,
it'll be good.

1505
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,900
You can give them out
however you want.

1506
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:51,810
- So Bal.
- She's giving them out so fast.

1507
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:54,540
- I'm telling you.
- She's like a master.

1508
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,350
I don't feel pain.

1509
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,380
Does that mean you don't feel pain
when you're hit?

1510
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,940
- Of course.
- Enjoy your steamed egg.

1511
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,790
- Okay.
- What is it?

1512
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:04,250
- It's steamed egg.
- I meant what's in it.

1513
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,380
You'll find out once you eat it.

1514
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,380
(Exclaiming)

1515
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,380
- It's so good!
- Mine is normal.

1516
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,130
- I meant what's in it.
- You'll find out once you eat it.

1517
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,460
- It's so savory.
- It's like a pudding.

1518
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,670
(They're all enjoying it.)

1519
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:16,730
Gosh, it's good.

1520
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:17,830
(They're all enjoying it.)

1521
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,060
Should it be this hot?

1522
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:21,860
(Halting)

1523
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,830
(Shutting his eyes tight)

1524
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:27,880
Suk Jin.

1525
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:31,000
How will you survive
in this world with such mentality?

1526
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,770
(How will you survive
in this world with such mentality?)

1527
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:36,080
(The boomer spewed out a harsh
comment without knowing his fate.)

1528
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,150
Suk Jin.

1529
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,210
- Suk Jin.
- You're from the future.

1530
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,310
Why couldn't you predict this?

1531
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,520
Don't do that.

1532
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,020
How will you survive...

1533
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,690
- With such mentality...
- in this...

1534
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,330
- In the fierce world?
- In such fierce industry?

1535
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:46,520
How will you survive?

1536
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,520
Only if you didn't say that earlier.

1537
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:50,360
Gosh, it's so spicy!

1538
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,790
I can't have it hot.

1539
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,630
- That's how it is.
- Was it salty?

1540
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:55,810
Don't drink water.
Don't let him drink water.

1541
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:57,130
- The mentality!
- Suk Jin.

1542
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,810
- Suk Jin.
- You lose if you drink water.

1543
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,040
- You lose if you drink water.
- How will you live...

1544
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,480
- with such mentality?
- You lose if you drink water.

1545
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,850
Suk Jin, don't give up.

1546
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,850
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

1547
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,810
- You're losing to the crew.
- The thing is...

1548
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:08,170
- It's really hard to eat.
- No, seriously...

1549
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,710
- Suk Jin.
- With such mentality...

1550
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,520
- With such mentality...
- I just can't eat this!

1551
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,580
With such mentality,
you can't survive...

1552
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,690
- in this tough showbiz.
- Then why did you say that?

1553
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:16,790
Why did you say that?

1554
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,690
It's up to how you think.

1555
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,400
Suk Jin, focus.

1556
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,790
All right. He did it.

1557
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,420
Suk Jin.

1558
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,960
I... I'm giving up.

1559
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,460
(With a shriek,)

1560
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,480
(he quickly gives up.)

1561
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,310
- No. You have to eat it.
- He's given up.

1562
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,810
- Just eat it!
- Gosh, Suk Jin...

1563
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,540
- Gosh, seriously.
- He's given up.

1564
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,580
Was it too salty? Or spicy?

1565
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:42,380
It'll put you in trouble
if you eat it.

1566
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,690
- Because it's spicy?
- Why did you say that to So Min?

1567
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,580
- Why couldn't you eat it?
- You try it.

1568
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,110
- Then how did So Min...
- Go ahead.

1569
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,380
- Was it too spicy?
- Just give it a try.

1570
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,080
- Let me try it.
- You should try it.

1571
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,230
My nose is runny.

1572
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,600
You just can't eat it!

1573
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,770
You see? He spitted it out.

1574
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:00,270
- Gosh!
- Is it too salty?

1575
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:02,310
- It's too salty.
- I swallowed some of it.

1576
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,500
Try it. Try just some of it.

1577
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,210
- I can eat it if I want.
- Seriously. Try it.

1578
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:08,770
Try it. It smells good.

1579
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:10,900
You should take a big bite.

1580
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,080
- It's too salty.
- Gosh, it's salty.

1581
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,540
- It's impossible to eat.
- Try it.

1582
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,210
No, don't do that.
You should eat it.

1583
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:17,610
- No, Suk Jin.
- Just try a bit.

1584
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:18,920
- Come on.
- It's so salty.

1585
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,980
Just give it a try.

1586
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,250
(Forced to eat)

1587
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,520
You should try and hold it in.

1588
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,290
- You should try it a little.
- No, thank you.

1589
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:25,690
- Just try a bit.
- No, I don't want to.

1590
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:27,020
- Just try it.
- I tried it before.

1591
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,360
- Suk Jin, don't force So Min!
- Stop it!

1592
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,670
- Just try it.
- Don't force it on So Min!

1593
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,460
- It's because...
- So Min's stomach is hurt.

1594
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,610
Viewers, you shouldn't criticize me.

1595
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:38,360
It's because some might criticize me
for not eating it...

1596
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,730
when I scolded So Min.

1597
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,750
- You should give it a try!
- He knows it too.

1598
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:45,170
He knows that he'll be criticized.

1599
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,810
What do you mean by
"Don't criticize me?"

1600
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:48,750
Suk Jin! You are...

1601
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,350
- Viewers!
- If you were to be criticized...

1602
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:51,980
- I get it!
- If you don't want...

1603
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,980
to be criticized, you should eat it.

1604
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,710
He's been in this industry
for 30 years.

1605
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:56,790
But he asked the viewers
not to criticize him.

1606
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,830
I mean, it's impossible to eat this.

1607
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,130
He's trying to rationalize
his actions.

1608
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:02,020
- That's why he's feeding them.
- I know.

1609
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,960
- I'll eat it if I get it.
- Stop it.

1610
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,440
Stop it.

1611
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,600
Did you see how he spitted it out?

1612
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,400
- You can eat it if you try hard.
- My gosh.

1613
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,830
This is cheating.

1614
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,710
- If only he had a will.
- I know.

1615
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:14,080
The third course
is spicy fried chicken.

1616
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,000
- It looks spicy.
- It looks good.

1617
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,610
- Is it all right?
- It's so good.

1618
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,040
(They're all enjoying
the sweet and spicy fried chicken.)

1619
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,880
Gosh. Did you know?

1620
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:25,790
- We all got it.
- Did we all make it?

1621
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:28,460
- Mine is okay.
- Your tongue must be numb.

1622
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:29,830
- Is it me?
- One of us got it.

1623
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,360
- Is it me?
- One of us got it.

1624
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,500
So Min.

1625
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,520
Who got the random dish?

1626
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,690
- Is it So Min?
- My tongue is numb,

1627
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:35,690
so I can't taste anything.

1628
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,360
(She lost her palate.)

1629
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,600
- It was you?
- For real?

1630
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,790
That's great.
You should eat them all.

1631
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:44,360
- I can't taste anything.
- You should finish it.

1632
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:45,940
All right. I finished it.

1633
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:48,000
She's good. This is how good we are.

1634
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,400
So you've succeeded
in finishing four courses.

1635
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,770
In total, you deducted 80 minutes.

1636
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,750
That's a lot.

1637
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:56,610
- We'll be able to go home by 1 p.m.
- So now,

1638
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,960
those who can go home early...

1639
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,790
- Could it be 2 p.m.?
- can leave at 1:51 p.m.

1640
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:02,250
(Getting off work early: 1:51 p.m.)

1641
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,690
And the remaining five of you
can leave at 2:54 p.m.

1642
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:05,790
(Getting off work on time: 2:54 p.m.)

1643
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:06,900
Lastly, the last one to leave...

1644
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,020
- will get off work at 4:33 p.m.
- It's unbelievable.

1645
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,560
We can leave by 4:33 p.m., at least.

1646
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,830
It'd be incredible if Jong Kook
can leave by 1:50 p.m.

1647
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:14,230
- That'll be amazing.
- We came early in the morning.

1648
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:16,310
You came at 11 a.m., and you can leave
after only 2 hours.

1649
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,360
Then you should've told me
to come later too.

1650
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,540
I'll do my best.

1651
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,170
- Two hours?
- I'll seriously do my best.

1652
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:24,170
Let's move on to the next mission.

1653
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:25,170
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1654
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,250
All right.

1655
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,670
(Working overtime: 4:33 p.m.)

1656
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:33,750
What is this?

1657
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,560
- Gosh, what's this?
- What is this?

1658
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,750
It's 1:13 p.m. right now.

1659
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,900
One of us will be going home.

1660
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,000
- Someone is leaving.
- One of us is getting off work.

1661
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,170
The one getting off work early
will be leaving at 1:51 p.m.

1662
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:43,960
Awesome.

1663
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,770
- Please let it be me!
- All right.

1664
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:48,130
- I want to go home too!
- They'll be leaving soon.

1665
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,810
Let me watch "The Outlaws."

1666
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,080
In this mission, the amount of work
will differ dramatically...

1667
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,230
depending on your title.

1668
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,810
It's called Today's Staff
is Tomorrow's CEO.

1669
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:58,980
What could it be about?

1670
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,710
There are five mini missions.

1671
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,290
In each round, you'll pick
a name tag randomly.

1672
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,920
The titles available will be
CEO, Deputy Manager, Manager,

1673
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,460
Assistant Manager, Supervisor,
Staff, and Intern.

1674
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,330
You'll be divided
into different titles.

1675
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,900
You'll be carrying out according
to the title you pick.

1676
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,560
The CEO will be doing
the easiest mission.

1677
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,690
The staff and intern will have to...

1678
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,790
- do a more difficult mission.
- All right.

1679
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,230
- It must be hard.
- Intern must be the hardest.

1680
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:24,130
Once you succeed in your mission,

1681
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,230
- twenty minutes will be deducted.
- That's nice.

1682
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,400
That means one of you can go home
right away...

1683
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,610
if you succeed in the first mission.

1684
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:30,250
- All right!
- One of us?

1685
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:32,670
- Boombastic!
- Boombastic!

1686
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,110
Boombastic!

1687
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,540
Please pick your title
before the first mission.

1688
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,940
- I'll be picking it last.
- Do we just pick it now?

1689
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,610
- Yes, please pick it now.
- I want to pick CEO.

1690
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,860
But if we get off work too early,
we won't get enough airtime.

1691
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,860
- That's...
- That's...

1692
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,420
- Come on.
- You can't have it all.

1693
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,500
Why are you so greedy
over your airtime?

1694
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,790
- You can't have it all.
- Darn it.

1695
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:50,670
- This is it.
- I picked Assistant Manager.

1696
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:52,020
- It's not a good thing, right?
- I picked CEO.

1697
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,360
Didn't they peek beforehand?

1698
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,630
- Who picked CEO?
- I'm the intern.

1699
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:57,170
- You're Supervisor.
- I picked Deputy Manager.

1700
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,540
I picked Manager!

1701
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,940
I'm second-highest after CEO.

1702
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,080
(And...)

1703
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,150
Assistant Manager
is right in the middle.

1704
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:08,110
- He's the staff.
- Intern, please stand over here.

1705
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:09,290
And the CEO will be standing
on this side.

1706
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,440
Please stand on the squares.

1707
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,610
I'm a staff on this show too.

1708
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:14,750
Staff Ha.

1709
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:16,360
- Are you the deputy manager?
- Yes, I am.

1710
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,560
- You're the manager?
- That's right.

1711
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,580
Deputy Manager is a higher position.

1712
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,630
Oh, is it?

1713
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:20,920
(Deputy Manager
is a higher position.)

1714
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:24,230
- Come here!
- I didn't know.

1715
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:26,060
- How dare you!
- I didn't know. I'm sorry.

1716
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:28,230
- You're in a higher position?
- Of course.

1717
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:30,670
How did the bicycle thief
become a manager?

1718
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:32,730
Are you next to me?

1719
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,650
You assistant manager. How dare you.

1720
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:37,880
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
- Hey, Intern Kook.

1721
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:39,440
Hey, Intern Kook.

1722
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,080
- Hey, Intern!
- Yes.

1723
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,380
Are we doing a role play too?

1724
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,040
- Of course!
- Of course we should.

1725
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,790
Of course we should.
How dare these punks...

1726
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:48,150
I'm so sorry, sir.

1727
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,360
What a mess of a company.

1728
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,460
- It's a mess. Do a proper job.
- Assistant Manager, get down.

1729
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,960
- Yes, sir.
- Why didn't you discipline them?

1730
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,650
Hey! Get in the square, you punk!

1731
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:56,770
Wait. Companies aren't like this
these days.

1732
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,360
There's no such company these days.

1733
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,460
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1734
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,270
- Can you behave like an intern?
- Intern Kim.

1735
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:04,630
Why are you behaving like a thug?

1736
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:05,670
Why are you acting like a thug?

1737
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:07,880
How can you wear shorts
to the company?

1738
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,670
I can leave the company anytime
if I don't like it here.

1739
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:11,940
You can't do that.

1740
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,580
- What is this?
- Seriously.

1741
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,880
Interns are supposed to...

1742
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,790
That's what interns do, right?

1743
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:18,380
- Hey.
- He's like Generation MZ.

1744
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,790
- If I don't like it...
- He's like Generation MZ.

1745
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,790
Okay, we heard you.
Give us the jegi.

1746
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,560
(Throwing)

1747
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,560
He used to study
in the States, so...

1748
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,650
That's American style.

1749
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,560
Hey, JK. Calm down.

1750
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,560
Okay.

1751
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,730
- Here's the first mission.
- What is it?

1752
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:33,330
The first mission...

1753
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,270
is Walking in Place in Group.

1754
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:36,360
- What?
- That'd be easy.

1755
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,560
You'll be wearing a blindfold,

1756
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,580
and you'll walk in place
in your square.

1757
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,940
- What's so hard about it?
- You can check your place...

1758
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,110
every 5 to 15 seconds.

1759
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,580
So we must stay within the square.

1760
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,650
You should stay in it.

1761
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:50,110
The CEO can walk for 15 seconds,
20 seconds for Deputy Manager,

1762
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,080
then 25, 30, 35,
and 40 seconds respectively.

1763
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,060
Lastly, Intern Kook must walk
for 45 seconds.

1764
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:55,110
- This is...
- It's quite simple.

1765
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:57,080
- Once you're done with it,
- Of course we can all do it.

1766
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,380
it'll be a success if you're
in the square.

1767
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,020
- We can easily pull this off.
- What's so hard about it?

1768
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,100
You can't do it?

1769
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,230
Let's speak less and practice more!

1770
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,460
(The intern from LA
gives an order to his bosses.)

1771
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,770
- How can an intern...
- How can an intern...

1772
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:08,040
give out an order?

1773
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,210
Once I say start, you can begin.

1774
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:11,830
I'll tell you where you are
every five seconds.

1775
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:12,940
We must shake our arms too?

1776
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,170
Yes, you should. Get ready.

1777
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:15,850
- Intern Kook.
- Yes, sir.

1778
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:18,170
Keep your mouth shut, okay?

1779
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,750
- Yes, sir.
- Get ready.

1780
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,020
Just walk in your place.

1781
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,040
Go!

1782
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,080
- Left.
- You must lift your legs high.

1783
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,790
- Left.
- This isn't hard.

1784
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:27,790
- What is this?
- It's not hard.

1785
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:31,250
- It's not hard at all.
- We'll be in our places for sure.

1786
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,360
That's for sure.

1787
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,860
How is this hard?

1788
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,360
(Everyone is walking confidently.)

1789
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,580
(CEO Jeon takes off
her blindfold first.)

1790
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:52,080
CEO, you can take off
your blindfold. You can stop.

1791
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,950
I'm right in the same place.

1792
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:57,060
- I'm dizzy.
- Deputy Manager, take it off.

1793
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:59,450
I'm in the same place, right?

1794
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:00,890
(Even Deputy Manager Yoo made it.)

1795
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:02,620
- I could've walked out of it.
- I can hear you.

1796
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,950
(It's Manager Yang's turn.)

1797
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:06,160
Manager Yang, take it off.

1798
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,660
I could've been in big trouble.

1799
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:09,370
- Gosh.
- What do I do?

1800
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,140
- What?
- Assistant Manager, take it off.

1801
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,200
What do I do? Wait a minute.

1802
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,410
- Hold on.
- I made it, didn't I?

1803
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:15,560
Supervisor Song,
take off your blindfold.

1804
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,760
I'm taking it off.

1805
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:20,200
(Even Supervisor Song succeeded.)

1806
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,620
(There are two more members
until their success.)

1807
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,350
Staff Ha, take your blindfold off.

1808
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:27,910
(They failed.)

1809
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:29,290
Intern Kook,
take your blindfold off.

1810
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,450
Those punks...

1811
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,620
- You guys should get down.
- Those punks...

1812
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:36,030
(The superiors are infuriated.)

1813
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:37,620
Are you kidding me?

1814
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,200
Staff Ha and Intern Kook failed.

1815
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,530
- How could you not pull this off?
- Why did you fail?

1816
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:42,930
You only had to walk in place.

1817
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:45,290
Because you kept talking,

1818
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:46,470
I got distracted.

1819
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:48,200
- Who is he to scold Staff Ha?
- I mean...

1820
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,410
Intern Kook.

1821
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:50,470
Why did you do such a horrible job?

1822
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:51,870
You were way out of the square.

1823
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:54,510
It's not that. I'm not even joking.

1824
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:56,310
Let me explain.

1825
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:58,120
I walked, following his voice.

1826
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,680
I also followed your voice.

1827
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,580
Here's the second mission.

1828
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,510
You'll kick jegi as many times
as you're given...

1829
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:05,890
depending on your title.

1830
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:08,120
You just need to kick at least
one more than your superior.

1831
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,830
- Is that so? Okay.
- Okay.

1832
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:10,930
Can I kick more than I have to?

1833
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:12,790
Then the person after you
will have to kick more.

1834
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:14,600
- Then it should start from one.
- So I can kick less.

1835
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,930
- One, two, three, four...
- We should just kick one more.

1836
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,660
So we should think of it this way.

1837
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:20,330
It's better that those
who are more athletic...

1838
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:22,010
- do it later.
- It gets worse.

1839
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,780
You're a mere intern.

1840
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,040
Can't an intern voice his opinion?

1841
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,950
The higher-ups will make
the final decision.

1842
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,180
We'll tell you the decision,

1843
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,410
- so just stay still.
- Excuse me.

1844
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:33,140
- So he means...
- Then why did you accept us?

1845
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:36,720
Hey, you're still just a staff.
What's with this Metallica shirt?

1846
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:40,890
He's such a boomer.

1847
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:44,600
You can wear that for your
club activities on weekends.

1848
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,720
What is this?

1849
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,830
(What?)

1850
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:49,930
- What is this?
- What about it?

1851
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:52,160
Who curls their bangs like this?

1852
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:56,310
- Wait a minute.
- What?

1853
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:57,970
- There's such a company?
- Who curls...

1854
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,910
their bangs like this?

1855
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:02,350
What are you, a dean at school?

1856
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:06,040
- I was just born this way.
- These punks...

1857
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,120
I was born this way.

1858
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,640
How dare you.

1859
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,990
Let's start playing.

1860
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:12,790
- Kick it just once.
- You need to kick it just once.

1861
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,030
- This isn't hard.
- Just one.

1862
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,030
Here we go.

1863
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,720
Just kick it once.
Don't kick it twice.

1864
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,950
- But Ji Hyo is the problem.
- I can't kick it.

1865
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,330
Don't kick it twice.

1866
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:23,930
- One. Hey!
- No, you can't do that.

1867
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,490
- One. Hey!
- No, you can't do that.

1868
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,060
I told you to kick it just once!

1869
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,970
- I didn't know.
- Deputy Manager, kick three times.

1870
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:31,970
- That CEO!
- CEO Jeon!

1871
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:33,970
- CEO Jeon!
- That just increases the number.

1872
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:36,310
The CEO is so dumb!

1873
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:37,910
Why is she so dumb?

1874
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:39,310
- I mean...
- Seriously!

1875
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:40,620
- What was she thinking?
- How did she...

1876
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:41,790
How did she become a CEO?

1877
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:43,220
- Staff Ha.
- Yes. I'm sorry, ma'am.

1878
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,260
How did you become a CEO?

1879
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,160
She's the daughter of the founder.

1880
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,830
- So she's from a rich family.
- Why did she kick it twice?

1881
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:49,850
- She got in through connection?
- Now...

1882
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,100
(Now...)

1883
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:54,530
- It's 1:51 p.m.
- Let's go.

1884
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:56,930
(One of them can get off work
as it's reached 1:51 p.m.)

1885
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:58,430
- Who's going home?
- One of you...

1886
01:00:58,430 --> 01:00:59,890
can get off work now.

1887
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:01,330
- Is that so?
- So who's going?

1888
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:04,010
The highlight of office life
is ghost leg.

1889
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:06,330
- Bring in the ghost leg.
- All right.

1890
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,350
(Nerve-racking)

1891
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:10,310
Are we really getting off work?
Do we really get to go home?

1892
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:11,680
- We're really going home?
- We're playing ghost leg.

1893
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:13,240
Can we just leave like that?

1894
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,720
It's none other than ghost leg.

1895
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:16,120
Seriously.

1896
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,580
It's been over eight hours
for those who came early.

1897
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,580
We came at 8 a.m.

1898
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:19,910
- For how long have we been here?
- This is amazing.

1899
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:21,580
But it'll be amazing
if Jong Kook gets to leave.

1900
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:22,990
- I want to go home too.
- Jong Kook.

1901
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:24,560
As you can see,

1902
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:27,790
"getting off work" is written
behind "candidates."

1903
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:29,260
Please write your names on top.

1904
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,260
- Let's write our names!
- I want to go home.

1905
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,100
- Then I'll pick number 2.
- Number 2?

1906
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,330
- I pick number 4.
- Will you pick number 4?

1907
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:34,870
Yes, I'll choose four,
which stands for "death."

1908
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:36,700
- Jong Kook.
- Work hard to death to survive!

1909
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,510
- So Min.
- I'll take whatever is left over.

1910
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:39,680
That's so cool.

1911
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,010
You can write my name wherever.

1912
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:42,910
- I'll take number five.
- Ji Hyo.

1913
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,410
Can we draw lines wherever we want?

1914
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,850
- Yes, you can.
- Go ahead and draw them.

1915
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:47,040
I'll draw them here.

1916
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,040
Make sure to draw them clearly.

1917
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,140
I won't join in since I'm unlucky.

1918
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,790
Right. We should draw them clearly.

1919
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:53,220
This is driving me crazy.

1920
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,430
I think it's all about luck.

1921
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:57,330
(It's still in the middle of the day
at around 2 p.m.)

1922
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:58,600
- That's enough.
- Is this all right?

1923
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,720
- Yes, it is.
- I think there should be one more.

1924
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,720
There are lines
over here too, right?

1925
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,030
- Yes.
- Let's start.

1926
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:03,890
Please rip it off.

1927
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:05,700
There are more lines on the bottom?

1928
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:06,700
So they drew them in advance.

1929
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,100
- They drew them in advance.
- Let's see.

1930
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,140
You can start.

1931
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:10,510
- Let's start with Haha.
- Let's start with Haha.

1932
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:12,040
(They're starting with Staff Ha.)

1933
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,200
I want to get off work.

1934
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,240
One of the three candidates
can get off work.

1935
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,850
Let's start with Haha.

1936
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:17,850
One, two...

1937
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:20,220
- Let's go! Go that way!
- One, two...

1938
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,510
(Let's go! Go that way!)

1939
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:24,390
Go that way! Go straight!
That's great!

1940
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,680
I'm going home!

1941
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,490
Yes! Haha is eliminated.

1942
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:32,700
(Disappointed for real)

1943
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,160
- No.
- You lost your chance!

1944
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,290
Haha is out.

1945
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:37,490
- All right!
- You lost your chance!

1946
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:38,870
- Next!
- Se Chan.

1947
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:40,660
- Let's go with Se Chan.
- Let's go!

1948
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,930
(Manager Yang has been working
for 6 hours...)

1949
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:44,310
(after coming in first.)

1950
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:45,910
- This is correct, right?
- No, you should go up.

1951
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:47,350
- Go up and down.
- Then come down again.

1952
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,040
- You should come down. Yes!
- Come this way.

1953
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,080
That's it!

1954
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:51,910
That's it. Push him to the corner.

1955
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,120
Go!

1956
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,910
(What's the fate of Manager Yang
who came to work first?)

1957
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,890
- Go!
- You should go down!

1958
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,990
(He's chosen
as one of the candidates.)

1959
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:05,530
(Manager Yang
becomes one of the candidates.)

1960
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:07,930
(Disappointed)

1961
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:10,760
- I'm one of the candidates!
- How annoying!

1962
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:12,100
You're one of the three candidates.

1963
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,970
- How annoying!
- Yes!

1964
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,140
- So Min!
- Next is So Bal.

1965
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:17,700
(Up next is CEO Jeon.)

1966
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,810
Ji Hyo, I got lucky
thanks to the line you drew.

1967
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:22,600
I don't think I can get off work.

1968
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,870
(So Min is out.)

1969
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,410
- Oh, no!
- Yes!

1970
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:29,410
(She got eliminated right away.)

1971
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:30,680
That's just like how So Min is.

1972
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,080
So Min!

1973
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,220
- You should stay a bit longer.
- It's my turn!

1974
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:36,120
(Next is Intern Kim.)

1975
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,060
- Jong Kook.
- It's Jong Kook's turn.

1976
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:39,530
(Let's go, Jong Kook)

1977
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,530
(Let's go home, Jong Kook)

1978
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:43,390
Let's go home, Jong Kook

1979
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:45,490
- No, stay.
- Let's go, Jong Kook

1980
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,930
- Don't go
- Let's go home, Jong Kook

1981
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:49,410
- Don't go
- No!

1982
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:51,600
- No, Jong Kook!
- No!

1983
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,740
(He's out.)

1984
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,040
No.

1985
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:57,470
- My goodness.
- It will be me.

1986
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:59,280
Hey, three of us remain.

1987
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,540
- It will be me.
- Three of us.

1988
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,180
- It will be me.
- One of the three...

1989
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,010
One of the three will go here.

1990
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,680
Suk Jin will end up here

1991
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,490
No, I will end up there

1992
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:10,760
Ji Hyo and I will take two spots

1993
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,390
- One of the three
- No way

1994
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,100
- No way
- One of us will get off work

1995
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,760
One of us will get off work

1996
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,970
That won't happen

1997
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:21,930
- I will end up there
- That will happen

1998
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,930
- Let's go.
- Like this

1999
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:25,540
You will get eliminated

2000
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:27,100
Like this

2001
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,850
I will get included

2002
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:32,180
(He suddenly begins.)

2003
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:34,620
Up.

2004
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:39,490
(Suk Jin was the second latest.
Will he get off work in 4 hours?)

2005
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:40,950
Up.

2006
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:44,330
My goodness.

2007
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,560
(He is out.)

2008
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:48,100
My goodness.

2009
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,870
(Like this, he got eliminated.)

2010
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:53,700
(Assistant Manager Ji
failed to get off work early.)

2011
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:57,600
He got eliminated

2012
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,810
- No way.
- He got eliminated

2013
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:01,040
- He got eliminated
- How did that happen?

2014
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,350
- Ji Hyo.
- I can't believe it.

2015
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:04,970
The candidates have been decided.

2016
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:06,970
- We are the candidates.
- We are the ones...

2017
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:08,540
- who came early.
- Yes.

2018
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:09,810
- We came early.
- You are right.

2019
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:11,260
Ji Hyo, let's begin.

2020
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,530
Okay.

2021
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,390
- Next to her...
- Jae Suk is here.

2022
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:17,660
- Me.
- Okay.

2023
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,290
- Who will it be?
- This is incredible.

2024
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:22,160
It will be 1 of the 3.
The current time is 1:51 p.m.

2025
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:24,640
- I arrived at 8 a.m.
- You will get off work before 2 p.m.

2026
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,410
- Let's go.
- It shouldn't be Jae Suk.

2027
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:29,140
- Let's go.
- Take off the strip.

2028
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,870
- Here we go.
- Who will it be?

2029
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,330
One,

2030
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:34,280
two...

2031
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:38,350
(Who will realize the dream
by getting off work during the day?)

2032
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:39,450
Two...

2033
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,080
- Ji Hyo is out.
- My goodness.

2034
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,260
- Ji Hyo is out.
- My goodness.

2035
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:45,490
- Ji Hyo is out.
- All right.

2036
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:46,680
- Ji Hyo is out.
- My goodness.

2037
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:47,890
(Oh, no.)

2038
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:49,060
Ji Hyo is out.

2039
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,100
- Ji Hyo is out.
- Come on.

2040
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,990
- It will be 1 of us.
- Team 8 a.m.

2041
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,390
- Team 8 a.m.
- Team 8 a.m.

2042
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,220
No.

2043
01:05:57,390 --> 01:06:01,430
(Whoever gets off work
won't deal with heavy traffic.)

2044
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:04,810
(Who will get off work
during the day?)

2045
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:05,870
No.

2046
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:10,240
(Se Chan, Getting off work)

2047
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:13,080
(Manager Yang won.)

2048
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,490
All right.

2049
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,580
(Jae Suk lost the chance
to get off work early.)

2050
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:21,530
Bye, Se Chan.

2051
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:22,530
- I will get going now.
- Bye.

2052
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:24,100
Manager Yang will get off work.

2053
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,720
- Get off work.
- For real?

2054
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,850
This is nice.

2055
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,660
- I will follow you soon.
- Okay, Jong Kook.

2056
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,700
It's nice that you are leaving early
after coming early. Good work.

2057
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,200
- I will get going now.
- Manager Yang.

2058
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:35,510
Is he really getting off work now?

2059
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:36,760
I came early.

2060
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,430
- Se Chan came early.
- You know,

2061
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:41,010
- you arrived first.
- I did.

2062
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:42,510
- It's fitting.
- It's fair.

2063
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:43,810
- Bye.
- I will get going now.

2064
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,740
- Work hard.
- Bye.

2065
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:46,780
Bye.

2066
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:49,580
Let's go.

2067
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,310
Okay.

2068
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:52,410
(He runs off
to avoid getting called back.)

2069
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:53,510
This is unbelievable.

2070
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:56,180
Se Jin and I Re, let's go.

2071
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:58,450
- All right.
- We will get going now.

2072
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:01,100
Congratulations
on getting off work first.

2073
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,890
La la la la la

2074
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:03,970
(This is exciting.)

2075
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:07,040
- Good work.
- Good work.

2076
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,040
(Manager Yang
gets off work after 6 hours.)

2077
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,100
I will get going now.

2078
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:12,410
(Manager Yang arrived at 8:01 a.m.
and left at 1:51 p.m.)

2079
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:14,970
The remaining members
will continue on with jegichagi.

2080
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:17,720
- That really killed my enthusiasm.
- Same here.

2081
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,450
That killed my mood.

2082
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:21,890
She kicked it 2 times,
so kick it 3 times.

2083
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:24,390
- All right.
- Why did you kick it two times?

2084
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:25,950
You can kick it four times.

2085
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:27,660
- She is the problem.
- I am the problem.

2086
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:28,720
- Seriously.
- Look.

2087
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,120
Had you kicked it once,

2088
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,390
she would have only needed
to kick it four times.

2089
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:34,060
- I have to kick it three times.
- I will move to another company.

2090
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:36,100
- Hey, intern.
- Fire me.

2091
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,220
You fire!

2092
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:38,700
- "You fire?"
- Are you calling him fire?

2093
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:39,830
Are you calling me fire?

2094
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,260
Let's go.

2095
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:44,060
- Three.
- You just need to kick it.

2096
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,330
One, two...

2097
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:46,510
Hey!

2098
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,140
- Why did you kick it three times?
- I was supposed to do that.

2099
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:49,200
You are right.

2100
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,950
What was that?

2101
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:53,080
- I am sorry.
- For goodness' sake.

2102
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,080
(He got mad for no reason.)

2103
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,510
- I am so annoyed.
- What was that?

2104
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:56,680
I am sorry.

2105
01:07:56,790 --> 01:07:59,080
- I am sorry.
- I was supposed to do that.

2106
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,390
- I need to kick it 4 times, right?
- Kick it 4 times. Hurry up.

2107
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:03,080
- Can you kick it five times?
- No.

2108
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:04,490
- Just do it.
- You can do it.

2109
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:09,330
(Sudden slapstick comedy)

2110
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:11,990
- What was that?
- He did that on purpose.

2111
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:14,540
- You failed.
- He did that on purpose.

2112
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,160
- I think he did that on purpose.
- It was so contrived.

2113
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,310
- How will you edit this?
- That was...

2114
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:18,910
- I swear...
- That was...

2115
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:20,200
I didn't do that on purpose.

2116
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,950
How will you edit this?

2117
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:24,080
Even elementary school kids
will know that it was contrived.

2118
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,870
- I swear...
- Why did you do that?

2119
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:27,990
- I didn't do that on purpose.
- You did that on purpose.

2120
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:30,220
- You were ready to fall down.
- I didn't do that on purpose.

2121
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:31,990
- You moved your foot back.
- No, I didn't.

2122
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,490
Two, three, four.

2123
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:35,680
I should have kicked it like this.

2124
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,330
Start over then.

2125
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:40,220
You failed.

2126
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,590
(Suk Jin succeeded belatedly,
but they failed!)

2127
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:42,590
I didn't do that on purpose.

2128
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:43,830
It's time for the next mission.

2129
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:45,000
Why...

2130
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:47,060
Before we begin the mission,

2131
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,760
- you will pick your position.
- Okay.

2132
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,460
Jong Kook shouldn't be the CEO.

2133
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:52,740
- If Jong Kook becomes the CEO...
- Guys,

2134
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:53,910
- line up.
- What?

2135
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,470
Intern has it the worst.

2136
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,340
I can't move to the top.

2137
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,450
Are you the intern?

2138
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:00,380
- She shouldn't be the intern.
- Hey.

2139
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:01,490
(She went from top to bottom.)

2140
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:02,680
Go in there.

2141
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,290
She shouldn't be the intern.

2142
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:05,680
Please treat us with respect.

2143
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,990
Respect, my foot!

2144
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,350
Excuse me?

2145
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:09,720
- Respect, my foot!
- What are you doing?

2146
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,720
What are you doing?

2147
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:14,300
- Watch it.
- It will be hard...

2148
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:17,220
to complete the mission
since So Min is the intern.

2149
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,340
This mission is...

2150
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,500
Draw a Circle
the Elephant Trunk Spin.

2151
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,760
- We are ruined.
- This is bad.

2152
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,240
- This is bad.
- This game made me nauseous.

2153
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,910
- One person will go at a time.
- Okay.

2154
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,430
After five spins,

2155
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:29,210
draw a circle that is bigger
than the R mark.

2156
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:30,600
I should have been the intern.

2157
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,670
Your circle must be bigger
than the last person's.

2158
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:35,310
- So we need to make it small.
- Outside the R mark, right?

2159
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,790
Your circle must be bigger
than the CEO's.

2160
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:39,880
Manager's circle must be bigger
than Deputy Manager's.

2161
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,290
Intern's circle must be the biggest.

2162
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:42,490
It sounds fun.

2163
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:43,850
- I am in trouble.
- Okay.

2164
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:46,220
- It's doable.
- I draw first, right?

2165
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,220
The circles shouldn't overlap.

2166
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:48,700
- Make it small.
- It will be hard.

2167
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:49,890
All right.

2168
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:51,560
Get ready.

2169
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,240
Set, go.

2170
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,260
- One,
- One,

2171
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:56,960
- two,
- two...

2172
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,930
- three,
- Already...

2173
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:00,950
- four...
- Let's go.

2174
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:02,080
- Go.
- Go.

2175
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,100
Five.

2176
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,140
Three, two, one.

2177
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:09,620
- Look at that.
- There we go.

2178
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:11,180
- Five.
- Let's go.

2179
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,790
- Three, two, one.
- Bigger than that.

2180
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,050
- You succeeded.
- Okay.

2181
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:16,630
- Let's go.
- Good job.

2182
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,350
- Five.
- Three,

2183
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:19,800
two, one.

2184
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,830
- That's good.
- I am dizzy.

2185
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,300
- All right.
- We will succeed.

2186
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:25,090
I am worried about him.

2187
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:26,300
This is bad.

2188
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:27,500
I get dizzy really easily.

2189
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,710
- Set, go.
- He gets dizzy really easily.

2190
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,600
- Still,
- One,

2191
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,500
- he won't mess it up on purpose.
- two,

2192
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,000
- three,
- You are going fast. Three.

2193
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,250
four...

2194
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:39,510
(Staff Yoo has no skills
in the elephant trunk spin.)

2195
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:43,880
(Will he succeed this time?)

2196
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,160
- Four...
- Five.

2197
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:46,960
- Five.
- Go.

2198
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:47,990
- Go.
- Three,

2199
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:49,630
- two, one.
- Hurry up.

2200
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:51,700
Jae Suk!

2201
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:52,720
One.

2202
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:54,300
Jae Suk!

2203
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:55,700
Why did you draw it so big?

2204
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,800
What are you doing?

2205
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,870
In any case, he succeeded.

2206
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:01,100
- What was I supposed to do?
- How did you draw it like this?

2207
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:03,060
What are you, a thug?

2208
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:04,880
- Unbelievable.
- For goodness' sake.

2209
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,600
What was I supposed to do?

2210
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,750
- Why did you ruin the mission?
- I didn't ruin the mission.

2211
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,000
You should have drawn it better.

2212
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,380
I was dizzy, okay?

2213
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:13,050
- For goodness' sake.
- I was about to collapse.

2214
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:14,250
Still...

2215
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,620
- I was about to collapse.
- It's okay, So Min.

2216
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:17,120
Just make sure it doesn't overlap.

2217
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,620
- That's too big.
- Make it big.

2218
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:19,880
I haven't gone yet.
You are going after me.

2219
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,330
- Haha!
- He is next.

2220
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:22,590
- Haven't you gone yet?
- You are going after me.

2221
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:23,990
- How are we supposed to do this?
- Haha.

2222
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:26,330
- I thought I was going next.
- Do well.

2223
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:27,800
- Here I go.
- Go ahead.

2224
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,200
- Set...
- Set, go.

2225
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:31,040
- One,
- One...

2226
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,260
- two,
- He is fast.

2227
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,670
- three,
- three...

2228
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:34,930
- four...
- Go slower. Four.

2229
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:36,300
- Three,
- Put one hand on the wall.

2230
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:37,560
two, one.

2231
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,380
- All right.
- That's good.

2232
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:40,630
Intern will go last.

2233
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,840
- See how big you can draw it.
- Practice.

2234
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,250
- She will succeed.
- Make it as big as possible.

2235
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:46,470
You will succeed, So Min.

2236
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:48,180
- That's it.
- There you go.

2237
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,510
So Min, you can do it.

2238
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,290
Not even a small bit
of the circle should overlap.

2239
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:53,880
- So Min, you can do it.
- Go.

2240
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:55,920
- You are the last one.
- You know,

2241
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,700
my higher-ups are giving me
an overweight workload.

2242
01:11:58,700 --> 01:11:59,800
- Hey.
- Put one hand on the wall.

2243
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,000
You mean a heavy workload.

2244
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,500
It's a heavy workload,

2245
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,060
- not an overweight workload.
- Overweight.

2246
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,260
To be honest, I didn't see
what was wrong with it.

2247
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,600
(To be honest, I didn't see
what was wrong with it.)

2248
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:09,910
I was like, "What's wrong with it?"

2249
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:12,170
It's a heavy workload,
not an overweight workload.

2250
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:13,500
- A heavy workload.
- If you succeed,

2251
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,050
- you can deduct 20 minutes.
- I feel dizzy.

2252
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:17,750
- You can do it.
- Make it as big as possible.

2253
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,970
Set, go.

2254
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:21,510
- So Min.
- One,

2255
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,140
- two...
- Two...

2256
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,310
This is bad. I am already dizzy.

2257
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:25,490
- Three,
- Three...

2258
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:27,250
- four,
- This is bad.

2259
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:28,630
- five.
- Five.

2260
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:30,090
- Three, two,
- Make it as big as possible.

2261
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:31,330
one.

2262
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:34,590
(Can Intern Jeon be a hero?)

2263
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,260
- Make it as big as possible.
- Two,

2264
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,300
one.

2265
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,890
You failed.

2266
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,630
- Why?
- The right side overlapped.

2267
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:42,710
It overlapped.

2268
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:44,040
- Hold on.
- All right.

2269
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,080
- I was so dizzy.
- Hey.

2270
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,550
- I am not disappointed at all.
- You failed to deduct time.

2271
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:50,100
We will do the sketchbook game.

2272
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:52,310
- We can do well this time.
- We will play...

2273
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:53,780
- the three-syllable word game.
- We will play that game.

2274
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:55,510
Skinny jeans.

2275
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:57,880
- Tick, tock.
- Keep doing that.

2276
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,620
Two, one.

2277
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,160
- For goodness' sake.
- Don't be flippant.

2278
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:04,530
You got this. It will be easy.

2279
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,000
This is bad.

2280
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:09,460
- It's easy.
- How is this jangseung?

2281
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:10,890
You should know from the ears!

2282
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,200
- Can't you see the ears?
- Why are you laughing?

2283
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,300
All right. It's past 2:45 p.m.,

2284
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,280
- so five people can get off work.
- Already?

2285
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,630
(It's the regular time
to get off work!)

2286
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:21,640
Can we go home?

2287
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,340
We will bring in the item
for getting off work.

2288
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:25,510
- My goodness.
- What is that?

2289
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:27,120
What is that?

2290
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,620
I would hate to work overtime.

2291
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:30,340
It's simple.

2292
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:32,120
- There are six cards.
- They are keys.

2293
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,850
Only one doesn't work.

2294
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:37,180
(Only one doesn't work.)

2295
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,090
- Unbelievable.
- This is insane.

2296
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:40,720
- This is insane.
- Unbelievable.

2297
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:42,720
You will need to hear the sound.

2298
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:43,800
(Key card sudden death game)

2299
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,300
- Unbelievable.
- This is insane.

2300
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,870
- Only one doesn't work?
- This is insane.

2301
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:48,960
- I have no luck in such matters.
- Me neither.

2302
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,260
- All right.
- Pick one.

2303
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:51,930
Okay.

2304
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:54,100
- Who will go first?
- Take one each.

2305
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,340
- Don't try it now.
- Die trying and you will live.

2306
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,950
- Die trying and you will live.
- Am I number one?

2307
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:00,250
All right.

2308
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,640
Do we go in numerical order?

2309
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,640
- Take turns as you see fit.
- Okay.

2310
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,590
- My goodness.
- I will get ready to go out.

2311
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:07,960
I will get ready to go out.

2312
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,220
- Number one.
- This is nerve-racking.

2313
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:10,920
Being number one makes me nervous.

2314
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,000
I am number five.

2315
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,660
- Why was number 1 remaining?
- It can't be number 1.

2316
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:15,500
Why was number one remaining?

2317
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,460
Who will go first?
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors?

2318
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:18,460
I will go first.

2319
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:19,700
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2320
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:20,840
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Let's do that.

2321
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:21,840
- Rock...
- Does the winner go first?

2322
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,040
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2323
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:25,040
- Okay.
- Three of us.

2324
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,080
Rock-paper-scissors.

2325
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,410
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- All right.

2326
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:28,880
- I hope mine works.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2327
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,580
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Will I go first?

2328
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:32,310
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Second.

2329
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:33,750
- I have a bad feeling about this.
- Jong Kook will go first...

2330
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:35,010
- and I will go second.
- If my key card doesn't work,

2331
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:36,550
- everyone else will go home.
- Yes.

2332
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,180
All right. Please begin right away.

2333
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:39,510
- If someone fails to open the door,
- Here I go.

2334
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:41,380
- everyone else will go home.
- Please.

2335
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:44,330
I hope the door doesn't open

2336
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:45,960
- My goodness.
- I hope the door doesn't open

2337
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,700
It's better to go later
so that someone else fails first.

2338
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:49,830
- Work overtime
- Let's go.

2339
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:51,560
- Work overtime
- Work overtime

2340
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:54,600
- Work overtime
- Work overtime

2341
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,540
- I will be heading home.
- Work overtime

2342
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:58,710
- If you fail, all of us will live.
- Work overtime

2343
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:01,080
Jong Kook will work overtime

2344
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:03,880
Jong Kook will work overtime

2345
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,310
- Did it open?
- What?

2346
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:06,310
(What?)

2347
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,790
(Will the first person work
overtime?)

2348
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:12,090
Overtime

2349
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:13,790
- Did it open?
- What?

2350
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,460
It opened!

2351
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:17,890
(It opened!)

2352
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:19,830
Home! I will be heading home now!

2353
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:24,800
(Laughing)

2354
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,060
(It opened.)

2355
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,100
Home! I will be heading home now!

2356
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:31,670
(Sighing)

2357
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:36,000
(He shows the excitement
of getting off work.)

2358
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,100
(Slamming)

2359
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,210
Please stay
and watch their reactions.

2360
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:40,970
- Their reactions.
- Right.

2361
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:42,620
It will be fun to watch.

2362
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:45,180
- Who is going second?
- Me.

2363
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,880
(Suk Jin is the next person
who wants to get off work.)

2364
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,830
Please yell, "I am off for the day."

2365
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:51,030
- Okay. This is nerve-racking.
- Work overtime

2366
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:54,390
- Work overtime
- Work overtime

2367
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:56,560
- Suk Jin, work overtime.
- No.

2368
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,590
- I am off for the day.
- Work overtime

2369
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:01,200
Please make him work overtime.

2370
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,800
Please. That way,
all four of us will go home.

2371
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,460
- Work overtime.
- Work overtime.

2372
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:06,470
My heart is beating so fast.
What should I do?

2373
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:07,840
- Work overtime.
- Work overtime.

2374
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,080
(What will become of Suk Jin?)

2375
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,080
My heart is beating so fast.
What should I do?

2376
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:12,840
(Escape)

2377
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:13,840
(Screaming)

2378
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,090
(Laughing)

2379
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:20,250
I will head home.

2380
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,460
(The two members who came last
will get off work on time!)

2381
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,590
So Min is genuinely upset.

2382
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,200
This is driving me crazy.
I am unsure about this one.

2383
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:29,090
- I am more unsure about this one.
- I am off for the day.

2384
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:30,300
Do you want to switch with mine?

2385
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,300
- No.
- This is exciting.

2386
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,560
I am off for the day. Bye.

2387
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:36,760
- Work overtime.
- So Min looks cheerful.

2388
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,130
- I am sure about this one.
- I am really nervous.

2389
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:40,380
- Look at her face.
- I was number three all day long.

2390
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:42,600
- Please.
- Work overtime.

2391
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,100
(Ringing)

2392
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,120
So Min.

2393
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,470
(What?)

2394
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:49,790
(Will So Min work overtime?)

2395
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:50,880
So Bal.

2396
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:51,920
(Ringing)

2397
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,920
(Beeping)

2398
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:56,420
(The door opened!)

2399
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:59,220
That startled me.

2400
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:00,460
(That's too bad.)

2401
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:02,390
- How is the order so perfect?
- Bye.

2402
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:04,700
- How is the order so perfect?
- Seriously.

2403
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,130
It sounded like
the door wouldn't open.

2404
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:09,240
The sound was strange, right?

2405
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,500
- It rang first.
- Yes.

2406
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,930
It didn't beep right away.

2407
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:13,280
- One of the three.
- I hope it's Jae Suk.

2408
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,670
I bet it's Jae Suk.

2409
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,580
I am from the future. You are it.

2410
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:18,710
He works so much these days.

2411
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:19,750
That's right.

2412
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:21,950
I want to head home now.

2413
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:23,290
- Go home, Ji Hyo.
- "I am off for the day."

2414
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:25,460
I am off for the day.
I think I am it.

2415
01:17:26,290 --> 01:17:29,790
(It's about time
a nonfunctioning key card appears.)

2416
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:32,800
(What will become
of the three remaining members?)

2417
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:36,720
- It opened.
- It opened.

2418
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:37,720
(The door opened again!)

2419
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,740
It opened.

2420
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:41,630
- I am off for the day.
- Hey. How did this happen?

2421
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:42,630
- It opened.
- It opened.

2422
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:44,800
(Oh my goodness.)

2423
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,100
How did this happen?

2424
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,540
- How did this happen?
- Seriously.

2425
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:49,250
I can't believe
we chose the key cards at random.

2426
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:51,880
- How did this happen?
- We played rock-paper-scissors.

2427
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,580
How did this happen
when we played rock-paper-scissors?

2428
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:54,810
Is this for real?

2429
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:57,640
How did four people pass?
It's unbelievable.

2430
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,120
I have a bad feeling
about key card number five.

2431
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,210
- Hey.
- Who is going next?

2432
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:01,630
- Me.
- What's your key card number?

2433
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:02,790
Mine is number 5
and his is number 6.

2434
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:05,800
Haha, if yours work...
It will be unbelievable.

2435
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,850
- Jae Suk wouldn't need to try.
- I arrived first today.

2436
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:10,300
- Please.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2437
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,370
- Thank you for your hard work.
- We played rock-paper-scissors.

2438
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:15,870
- Haha isn't exactly lucky.
- I am off for the day.

2439
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:17,930
- Please.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2440
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,100
- Please let it be him.
- If it's Jae Suk...

2441
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,580
- I am so nervous.
- This is really nerve-racking.

2442
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:24,970
Thank you for your hard work.
I am off for the day.

2443
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:27,140
He has a 50-percent chance
of getting off work.

2444
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:30,420
Think about what you will do
for an hour and a half.

2445
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:32,210
- Please.
- My goodness.

2446
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:33,550
- Please let it be him.
- He raised it.

2447
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:34,660
- Please.
- Let's hear the sound.

2448
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:36,030
- Please let it be him.
- He raised it.

2449
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:37,130
- Please.
- Let's hear the sound.

2450
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,530
(Please.)

2451
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:41,590
Let's hear the sound.

2452
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:44,170
I will try again.

2453
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:45,960
I will try again.

2454
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:46,960
(His heart dropped.)

2455
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,240
Hold on.

2456
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,560
- I think I did it wrong.
- Hold on.

2457
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:53,170
The sensor is here, right?
I put the card here.

2458
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:54,340
Okay.

2459
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:56,450
Good work.
Thank you for your hard work.

2460
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:58,470
Thank you for your hard work.

2461
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,470
Thank you for your hard work.
Good work.

2462
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:05,010
- Please let me go home.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2463
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:06,710
- Thank you for your hard work.
- I am off for the day.

2464
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:08,750
- All right.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2465
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:09,880
Let's see what happens.

2466
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,630
(He put it on the sensor.)

2467
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:14,250
I think it will work.

2468
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,920
(Who will work overtime
without getting paid?)

2469
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:22,870
Okay.

2470
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:26,540
(The door opened!)

2471
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:27,840
Let's go.

2472
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,880
This is unbelievable.

2473
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,710
(Jae Suk will work overtime.)

2474
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:36,250
This is unbelievable.

2475
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:38,350
We played rock-paper-scissors.

2476
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:39,850
- No way.
- How...

2477
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:42,420
Try your card.

2478
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:44,460
How did this happen?

2479
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:46,550
Let's go.

2480
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:47,830
I am off for the day.

2481
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,670
(Tapping)

2482
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:52,760
My goodness.

2483
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,560
It's strange.
How did Jae Suk pick that key card?

2484
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,600
I told you
that I am from the future.

2485
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,710
Let's go.

2486
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:59,930
Five members will get off work
and Jae Suk will work overtime.

2487
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:02,000
- Okay.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2488
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,340
We will get going now.

2489
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,140
- He has so much work.
- This is the absolute worst.

2490
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:06,420
- This is the absolute worst.
- I thought it would be me.

2491
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:07,920
This is the absolute worst.

2492
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,640
Jae Suk, work hard.
We will get going now.

2493
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,920
- We will be leaving for real.
- Leave.

2494
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,790
- Jae Suk, we are off for the day.
- Thank you for your work.

2495
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:15,330
- What will he do now?
- This is nice.

2496
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:17,220
- I thought it would be me.
- No way.

2497
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:20,530
What am I supposed to do by myself?

2498
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:23,170
We can't help you.

2499
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:25,540
I had a bad feeling
about key card number five.

2500
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:27,300
You picked first.

2501
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,870
(He picked the bad key card first
and lost in rock-paper-scissors.)

2502
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:30,710
- How strange.
- It's unbelievable.

2503
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,040
- You can't even plan this.
- Seriously.

2504
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,580
You must be from the future.

2505
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,210
I told you so.

2506
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:38,470
I told you that
Jae Suk would be it.

2507
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:40,840
- What will happen in my life?
- Jae Suk is it.

2508
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,340
(Jae Suk is it.)

2509
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,380
- Gosh.
- Can we go home now?

2510
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:45,380
Bye.

2511
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:47,010
- Do I head to the basement level?
- Thank you.

2512
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,880
- Fifth floor.
- I will be heading home now.

2513
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,720
- This is electrifying.
- Bye.

2514
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,300
I have no luck.

2515
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:55,130
Jae Suk, please slate...

2516
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:56,720
so that some cameramen can go home.

2517
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:58,540
Is that so?

2518
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,930
Do I need to slate
for them to go home?

2519
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,840
Then I will do it later.

2520
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,380
For goodness' sake.

2521
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,750
One, two, three.

2522
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:13,420
All right.

2523
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:16,090
The first group of cameramen
will head out.

2524
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:17,640
Only those who are working overtime
will remain.

2525
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:21,590
This is the absolute worst.
For goodness' sake.

2526
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:25,300
I couldn't open the door.

2527
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:31,130
My goodness.

2528
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:35,600
Can I take off the camera?

2529
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,260
Go ahead.

2530
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,500
Out of the two...

2531
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:44,750
(The staff leaves except for those
who are working overtime.)

2532
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:48,640
(I want to go home too.)

2533
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:51,310
What am I supposed to do
for an hour and a half?

2534
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,160
Seriously.

2535
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,830
This is the absolute worst.

2536
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:59,160
We have a small task
for the remaining people.

2537
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,220
(Chuckling)

2538
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,420
Let me explain.

2539
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:04,500
- I never asked for a small task.
- You are working overtime.

2540
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,040
I will lie down and kill time.

2541
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:08,500
We told you that there will be...

2542
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,460
- a simple task.
- What is it?

2543
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,910
Until the ending time,

2544
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,880
receive signatures from 18 people.

2545
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,880
- Then you can get off work faster.
- Did you say 18 people?

2546
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:21,510
Yes. For each signature,
we will deduct five minutes.

2547
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:24,840
- Please take a look.
- Who are these people?

2548
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:27,590
(An overtime mission
to get off work faster)

2549
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:30,630
"Due to his lacking job performance,
this person is working overtime."

2550
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,090
"He is in need
to shorten his work time..."

2551
01:22:34,090 --> 01:22:35,830
"as he lacks capabilities."

2552
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,890
"Receiving signatures
from people in charge..."

2553
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:39,130
"can help him get off work faster,"

2554
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:42,340
"so we ask for your cooperation."

2555
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,460
"An information desk employee
on the first floor,"

2556
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,470
"a cafe employee,"

2557
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:48,640
"a woman whose last name is Lee,
a man whose last name is Park..."

2558
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:50,170
For goodness' sake.

2559
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:54,780
There is even
"A producer of a famous TV show."

2560
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:57,340
I know that there are many.

2561
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:58,750
(A woman whose last name is Lee)

2562
01:22:58,750 --> 01:22:59,920
Lee? Hold on.

2563
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:01,960
Hyo Im, isn't your last name Lee?

2564
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:03,850
It's Yang.

2565
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,220
Isn't your last name Lee?

2566
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:07,660
- No.
- Isn't your last name Lee?

2567
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:08,670
(No.)

2568
01:23:08,670 --> 01:23:10,060
I am sure it is.

2569
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:13,040
You should say
that your last name is Lee today.

2570
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:15,000
A blue top.

2571
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,910
Everyone is wearing khaki clothes.

2572
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:21,130
You watch Running Man.

2573
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:23,640
(He captures an assistant director
who was passing by.)

2574
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:24,970
You watch Running Man every week.

2575
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:27,050
- He doesn't count.
- He watches it every week.

2576
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,180
An avid watcher
can't be a staff member.

2577
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:30,420
(An avid watcher
can't be a staff member.)

2578
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,180
Let's go to the first floor.

2579
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:33,680
(He takes an elevator
to go to the 1st floor.)

2580
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:36,530
"A person whose MBTI is ENFP."

2581
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:38,720
Is your MBTI ENFP?

2582
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,890
MBTI changes all the time.

2583
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,720
MBTI changes all the time.
What's your type?

2584
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,540
- She is an I type.
- I type?

2585
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:49,060
But you could be an E type.

2586
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,540
(The elevator stops
on the 4th floor.)

2587
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:51,910
Come on in. It's okay.

2588
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:53,470
Hello, producer.

2589
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:57,600
You're a producer, right?
You must be a producer.

2590
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:59,640
- I'm a manager.
- Are you a manager?

2591
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:03,140
Is your MBTI ENFP?

2592
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:04,450
- I'm ENFP.
- You're ENFP!

2593
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:06,050
All right. Please sign here.

2594
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:09,250
I'm glad that I found an ENFP here.

2595
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:11,090
Nice to meet you.
Whose manager are you?

2596
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:13,850
- I'm Seung Guk Lee's manager.
- I see.

2597
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:15,670
- Thank you. Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

2598
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:16,760
All right. Hey.

2599
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:17,920
Hello.

2600
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:20,090
- My gosh.
- You're wearing a mask, so...

2601
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:21,800
I'm Hwang Yoon Sung, a trot singer.

2602
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,430
Oh, hello.

2603
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:24,840
I'm glad to meet my colleague here.

2604
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:25,840
What is this?

2605
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,630
Please sign here.

2606
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:28,950
I'm so lucky.

2607
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:30,750
- This is Running Man.
- Really?

2608
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:32,120
I guess you're here for work.

2609
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,640
Yes. I am.

2610
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,640
(Jae Suk's colleague
signs the document befuddled.)

2611
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,810
- What's your name again?
- I'm Hwang Yoon Sung.

2612
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:38,550
You're Yoon Sung. Nice to meet you.

2613
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:39,750
- I'll see you later.
- See you around.

2614
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:41,290
- Thank you, Yoon Sung.
- Thank you.

2615
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:42,630
Have a nice day.

2616
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:44,680
I didn't expect to meet
my colleague here.

2617
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:47,300
- Are you sure he's your colleague?
- Of course he is.

2618
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:49,500
You know he's Yoon Sung.

2619
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,560
He looks uncomfortable around you.

2620
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,590
No. That's because
we didn't meet often.

2621
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,670
Yoon Sung, what's your song?

2622
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:57,060
(If you have to go)

2623
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:59,040
(If you have to leave after all)

2624
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,600
I love your song. See you, Yoon Sung.

2625
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,800
Thank you. Bye.

2626
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,800
"If you have to go."
That's perfect for me.

2627
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:09,380
Is this the information desk?
I appreciate your hard work.

2628
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:13,050
Please sign here. Please.

2629
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:14,920
Does anyone want
to go to the restroom?

2630
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:16,960
Hang on. I need to go
to the restroom. Can I...

2631
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:18,920
I really need to go.

2632
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,220
Hang on. Is there...

2633
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:22,960
Don't you want
to go to the restroom?

2634
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:24,560
No.

2635
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,590
(No.)

2636
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,200
He's so...

2637
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,200
(The cameraman just
wants to go home.)

2638
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,560
Hang on. The restroom...

2639
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,540
(An employee who was born
in the Year of the Tiger)

2640
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:33,130
Were you born
in the Year of the Tiger?

2641
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:35,550
- I was born in the Year of the Rat.
- The Rat?

2642
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:37,470
Are we of the same age?

2643
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:38,470
(Someone who is your age)

2644
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,170
Wait. Were you born in 1972?

2645
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:43,640
- I was born in 1996.
- I see. In 1996.

2646
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:46,290
(He added 24 years.)

2647
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:49,720
He's nice.
He has a nice personality.

2648
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:51,720
- Hello.
- He's our staff.

2649
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:53,920
Do you like to watch Running Man?

2650
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,630
- I'm the staff.
- Do you like Running Man?

2651
01:25:55,630 --> 01:25:57,330
- I'm the staff.
- Still.

2652
01:25:57,670 --> 01:26:00,740
You can still like
to watch Running Man.

2653
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:03,800
Wait. Just say you love our show.

2654
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:04,800
(Just say you love our show.)

2655
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:07,840
All right. He's our viewer.

2656
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:08,840
(He keeps talking
to the wrong people.)

2657
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:13,920
Ju Eun. Wait in there.

2658
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,450
- What?
- Do you want me to wait in there?

2659
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:17,680
Just stay there for a while.

2660
01:26:17,950 --> 01:26:20,010
Excuse me. Please sign here.

2661
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:21,250
- Who is she?
- What?

2662
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:22,490
- Who is she?
- She works at the cafe.

2663
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:24,490
What are you talking about?
She's obviously your stylist.

2664
01:26:24,490 --> 01:26:25,500
No.

2665
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,630
She's my stylist,
but she works here.

2666
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:29,170
Do you know how to make coffee?

2667
01:26:29,170 --> 01:26:30,390
- Make what?
- Can you make coffee?

2668
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:31,670
No. We can drink it.

2669
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:36,340
- Are you a writer?
- Me? No.

2670
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:37,540
- Aren't you a writer?
- No.

2671
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,240
Is there anything
that works for you?

2672
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:42,550
Aren't you riding a bicycle?
Isn't this a bicycle?

2673
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:45,050
We can say this is a bicycle.

2674
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:47,010
- If she goes home on it, it counts.
- It has wheels.

2675
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:49,750
- Do you live in Sangam-dong?
- Yes.

2676
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:51,620
She's riding a bicycle now.

2677
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:52,990
I'm riding it now.

2678
01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:54,290
Hang on. Bicycle...

2679
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:55,550

2696
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:29,160
It will happen if you work hard.

2697
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,250
All right then.

2698

(For you who are afraid
of the hot summer...)

2703
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:43,260
(We are going on a vacation
that's cool to the bone.)

2704
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:46,130
(For you who believe
that there's no place like home...)

2705
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:49,340
(We will enjoy everything
you tell us to enjoy.)

2706
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:50,550
- Hang on.
- Look at this.

2707
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:51,910
We are to do this without tools.

2708
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:53,550

2709
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:57,180

They try all these for viewers.)

(The viewers' vacation comes true!)

2712
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:04,550
Stop spinning it.

2713
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,890
(When everything was going well...)

2714
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:08,160
(It must taste terrible.)

2715
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:09,170
(Go away!)

2716
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:10,300
(What nonsense is this?)

2717
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:13,260
(They end up bursting into rage.)

2718
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:14,540
(Is the vacation...)

2719
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,130

2720
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:18,560
