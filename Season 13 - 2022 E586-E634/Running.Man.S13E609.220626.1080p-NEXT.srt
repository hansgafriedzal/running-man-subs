1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,360
Hello

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,010
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,640
Gosh, look at you.
We have a thug here.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,650
- Hi, Mr. Thug.
- I like the pavilion.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,320
My goodness.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,350
- I hate summer.
- Hey.

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,780
Jong Kook, Haha stole my coffee.
Is he a beggar or what?

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,710
Do you like my coffee?

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,710
(He stole So Min's coffee
before the shoot.)

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,280
Gosh, this is nice.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,090
Drink it and
get out of my sight, Haha.

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,550
(Haha steals So Min's coffee,
and she tells on him.)

13
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,120
- My coffee was like...
- She has nothing else to say.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,570
What's the big deal
about some coffee?

15
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,830
You're a witness.
It's not like I just gave it away.

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,570
- I hate summer.
- Don't call me before the shoot.

17
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,400
- What?
- I said I hate summer.

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,210
- Don't you like summer?
- I hate it.

19
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,900
I like summer
because I can wear light clothes.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,350
- And the laundry dries quickly.
- I see.

21
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,920
So I love summer.

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,640
My bag is light
when I go to the gym.

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,390
The reason I hate summer is...

24
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,710
- I hate it because it's too hot.
- What's wrong about that?

25
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,430
And I don't like that I sweat a lot.

26
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,250
It's hot because it's summer.

27
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,390
(It's hot because it's summer.)

28
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,970
We never understand each other.

29
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,830
Why not?

30
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,740
I'm not supposed to talk
with him for a long time.

31
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,030
- It's hot because it's summer.
- I should just avoid him.

32
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,500
You know what I mean.

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,210
- Jae Suk, and...
- A guy like him...

34
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,740
- I'll give you a tip.
- Don't even try...

35
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,210
- to talk with a guy like him.
- Just come here, Jae Suk.

36
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,240
It will do you no good.

37
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,640
- I'll give you a tip.
- Okay?

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,520
- Do you agree?
- In summer...

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
You don't want to bother
with a guy like him.

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,780
- "A guy like him?"
- Hello, Suk Jin!

41
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,110
"A guy like him."

42
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,190
Hey, Seok Sam.

43
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,520
You're here, Mr. Ji.

44
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,130
You're wearing pink shoes.

45
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,360
I know. It's pink.

46
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,890
You don't need the microphone today.

47
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,890
- Today...
- Just come here.

48
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,660
They will use the boom mics,
so you don't have to wear one.

49
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,660
They will?

50
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,720
This is new.

51
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,160
You should just speak loud today.

52
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,190
- Why?
- You don't need a microphone.

53
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,940
You have to talk loud like this.

54
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,630
- You all are wearing one.
- You must be hot.

55
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,740
You all have puppies.

56
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,000
Puppies?

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,740
- Are you wearing a school uniform?
- It's a school uniform.

58
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,440
He looks like an elementary
school kid in Japan.

59
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,610
Today, you two look good together.

60
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,850
- Do we look good together?
- Yes.

61
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,440
- I'm hot.
- Hey, you look like his mom.

62
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,740
(You look like his mom!)

63
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,660
- He's an elementary school kid.
- So Min is...

64
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,990
Don't say that to So Min.

65
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,080
It looks like
she's taking you to school.

66
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,130
Don't say she's a mom.

67
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,220
It just looks that way,
don't you think so?

68
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,860
- Just accept it.
- I'm his mom,

69
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,090
- so I can hold his hand, right?
- Yes, take his hand.

70
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,270
Son, come here. My dear son.

71
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,540
There you go.

72
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,830
Pat me on the back.

73
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,330
Move to the back a little.

74
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,210
- It's summer now.
- This is nice. I like the shade.

75
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,430
Do you guys have any vacation plans?

76
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,240
- I don't. I have to work.
- That's ridiculous.

77
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,580
Where would we go?

78
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,340
So we prepared something
for the vacation season.

79
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,390
We will have the
1st Running Man Vacation Service.

80
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,110
- "Vacation service?"
- I saw something...

81
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,150
on our YouTube channel.

82
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,520
- That's what it is.
- Right. We asked our viewers...

83
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,290
- to suggest...
- You should've talked to us first.

84
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,300
Without even telling us,

85
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,430
they post things like that.

86
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,360
- I don't want to go on a vacation.
- Me neither.

87
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,830
It's not like you're doing
what you want to do.

88
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,430
You will try things
that our viewers want to enjoy...

89
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,460
on behalf of them.

90
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,560
- On behalf of our viewers?
- Yes.

91
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,240
- We are like substitutes.
- I see.

92
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,770
We asked our viewers to recommend
things to enjoy on vacation.

93
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,610
And we picked out the ideas
that were realistic enough to try.

94
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,480
We made a roulette with those ideas.

95
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,810
You will spin the roulette
to choose 2 activities and 1 food.

96
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,840
There's food too?

97
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,650
- It's good that we have food.
- We get to eat.

98
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,390
We have to enjoy
good food on vacation.

99
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,580
That sounds nice.

100
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,680
Before you spin the roulette,

101
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,460
- I'll give you a simple mission.
- Right.

102
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,800
And you will fill out the roulettes
according to the result.

103
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,060
If you succeed, you'll get to write
what you want on the roulette.

104
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,060
- Really?
- Yes.

105
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,060
And you can get rid of one thing...

106
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,060
- that you don't want to do.
- What about just laying around?

107
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,740
- You can write what you want.
- All right.

108
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,180
- It doesn't matter.
- A vacation is nothing special.

109
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,270
- We can just sit here...
- You're right.

110
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,710
- Right. Just give us young pollack.
- That will be the best.

111
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,140
Just give us some young pollack
so we can have a talk.

112
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,240
- We can chat for like three hours.
- Right.

113
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,640
- All we need is some watermelon.
- Exactly.

114
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,920
Even when we go abroad,

115
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,420
we just stay in the room drinking.

116
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,520
- We don't go out.
- That's true.

117
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,580
And apart from
the vacation roulette,

118
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,180
we also have this penalty roulette.

119
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,650
- It's for a penalty.
- If you like roulettes that much,

120
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,230
we should just go to Las Vegas.

121
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,520
- We're spinning so much.
- Why do we keep spinning roulettes?

122
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,730
You will pick one member
as you please...

123
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,430
and write the person's name
on the roulette.

124
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,430
- Really?
- Let's do that.

125
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,140
You can play rock-paper-scissors
or anything.

126
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,670
- Okay.
- I get it.

127
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,370
All right. Please bring in
the vacation roulette then.

128
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,640
- This is the important thing.
- This is important.

129
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,450
- What's Increasing Lung Capacity?
- What could it be?

130
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,680
That sounds strange.

131
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,340
- That doesn't sound good.
- What's that?

132
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,890
- What's Increasing Lung Capacity?
- Let's see what it is.

133
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,990
Whac-A-Mole With Jong Kook in Water.

134
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,380
- I hate it.
- It's the worst.

135
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,490
(Activity 1)

136
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,420
- I hate it.
- It's the worst.

137
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,250
- I hate it.
- Actually, all of us are...

138
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,530
- good at holding our breath.
- I hate it so much.

139
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,620
- But we get hit.
- You do get hit.

140
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,470
Thrilling Game.

141
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,190
What is it?

142
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,430
Hide-And-Seek at a Very Big Place.

143
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,430
No. That doesn't sound good.

144
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,910
- That's a lot of work.
- We will sweat a lot.

145
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,110
It's summer.

146
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,280
I bet we won't want to do
any of these.

147
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,550
We will spin the roulette
and do some of them anyway.

148
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,700
- What's next?
- Diversion sounds good.

149
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,920
It says diversion. That sounds nice.

150
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,980
Giving Each Other a Makeover.

151
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,490
- My gosh.
- That sounds horrible.

152
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,510
I hate it.

153
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,180
- I like that. It sounds fun.
- I hate it so much.

154
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,250
That's horrible.

155
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,420
- I hate this.
- This is...

156
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,560
- Hey, let's get rid of this.
- This is the worst.

157
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,450
None of us have
a good sense of fashion.

158
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,730
- This is the worst.
- I don't want to do this.

159
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,750
- I hate it.
- I still hate the thing we tried.

160
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,670
- It went viral online.
- What?

161
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,970
I hated the personal color test.

162
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,260
Right. Let's not do this.

163
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,240
- I don't like my personal color.
- We don't like it.

164
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,810
- I just wear the colors I like.
- Right. It's your choice.

165
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,000
- Of course.
- I hate it.

166
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,370
- I know.
- Recreation?

167
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,240
- It's a special recreation.
- Special recreation sounds good.

168
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,480
The Yoo Jae Suk Show by
Recreation Instructor Yoo Jae Suk.

169
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,310
- That's tiring.
- No, I'm too tired for this.

170
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,350
(The Yoo Jae Suk Show by
Recreation Instructor Yoo Jae Suk)

171
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,220
- It's really annoying.
- It must be tiring.

172
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,790
- It will be annoying.
- I like it.

173
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,680
We will have to dance for two hours.

174
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,450
- I like this one.
- We will dance for two hours.

175
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,790
- It will never end.
- I like it.

176
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,890
Whac-A-Mole With Jong Kook in Water
would be better.

177
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,300
- That's better.
- I'd rather do that.

178
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,490
- It will end soon.
- This is better.

179
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,490
- That's better.
- All right.

180
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,530
- I like this one.
- Playing hide-and-seek is better.

181
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,970
Going On Scary Rides at Lotte World.

182
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,330
- I like that.
- I hate it.

183
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,630
(Activity 5)

184
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,110
(The cowards are terrified
to hear that.)

185
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,200
- That's the worst.
- No, I don't like rides.

186
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,500
- I can't ride them.
- I can't.

187
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,440
- It's all right.
- I'm not doing this.

188
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,780
- I can do it.
- All you need to do is sit.

189
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,510
- It will be fun.
- I can't do that.

190
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,440
- You should just sit there.
- But I can't do it.

191
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,050
All right.
It's Finding Childhood Innocence.

192
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,790
Having Fun at the Water Park
Like Eight-Year-Olds.

193
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,660
- My gosh.
- It must be tiring.

194
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,680
(They start groaning right away.)

195
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,950
- It's all about a water park.
- It has something to do with it.

196
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,230
- Is this product placement?
- What is it?

197
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,430
No. Our base camp...

198
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,690
has a sauna and swimming pools.

199
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,300
But I get exhausted
after playing at swimming pools.

200
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,490
It's a Leisure Activity.

201
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,830
- That sounds good.
- What is it?

202
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,700
Enjoying the Most Popular
Water Sport, Surfing.

203
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,040
- Indoor surfing?
- Surfing sounds good.

204
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,130
- I've never tried it before.
- You can get motion sick.

205
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,410
- You can get sick from surfing.
- You might fall down.

206
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,740
- You might fall.
- Right.

207
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,280
- And you get motion sickness.
- Right.

208
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,370
You really do.

209
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,480
I don't want to do anything
among these.

210
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,620
We are so weak.

211
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,850
- There's nothing.
- I'm sorry,

212
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,620
but can we just lie around
at home...

213
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,180
- and watch Netflix?
- Sounds good.

214
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,080
- I agree.
- I hate this the most.

215
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,230
- But I bet it's the easiest one.
- Removing Waste Products.

216
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,060
- Removing Waste Products.
- I thought it would be horrible.

217
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,450
Mythomania Game
to Get Out of a Sauna.

218
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,560
We can't do this.

219
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,370
- None of this is fun.
- It's too hot.

220
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,120
We can't even call it a vacation.

221
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,240
- It's just painful.
- Aren't they penalties?

222
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,410
- I think so.
- This is...

223
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,310
what our viewers want us to do.

224
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,570
I guess they picked the ideas
that we can use on the show.

225
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,680
So do we have to try
at least two among these?

226
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,780
You will pick two things. But...

227
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,720
you might pick
what you wrote instead.

228
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,140
- I see.
- Okay.

229
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,510
It kind of breaks my heart though.

230
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,180
Our viewers don't know
how to have fun.

231
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,250
They have no idea.

232
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,360
- Hey.
- I guess he went on a vacation.

233
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,530
You're blocking two cameras now.

234
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,860
- I don't know...
- Move over.

235
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,060
- where you are looking.
- Move.

236
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,060
That's because
I can't see the roulette.

237
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,190
- Take off your sunglasses.
- Take them off.

238
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,430
- That's because I'm standing here.
- Your sunglasses aren't cool.

239
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,740
Do you know how I feel?

240
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,780
You two might not know because
you always stand in the center.

241
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,240
- By the way,
- I just can't see it.

242
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,070
- you look like...
- I just go with my feelings.

243
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,480
- a middle-aged man at a festival.
- What?

244
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,550
Doesn't he look like ET?

245
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,920
(He looks like a middle-aged man
at a festival.)

246
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,490
- He doesn't look hip anymore.
- I know what you mean.

247
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,920
- He does look like ET.
- He's just a middle-aged man.

248
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,560
- He wants to look young.
- Seriously.

249
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,660
All right.
Let me give you the first mission.

250
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,660
What is it?

251
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,660
You guys are...

252
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,620
- so into drawing these days.
- That's right.

253
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,930
So we will have
the Running Man Drawing Contest.

254
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,230
- I love to draw.
- I don't like drawing.

255
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,190
It's your favorite game.

256
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,240
- You will take turns drawing.
- That's the game.

257
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,430
- We like it.
- We just need to have good sense.

258
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,370
(Each member will draw
in turn for 3 seconds,)

259
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,050
(and the last member guesses
what it is.)

260
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,850
- This must be a bird.
- Right.

261
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,010
(They use all kinds of tricks
to share hints about the answer.)

262
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,290
(The grass is greener
on the other side.)

263
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,880
(But despite all the hints,)

264
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,730
(they have never gotten
the correct answer before.)

265
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,930
- All right.
- I like the game.

266
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,060
- I will give you 10 questions.
- We get 10 questions.

267
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,600
If you give more than
five correct answers,

268
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,760
- you'll get to replace four items.
- That's a lot.

269
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,890
- All right.
- Four items?

270
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,190
The category is important.

271
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,000
(If they get 5 or more questions right,
they replace 4 items.)

272
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,110
- Okay.
- All right.

273
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,810
The first member should be good.

274
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,240
We are good at this game.

275
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,050
- All right. Let's begin.
- Okay.

276
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,700
- The category is important.
- Should we take off our shoes?

277
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,570
- Who will answer?
- Who will answer?

278
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,750
- What's the category?
- Jae Suk, will you answer?

279
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,980
- Do you want me to go?
- You can do that.

280
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,520
The category is proverbs
and Chinese idioms.

281
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,790
- Okay. I should answer.
- It must be difficult.

282
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,890
And Suk Jin and Jong Kook
should be the first ones to draw.

283
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,350
- You and me...
- But you guys should know...

284
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,720
Chinese idioms to draw something.

285
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,160
Stop bragging.

286
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,560
- They have to know what it means.
- Just do it.

287
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,670
- Come here.
- Do you know Chinese idioms?

288
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,000
- So you should be the first one.
- Ji Hyo.

289
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,090
- We know.
- Are you serious?

290
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,330
- So Min.
- I know Chinese idioms.

291
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,670
So Min, you three...

292
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,510
You three don't have to draw anything.

293
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,910
(You three don't have to draw anything.)

294
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,700
Seriously, I'm going...

295
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,910
to kill you today.

296
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,150
What's with him? We can do this.

297
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,070
- We have to show them.
- If they draw first, it'll be fun.

298
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,250
- Hey, sit down.
- Will you answer?

299
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,340
I will answer.

300
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,480
I want you to play fair.

301
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,950
If you don't pass it in time,
you fail.

302
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,450
- How many seconds?
- You get three seconds.

303
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,160
- Only three seconds?
- In a variety show,

304
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,480
- that's not enough.
- How would we...

305
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,400
Don't count the numbers too fast.

306
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,690
What about we do this?

307
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,360
- Mr. Producer.
- Let's just do it.

308
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,090
Can we use the time
for Ji Hyo, Se Chan, and So Min?

309
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,000
No.

310
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,560
- What?
- I'm going to beat you up.

311
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,100
- I won't let it slide.
- I'll teach you a lesson.

312
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,100
- Or give them a white marker.
- Let's give it a try.

313
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,230
- Let's just do it.
- Ready.

314
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,430
Start.

315
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,970
Start.

316
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,070
(Don't count your chickens
before they hatch.)

317
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,710
- All right.
- Three,

318
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,840
two, one. Pass.

319
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,250
- No, it's not over yet.
- Three.

320
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,110
- It's not three seconds.
- Go ahead.

321
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,610
Two, one.

322
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,290
Pass.

323
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,580
- What's that?
- Three, two,

324
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,800
- one. Pass.
- Stay calm.

325
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,900
Three.

326
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,430
- Pass.
- Stay calm.

327
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,360
(Don't count your chickens
before they hatch.)

328
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,860
Two, one.

329
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,330
Pass.

330
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,170
- Three, two, one.
- Just erase it.

331
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,430
- Pass.
- Gosh, this can be confusing.

332
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,750
If it's not good, just erase it.

333
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,700
Two, one. Time's up.

334
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,250
- Haha, stop drawing.
- Hang on.

335
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,550
Right. I mean...

336
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,420
Is this a proverb?

337
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,680
It's a proverb.

338
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,710
- I mean...
- You can't give him a hint.

339
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,020
My goodness.

340
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,890
- You should've drawn only two.
- What is this thing?

341
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,180
We need only two.

342
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,090
- My goodness.
- We just need to draw...

343
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,760
only two things from the proverb.

344
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,960
Don't give him a hint.

345
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,320
- Is this a person?
- This proverb is...

346
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,960
- No hint.
- You spoil...

347
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,170
You spoil a good dish
with ill sauce.

348
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,270
- Gosh.
- Don't rush.

349
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,770
(He gives the wrong answer
in haste.)

350
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,230
- Gosh.
- Don't rush.

351
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,070
- You don't need to rush.
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

352
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,700
- Don't rush things.
- You should say two things.

353
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,250
Who drew the rice cake?

354
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,570
- I drew the first one.
- Suk Jin drew it.

355
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,650
- Is this rice cake?
- It looks strange.

356
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,810
It's rice cake.

357
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,210
How else would I draw it...

358
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,310
- in three seconds?
- I'm sorry but draw one yourself.

359
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,980
- How would you draw it?
- This is a rice cake.

360
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,390
(This is a rice cake.)

361
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,400
- Like this.
- Is that rice cake?

362
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,500
- This is bar rice cake.
- Right.

363
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,960
Let me tell you something.

364
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,730
A proverb has two main things.

365
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,640
Jong Kook is right about that.

366
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,040
We should draw
only rice cake and kimchi.

367
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,330
Right. They are the main things.
Just do that.

368
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,640
- We will do that.
- This time, it's a Chinese idiom.

369
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,570
- It's not bad.
- All right. It's here.

370
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,150
- Don't draw anything strange.
- A Chinese idiom? Okay.

371
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,780
Or let's draw
about one syllable at a time.

372
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,050
- Let's do that.
- That sounds like a good idea.

373
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,920
Let's say it's sapilguijeong.

374
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,350
- You should draw a lion.
- Right.

375
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,980
- Lion for "sa."
- I see. A lion?

376
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,630
- Only the first syllable. Okay.
- Yes.

377
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,930
- Okay?
- Okay.

378
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,060
- Let's do that.
- Okay. I get it.

379
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,260
Let's begin.

380
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,860
- You go first.
- Here's the question.

381
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,130
You will see the order.

382
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,860
(Seomseomoksu)

383
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,640
I just need to know
if it's a Chinese idiom or not.

384
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,510
I just need to know
if it's a Chinese idiom or not.

385
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,040
Pass it. Time's up.

386
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,640
- Three, two, one.
- Draw the same thing.

387
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,880
Pass it.

388
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,700
- What is it?
- Three, two, one.

389
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,050
(Answer: Seomseomoksu)

390
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,610
One. Pass it to her now.

391
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,980
Three, two...

392
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,950
- He pronounces "pass" weirdly.
- One. Pass it.

393
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,260
- Pass it.
- That's good.

394
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,480
- That's good.
- He pronounces "pass" weirdly.

395
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,950
(Answer: Seomseomoksu)

396
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,630
- Good. Just add details now.
- Right.

397
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,090
- It's good. Don't touch it.
- Don't draw anything else.

398
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,690
- Don't touch it. No.
- Don't draw anything else.

399
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,360
- Three, two...
- Just add details. Don't touch it.

400
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,500
- One.
- Don't draw anything.

401
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,670
- Don't even touch it.
- Hold on.

402
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,190
- Two, one. Time's up.
- He told me not to touch it.

403
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,230
- Don't touch it.
- That's good.

404
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,140
- Two, one. Time's up.
- That's good enough.

405
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,410
- Don't touch it.
- Haha.

406
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,180
- That's good enough.
- I'm giving you a warning, Haha.

407
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,310
- Got it.
- You've been warned.

408
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,840
- It looks weird.
- It's easy. You can get it right.

409
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,340
- We drew it wrong.
- We did a good job.

410
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,940
- We did well.
- No, that's not it.

411
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,440
- What could be the first thing?
- It's up to him now.

412
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,480
You're not allowed to give him
any hints.

413
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,980
- I should figure out what this is.
- But...

414
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,520
- Do not give him any hints.
- What could that be?

415
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,580
- Jae Suk, that's easy.
- What could that be?

416
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,580
- What is this?
- Guess what it is.

417
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,060
My, I'm craving this.

418
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,350
You're not allowed to give him
any hints.

419
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,800
- Sweet potato.
- Don't give him any hints.

420
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,160
- Sweet potato.
- It's perfect for summer.

421
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,670
- Hey.
- You eat it in summer?

422
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,130
No, that's not the point.
What place is that?

423
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,590
- No, wait.
- Come on.

424
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,690
- That's not it.
- Gosh.

425
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,960
- I mean...
- Jeju Island.

426
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,810
Five, four...

427
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,010
- Jae Suk.
- Three.

428
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,330
- Just give me a minute.
- I can't give you any more time.

429
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,140
- They keep giving you hints.
- No, they didn't give me any hints.

430
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,310
- We won't say anything.
- If you don't say a word...

431
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,840
- We won't say a single word.
- We'll be quiet.

432
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,610
It's meaningful only if you get it
right without cheating.

433
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,650
- What is this?
- It's not easy.

434
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,970
- Jeju Island.
- But Jae Suk,

435
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,110
- you know the answer for sure.
- What is Jeju Island?

436
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,250
- Stop. Listen.
- Tamra?

437
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,480
You're not allowed to chat.

438
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,580
Jae Suk.

439
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,920
We were talking
about something else.

440
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,660
He asked me
if I had been to Jeju Island.

441
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,820
He asked me if I was planning
to go on a trip to Jeju Island,

442
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,400
- so I said I'd be happy to.
- That wasn't what it sounded like.

443
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,430
- He said he'd go to Tamra Island.
- No.

444
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,800
- I said I wanted to go there.
- Three.

445
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,630
Two.

446
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,590
(The final countdown)

447
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,830
One.

448
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,330
You failed.

449
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,540
- What is this?
- It's easy, Jae Suk.

450
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,200
- We'll reveal the answer.
- Okay.

451
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,970
- It's an island.
- Gosh. Come on.

452
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,100
You just had to guess the first one.
You know ."eomseomoksu."

453
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,840
- "Seomseomoksu" is too easy.
- But...

454
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,050
Couldn't you draw the map of Korea
any better than this?

455
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,390
I only had three seconds.

456
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,850
- Try to draw it in three seconds.
- I mean...

457
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,390
- Draw it. One.
- Suk Jin, Jeju Island is...

458
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,130
- This is what Korea looks like.
- Two. Three.

459
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,560
- That's right.
- This is better.

460
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,060
But you figured out
that I drew Jeju Island, Jae Suk.

461
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,400
- You figured it out.
- I failed anyway.

462
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,590
- Right. Good job.
- Okay. I get it.

463
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,820
- I see how you draw things now.
- Give it a try.

464
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,060
- I only had three seconds.
- I get it.

465
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,060
- Give us an easy question.
- It's a proverb this time.

466
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,090
- We draw only two words.
- For a proverb...

467
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,700
- Two words.
- We'll draw only two words.

468
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,100
- The two most important words.
- Okay.

469
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,810
Ready. Here's your question.

470
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,150
(Answer:
To follow a friend to Gangnam)

471
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,510
- Gosh. How should I draw this?
- Three.

472
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,750
- Two, one.
- I can't do this.

473
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,610
- Pass it. Three, two...
- Really?

474
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,050
- I know what it means, but...
- One.

475
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,840
Pass it. Ji Hyo, your time is up.

476
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,110
Three, two, one.

477
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,610
Pass it. Jong Kook, your time is up.

478
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,030
- Three, two, one.
- What should I do?

479
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,160
- Don't ruin it.
- Pass it.

480
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,060
- Hey.
- Three, two...

481
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,760
- Two, one.
- Wait.

482
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,000
- Don't ruin it.
- Pass it.

483
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,360
- Three, two, one. Pass it.
- Draw faster.

484
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,360
What is he doing?

485
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,010
- Three, two, one. Time's up.
- What is he doing?

486
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,280
That's even weirder.

487
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,380
- What did he do?
- Han River.

488
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,830
What did he draw in the middle?

489
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,100
- What is it...
- Han River.

490
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,070
- Hey.
- What's that thing in the middle?

491
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,420
(Jae Suk checks the drawing.)

492
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,550
Is it a proverb?

493
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,250
- Yes.
- Gosh. What is this? Darn.

494
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,920
This is almost like interpreting
Na Eun's drawing.

495
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,820
Well, this is...

496
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,160
- It's so difficult.
- This is a person.

497
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,820
There are two people here.

498
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,090
- Yes.
- What is this on the left?

499
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,160
Who drew this?

500
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,190
- That's not important.
- Ignore it.

501
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,130
- You can ignore it.
- This is not a deduction game.

502
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,230
Wait. Hold on.

503
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,590
I see water flowing...

504
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,000
- Do not give him any hints.
- Okay.

505
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,770
There's a reason for this.
I could also...

506
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,830
"One cannot see through
another's mind."

507
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,100
- This must not be it, right?
- Take your time.

508
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,550
("One cannot see through
another's mind.")

509
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,920
(This must not be it, right?)

510
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,070
That's not the answer, right?

511
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,650
- That's a good strategy.
- Take your time, Jae Suk.

512
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,840
I'm going to take my time.

513
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,940
He's so funny.

514
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,210
"One cannot see through
another's mind."

515
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,810
- I'm sure that's not the answer.
- Take your time.

516
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,060
Okay. I'm sure it's not.

517
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,060
- Why did you wipe your sweat off?
- What?

518
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,190
- Why did you do that?
- That has nothing to do with this.

519
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,000
- That's not a hint.
- You got the wrong idea.

520
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,530
- That means nothing.
- Just forget about it.

521
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,560
- We're not allowed to do that.
- My friend, that was nothing.

522
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,230
- No?
- No.

523
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,810
This person is giving something
to the other.

524
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,670
What do you mean? That person is
giving nothing to the other.

525
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,600
(No, that's not what it means.)

526
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,310
- That person isn't giving...
- It's not about giving.

527
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,550
- If that's the case...
- Is it about moving?

528
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,810
(Yes. It's about moving.)

529
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,880
It must be friendship
that was given to this person.

530
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,290
Guys, please. Listen, everyone.

531
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,050
I'll give you five seconds.

532
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,050
- Five.
- But...

533
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,080
(The director starts a countdown
hastily.)

534
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,160
- Four.
- Wait.

535
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,450
- Where do you live?
- Apgujeong.

536
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,560
- Three.
- Come on. Wait.

537
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,680
- Two.
- Hey.

538
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,720
One. What's the answer?

539
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,500
- Let me answer. Wait.
- Okay.

540
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,560
He figured it out.

541
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,030
- He figured it out.
- Could he get it right?

542
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,190
Please.

543
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,040
(Did he figure out the answer
from all those hints?)

544
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,930
- I think I know what it means.
- Okay.

545
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,040
- Good.
- It means "to follow."

546
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,230
- Oh, my.
- That's right.

547
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,540
(Did he really figure it out?)

548
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,330
"To follow a friend to Gangnam."

549
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,250
This is...

550
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,780
(He managed to get the answer
in the end.)

551
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,210
- Recognize it as correct.
- He's right.

552
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,480
- He got it right.
- This is the river.

553
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,250
- He got it right.
- Gangnam is south of the river.

554
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,760
- Great job.
- Right?

555
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,020
- That's correct.
- "To follow."

556
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,810
That's the only proverb
that includes the word "follow."

557
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,320
The answer is
"to follow a friend to Gangnam."

558
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,930
And you guys mentioned
"Apgujeong, friendship, and moving."

559
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,660
But he actually lives in Apgujeong.

560
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,930
- What's wrong with mentioning that?
- What's wrong with that?

561
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,430
- What's the problem?
- I only asked him where he lived.

562
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,860
- You mentioned other words too.
- Is Apgujeong in Gangnam?

563
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,830
Yes, it's in Gangnam,
but he didn't say "Gangnam."

564
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,170
- That's not the same.
- I got it right.

565
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,360
- He got it right.
- You should accept it.

566
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,200
- We'll accept it this time.
- Okay.

567
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,230
Good.

568
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,330
Bo Pil is so nice.

569
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,840
The next question is
a Chinese idiom.

570
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,200
- A Chinese idiom.
- Let's do this.

571
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,470
Here's your question. Ready, go.

572
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,050
(Answer: Hyeongseoljigong)

573
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,180
Five. Three.

574
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,750
(His hands are shaking.)

575
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,580
- Two, one.
- Come on, Suk Jin.

576
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,910
- Pass it. Now.
- It's okay.

577
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,320
- Three, two, one.
- You said, "Five, three, two, one."

578
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,920
- Pass it.
- No. What?

579
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,890
- Three, two...
- Let me...

580
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,700
(Each of them draws one syllable
as they planned.)

581
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,470
- Let me draw the last one.
- Two.

582
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,060
One. Pass it.

583
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,200
Let me draw the last one.

584
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,570
- Three, two, one. Pass it.
- Why?

585
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,870
- Fix the first drawing.
- Three.

586
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,980
- Two.
- Fix the first drawing.

587
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,340
- One.
- That looks like poop.

588
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,450
- Three, one.
- That doesn't look like it.

589
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,050
- That's just poop.
- Exactly.

590
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,880
- My gosh. I told you to draw snow.
- One. Time's up.

591
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,220
- It's over. Haha, your time is up.
- Snow.

592
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,190
(He's adding details
to describe "Hyeong.")

593
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,190
- Is it a Chinese idiom?
- Yes.

594
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,850
Why did you draw poop?

595
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,760
But you can get this right,
Jae Suk.

596
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,470
- I see. He's right.
- Look at the last two drawings.

597
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,090
You only need the last two drawings
to get it right.

598
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,700
- "Gong."
- Yes, that's right.

599
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,240
- "In."
- No.

600
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,040
- A person has grown up?
- Look at the last two drawings.

601
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,370
- Don't tell him if he's right.
- Just the last two drawings.

602
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,100
- Look at the last two drawings.
- "Hyeon."

603
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,510
- "Hyeon."
- No, ignore that drawing.

604
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,640
Gosh, seriously.

605
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,020
- I told you to ignore them!
- Look at the last two drawings.

606
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,910
Just the last two drawings.

607
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,220
(The last two drawings are easy
to guess.)

608
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,810
It must not be "Hyeongseoljigong."

609
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,350
(It must not be "Hyeongseoljigong.")

610
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,350
(Surprised)

611
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,500
(Chuckling)

612
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,500
(That's it!)

613
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,620
Is it "Hyeongseoljigong?"

614
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,970
(Correct)

615
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,500
- That's an earthworm for "Ji."
- Right.

616
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,240
You were supposed to draw
the last one.

617
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,710
- That's "Seol."
- He...

618
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,980
- Jae Suk was...
- Why did you draw poop, you punk?

619
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,980
- "Seolsa" as in "diarrhea."
- That's nonsense.

620
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,670
- Let me try this time.
- Okay.

621
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,010
- Come over here.
- Jae Suk.

622
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,410
- Yes?
- You got lucky this time.

623
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,280
- I did well, right?
- You were lucky.

624
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,050
- That was good.
- I did well, didn't I?

625
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,190
- Everyone was lost for words.
- I was so surprised.

626
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,190
(Everyone was taken back as no one
expected him to get it right.)

627
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,520
We were all surprised.

628
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,730
- All of us were surprised.
- Indeed.

629
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,080
- Let's begin.
- What is the category?

630
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,350
- I think we'll do well.
- It's a proverb.

631
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,000
- Since it's a proverb...
- Okay. That's good.

632
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,920
- Look here. I divided it.
- Don't be nervous.

633
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,120
- We know.
- We'll draw two words, okay?

634
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,390
- Okay.
- Got it. Let's go.

635
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,440
Here's your question.

636
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,440
(Answer:
A hungry belly has no ears.)

637
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,470
- I know that.
- Three.

638
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,830
(Answer:
A hungry belly has no ears.)

639
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,280
- Good. This is easy.
- We can draw it.

640
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,670
- One. Pass it.
- Focus on the main words.

641
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,570
- Three, two, one.
- We don't even have to draw it.

642
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,570
- Pass it. Three.
- Just add a few details.

643
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,480
Two, one. Pass it.

644
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,720
I'll just draw this.

645
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,310
- Pass it.
- Grapes.

646
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,060
- Just finish this up well.
- Three.

647
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,610
- Two.
- This is...

648
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,060
- He'll get this right.
- Pass it.

649
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,650
- Is it easy?
- You'll definitely get this right.

650
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,500
(The grapes become more realistic.)

651
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,560
- That's good.
- One.

652
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,620
- This...
- Three, two. one.

653
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,730
- Time's up.
- That's good.

654
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,770
- I bet he'll get the answer right.
- Of course, he will.

655
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,060
- He'll definitely get it right.
- What is this?

656
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,510
- No talking.
- That means nothing.

657
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,510
- I'm sure of it.
- Of course I know the answer.

658
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,830
The answer is
"A hungry belly has no ears."

659
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,480
Of course I know the answer.
It's "A hungry belly has no ears."

660
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,640
(He got the correct answer
as soon as he saw the drawing.)

661
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,710
- It was easy.
- Yes.

662
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,140
- We did a good job.
- But Haha.

663
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,220
Didn't you say "grapes"
while drawing it?

664
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,520
- No, I didn't.
- No.

665
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,840
- He didn't say that.
- I swear I didn't hear that.

666
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,960
I clearly heard him saying that.

667
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,380
- He didn't say that.
- He can't hear us.

668
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,290
- Check the recording.
- He didn't say that.

669
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,580
- I couldn't hear it.
- He couldn't hear it.

670
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,260
- Please erase his voice.
- As the director,

671
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,620
I request Haha to move
toward the other end.

672
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,860
- Okay.
- Move toward the other end.

673
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,970
No, not you, Jae Suk.
Someone else should sit there.

674
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,700
- Ji Hyo, switch seats with him.
- I'll do it.

675
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,970
No, we picked Ji Hyo.

676
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,940
Jong Kook has bad hearing.

677
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,440
- He knows us too well.
- My gosh.

678
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,240
- We're the best at group games.
- Don't look down on us!

679
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,950
Here's your question.

680
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,370
- Three, two...
- It's okay.

681
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,220
- One. Pass it.
- Two words, okay?

682
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,190
- Three, two...
- Just describe the words.

683
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,520
One. Pass it.

684
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,990
- It's a proverb.
- Three.

685
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,720
Two, one.

686
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,060
Time's up. Pass it.

687
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,560
Jae Suk, your time is up.

688
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,650
What's that?

689
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,820
- What's this?
- He wrote an English word.

690
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
- I'm worried.
- One.

691
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,300
- Isn't an English word allowed?
- No.

692
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,500
- I'm worried.
- One.

693
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,060
(He wrote "good"
as in "harden" in Korean.)

694
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,440
- Three, two...
- You should erase the English word.

695
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,560
- One.
- Erase the English word.

696
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,600
- Pass it.
- Erase it.

697
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,900
Cross it off roughly...

698
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,010
so that he can see it.

699
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,130
- Two, one.
- Cross it off roughly...

700
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,310
(She crosses off the word roughly
so that it's barely visible.)

701
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,750
- Time's up. It's over.
- Don't cover it up completely.

702
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,070
- It's over.
- Hey, that...

703
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,020
- Hey.
- Is it a proverb?

704
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,050
Yes, it's a proverb.

705
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,490
Don't think about the colors.

706
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,460
The English word that I wrote...

707
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,760
You can see it right there.

708
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,960
(They're starting
to give him hints.)

709
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,820
- Let me see. It's raining.
- Okay.

710
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,030
This is an umbrella.

711
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,590
- Don't make a noise like that.
- It's raining.

712
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,730
(They're not allowed to make a noise
to confirm his guesses.)

713
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,700
What?

714
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,540
After it rains...

715
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,900
What?

716
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,670
(Did he figure it out?)

717
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,440
- No way.
- He's incredible.

718
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,370
- The weather is so nice.
- Get ready to stand up.

719
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,340
It means that after it rains...

720
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,720
It means that the ground is good
after it rains, right?

721
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,690
I mean... Hold on.

722
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,490
- Give me a second.
- Whatever you say is your answer.

723
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,260
I mean... Wait.

724
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,460
Hang on.

725
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,920
Give me a second.

726
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,890
He doesn't know the proverb.

727
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,890
- He's close to the answer.
- This is frustrating.

728
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,060
Gosh, I'm frustrated.

729
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,660
I know... Just wait.

730
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,500
- Hold on.
- This is your last chance.

731
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,970
I mean,
this is what I'm trying to say...

732
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,540
- After it rains...
- I'll give you five seconds.

733
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,940
- Five, four...
- After it rains...

734
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,130
- Wait. I think I know it.
- Three.

735
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,980
- Two. One.
- "After it rains,"

736
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,170
"the ground is harder?"

737
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,340
(After it rains,
the ground is harder?)

738
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,880
- "The ground hardens."
- "Hard..."

739
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,910
"It's hard ground?"

740
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,460
- Hey!
- "The ground is harder."

741
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,460
- What does that mean?
- "The ground is harder."

742
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,820
"The ground hardens."

743
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,120
- "The ground is hard."
- You should accept it.

744
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,890
- "The ground hardens."
- "The ground hardens."

745
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,890
- "The ground hardens after rain."
- Oh, I see.

746
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:24,920
"The ground is harder."

747
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,700
- "The ground is harder after rain."
- But...

748
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,390
It's
"The ground hardens after rain."

749
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,860
Are we allowed to write
an English word?

750
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,940
- That was good.
- Jae Suk, you did great.

751
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,040
- Good.
- Yes.

752
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,440
- We're good at this.
- How many did we get right?

753
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,540
- We're doing well.
- You already got three empty slots.

754
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,710
- Okay!
- That's great.

755
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,340
- This is the last question.
- Let's get this right too.

756
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,870
Can we change four slots
if we get this right?

757
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,610
(They'll get four empty slots
if they get this right as well.)

758
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,750
- Is it a proverb?
- Yes.

759
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,250
- It's a proverb. Draw 2 words.
- A proverb. We'll draw 2 words.

760
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,460
- Here's your question.
- It was easy.

761
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,350
- Gosh, it's difficult.
- Gosh.

762
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,350
Three.

763
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,530
(Answer: To sow the wind
and reap the whirlwind)

764
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,030
- This one is difficult.
- Two.

765
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,060
One.

766
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,620
(Answer: To sow the wind
and reap the whirlwind)

767
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,060
- It's a proverb. Two.
- Okay.

768
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,500
- One. Time's up.
- Just draw two words.

769
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,300
- Three, two...
- Just two words.

770
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,160
- Time's up.
- What's that "X" mark?

771
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,810
- It's difficult.
- What is this?

772
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,570
- It's difficult.
- Indeed.

773
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,070
It was hard to draw.

774
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,870
Why are there two arrows
pointing opposite directions?

775
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,750
- Oh, it moves back and forth?
- Right. Yes.

776
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,250
I think I know the answer.

777
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,690
- That's good. Okay.
- I think I know the answer.

778
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,260
(He thinks he knows the answer?)

779
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,650
- Yes.
- "Word travels..."

780
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,990
Gosh.

781
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,700
("Word travels...")

782
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,920
(Gosh.)

783
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,920
Why? What's wrong?

784
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,530
- He reacted to make the show fun.
- Come on.

785
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,500
- What's wrong?
- He did it without realizing it.

786
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,970
I didn't imply anything
about his answer.

787
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,060
- What's wrong?
- This is a horse for sure.

788
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,940
- Yes.
- And it goes back and forth.

789
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
That's right.

790
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,670
- The horse is behind this thing.
- Yes.

791
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,980
- And it moves back and forth.
- Yes.

792
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,710
- Hey.
- Is this a bowl?

793
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,750
- Gosh, you.
- Yes.

794
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,250
- Do not respond to his comments.
- It looks like...

795
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,520
- a bucket.
- If I acted like that,

796
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,880
- that would happen.
- Forage for the horse?

797
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,910
I think this is...

798
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,190
If I did it to Jong Kook...

799
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,260
Exactly.

800
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,260
- Three.
- Gosh.

801
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,850
- Oh, I get it.
- What is it?

802
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,490
Gosh, you guys. Okay.

803
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,420
- Did you figure it out?
- What is it?

804
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,060
- It was an easy question after all.
- Yes.

805
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,160
"To sow the wind
and reap the whirlwind."

806
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,700
(They got the last question right.)

807
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,310
(They practically deduced
the answers through conversations.)

808
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,440
- Yes!
- I told you so.

809
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,240
- This game is so fun.
- Hey.

810
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,510
- I think we're really smart.
- Good.

811
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,600
We did an amazing job.

812
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,340
Now, we have our own strategy
for this game.

813
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,480
I guess we won't ever play
this game again.

814
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,450
- Why won't we play it again?
- Why?

815
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,190
- But it's such a fun game.
- We did incredibly well, right?

816
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,060
- We're so good at this, right?
- It's so exciting.

817
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,060
- That's not fair.
- We'll play it no matter what.

818
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,850
- Say goodbye to the game.
- That's not fair.

819
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,920
- No. This game is so fun.
- Don't say that.

820
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,120
- We're good at this game.
- Anyway, you did well,

821
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,160
so you can get rid of
four activities.

822
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
- That's great. We did really well.
- Let's get rid of them.

823
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,440
Please choose the activities
you want to get rid of.

824
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,590
That's good.

825
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,330
First, let's get rid of
Going On Scary Rides at Lotte World.

826
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,400
But I like that...

827
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,940
- It's too scary.
- It's scary.

828
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,330
- I'd pull muscles.
- I hate that too.

829
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,510
- I can't ride scary rides.
- And...

830
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,780
- Giving Each Other a Makeover.
- We don't like that either.

831
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,950
Right. Let's not do that.

832
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,340
- Get rid of it.
- We've done it too many times.

833
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,140
- And let's not do this either.
- Get rid of the surfing.

834
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,790
- We might get hurt.
- Okay, the surfing.

835
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,750
- You get seasickness.
- That's right.

836
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,880
- Let's remove Whac-A-Mole too.
- Really?

837
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,420
Now, you can write any activities
you want to do in the empty slots.

838
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,150
- It's probably...
- Hey, why don't we play this again?

839
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,320
- Or...
- It won't be fun.

840
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,120
- I like this game.
- Let's play another round.

841
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,730
- Playing another round?
- Or 30 minutes at the pavilion.

842
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,920
- Relaxing for 30 minutes.
- For 30 minutes,

843
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,970
- we can eat...
- Just chilling.

844
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,390
Chatting at the pavilion
for 30 minutes. Okay.

845
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,310
- That's good. I love to chat.
- That's a great idea.

846
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,900
Chatting right here.

847
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,240
Chatting at the pavilion
right behind us.

848
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,400
- "Right behind us."
- Yes, not far away from here.

849
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,980
- We'll have a nice chat.
- A nice chat.

850
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,550
- Great.
- I'm excited.

851
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,550
- A vacation should be like this.
- This is what it should be like.

852
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,080
- Exactly.
- For how long?

853
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,410
- For how long?
- For 30 minutes.

854
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,960
- Is it too short?
- It's too short.

855
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,260
It'll end as soon as we start.

856
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,060
- How about an hour?
- It should be at least an hour.

857
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,790
- We'll get coffee delivered too.
- Right.

858
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,060
- He's right.
- Yes, an hour sounds reasonable.

859
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,920
- Nice.
- And...

860
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,920
- Let's go to Suk Jin's house.
- Okay.

861
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,970
(Taken aback)

862
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,300
- That sounds great.
- I like the idea.

863
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,540
- I really like the idea.
- Don't do this to me.

864
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,740
- It sounds great.
- Let's go.

865
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,900
- It's a great idea.
- We can see Hyun Woo too.

866
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,900
Come on. Let's go.

867
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,040
- I'll agree if we go to yours too.
- It's a great idea.

868
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,600
- Fine. Then...
- Let's go to his house.

869
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,750
Instead of Suk Jin's house...

870
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,140
Or let's go to Jong Kook's house.

871
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,310
Sure. Let's do that.
My mother is home.

872
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,990
- But I don't really want to go...
- It's too cold in his house.

873
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,720
- to his place again...
- It appears every week.

874
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,960
- It's not cold in my house.
- because it's too dark.

875
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,560
- It's hot. My gosh.
- It's too dark.

876
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,820
It's bright with the blinds open.

877
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,120
- In his house...
- He never turns the AC on.

878
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,730
I had never felt oppressed
in anyone else's house before.

879
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,530
You get frostbite
if you visit his house in winter.

880
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,420
- Having ramyeon at Jong Kook's.
- It could cost you a fortune.

881
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,540
- Okay.
- That sounds good.

882
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,200
Having ramyeon at Jong Kook's house.

883
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,210
Do you have ramyeon at home?

884
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,630
We should buy some.

885
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,130
(What?)

886
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,240
- Why?
- What is it?

887
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,130
What did you mean by saying,
"Do you have ramyeon at home?"

888
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,810
(What did you mean by saying,
"Do you have ramyeon at home?")

889
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,140
She asked that
because we're going to eat ramyeon.

890
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,950
- We're going to eat ramyeon, so...
- You visited his place recently,

891
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,950
- and there was no ramyeon, right?
- There was no ramyeon there.

892
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,250
- No, she was just curious.
- What's the truth?

893
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,190
Hey, defend yourself more actively!

894
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,190
Jae Suk.

895
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,620
- Are you a prosecutor or what?
- I don't want to.

896
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,620
- "There was no ramyeon, right?"
- Let me explain.

897
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,230
- It's not like that.
- You look suspicious.

898
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,920
- What's going on?
- You look so suspicious.

899
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,420
"Do you have ramyeon at home?
You never eat ramyeon."

900
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,730
- Anyway...
- Detective Yoo.

901
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,060
- What's the truth?
- What's important is...

902
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,060
that there's no ramyeon...

903
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,060
- at his house.
- You're being unreasonable.

904
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,700
- That's not it. Listen to me.
- We're not being unreasonable.

905
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,510
- You see, usually...
- He's defending himself actively.

906
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,130
- "Do you have ramyeon at home?"
- many people think...

907
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,400
that I never eat ramyeon.
That's why she asked,

908
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,550
- "Do you have ramyeon at home?"
- Ji Hyo isn't saying anything.

909
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,450
- So I...
- I have nothing to say.

910
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,640
Hey, just be quiet.

911
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,640
Just be quiet.

912
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,290
- She says she has nothing to say.
- Right.

913
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,610
Having no ramyeon at home...

914
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,190
- is unusual.
- It's normal.

915
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,560
- I have no ramyeon at home.
- What's going on?

916
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,720
We should buy some on our way.

917
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,730
- Oh, I have an idea.
- What is it?

918
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,500
Watching Jong Kook and Ji Hyo
having a date...

919
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,820
- for one hour.
- Watching them.

920
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,860
(Watching Jong Kook and Ji Hyo
having a date for one hour.)

921
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,890
- I like that.
- Wait. What is your problem?

922
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,160
- Don't write it down.
- That sounds fun.

923
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,330
- I love this idea the most.
- It's a good idea.

924
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,440
- Why would you do that?
- I like that.

925
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,830
- "We Went on a Date."
- What?

926
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,130
- It has nothing to do with that.
- Why?

927
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,240
An hour sounds great.

928
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,810
- An hour is okay, right?
- That's great.

929
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,450
- An hour, right?
- Why would you write that down?

930
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,050
- "We Went on a Date."
- It has nothing to do with...

931
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,450
today's theme.

932
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,690
It does. Watching you two together
brings us joy and happiness.

933
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,750
This isn't...

934
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,560
- We'll just observe them.
- related to the vacation theme.

935
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,080
- Like a reality show.
- I really want to see it.

936
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,420
- I want to see it.
- It's not hard.

937
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,420
- Then let's visit that place.
- What place?

938
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,850
The terrace
that Suk Jin told us about.

939
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,030
Hey, that place...

940
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,500
- Right. You should go there.
- That's a good idea.

941
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,470
But what are we going to do...

942
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,940
- Hey, not long ago, I saw...
- Yes, Suk Jin.

943
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,630
people taking photo booth photos
near colleges.

944
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,330
- You mean, four-cut photos?
- Oh, that?

945
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,040
I really want to take those photos
with you guys.

946
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,070
- Really?
- I like that idea.

947
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,340
- Taking four-cut photos.
- I've never done it before.

948
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,510
- Right?
- Me neither.

949
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,510
(The activity
that Seok Sam suggested)

950
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,550
Seok Sam takes a photo alone.

951
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,140
- For his funeral?
- Let him do it alone.

952
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,750
- And the members...
- "The Ji Seok Sam Show."

953
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,560
(Watching the Ji Seok Sam Show)

954
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,460
- The Ji Seok Sam Show.
- Hey!

955
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,760
- I like that.
- The Ji Seok Sam Show.

956
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,420
- I like that.
- I put on a show in front of you?

957
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,030
- You can do some impressions.
- Or tell us jokes.

958
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,890
You can do impressions,
tell us jokes, and host an event.

959
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,800
- Seok Sam used to...
- That sounds great.

960
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,860
host events at Everland
when it was called Yongin Farmland.

961
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,330
- He's...
- But I had...

962
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,810
- a script back then.
- He's good at hosting fun events.

963
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:40,810
- He's a great host.
- You can do it.

964
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,040
- Cross it off.
- The rose festival...

965
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,310
- I don't have any ideas for that.
- Okay.

966
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,340
- Let's take four-cut photos.
- I think that's a good idea too.

967
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,550
This will be...

968
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,340
- Right. It'll be meaningful.
- It'll be meaningful.

969
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,750
- Taking four-cut photos.
- Taking four-cut photos.

970
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,050
That will be so fun.

971
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,110
Okay. We're done.
You see, I'm pretty sure...

972
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,690
that all of our viewers want us...

973
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,910
- to do this.
- This activity.

974
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,880
- The one-hour date?
- Right. I really want to see it.

975
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,060
- What's so interesting about it?
- It'll help us get high ratings.

976
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,300
- Our ratings will go up.
- Definitely.

977
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,500
- There's no doubt.
- I wonder what they'll talk about.

978
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,470
- We'll choose our first activity.
- Okay.

979
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,330
- All right.
- Please, Jae Suk.

980
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,970
- Please pick an easy one.
- Here we go.

981
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,600
- Okay. I'll spin it.
- The date.

982
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,540
(Many people want to see
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo on a date.)

983
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,670
I'm so curious.

984
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,140
Please.

985
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,810
- It's the date.
- Okay. Great.

986
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,340
It's the date.

987
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,550
- Okay. Great.
- It's the date.

988
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,190
- No, it's not.
- Oh, it's not that one.

989
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,590
- No.
- Is it taking photos?

990
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,790
- Okay. Great.
- What are you doing?

991
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,960
(The passionate fan interferes.)

992
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,530
- Stop spinning it.
- A little more.

993
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,960
Stop it already.

994
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
It's stopping.

995
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,500
- It's stopping. Okay.
- It's almost there.

996
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,500
- Wait. I'll spin it again.
- Go ahead.

997
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,950
Besides,
did anyone tell me to spin it?

998
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,540
- No one did.
- Right?

999
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,610
- Why didn't you stop me?
- That wasn't fair.

1000
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,850
- Suk Jin should've done it.
- Why didn't you stop me?

1001
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,240
- Right.
- Why didn't you stop me?

1002
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,310
Let's make the decision this time.

1003
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,150
- Suk Jin will spin it.
- Let Seok Sam spin it.

1004
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,750
- Okay. Let's end it here.
- Seok Sam will spin it.

1005
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,690
- I'll end it once and for all.
- Let's make the decision here.

1006
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,020
This is for real.

1007
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,690
- We'll make the decision.
- Okay.

1008
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,860
- To be honest...
- Hey.

1009
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,790
- My gosh. Look at that.
- That's it.

1010
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,060
(The roulette starts to slow down
near the slot for the date.)

1011
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,300
- It's stopping.
- It stopped...

1012
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,340
Okay.

1013
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,440
(The Yoo Jae Suk Show)

1014
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,700
(It stopped at the Yoo Jae Suk Show
one slot before the date.)

1015
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,580
(Disappointed and upset)

1016
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,350
- Let's pick it next time.
- Okay.

1017
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,510
- We have no choice.
- Okay.

1018
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,150
- You can do whatever you want.
- Congratulations.

1019
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,750
Jae Suk, you can do a talk show...

1020
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,210
or anything you want to do.

1021
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,360
- Got it. Then...
- Will we do it at the pavilion?

1022
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,360
- Are we going to the pavilion?
- First...

1023
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,430
We booked a large venue
just in case.

1024
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,700
Do you want to go there
or stay here?

1025
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,560
- Let's go there.
- Would you prefer that?

1026
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,560
- Let's go there and continue.
- Okay.

1027
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,640
Let's move to the next location
and begin the Yoo Jae Suk Show.

1028
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,700
- Let's get going.
- Is it a large place?

1029
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,670
- Let's go.
- We sure know how to have fun.

1030
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,960
- During the Yoo Jae Suk Show,
- Yes.

1031
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,970
I'll try various things
that I've always wanted to try...

1032
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,800
along with other activities.

1033
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,620
Are you planning
a variety of events?

1034
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,740
You know what I've been saying...

1035
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,810
- these days.
- What's that?

1036
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,420
I've been making suggestions.

1037
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,190
- Sure, go ahead.
- I've made suggestions.

1038
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,420
I'd like that.

1039
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,690
- I'll give it a try.
- Sure.

1040
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,360
- Haha, they're adorable!
- I love that we have a park here.

1041
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,400
Who is it?

1042
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,330
- Did you take your kids out?
- Yes.

1043
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,760
Raising kids is tough, isn't it?

1044
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,290
I'd be lying if I said
that it wasn't hard.

1045
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,440
- But it makes you happy.
- That's right.

1046
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,460
- What do you mean?
- I know that, but...

1047
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,460
- Of course we're happy.
- Of course.

1048
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,910
- When will your song be released?
- Haha...

1049
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,200
One will be released in the summer.

1050
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,650
- Haha.
- Run it by us first.

1051
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,040
- Your song...
- Run it by us.

1052
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,240
Run it by us first
before releasing it.

1053
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,390
Why? My previous song wasn't so bad.

1054
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,740
- As if.
- Haha!

1055
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,280
He releases songs
like we go shopping.

1056
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,010
- What? Like a luxury item?
- Like we go shopping?

1057
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,480
- Of course.
- "Busan Vacance" was a good one.

1058
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,830
- Right.
- Jong Kook,

1059
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,520
- you...
- Not this time around.

1060
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,130
- You'll be releasing one too.
- Right.

1061
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,760
- Yes, with KCM.
- A new song?

1062
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,020
Yes, with KCM.

1063
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,290
- Really?
- He suggested we sing a duet.

1064
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,960
He felt bad about losing out
on the previous opportunity.

1065
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,910
- How about a duet with Ji Hyo?
- That sounds nice.

1066
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,580
Don't be ridiculous.

1067
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,950
- You see...
- I quite like that.

1068
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,850
We haven't had married couples
sing duets in a while.

1069
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,310
(Duets by married couples
are a thing of the past.)

1070
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,740
With just the affection
we have for one another

1071
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,810
(The next big hit
by a married couple)

1072
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,310
Like Hong Seo Beom
and Jo Gap Gyeong.

1073
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,450
Why did you have to sit next to me?

1074
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,450
Their song is "My Love to You."

1075
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,860
- My love to you
- My love to you

1076
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,490
(She tries to get him
to sing a duet.)

1077
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,490
- My love to you
- My love to you

1078
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,870
I've come up with a title
for your song.

1079
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,370
"There's No Ramyeon at Your Place."

1080
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:31,370
- There's no ramyeon at your place
- There's no ramyeon at your place

1081
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:35,270
(An enchanting melody)

1082
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,650
It's a trot song.

1083
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:40,010
- The market
- I checked last night

1084
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,420
My favorite ramyeon

1085
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,920
Is the one I share with you

1086
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,950
My favorite ramyeon

1087
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:52,700
- Then...
- Is the one I share with you

1088
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,290
- There you go.
- And after having ramyeon

1089
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,600
You've got to be kidding me.

1090
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,790
Cook it deliciously

1091
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,560
If you like me

1092
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,110
If you truly like me

1093
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,970
You would cook me ramyeon
for the rest of my life

1094
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,940
Kiss

1095
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,270
Is this the so-called
Yoo Jae Suk Show?

1096
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,540
- Gosh.
- Has it begun?

1097
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,420
Has it already started?

1098
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,420
- The Yoo Jae Suk Show.
- Right, the Yoo Jae Suk Show.

1099
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,810
Will it go on for an hour?

1100
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,390
The Yoo Jae Suk Show has begun.

1101
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,630
"Kiss, kiss, kiss" had me laughing.

1102
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,020
He sang that
while looking straight at me.

1103
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,020
(He wanted to yell,
but ended up laughing.)

1104
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,430
He tried his best to sound annoying.

1105
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,760
That was him trying really hard.

1106
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,130
Was that the kissing sound?

1107
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,230
That's right.

1108
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,400
- The kissing.
- Unbelievable.

1109
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,940
I can't believe him.

1110
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,200
- Then...
- There's no ramyeon

1111
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,880
At your place

1112
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,380
Cook it

1113
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,080
It really feels like
we're going on a vacation.

1114
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,950
Of course I remember this place.

1115
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,780
I know this place too well.

1116
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,450
- Really?
- Red Velvet.

1117
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,690
- That's right.
- We met Red Velvet here.

1118
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,100
We had the name tag elimination
and Kwang Soo kept running.

1119
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,290
- That's right.
- Kwang Soo kept running away.

1120
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,760
In the final moments,
he went into the pool.

1121
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,290
- We played a game here.
- That's right.

1122
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,370
- What was the game?
- You're right.

1123
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,060
I don't remember,
but one at a time...

1124
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,610
I'm sorry,
but please sit down and stay quiet.

1125
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,300
Shut our mouths.

1126
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,410
Yes, and please sit.

1127
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,740
- Let's all be quiet.
- And sit.

1128
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,350
- What now?
- Sorry?

1129
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,080
- What's next?
- Jae Suk.

1130
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,520
How about Chinese idioms?

1131
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,020
- Let's do it again.
- The one with the drawing.

1132
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,210
I'm in!

1133
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,060
We did that one too many times.

1134
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,750
- So for an hour...
- Yes?

1135
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,120
- It's currently 11:58 a.m.
- Right.

1136
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,700
- How about lunch?
- Sorry?

1137
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,890
It's time for lunch.

1138
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,830
- I mean...
- Please sit at the far end.

1139
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,370
Mister.

1140
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,790
- Mister, get over here.
- But...

1141
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,060
I don't appreciate
your annoying comments.

1142
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,270
Sit at the far end.

1143
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,210
- Unbelievable.
- I'm trying to run a show,

1144
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,930
- so why...
- I wasn't trying to annoy you.

1145
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:49,080
Anyway,

1146
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,350
if I'm being honest,

1147
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,620
- I don't have anything planned.
- Of course not.

1148
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,890
- Right.
- So what should we do?

1149
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,790
(Well...)

1150
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,290
- Let's play for some food.
- Hold on.

1151
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,560
Are you now thinking about
what to do?

1152
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,210
- I am.
- Seriously?

1153
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,960
- You have nothing planned?
- What?

1154
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,060
- Why aren't you prepared?
- You thought of nothing?

1155
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,200
I'm now thinking about it.

1156
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,290
- You had more than enough time.
- The viewers wanted a show...

1157
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:12,120
where Jae Suk does
anything he wants.

1158
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,290
- That's right.
- Really?

1159
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,000
- Like I said...
- Do whatever you want.

1160
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,140
It's my time to do something
that I've been meaning to try.

1161
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,480
- Like what?
- What do you have in mind?

1162
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,080
- I would like...
- Yes?

1163
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,910
Ji Hyo and Jong Kook to...

1164
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,500
Don't.

1165
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,680
(He'd like to force them on a date.)

1166
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,270
Don't!

1167
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,140
- Just so that you can have fun...
- Wait!

1168
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,790
- I'd love that.
- You're being selfish.

1169
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,250
- Don't.
- I second that.

1170
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,290
- But it's the Yoo Jae Suk Show.
- But...

1171
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,960
I'm allowed to do anything.

1172
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,060
No, don't.

1173
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,460
So you'll have them do that here?

1174
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,160
- Then...
- A segment within the show.

1175
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,600
I won't force anything...

1176
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,330
since it will only put pressure...

1177
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,040
- on Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.
- Right.

1178
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,370
- How about...
- So go ahead...

1179
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,430
- and get us some snacks.
- Yes!

1180
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,430
- You're making us run errands?
- That's not it.

1181
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,930
Once we have food...

1182
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,270
- Look at her.
- She's getting ready to go.

1183
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,810
- She's up for it.
- But...

1184
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,910
- I love this about Ji Hyo.
- I can't be bothered, that's all.

1185
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:04,950
Getting something to eat
isn't hard at all.

1186
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,560
Don't forget the eggs
and the sikhye.

1187
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,020
- Sweetie.
- Your girlfriend's ready to go.

1188
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,020
- Sweetie.
- That seems unnatural.

1189
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,960
- What do you mean?
- Why call her my girlfriend?

1190
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,390
- She's just someone she knows.
- Let's go!

1191
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,830
Stop forcing it on us.

1192
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,000
- I...
- Let's go!

1193
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,140
Come on, let's go.

1194
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,910
Let's go. Get up.

1195
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,430
- Let's go.
- What...

1196
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,080
- What's with you?
- Jong Kook.

1197
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,330
Why are you being this way?

1198
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,140
- Let's go.
- Don't read too much into it.

1199
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,450
What's with you?

1200
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,080
- Come on, Ji Hyo. Let's go!
- Then...

1201
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,370
Get us some snacks.

1202
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,620
- As in what?
- Pay with this.

1203
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,910
Sure, got it.

1204
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,140
- I'd like some mild coffee.
- Got it.

1205
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,410
Ji Hyo, let's go.

1206
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,310
- Sikhye?
- They have it here.

1207
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,580
- Sikhye and...
- Sikhye and eggs.

1208
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,500
- The rest of us...
- What game should we play?

1209
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,890
- The rest of us...
- We should have a plan.

1210
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,520
Can you lie down?

1211
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,790
- On our backs?
- Really?

1212
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,870
Suk Jin,

1213
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,930
you can stand up.

1214
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,230
I'm loving the Yoo Jae Suk Show.

1215
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,370
- This is hilarious.
- Why only me?

1216
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
Why should I stand
when the others are on their backs?

1217
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,600
And now...

1218
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,770
Give us a massage.

1219
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,770
- And...
- The amusement park MC.

1220
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,810
(You can be the amusement park MC.)

1221
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,060
We hired you
to keep us entertained today.

1222
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,850
- So...
- But I want to rest.

1223
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,960
- You can keep talking.
- Suk Jin, keep us entertained.

1224
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,500
I'm sorry,
but is this the King Game?

1225
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,460
- I...
- What on earth is this?

1226
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,770
- It's the Yoo Jae Suk Show.
- No, it's the King Game.

1227
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,330
- Relax if you want to.
- I know

1228
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,000
Can we also get some eggs?

1229
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,640
How about three per person?

1230
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,500
- That's too many.
- Is that so?

1231
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,580
- Sorry.
- We have to have our lunch.

1232
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,870
I wanted to eat some protein.

1233
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,180
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1234
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,120
Which snacks should I buy?

1235
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,680
The Homerun Ball for starters.

1236
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,080
(Look at that.)

1237
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,520
- What...
- Things are looking good.

1238
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,350
- That was sweet of you.
- This may come true.

1239
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,580
You can't carry all of that.
Let me help.

1240
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,060
No, I can carry them all.

1241
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,660
There still is some room left.

1242
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,370
It's fine. You don't have to.

1243
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,020
- Still.
- Don't.

1244
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,600
There's no need to carry anything.

1245
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,640
This isn't efficient at all.

1246
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,640
Don't you agree?

1247
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,080
- There's no need to...
- I want to help, that's all.

1248
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,850
But it makes no sense.

1249
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,480
What's with those two?

1250
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,870
Is there something
going on between them?

1251
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,040
(Beats me.)

1252
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,870
- Goodness.
- Here you go.

1253
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,040
- Take your pick.
- Did you buy some eggs?

1254
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,620
- Of course.
- Eggs are the best.

1255
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1256
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,310
- Here.
- It's plum juice.

1257
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,460
- Good job.
- Gosh, that's sweet.

1258
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,480
(Slap!)

1259
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,700
- You...
- Watch.

1260
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,960
(They start messing around
with the eggs.)

1261
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,000
It hurts, doesn't it?

1262
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,730
(This looks like fun.)

1263
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,770
It hurts.

1264
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,040
(Crack!)

1265
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,500
(Startled)

1266
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,480
- It hurts.
- That was my fist.

1267
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,180
- That was my fist.
- That really hurts.

1268
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,410
What in the...

1269
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,950
I saw how Se Chan
just used his fist.

1270
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,710
(He gets revenge!)

1271
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,020
It really hurts.

1272
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,960
Stop it.

1273
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,160
Stop it, misters!

1274
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,680
Get back here.

1275
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,330
(Third segment: Tag with Seok Sam)

1276
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,700
(Chuckling)

1277
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,330
Look at them having fun.

1278
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,620
Is this what you wanted for
the Yoo Jae Suk Show?

1279
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,770
Get back here!

1280
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,910
(Most segments are created
to entertain the show host.)

1281
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,710
I'm going to crack your skull open.

1282
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,080
He's so annoying.

1283
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,870
- Jong Kook, please.
- What?

1284
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,100
Please catch him for me.

1285
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,370
Do it yourself.

1286
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,540
Catch him for me.

1287
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,950
- You're the one who wants to.
- Catch him for me.

1288
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,350
I want to crack this on his head.

1289
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,160
(It's funny though.)

1290
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,210
What are you laughing at?

1291
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,930
(He takes his anger out
on Haha instead.)

1292
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,350
It's quite hard to peel the shell.

1293
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,390
(He takes his anger out
on Haha instead.)

1294
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,960
(Jae Suk cracks another egg.)

1295
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,870
(Seok Sam keeps letting his head
get hammered.)

1296
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,930
(Once again,
he fails to catch Jae Suk.)

1297
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,270
This is so annoying.

1298
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,000
- So annoying!
- Here.

1299
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,480
How is this the Yoo Jae Suk Show?

1300
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,270
It's Yoo Jae Suk's Prankster Show.

1301
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,640
I keep watching it though.

1302
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,620
(It's funny for some reason.)

1303
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,750
It's funny.

1304
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,910
So what did you two talk about?

1305
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,230
- Not much.
- Not much?

1306
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,850
That's why you haven't been
successful in love.

1307
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,790
Unbelievable.

1308
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,660
- What are you talking about?
- I...

1309
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:12,330
We let you have some alone time.

1310
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,930
Feed the person next to you.

1311
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:20,600
(Fourth segment:
Feed the one next to you.)

1312
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,910
We're doing this
to witness one single scene.

1313
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,480
- They're your main targets today.
- Gosh, no.

1314
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,950
Forcing things to happen
isn't something...

1315
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,450
- the viewers like.
- Exactly.

1316
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,310
- It'll only pressure them.
- The viewers hate that.

1317
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,460
Is this really the Yoo Jae Suk Show?

1318
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,460
You both...

1319
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,960
Jong Kook's highly irritated.

1320
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,750
He's scoffing.

1321
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,890
(Sweetie!)

1322
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,370
(Ji Hyo plays the game
in "expert" mode.)

1323
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,870
(They're loving it.)

1324
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,770
Ji Hyo's hilarious these days.

1325
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,500
Ji Hyo,
I get what you're doing, but...

1326
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,910
Are you getting extra pay?

1327
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,020
Finish it now!
We're running out of time!

1328
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,020
Hey!

1329
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,140
- Hurry up!
- You don't like chocolate, right?

1330
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,290
I'll remove it for you.

1331
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:06,140
Are you getting extra pay?

1332
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,890
Are you shooting a different show?

1333
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:09,960
Gosh, he's...

1334
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,230
Why is he being so shy?

1335
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,520
- It's hilarious.
- This is nice.

1336
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,020
- They're lovey-dovey.
- This is great.

1337
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,600
- Today,
- Yes?

1338
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,540
we're here at a dry sauna
after a long while.

1339
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,600
I know this is the Yoo Jae Suk Show,

1340
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,160
but let's talk about the things
we've wanted to tell each other.

1341
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,600
Right.

1342
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,710
All right.

1343
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,910
- Let's do that.
- I have a question.

1344
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:29,330
- Yes.
- Is this the Yoo Jae Suk Show...

1345
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,600
- or the Kim Jong Kook Show?
- Stop it already!

1346
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,080
- He got hit!
- Stop it already!

1347
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,080
He got hit!

1348
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,120
He got hit at the crown of his head.

1349
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,390
(The host got hit
while teasing Jong Kook.)

1350
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,890
We can say
whatever we've wanted to say.

1351
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,850
- For whom is this show for?
- I mean...

1352
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,350
You don't have to participate.
I'll talk to her.

1353
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:47,120
I've always been grateful
for everything you've done for me...

1354
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,460
for the past 12 years.

1355
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,200
All right.

1356
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,560
It's over?

1357
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,960
(End of the segment)

1358
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,160
As soon as Suk Jin started...

1359
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,160
That's it?

1360
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,460
How can a segment end so fast?

1361
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,080
- How many segments are there?
- It'll be continued.

1362
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,680
Are there any fun games you know of?

1363
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,540
Nothing's more fun
than a drawing game.

1364
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,980
- I love that game.
- A drawing game...

1365
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,350
- Me too.
- It's so fun.

1366
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:12,250
We must choose four candidates
for the penalty.

1367
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,750
We can play a game and decide that.

1368
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,750
We can decide that right away?
Let's play a game and decide.

1369
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,330
Let's do that.
The loser gets the penalty.

1370
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,460
There's this classic game
we played...

1371
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,000
- we had so much fun with.
- What is it?

1372
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,290
What is it?

1373
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,700
The game I prepared...

1374
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,890
is Towel Tug of War.

1375
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,540
- Towel Tug of War?
- That's right.

1376
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,770
(The sixth segment
of the Yoo Jae Suk Show)

1377
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:33,210
(Towel Tug of War)

1378
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,640
One player will be holding
the ends of a towel,

1379
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,000
and the rest of the players
will pull the first player.

1380
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,250
- And you must win.
- Will it be a 2-on-2 game?

1381
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,450
Sorry? It'll be 3 on 3.

1382
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,540
- Three on three?
- That's right.

1383
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:46,710
When the score is 2 to 0...

1384
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,480
or 2 to 1,

1385
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,330
one of the members
of the losing team...

1386
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:52,160
will be a candidate for the penalty.

1387
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,750
What about the host?
Will you be exempt?

1388
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,290
I'll have to host the game
since it's a 3-on-3 game.

1389
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,270
- Then you won't even play?
- What will your role be?

1390
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,290
I know.

1391
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,770
I mean...

1392
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,230
All of us can be a candidate
for the penalty.

1393
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,870
This is the Yoo Jae Suk Show.

1394
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:07,210
- We can vote for you, though.
- Even so...

1395
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,330
We have that right.

1396
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,750
The voting is up to us.

1397
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:11,810
- Then...
- We'll play the game,

1398
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,850
and if it turns out...

1399
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,520
- If it's 6 to 1...
- If it's not that fun,

1400
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,890
- Then he'll be the candidate.
- then he'll be chosen.

1401
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,120
Let's do this. Okay.

1402
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,390
Let's put these away.

1403
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,680
Okay, but do we have to?

1404
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,960
I think we can play it on the mat.

1405
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,330
- Let's play it on the mat.
- Put them away.

1406
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,160
So it's this song.

1407
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,290
(Suddenly playing a theme song
for a sports day)

1408
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,620
(Weren't you guys
going to play a game?)

1409
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,500
- A sports day!
- In 2, 3, 4.

1410
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:37,640
Now, we'll divide into teams.

1411
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,930
- Think of it as a sports day.
- All right.

1412
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:43,450
- It'll be a best-of-three-race.
- A best-of-three-race.

1413
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:44,580
Towel Tug of War.

1414
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,210
Are you ready for Towel Tug of War?

1415
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,520
- Yes.
- All right. First...

1416
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,080
I don't want to play
Towel Tug of War.

1417
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,250
Me neither.

1418
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,680
- What is this?
- I really don't want to play.

1419
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,750
Let's just...

1420
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,680
No, let's give it a shot.

1421
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,290
- I really don't want to play it.
- Why are we playing it?

1422
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:58,460
I don't want to!

1423
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,890
Why are we playing Towel Tug of War?

1424
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:03,430
Let's warm up first
since we need to.

1425
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,620
How do we warm up?

1426
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,430
- We'll follow you.
- Follow after me.

1427
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,140
Why is the Yoo Jae Suk Show
like this?

1428
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,270
- Gosh, seriously.
- Can you change your move?

1429
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,230
He's like a thug.

1430
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:14,410
Gosh, seriously.

1431
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,140
(Moving to the side)

1432
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:21,180
Don't stall for time!

1433
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,250
You're stalling for time
because you think it won't be fun.

1434
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,140
Now, spin.

1435
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:26,850
Spin.

1436
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,620
What is this?

1437
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,060
(The host carries on
despite the complaints.)

1438
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:32,980
(He's run out
of things to do already.)

1439
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,620
I can't help but laugh
because it's ridiculous.

1440
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,120
Let's put our arms
around each other.

1441
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,460
- It's funny.
- Let's do it.

1442
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,890
What do we do now?

1443
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,540
- What are we doing?
- What is this?

1444
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,710
- What is this?
- What is this?

1445
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,210
What is this?

1446
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,830
- Mister!
- Seriously...

1447
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,180
- Hey!
- We need to warm up.

1448
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,540
- It's already warmed up.
- We must warm up.

1449
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,680
We must warm up.

1450
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,210
But it's not making me feel better!

1451
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,540
Are you ready now?

1452
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,080
- What?
- What do you mean if we're ready?

1453
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,080
What did we even do?

1454
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,350
- The Tug of War will begin now.
- Okay.

1455
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,060
- How...
- Ji Hyo and So Min...

1456
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,460
- So Min.
- will decide the teams.

1457
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,500
All right.

1458
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,700
Round One will start
with these members.

1459
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,020
- What about you?
- I need to host it.

1460
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,500
- You'll be the host?
- Get ready.

1461
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,770
- What do I do?
- Stand in the front.

1462
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:16,160
- I stand in the front?
- Grab over here.

1463
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,460
The one who's good at it
must stand in the front.

1464
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,370
Watch your pronunciation.

1465
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,770
Mister, what's funny is that...

1466
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,350
she's grabbing my waist, but...

1467
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,480
She should grab it tight.

1468
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,870
- But it's...
- It's up to you guys.

1469
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:30,450
- You should figure it out.
- But they're grabbing the towel.

1470
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,680
You guys should figure it out.

1471
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,040
- What?
- You told us to grab the waist.

1472
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,980
- That's up to you.
- We can beat them.

1473
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,980
The rule changed?
We can do whatever we want?

1474
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,430
(MC Yoo clearly told them to grab
the member's waist and pull.)

1475
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,020
(But when the game started,
he went back on his word.)

1476
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,890
The rule changed?
We can do whatever we want?

1477
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,540
It's up to us, but we can only
hold on to it this much?

1478
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,060
- What is this?
- I'm sorry,

1479
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,160
- It's just a game!
- but what's this supposed to be?

1480
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,640
That's a reasonable complaint.

1481
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,000
- It is reasonable.
- Right?

1482
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,600
- I get everything else.
- Let it go.

1483
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,210
But why are we given only this much
and why did they take that much?

1484
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,270
Let it go.

1485
00:45:58,270 --> 00:45:59,770
This is why I told you
to grab the waist.

1486
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:00,980
- It's better to hold the waist.
- But...

1487
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:01,980
what about you?

1488
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,710
What are you doing?

1489
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,350
I'd be beaten to death at this rate.

1490
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,060
It's not that.

1491
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,660
(The host will be beaten to death
for a terrible game.)

1492
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,620
- What are you supposed to do?
- Let it go, will you?

1493
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,350
What about you? What's your role?

1494
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:14,350
I get it, but...

1495
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:16,350
- What do we get out of this?
- It's the Yoo Jae Suk Show.

1496
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:17,830
I know that it is,
but why are you so...

1497
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:18,890
- Hey!
- Let's start already.

1498
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:19,930
- Jong Kook.
- Get ready.

1499
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:21,230
I'm holding the center.

1500
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,890
- Get ready.
- Hurry.

1501
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:24,140
- It slipped.
- He's practically lying down.

1502
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,310
What about it? You're supposed to
lie down in a Tug of War.

1503
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:27,810
- We can do that? Okay.
- You can lie down too.

1504
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:28,930
Get ready.

1505
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,310
- We can do that? Okay.
- You can lie down too.

1506
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:31,500
Get ready.

1507
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,810
- Set...
- Hey. You can't lie down yet.

1508
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:33,870
But you said we could.

1509
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,210
- Set...
- Hey. You can't lie down yet.

1510
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,350
(The game starts right away.)

1511
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:37,950
- You told us it was allowed.
- Hold on.

1512
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,390
- Why did you start the game?
- We won.

1513
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:40,410
It's over!

1514
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,480
You should start when we are...

1515
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,890
- We won. We're the winners.
- Team So Min wins the first round.

1516
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,430
We won.

1517
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,960
- Team So Min wins the first round.
- We're the winners.

1518
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,390
All right. This is great.

1519
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:50,100
- Why did you do that?
- You shouldn't host like that.

1520
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,500
It's not fun!

1521
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,790
It's not fun at all.

1522
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,660
It's so boring even though we won.

1523
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,270
It'll get fun when we have
the candidates for the penalty.

1524
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,370
Don't worry.

1525
00:46:58,370 --> 00:46:59,410
- Then what's going to happen?
- For the first round...

1526
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:00,540
You'll be in a different team
for the second round.

1527
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,540
We'll choose our teams again?

1528
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,140
- Yes, for Round Two.
- How will this work?

1529
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,370
(What? We're switching teams?)

1530
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:05,950
We're going to warm up again.
Get ready.

1531
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:06,980
- For Round Two...
- The person...

1532
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,680
who loses the most
will be a candidate?

1533
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,910
What? I already told you.

1534
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,950
- If the score is 2 to 0,
- Then it'll be over.

1535
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:13,890
then one member of the losing team
will become the candidate.

1536
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:14,960
Oh, really?

1537
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,180
But we can't tell
which team is winning or losing.

1538
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,290
Shouldn't we stay on the same team?

1539
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,430
- Sorry?
- That way, we have a candidate.

1540
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,160
No, that's not it.
I told you it'd be random.

1541
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,790
- Random?
- So that Jong Kook...

1542
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:28,100
- That's right.
- You can join Jong Kook this time.

1543
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,960
- That way, it'll be 1 to 1.
- Is it just me who doesn't get it?

1544
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,960
Yes.

1545
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,500
The one who was on the losing team
must remember it.

1546
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,930
- How many times must we lose?
- That's right.

1547
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,600
- How many times must we lose?
- I have one win.

1548
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,870
- I have one win too.
- Right.

1549
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,100
How many rounds are we playing?

1550
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,410
No idea.

1551
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:41,870
Shouldn't we stay on the same team?

1552
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:42,950
Isn't that how it works?

1553
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,890
- We'll play until we pass out.
- Is that so?

1554
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,060
- Let's begin Round Two.
- Okay.

1555
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,620
For Round Two,
we'll divide teams again.

1556
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,020
- They all sat down.
- Since Suk Jin sat down first,

1557
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,020
so you take him.

1558
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,200
- It's okay. That's how it works.
- All right.

1559
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,850
- It's okay. We can win.
- It's doable.

1560
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:56,890
We can still win.

1561
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,060
- All right.
- I don't think we can win.

1562
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,370
It's doable, right? It is doable.

1563
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,870
- You should go second.
- This is doable.

1564
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,100
Lie down as soon as it starts.

1565
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,410
Hold the center.

1566
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,140
We should hold the towel
as much as we can.

1567
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,180
Their part is longer.

1568
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,980
- Get ready.
- This is making me competitive.

1569
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,450
- We don't stand a chance...
- Get ready...

1570
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:11,770
because we only have female members.

1571
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,140
- You never know.
- Let me lie down a bit.

1572
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,250
- We should lie down too.
- Hold on.

1573
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:16,850
- Hold on.
- My gosh.

1574
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,250
Goodness. He's strong like a bull.

1575
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,890
Get ready. Set...

1576
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:23,520
(Who will be the winner
of this game?)

1577
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,000
Set,

1578
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,200
go!

1579
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,230
- It's 1 to 1.
- Okay!

1580
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:35,270
- Okay!
- Okay!

1581
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:36,810
I got two points. I won twice.

1582
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:37,930
Sorry?

1583
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:39,100
It's not 1 to 1.

1584
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,270
That doesn't matter.
It's still 1 to 1.

1585
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:42,710
Why doesn't it matter?

1586
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:43,870
- Wait. Hey.
- It doesn't matter.

1587
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:44,910
But I won.

1588
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:47,270
- It's confusion. Think carefully.
- It doesn't matter.

1589
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:48,950
I told you.

1590
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,210
I have one win. What about you?

1591
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:51,750
- I won twice.
- I won twice too.

1592
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,460
- It's confusing.
- It's 1 to 1.

1593
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,410
No, they lost twice.

1594
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,330
- It's 1 to 1.
- Exclude those who lost twice.

1595
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:58,830
- This team won earlier, right?
- Yes.

1596
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,160
- And you guys won this time.
- Yes.

1597
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,830
But the members changed.

1598
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,020
Let's beat him.

1599
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,230
So what matters is which side
we are standing.

1600
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:10,060
Then we just need to focus
on the last round.

1601
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,310
The winning team of
the last round will be the winner.

1602
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:12,460
No, what matters is where you stand.

1603
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:15,100
- Isn't that right? The winner...
- No, it's neck and neck.

1604
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,230
It's neck and neck
with a score of 1 to 1.

1605
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:19,870
I hate Tug of War. It's not fun.

1606
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:21,520
- You don't like it?
- No.

1607
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,680
Then...

1608
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,040
What about this?

1609
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,040
- What is it?
- Lie down on your stomach...

1610
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:27,560
- and see who goes the farthest.
- Like curling?

1611
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,850
(Pushing yourself on your stomach)

1612
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,520
Doesn't it look fun?

1613
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,060
It looks painful.

1614
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,790
- Oh, gosh.
- Be careful.

1615
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,660
It's burning.

1616
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,890
- It'll burn your skin.
- I have an idea.

1617
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:45,540
You must include a relay race
when it comes to a sports day.

1618
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,810
- A relay.
- That's right.

1619
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:48,330
Whatever happened
to the Tug of War, then?

1620
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:49,980
Sorry? You got two wins.

1621
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,210
- Two wins.
- It's still valid?

1622
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,350
- You got two wins.
- All right.

1623
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:53,370
Since this is a team match.

1624
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:56,080
We'll play a relay race
from that point to here.

1625
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,810
- That'll be fun.
- How about we run on our stomachs?

1626
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,710
- We'll run.
- We're going to run?

1627
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,390
- This could be a lap, right?
- Come on.

1628
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,850
The area next to the pillar.
You're going to tap it and run back.

1629
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:04,850
Like a baton?

1630
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,350
- Yes, that's the halfway point.
- Two must stay there.

1631
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:07,730
Two here and one over there.

1632
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:11,390
Let's divide into teams.
Ji Hyo and So Min will decide.

1633
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:13,000
Paper.

1634
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,200
- All right.
- I pick Se Chan.

1635
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,700
What about you, Ji Hyo?

1636
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,160
(She picks Jong Kook.)

1637
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:20,980
Okay!

1638
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,080
Pick one more member.

1639
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,000
So Min, should you pick Suk Jin?

1640
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,410
Who do you think is faster?

1641
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,620
- Still, Haha must be faster.
- I run really fast.

1642
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,680
I pick Jae Suk.

1643
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:30,080
He can play too?

1644
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,350
I pick Jae Suk.

1645
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:32,580
(She picked the host?)

1646
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,660
Then...

1647
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,390
Then Suk Jin should host it.

1648
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,180
- Then I should...
- Yes, you should host it.

1649
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,080
I can host the game, then.

1650
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,850
- I'm on your team, then.
- This is great.

1651
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,060
- Hey.
- This is great.

1652
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,120
- All right.
- I never imagined it.

1653
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,500
Why is Jae Suk playing
all of a sudden?

1654
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,500
That's because So Min...

1655
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,890
- suddenly picked me.
- He was chosen.

1656
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,330
- The team...
- Then how many wins do you have?

1657
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,870
Since it's 1 to 1,

1658
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,730
the members of the losing team
in the next game will be a candidate.

1659
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:57,980
- How strange.
- Yes.

1660
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,450
I won't get punishment then.

1661
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,640
- Why not?
- I won't receive punishment.

1662
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,770
I won't lose because I'm the MC.

1663
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,640
But I can play...

1664
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,540
- instead of you.
- Right.

1665
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,390
You can?
Then I would have to root for you.

1666
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:09,710
Yes. You should be rooting for me.

1667
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:10,930
You should be biased.

1668
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:12,080
Gosh.

1669
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:15,430
- Are you ready?
- Are you the first one to go?

1670
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:17,660
- Yes, I'm the first.
- Is Ji Hyo the second one to go?

1671
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:22,100
Gosh. I won the flag-grabbing game
in "Let's Go! Dream Team."

1672
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,500
I was number one.

1673
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:25,660
The one who grabs this wins.

1674
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,810
So Min. You should be barefooted.

1675
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:27,910
- Barefooted?
- Yes.

1676
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,310
You got this.

1677
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:30,410
(1 member from the losing team will
be a candidate to get punishment!)

1678
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:32,210
- You should go then come back.
- You got this.

1679
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:33,270
(Which team will win?)

1680
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:34,640
Ready.

1681
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:38,250
Go.

1682
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,810
So Min is slow. Gosh.

1683
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:42,560
(Haha is faster as expected.)

1684
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,680
(After So Min, Jae Suk will go.)

1685
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,520
- She's slow.
- Hurry up.

1686
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,620
- So Min is slow.
- Hurry up.

1687
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:50,660
Hurry up.

1688
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,230
(Ji Hyo who received the baton
from Haha goes first.)

1689
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:54,600
(Jae Suk chases her from behind.)

1690
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,100
Hurry up, Ji Hyo.

1691
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,410
(Jae Suk is coming after her
at an amazing speed at that time.)

1692
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,540
Hurry up. He caught up with her.

1693
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:09,020
- The last one.
- Okay.

1694
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:12,020
(The last runners,
Se Chan and Jong Kook, run.)

1695
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,850
- Good!
- Se Chan!

1696
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:15,680
- Good.
- Beat him.

1697
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,790
- Catch him.
- Hurry up.

1698
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,430
(Se Chan barely gave Jong Kook
who tried to stop him the slip.)

1699
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:21,930
Hurry up.

1700
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:22,960
(They start spurting
for the last time.)

1701
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,770
- Hurry up.
- Go.

1702
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:29,370
Hurry up.

1703
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,810
Okay!

1704
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:32,810
(Se Chan went in.)

1705
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,830
(Jae Suk, Se Chan, and So Min won.)

1706
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:36,600
This is fun.

1707
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,100
This is thrilling.

1708
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,120
(Zooming)

1709
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,790
We won.

1710
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:46,890
Are you his girlfriend?

1711
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:49,290
- Gosh.
- Nice.

1712
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:50,290
We had a good strategy.

1713
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:52,020
- Isn't it fun?
- It hurts so much.

1714
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,930
The soles of my feet hurt so much.

1715
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,700
- Isn't it fun?
- The soles of my feet hurt so much.

1716
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,750
- How is it? Isn't it fun?
- Does it hurt?

1717
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:57,790
It hurts.

1718
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:59,290
It's fun to watch.

1719
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,790
It's fun.

1720
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,790
- They're fast.
- Hold on.

1721
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:05,730
What are the rules?
So they will have a candidate, not us?

1722
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:08,100
- The other team has a candidate.
- It's weird.

1723
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,040
As far as I know,
it's the first time...

1724
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,680
- for Haha to lose.
- They will have a candidate.

1725
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,140
Gosh.

1726
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:15,180
He's unlucky.

1727
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:17,040
- Isn't it weird?
- Jae Suk's Thug Show.

1728
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:18,910
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
- Shoot.

1729
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:19,910
(Ji Hyo is picked as a candidate
for punishment in the end.)

1730
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:20,960
Okay.

1731
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,290
(Okay!)

1732
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:24,930
He likes it so much.

1733
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,330
He's annoying.

1734
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:27,520
- Ji Hyo is mad.
- Ji Hyo.

1735
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,060
She won't receive
the punishment anyway.

1736
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:30,330
We should do it now.

1737
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:32,730
But we still got some time left
for Jae Suk Show.

1738
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,040
- Stop.
- We got more time?

1739
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,770
We don't have to do it
until the end.

1740
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:36,790
No.

1741
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:38,410
Let's talk.

1742
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,600
- Sit down for now.
- Yes. We can talk too.

1743
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,770
Sit down, everyone.

1744
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,640
Let's have a talk.

1745
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,040
That's random.

1746
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:50,310
If something fun happened
last week...

1747
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,350
or had an interesting experience...

1748
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,580
- Something bizarre?
- Hey.

1749
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,960
- Like "Incredible Moment."
- An interesting experience.

1750
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,680
Something like
an out-of-body experience.

1751
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,290
- If you have something like that...
- Let me think about it.

1752
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:03,620
Think of a horror experience
or something like that.

1753
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,060
- What should I talk about?
- A unique experience.

1754
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,430
I have a bizarre experience.
It doesn't make sense.

1755
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:08,430
Tell us.

1756
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:09,600
- Two weeks ago,
- Okay.

1757
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,370
I appeared on a golf channel
with In Gyu.

1758
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,540
I was hit by the ball
Joon Ho hit with a 4-iron golf club.

1759
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:16,580
- Who was hit?
- Me.

1760
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,580
Where?

1761
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,750
On my side. But fortunately...

1762
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:19,770
You have a lot of fat there.

1763
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,850
I was hit on my side.
But if it was a little higher or lower,

1764
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:24,390
- I would've injured badly.
- It could've been dangerous.

1765
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:25,790
- I went to a doctor.
- Okay.

1766
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:27,680
I was lucky because I had belly fat.

1767
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,960
The bruise is healed a lot now.

1768
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,930
- For real? Did you get a bruise?
- I can show you.

1769
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:33,020
- I can show you.
- Did you get a bruise?

1770
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,460
- But...
- Did you get a bruise?

1771
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,560
- But...
- As the ball spun.

1772
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,230
The ball...

1773
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:41,790
But you really have
a thick layer of fat.

1774
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:44,100
Fortunately, before I got hit,

1775
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,910
I had two bowls of hangover soup.

1776
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,000
I shouted when I was hit.

1777
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,680
- I screamed.
- Gosh.

1778
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,410
I will stay chubby.

1779
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:54,850
I want to know what Ji Hyo did
last week...

1780
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:56,020
so bad.

1781
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,290
What were your days like?
When do you wake up?

1782
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,680
- I wake up at 12 p.m.
- Okay.

1783
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,620
I go to the kitchen
to organize stuff.

1784
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:06,480
And I prepare
something to eat later.

1785
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:10,230
Around at five,
I go out to take a walk with my dog.

1786
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,330
What do you do for those five hours?

1787
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:14,200
- Do you not eat?
- Five hours is a lot of time.

1788
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,500
- For those five hours...
- Do you not eat?

1789
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,710
What do you do for those five hours?

1790
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,270
- It doesn't make sense.
- I don't eat at that time.

1791
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:20,980
- I eat at seven.
- What?

1792
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,850
- You eat your first meal at seven?
- Yes. I eat my first meal then.

1793
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,810
- It's not good.
- You eat once a day.

1794
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:29,640
I don't know how it happened,
but I adjusted my life to my dog.

1795
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,850
- So you eat.
- I eat.

1796
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,790
I clean up,

1797
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:35,390
watch TV, then go to bed.

1798
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:37,960
- What time?
- What time do you go to bed?

1799
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,580
- At 12 a.m.
- What time do you wake up?

1800
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,500
- At 12 p.m.
- Then you sleep for 12 hours?

1801
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,060
- Yes.
- You sleep for 12 hours?

1802
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,120
Do you not wake up
not even once in the middle?

1803
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,620
No. I don't wake up in the middle.

1804
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,060
How can you sleep for 12 hours?

1805
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,830
It's like you have six hours less
than me in a day.

1806
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:52,500
Let's listen to Seok Sam's
daily routine.

1807
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:54,930
- Yes. Let's listen to his story.
- Let's listen.

1808
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:57,140
- I wake up at 8:30 a.m.
- So?

1809
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,370
All my family members are sleeping.

1810
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:02,120
- Then?
- Then I watch YouTube...

1811
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,790
- by myself.
- Then?

1812
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:06,710
When I get hungry,
I have a cup of coffee with a toast.

1813
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,810
I spend my day like that until 11 a.m.

1814
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:12,390
Your story is so boring.
Can you say something fun?

1815
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:13,680
Do you eat your toast with jam?

1816
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,700
What we want is...

1817
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,430
"I was trying to get jam,
but I stepped on it and fell."

1818
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:18,560
- "I passed out for a moment."
- Do I have to make it up?

1819
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,830
- Yes.
- At 11 a.m.,

1820
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:23,560
I do bungee jumping at a veranda.

1821
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,830
(Bungee jumping at a veranda
at 11:30 a.m.)

1822
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:26,040
That's too much.

1823
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,100
You exaggerated too much.

1824
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,210
- You know the rubber band, right?
- Yes.

1825
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,750
- I do bungee jumping with that.
- You do bungee jumping?

1826
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:31,850
That's exaggerated too much.

1827
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,910
- It's funny.
- I do bungee jumping.

1828
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:36,120
I live on the 12th floor.

1829
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,480
I was hanging on the 7th floor once.

1830
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,040
That's enough.

1831
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,060
(Jae Suk Show abruptly ends.)

1832
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:46,120
Let's eat now.

1833
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,200
Finally?

1834
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,430
The vacation food...

1835
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,930
recommended by the viewers.

1836
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:52,620
- Good.
- Bring it.

1837
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,540
We're eating what the viewers
gave us?

1838
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,290
We got the exact food
they wrote in the comment.

1839
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:58,560
Do you think the viewers
sent the food?

1840
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,830
They won't just give it to us.

1841
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:02,580
- What is it?
- What's this?

1842
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:04,640
There's something Se Chan
should make.

1843
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,810
"Without a tool?"

1844
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,410
(We chose 8 out of many food ideas
from so many comments.)

1845
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,410
"Bean noodles made with millstones
by yourself."

1846
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,520
We should make
bean noodles made with millstones?

1847
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:17,930
This will take 3 to 4 hours.

1848
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:19,120
"Handmade jjajangmyeon."

1849
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,600
It will take 3 to 4 hours for us.

1850
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,750
This doesn't make sense.

1851
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:24,120
We brought the exact food
they mentioned in the comment.

1852
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,200
- Among them...
- What's this?

1853
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,230
"Food from a restaurant
with a long line?"

1854
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:27,230
Does it mean we should eat
lining up?

1855
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:28,890
One of you should get the food.

1856
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,730
- We can't eat it either.
- No. I don't want to eat it.

1857
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:31,910
It will take two hours at this hour.

1858
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:34,640
What's this?
"Made by Se Chan without a tool?"

1859
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,410
- With his hands.
- Without a tool.

1860
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,770
He should make watermelon punch
with his hands.

1861
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,210
How can we eat that?

1862
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:40,810
Will he scoop out the watermelon
with his hands?

1863
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:42,540
It's disgusting. We can't eat it.

1864
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,020
I don't know about the others,
but I can't eat what he made.

1865
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:47,390
He can't do it.
He touched his feet a lot earlier.

1866
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,810
Get ready.

1867
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,290
"Pepper ramyeon made by Ji Hyo"
is the best.

1868
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:52,390
- Right.
- It's the best one.

1869
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:53,930
"Pepper ramyeon made by Ji Hyo"
is the best.

1870
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:55,200
Yes. Ramyeon.

1871
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,700
This one is nice too.
Crabs are easy to shell.

1872
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,770
- Right.
- I can't shell crabs.

1873
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:00,770
(Hating)

1874
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,100
- It's bothersome.
- So Min...

1875
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,390
can make great pot rice.

1876
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:05,710
- But it takes time.
- She's a good cook.

1877
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:07,410
Ji Hyo's ramyeon,

1878
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:08,910
So Min's pot rice,

1879
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,180
and snow crabs are the best.

1880
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,370
- Yes.
- Yes.

1881
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:13,850
You can cover the roulette
through a simple mission again.

1882
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:15,370
- Okay.
- It's Look Into My Eyes and Say It.

1883
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:17,390
We can test how Running Man crew
who have been together...

1884
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:19,390
for 12 years can read
each other's minds.

1885
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:20,660
"Look Into My Eyes and Say It?"

1886
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:24,120
We'll show you ten words.

1887
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:26,230
One of them is the answer.

1888
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,390
I'll show it
to the first member only.

1889
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,520
The first member should describe
the word...

1890
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,890
to the next member...

1891
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,830
only with their eyes
and facial expressions.

1892
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:36,730
- That's the rule.
- No way.

1893
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:38,660
- So there are ten words.
- Yes.

1894
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:39,660
Among those ten words.

1895
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,100
- Among ten words.
- We can use eyes, right?

1896
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,100
- Yes.
- As long as we don't say it.

1897
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,480
You can't read lips.

1898
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,480
We won't.

1899
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,000
- We don't do stuff like that.
- We're not like that.

1900
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,850
We're good. We won't do it.

1901
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:48,870
We hate it the most.

1902
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,480
We're veterans.

1903
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,410
Sit in a row in the front.

1904
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,290
The one at the end
will make a guess.

1905
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:56,790
I think you should be the first one.

1906
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:58,830
- It'd be better that way, right?
- Yes.

1907
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:00,430
- You go after him, Ji Hyo.
- You go first, Jong Kook.

1908
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,060
- Me?
- I'll go first.

1909
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,520
- Yes.
- Start from there.

1910
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,560
- I'll make a guess.
- So Min, you make a guess.

1911
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,430
Wear your eye mask.

1912
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:07,790
- We'll show you if you take it off.
- Let's go.

1913
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:09,730
I'll wear it.
You should tell me what it is.

1914
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:11,730
They will show me the answer.

1915
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,710
- You should do well, Se Chan.
- Don't worry.

1916
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:14,770
Let's go.

1917
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:16,180
Don't try to do a trick, guys.

1918
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,310
These are the words.

1919
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,410
(Shampoo, butter, desire, massager,
fish, Yoo Se Yoon, crocodile,)

1920
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:20,480
(monkey, Yoo Hui Yeol, lamb skewer)

1921
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,120
Gosh.

1922
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,210
- Take off your eye mask.
- This is hard.

1923
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:25,480
It's hard.

1924
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,680
- You can take off your eye mask.
- Okay.

1925
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,680
- Okay.
- Let's see.

1926
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:28,790
Okay.

1927
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:30,060
"Shampoo." This is hard.

1928
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,430
Monkey or Se Yoon?

1929
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:32,560
- How do you describe Se Yoon?
- Go.

1930
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,830
I'll just describe the key elements.

1931
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,290
The key elements.

1932
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,730
(Shampoo, butter, desire, massager,
fish, Yoo Se Yoon, crocodile,)

1933
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:40,730
(monkey, Yoo Hui Yeol, lamb skewer)

1934
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:43,200
It's over.

1935
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,410
(Shampoo, butter, desire, massager,
fish, Yoo Se Yoon, crocodile,)

1936
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,000
- Pass.
- "Desire" is so hard.

1937
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,310
Just do as you always do.

1938
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,910
I don't know what it is.

1939
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,410
Just copy what I did.

1940
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:52,210
You can't give her a hint.

1941
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:54,910
Just copy what Jong Kook did.

1942
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:56,210
(Ji Hyo tries to mimic what Jong Kook did
as closely as possible.)

1943
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:57,210
Do it again.

1944
00:59:57,790 --> 00:59:59,040
What's the last facial expression?

1945
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,390
Jae Suk, you can't watch.

1946
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,790
(Glancing)

1947
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:03,980
Jae Suk.

1948
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:06,120
Why do you keep cheating?

1949
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,930
- Why?
- I'm not cheating.

1950
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,230
You should be fair and square.

1951
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,830
It's over. It's Haha's turn.

1952
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:11,830
Okay.

1953
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:13,230
(It's Haha's turn.)

59:59,530 --> 01:00:02,139
(Shampoo, butter, desire, massager,
fish, Yoo Se Yoon, crocodile,)

1954
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:17,810
(monkey, Yoo Hui Yeol, lamb skewer)

1955
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:18,810
Time's up.

1956
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:20,040
Isn't it you?

1957
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,100
Time's up.

1958
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,930
I think he would know.

1959
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:24,410
You can tell by a glance.

1960
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,480
What is it? All of them are hard.

1961
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,710
Okay.

1962
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,520
No. He can get it
if he gets the point.

1963
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:33,540
(Confused)

1964
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,680
Isn't it you?

1965
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,910
- You can't watch.
- Time is up.

1966
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:39,080
(Shampoo, butter, desire, massager,
fish, Yoo Se Yoon, crocodile,)

1967
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,750
(monkey, Yoo Hui Yeol, lamb skewer)

1968
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:44,020
(His tongue moves are much louder.)

1969
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:45,700
(Confused)

1970
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,830
- Time's up.
- There's no word like this.

1971
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:49,330
There's no word like this.

1972
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:50,330
Think about it.

1973
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:51,600
- There's no word like this.
- Watch closely.

1974
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,100
- Watch closely.
- Take a close look.

1975
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,040
Someone said "disgusting."

1976
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:58,040
(Lastly, it's Se Chan's turn.)

1977
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,410
- What is that?
- I don't know.

1978
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:00,600
What is that?

1979
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:02,580
- Come on.
- What is that?

1980
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,210
- Guess.
- It isn't among the options.

1981
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:05,980
- You can get it right.
- Do it again.

1982
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,560
- It is among the options.
- You can get it right.

1983
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,790
- There is one.
- What is that?

1984
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,210
You can get it right.

1985
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:11,580
What is that?

1986
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:13,350
It isn't among the options.

1987
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:15,730
- You can't give a hint.
- Okay.

1988
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:16,750
- You can get it right.
- Yoo Se Yoon.

1989
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:19,270
- No! It's a lamb skewer!
- Yoo Se Yoon.

1990
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:21,270
(They failed to use telepathy.)

1991
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:22,770
- It's butter.
- It's butter.

1992
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:24,270
- It's butter.
- It's greasy.

1993
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:25,430
The answer is butter.

1994
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,540
Why did you stick out your tongue
if it's butter?

1995
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:28,600
Haha did that.

1996
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,930
Ji Hyo did that.

1997
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:31,680
- Ji Hyo, what did you do?
- I did this.

1998
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,310
- It's greasy.
- Butter.

1999
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:34,850
- You should have done this.
- For greasiness...

2000
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,140
What is that?

2001
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:37,370
- What would you do for butter?
- What?

2002
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:38,980
- Go ahead.
- How would you act it out?

2003
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,290
- Go ahead.
- Butter?

2004
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:43,850
- What was that?
- Your tongue came out too.

2005
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:44,890
That's disgusting.

2006
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:46,350
- Your tongue came out too.
- I get it now.

2007
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:48,520
- What was that?
- You should have guessed.

2008
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,700
You should have done this.

2009
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,890
- This is fun.
- The next one.

2010
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:54,140
- Let's change seats.
- Let's change seats.

2011
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:55,700
- All right. I will guess.
- Okay.

2012
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,600
- I will go first.
- Go ahead.

2013
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:59,270
- Please get ready.
- Okay.

2014
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:01,040
(Jae Suk will go first
and Jong Kook will go last.)

2015
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,310
All right. Jae Suk.

2016
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:04,410
(Answer: Headache)

2017
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:07,410
Don't add any elements
that could be confusing.

2018
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,350
- Okay.
- Please take off your blindfolds.

2019
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:11,140
I bet Jae Suk will make it
very confusing.

2020
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:14,310
- I will guess the answer correctly.
- Squid.

2021
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:15,560
- Here I go.
- Okay.

2022
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:18,330
(Headache)

2023
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:19,520
(Groaning)

2024
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,430
- You can't make a sound, Jae Suk.
- Give him something big.

2025
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,290
- You made a sound from the start.
- Something big.

2026
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:24,770
You can't make a gesture.

2027
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:26,930
Something big.

2028
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:29,460
(He openly destroys the rules.)

2029
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,810
- Start over.
- Why?

2030
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,100
You can't make a gesture.

2031
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,330
- Start over.
- Why?

2032
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:37,480
He used his hands freely
and gave me all the clues.

2033
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,850
He shouldn't have done this
for headache.

2034
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:41,680
- I mean...
- You can't use your hands.

2035
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,450
You can't do this for headache.

2036
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:44,750
My glasses fell, so...

2037
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:46,210
- Start over.
- You should look up and...

2038
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:47,750
Add a slot for Jae Suk
to the wheel.

2039
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:50,750
For goodness' sake.
You are overly strict.

2040
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,350
- All right.
- Let's begin.

2041
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:53,730
- That was so funny.
- Let's begin.

2042
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:56,560
(Ear swab)

2043
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,290
- Done?
- Take a look.

2044
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:01,540
(It's pretty hard
to act out an ear swab.)

2045
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:02,660
Let's look at the options.

2046
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,410
- Gosh. Cat.
- There are many candidates.

2047
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:06,560
- Look for a fitting option.
- Don't worry.

2048
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,310
- Act it out to Se Chan.
- Find something similar.

2049
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:09,480
Here I go.

2050
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,850
- Don't use your hands.
- I won't.

2051
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:12,870
Ear swab and earphones
will be confusing.

2052
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:15,540
Ear swab and earphones
will be confusing.

2053
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:19,390
Pass.

2054
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,810
Pass.

2055
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:25,430
He spoke.

2056
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:26,750
(Laughing)

2057
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:28,120
Why?

2058
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:30,160
(He cheated again.)

2059
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,600
- Why?
- Jae Suk.

2060
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:32,770
Hey.

2061
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:33,930
Why did you speak?

2062
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:35,500
What did you do?

2063
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,060
- I didn't give the answer.
- What did you do?

2064
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:39,910
Jong Kook talked about ear swab,
so I went, "He mentioned it."

2065
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:41,830
What's wrong with you?

2066
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:43,310
- Seriously.
- For goodness' sake.

2067
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:44,370
Change seats.

2068
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:45,910
Don't be ridiculous.

2069
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:47,100
- Se Chan.
- So Min, go first.

2070
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,850
- I will be the first one to see it.
- Se Chan.

2071
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:50,250
- So Min, go first.
- For goodness' sake.

2072
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:52,450
Don't change anything.
Keep it as it is.

2073
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:54,120
Keep it as it is.

2074
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,310
Don't change anything.

2075
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:56,350
All right.

2076
01:03:57,850 --> 01:03:59,060
Gosh.

2077
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:00,250
(Answer: Bottle opener)

2078
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,290
- Use facial expressions only.
- Hold on.

2079
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,890
You can look now.

2080
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:05,460
Show Se Chan.

2081
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,390
Loneliness, rice ball, Dooly...

2082
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:10,040
This is hard.
How will you act out a rice ball?

2083
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:11,330
- Rice ball?
- You got it, right?

2084
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:12,600
Pretend to eat then.

2085
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:16,870
(Just like So Min,
he uses his mouth.)

2086
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:17,950
Pass.

2087
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:19,350
All right.

2088
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:20,680
- This is too easy.
- Go.

2089
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,810
- Go.
- That's the only option.

2090
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:24,040
(This question is relatively easy.)

2091
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:26,020
(Pop)

2092
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:28,020
Bottle opener!

2093
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:30,310
(Pop)

2094
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:32,750
- Bottle opener!
- Bottle opener, right?

2095
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:34,520
- I got that from the sound.
- What's wrong with you?

2096
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:35,700
Why did you do that?

2097
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,600
- I mean...
- Why did you ruin it?

2098
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,060
I didn't mean to make a sound.

2099
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,600
Why did you make a sound?

2100
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:43,330
It just came out.

2101
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:45,430
Why did you make a popping sound?

2102
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:47,430
- Why did you do that?
- This is so frustrating.

2103
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:48,710
Why did you do that?

2104
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:50,540
Just act it out.

2105
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:52,370
- Gosh.
- For goodness' sake.

2106
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:54,310
- Isn't it pain?
- That's right.

2107
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:55,810
- Nice!
- Okay!

2108
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:57,310
- It's pain.
- Why is it pain?

2109
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,480
- Is it pain? How did you know?
- It's pain.

2110
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:01,210
- I will guess.
- It's the last question.

2111
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:02,560
- Okay.
- Let's begin from that side.

2112
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,580
- We should do that.
- I will give it a go.

2113
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:07,580
We need to take out the bean noodles
made with millstones.

2114
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:09,700
We need to take it out.
Green onion kimchi too.

2115
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:12,230
I really want
the pepper ramyeon Ji Hyo made.

2116
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:14,640
- I hope Jong Kook helps her.
- Pepper ramyeon.

2117
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
(The answer gets revealed.)

2118
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
How am I supposed to act it out?

2119
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:21,910
You can look.

2120
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,310
- Let's take a look.
- So Min, you can do it.

2121
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:24,750
- It's the last question.
- You can do it.

2122
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:26,870
- Hold on.
- You can figure it out.

2123
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,770
- You can figure it out.
- Passion.

2124
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:31,140
I will send a telepathic message.
Look into my eyes.

2125
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,480
(I will send a telepathic message.
Look into my eyes.)

2126
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,890
(Passion, cheese, tie,
snake, rabbit)

2127
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:35,020
Jae Suk, you can look
at the options.

2128
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:37,250
(Joy, straw, Pepero,
ramyeon, candle)

2129
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,480
- What?
- You get it, right?

2130
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,730
- You get it, right?
- It can't be joy.

2131
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:41,960
There is an option
that suits what I did.

2132
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,600
- Think about how my eyes moved.
- Do exactly what she did.

2133
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,830
(He kept it similar
to what So Min did.)

2134
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,660
Don't speak.

2135
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,910
What's that?

2136
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:55,040
- Pass.
- Why don't you know?

2137
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,480
- Are you done?
- What's that?

2138
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,910
Nothing comes to mind.

2139
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:59,100
Just do what you need to do.

2140
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:01,520
(Upset)

2141
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:03,520
What's that?

2142
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:06,020
(He diligently relays what he saw.)

2143
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:07,390
Jae Suk, it's your turn.

2144
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:09,960
- It isn't among the options.
- I relayed what I saw.

2145
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,350
Jae Suk, show it to Haha.

2146
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:12,960
What's this?

2147
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:15,430
Go ahead.

2148
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,430
- Do you know what it is?
- Of course.

2149
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:20,560
- What is it?
- Haha.

2150
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,730
It's obvious.

2151
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:23,370
- How did you figure it out?
- What's the answer?

2152
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:24,810
(Did Haha figure it out
unlike Jae Suk and Suk Jin?)

2153
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,640
Rabbit is an easy one.

2154
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,910
- What is that?
- Rabbit is an easy one.

2155
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:30,140
So it can't be that.

2156
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,370
Jong Kook,
I will show you exactly what I saw.

2157
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:37,850
Oh, is that it?

2158
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:40,080
(She relays exactly what she saw
to Jong Kook.)

2159
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,160
What's the answer?

2160
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:43,750
- I know what it is.
- What is it?

2161
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,930
- Three...
- You will be surprised.

2162
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,600
- If you get it right...
- You will be surprised.

2163
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,770
- Please.
- What is it?

2164
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:53,270
- Ramyeon.
- No!

2165
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,960
- It's a tie.
- A tie.

2166
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,540
- No!
- It's a tie.

2167
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:58,140
- A tie.
- Is it a tie?

2168
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,230
- A tie.
- You wear a tie like this.

2169
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:01,040
- You wear a tie like this.
- That's right.

2170
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,730
- Haha.
- You push it up like this.

2171
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:03,910
Haha, you got it.

2172
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:05,000
- I got it, right?
- You got it.

2173
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,640
You could have acted out
a tie differently.

2174
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,080
I thought it was a candle.

2175
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,870
- You could have done this.
- No.

2176
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:14,180
- She acted out tying a tie.
- That's right.

2177
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:16,480
So Min didn't know better
since she never wore a tie.

2178
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,980
- She could have done this.
- Yes.

2179
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:19,960
(He uses his hands.)

2180
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,430
- You can't use your hands.
- You can't use your hands.

2181
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,520
- For goodness' sake.
- By that logic,

2182
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,870
- you can do this for a rabbit.
- Hey.

2183
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:28,060
- You can do this for a snake.
- You can do this for ramyeon.

2184
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,330
- As for Pepero...
- It's prohibited.

2185
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:31,270
- You could have done this.
- No.

2186
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:33,230
- I couldn't have done that.
- A tie was an easy one.

2187
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:36,480
Let's have one more question.

2188
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,600
- You can cover one slot.
- A tie was an easy one.

2189
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,410
So Min did well.

2190
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:42,750
What should we cover?
It should be the worst one.

2191
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:43,910
In that case...

2192
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:45,390
- This is fun.
- All right.

2193
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:47,310
We covered it.

2194
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,850
Write anything on top of it.

2195
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:50,710
- In that case,
- In that case...

2196
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:52,290
- shall we eat ramyeon?
- Let's eat ramyeon.

2197
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:54,850
- Cup noodles.
- Ramyeon.

2198
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:55,930
- Ramyeon.
- Add eggs.

2199
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:57,430
- Egg ramyeon.
- Egg ramyeon.

2200
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:58,830
- There you go.
- It's done.

2201
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,770
Now, spin the wheel.

2202
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,370
- Okay.
- You should do it.

2203
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,890
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2204
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,270
Good luck.

2205
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:07,460
Millstones won't be so bad.

2206
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:09,430
- We need to get ramyeon.
- Ramyeon.

2207
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:11,100
(Out of the outrageous options,
which dish will they eat?)

2208
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,540
- No.
- Let's go.

2209
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:17,210
(What?)

2210
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:19,020
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

2211
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:20,120
(Please!)

2212
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:22,390
No.

2213
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:24,060
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

2214
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:26,580
- Yes!
- Yes!

2215
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,330
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

2216
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,800
- Yes!
- Yes!

2217
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,760
(They covered 1 slot
and got what they wanted.)

2218
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:35,730
- I...
- The pepper couple.

2219
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:38,710
- Egg ramyeon by the pepper couple.
- We will make it.

2220
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:40,540
- Yes!
- Let's go.

2221
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,970
- Since it's ramyeon, I will do it.
- Make it tasty.

2222
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:44,470
- Make it tasty.
- Of course.

2223
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:45,580
Make a lot.

2224
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,010
(They happily begin
to prepare for lunch.)

2225
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:49,270
Will you beat the eggs...

2226
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:51,140
- or add them as they are?
- There is a method...

2227
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:54,140
- of adding everything at once.
- That's a good method.

2228
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:56,460
You add all ingredients at once...

2229
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,880
when the water is cold.

2230
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,050
- I used to make ramyeon that way.
- I hear that it's the best method.

2231
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:03,960
It's the best method
for making tasty ramyeon.

2232
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,700
A professor proved it.

2233
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,670
I love ramyeon.

2234
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:11,060
The pepper couple will cook it.

2235
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:12,630
Move out of the way.

2236
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:14,010
- Leave them to it.
- Add everything.

2237
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:15,730
- Let's listen to music and relax.
- Okay.

2238
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:18,010
- Add four to that pot.
- Okay.

2239
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,050
Shall we add kimchi as well?

2240
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:21,310
- Kimchi.
- Kimchi?

2241
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:23,950
- How do you add it to kimchi?
- Don't you remember?

2242
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:25,840
We added it right away.

2243
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,140
Did we add it?

2244
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:29,660
- I don't remember.
- We added a bit of it.

2245
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:31,260
(Jong Kook adds the noodles
to cold water.)

2246
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:32,520
You should add the noodles...

2247
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:34,290
- when the water is boiling.
- Wait for it to boil.

2248
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:36,830
No. It has been proven
that this method is better.

2249
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:38,260
- Give me chopsticks.
- Who proved it?

2250
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:40,020
- Give me chopsticks.
- Don't do it so carelessly.

2251
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,870
- But ramyeon...
- This is a good method.

2252
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:43,000
You should add them
after the water boils.

2253
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,060
- But ramyeon...
- No.

2254
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:46,430
This is a good method. Look it up.

2255
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,080
We are cooking them in two pots.

2256
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,580
You shouldn't add noodles
before the water boils.

2257
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:52,270
For goodness' sake.

2258
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:53,950
- Excuse me.
- This ramyeon will taste bad.

2259
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:55,270
Please move out of the way.

2260
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:56,640
Haven't you heard of this method?

2261
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,140
- Who cooks ramyeon this way?
- You are soaking the noodles.

2262
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:01,760
- It has been proven to be the best.
- Who proved it?

2263
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,050
- Who proved it?
- Look it up on the Internet!

2264
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,350
Who proved it? It makes no sense.

2265
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,220
- For goodness' sake.
- It has been...

2266
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:08,960
- I should have cooked it.
- It has been tested.

2267
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:11,970
I am good at cooking ramyeon.
I should have cooked it.

2268
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:13,830
You wanted us to cook it.

2269
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:16,000
(The cold water couple bickers.)

2270
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,130
- Still
- What are the two of you doing?

2271
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:21,130
- I call for you, I miss you
- Hurry over here.

2272
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:22,600
Let's ask for snow crabs.

2273
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:24,600
Let's add the snow crabs to ramyeon.

2274
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,140
The power is off.

2275
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:27,840
- We...
- Hey.

2276
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,380
- Would you give us snow crabs?
- Would you give us snow crabs?

2277
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:31,140
The older members
can remove the meat.

2278
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:32,620
You can have them
if the older members work on them.

2279
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:34,120
- Jae Suk, remove the crab meat.
- Let's add it to the ramyeon.

2280
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,220
- Let's do it.
- Let's add it to the ramyeon.

2281
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,510
Don't add it.

2282
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:38,480
- Just eat it as it is.
- It will be tasty.

2283
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,660
- Please do it.
- We will give you snow crabs.

2284
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,300
- No.
- Remove the meat.

2285
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:44,720
- I don't eat snow crabs at home.
- Do it just once.

2286
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:46,630
I hate removing crab meat so much...

2287
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:47,760
that I don't eat snow crabs.

2288
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,090
- Please do it.
- It's too much work.

2289
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:51,130
Please do it.

2290
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:53,210
Give us watermelon punch
as a dessert.

2291
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,630
I will make the watermelon punch.

2292
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:57,910
I hate removing crab meat.

2293
01:10:57,910 --> 01:10:59,550
I will make tasty watermelon punch.

2294
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:01,080
It's too much work.
Our hands will smell fishy too.

2295
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:02,880
It's too much work.

2296
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,590
(Snow crabs appear.)

2297
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:07,840
- Thank you.
- Only the older members can do it.

2298
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,120
- Don't I count?
- No.

2299
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,160
I won't do it. If we don't do it,
they won't eat the crabs.

2300
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,420
- I won't do it.
- Me neither.

2301
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:13,830
- Jae Suk.
- I won't do it.

2302
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:14,850
Remove the meat.

2303
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:15,850
Hurry up.

2304
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:17,890
These gloves aren't fitting.

2305
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:19,330
Just add the legs.

2306
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:20,420
- I won't do it.
- Gosh.

2307
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,800
It's too much work.

2308
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,170
Don't do it.

2309
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:25,470
The younger ones want to eat them.
Please do it this once.

2310
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:27,470
- Please do it this once.
- I will make the dessert.

2311
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:29,730
That's a nice watermelon.

2312
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:31,010
- This...
- Jae Suk.

2313
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:32,670
The taste will improve
if you add the innards.

2314
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:35,510
- Snow crab ramyeon.
- Ramyeon turned into udon.

2315
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:37,970
Jong Kook, ramyeon turned into udon!

2316
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:38,980
It's ready now.

2317
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:40,050
- Can we eat now?
- It's ready now.

2318
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:42,920
- Don't be ridiculous.
- It's done already.

2319
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,020
Water didn't even boil in this pot,
but my ramyeon is done.

2320
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:46,130
(Cooking ramyeon in cold water
shortened the cooking time.)

2321
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:48,630
It's a scientifically-proven method.

2322
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:49,830
Stop making a fuss!

2323
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,000
It's a scientifically-proven method.
Stop making a fuss!

2324
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,700
(He suddenly shouts.)

2325
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:56,540
Stop making a fuss!
It's scientifically proven.

2326
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:57,930
- Go home.
- It's done.

2327
01:11:57,930 --> 01:11:59,470
- Let's film some other time.
- Don't eat.

2328
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:01,210
Let's just order deliveries.

2329
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:02,230
- It's done.
- Go home.

2330
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:04,170
- This is why I don't come outside.
- It's done.

2331
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:05,380
- It's done.
- Don't be so cocky.

2332
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:06,580
- Come here.
- Pack up.

2333
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:07,600
- Remove the meat.
- Pack up, Ji Hyo.

2334
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,770
It's done.

2335
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:10,220
- Look. The noodles are firm.
- Go home.

2336
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:11,420
It's done.

2337
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:12,750
I cooked it so fast.

2338
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:15,290
- That isn't what's important.
- It's tasty. Try it.

2339
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:16,960
- Jae Suk, sit down.
- Eat.

2340
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:20,180
- Eat what?
- It's done. Ramyeon.

2341
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,660
- Try it.
- Get out.

2342
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,020
Why did you come here?

2343
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,370
Get out.

2344
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:26,970
Don't make things worse.

2345
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:28,630
Get out.

2346
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,500
Why are you filming it?

2347
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:32,260
Get out.

2348
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:35,580
Why did you come here?

2349
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,930
- Eat.
- This isn't a cooking show.

2350
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:39,450
Eat before the noodles become soggy.

2351
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:41,640
- Seriously.
- I need an insert shot.

2352
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:42,810
Really?

2353
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:44,580
(Jong Kook tries
the cold water ramyeon.)

2354
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:46,720
- He is hot-tempered. "Let go."
- Jae Suk.

2355
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,810
Jae Suk, hurry up and try it.

2356
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,120
- For goodness' sake.
- Try it.

2357
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:53,160
- Aren't the noodles soggy?
- No. Hurry up and try it.

2358
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,800
- The noodles aren't soggy.
- In that case,

2359
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,350
I will divide them into big pieces.

2360
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:59,420
Don't fake it. Try it for real
and see if the noodles are soggy.

2361
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,170
- Here. Eat.
- Try it.

2362
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:05,630
Jae Suk,
that's not how you open a crab.

2363
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,100
Get the legs first.

2364
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,300
Try it. Hey.

2365
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,380
Try it.

2366
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:10,430
Get the legs first.

2367
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:12,950
(Suk Jin got some crabmeat.)

2368
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:14,050
Try it.

2369
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:15,140
Me too.

2370
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:17,080
Is it tasty?

2371
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,120
Suk Jin.

2372
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:19,480
Jae Suk, try the snow crabs.

2373
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:21,960
Hurry up and remove more crabmeat.

2374
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:24,010
- In that case...
- It's tasty.

2375
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:25,330
Snow crabs are really tasty.

2376
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:29,200
Look. I finished cooking,
but she hasn't even begun yet.

2377
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,350
Jae Suk, ramyeon is tasty.

2378
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:32,470
- Really?
- It's tasty.

2379
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,260
Jae Suk. It's so tasty.

2380
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:36,000
I wasn't going to eat it
because of pride.

2381
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,170
Listen to me.

2382
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:40,370
Someone famous tested the method.

2383
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:41,800
Try it.

2384
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,130
- It's tasty.
- Jae Suk, ramyeon is tasty.

2385
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:44,340
The noodles are tasty and firm.

2386
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:46,050
- I cooked it in no time.
- You should know this.

2387
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:48,750
- I am a ramyeon expert.
- Thank you.

2388
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:50,450
A university tested this method.

2389
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:52,250
I am a ramyeon expert,
so I can judge it right away.

2390
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:53,450
- I will be objective.
- Try it.

2391
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:55,310
- They tested this method.
- It's so tasty.

2392
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:57,810
Try it first.

2393
01:14:00,290 --> 01:14:01,290
(My goodness.)

2394
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:04,630
The noodles...

2395
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:07,870
The noodles are firm.
It's the perfect method.

2396
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:09,470
It boiled in no time.

2397
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,130
- How are the noodles firm?
- Is it tasty or not?

2398
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:12,260
- It's tasty.
- Right?

2399
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:13,840
It's very tasty.

2400
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,230
(He admits it in the end.)

2401
01:14:15,230 --> 01:14:17,540
(It's a happy ending.)

2402
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:18,840
- It's so tasty.
- Try it.

2403
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,250
- The snow crabs...
- Yes.

2404
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:23,140
(While everyone eats,
Suk Jin sits before the crabs.)

2405
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:25,340
- The snow crabs are delicious.
- Take off the legs.

2406
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:26,750
Can't we touch the snow crabs?

2407
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,790
Try it first.

2408
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:30,790
(Sad)

2409
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:34,420
(He removes the crabmeat
by himself.)

2410
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:38,200
Put it in Ji Hyo's mouth.

2411
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,970
- Ji Hyo, try the crabmeat.
- Ji Hyo.

2412
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:41,260
It's so good.

2413
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,260
The snow crabs are so tasty.

2414
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,670
Suk Jin, would you work on
another crab?

2415
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,470
(Suk Jin looks after the young ones
like the head of a household.)

2416
01:14:48,470 --> 01:14:50,100
- I am a ramyeon expert.
- Thank you.

2417
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:52,250
Look at this.
Suk Jin gave it to me.

2418
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,140
- I will cook another one.
- Gosh.

2419
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:55,510
Look at this. Who wants to eat it?

2420
01:14:55,670 --> 01:14:56,920
- Me.
- Me.

2421
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:00,120
- Me.
- Me.

2422
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,380
(He answered his own question.)

2423
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:03,680
- Suk Jin.
- Hold on.

2424
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,350
Suk Jin gave us so much crabmeat.

2425
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:08,020
Why did you say, "Me?"

2426
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,390
Try it.

2427
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:11,220
Seriously. Can't we touch the crabs?

2428
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:13,520
Can't we touch them?
I can remove the meat in no time.

2429
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:16,090
I can remove the meat in no time.

2430
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:17,170
Do you want to do it then?

2431
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:18,410
- It isn't allowed.
- Why not?

2432
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,430
Then Se Chan can be
the bigger brother...

2433
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:22,380
from now on.

2434
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:24,270
Ramyeon is really tasty.

2435
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:25,640
That's a good idea.

2436
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,880
Big brother.

2437
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:29,050
- Hey, Jae Suk.
- Please remove the crabmeat.

2438
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:30,920
All right.
I will do it for the young ones.

2439
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:32,720
I will give you tasty crabmeat.

2440
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,790
- Big brother.
- Big brother.

2441
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:34,810
- Okay.
- Please remove the crabmeat.

2442
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:35,850
Don't worry.

2443
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:37,380
I want to eat the crabmeat
you removed.

2444
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:38,720
For goodness' sake.

2445
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:41,260
Ramyeon is ready. Go ahead and eat.

2446
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:42,460
It's tasty.

2447
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:43,760
- Ji Hyo, it's so tasty.
- Let's try Ji Hyo's ramyeon.

2448
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,330
Jong Kook's ramyeon has
firm noodles.

2449
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:47,630
- Of course.
- It's tasty.

2450
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:50,370
But compared to the one that's made
with care, it's different.

2451
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,040
It's different.

2452
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,470
(He inhaled
Jong Kook's ramyeon earlier.)

2453
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:57,100
I did it earlier.

2454
01:15:57,730 --> 01:15:58,770
Here.

2455
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:00,140
- This kimchi is tasty.
- Yes.

2456
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:02,470
(The man who made
the cold water ramyeon is upset.)

2457
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:04,010
You glared for a long time.

2458
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:05,810
- Gosh, this is...
- It's incredible.

2459
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:07,290
(Meanwhile, the master pulls
the snow crabs apart.)

2460
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:08,590
- Can you do it fast?
- Of course.

2461
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:09,620
Look at him.

2462
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,120
How do you remove the crabmeat?

2463
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,160
You need to take off the legs first.

2464
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,330
Se Chan is an expert.

2465
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:16,160
- You are good.
- Hey,

2466
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,520
you once stole snow crabs
from a fish tank, right?

2467
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:20,630
- Don't treat him as a younger one.
- He is a big brother.

2468
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:22,200
- Big brother, you are good.
- He is the bigger brother.

2469
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:23,540
- Suk Jin.
- Se Chan is the bigger brother.

2470
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:25,560
Look. This is it.

2471
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:26,730
(A thick piece of crabmeat
over the firm ramyeon noodles)

2472
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:28,040
Jae Suk, this is it.

2473
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,270
Please put it here.

2474
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:30,800
Gosh, this is...

2475
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,250
I didn't know
snow crabs were so tasty.

2476
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:34,670
- Didn't you know?
- No.

2477
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,720
This is a proper vacation.

2478
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,270
- That's right.
- This is happiness.

2479
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:39,840
- This is happiness. I am happy.
- That's right.

2480
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,450
Eating ramyeon is enough
to make me happy.

2481
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:44,160
Se Chan, would you make
the watermelon punch first?

2482
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,460
- Of course.
- Work on the watermelon.

2483
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:47,130
- Do you mean big brother?
- Se Chan.

2484
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:48,330
Treat him as someone who is older.

2485
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:49,720
He actually is older than me.

2486
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:51,390
He is older than the producer.

2487
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:52,420
I see.

2488
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:54,390
- He is older than the producer.
- I am pretty old.

2489
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:58,130
How will you do it with your hands?
Can you break it?

2490
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,470
Do what you need to do
without any tools.

2491
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:02,770
This comment got
the most number of likes.

2492
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:06,050
I get to make watermelon punch
for the younger ones. Thank you.

2493
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:07,640
Not bad.

2494
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:09,640
Gosh, the sound is nice.

2495
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,620
(The watermelon is ripe.)

2496
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:15,920
- It isn't working.
- It isn't working.

2497
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:19,180
- You will die at that rate.
- Use your head.

2498
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,480
(The watermelon is
as hard as Se Chan's head.)

2499
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,720
It's working.

2500
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:22,850
All right.

2501
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:24,550
(He knuckled the watermelon
and got a small crack!)

2502
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:29,230
(He tries to rip it apart.)

2503
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,700
Let's get the juice.

2504
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:34,730
- Hey.
- We can't eat that.

2505
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:36,040
Are you a primitive man?

2506
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,430
How are we supposed to eat that?

2507
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:40,840
I can't use any tools!

2508
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,670
- It's almost done.
- How are we supposed to eat that?

2509
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:44,810
(Se Chan diligently follows
the viewers' request.)

2510
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,120
For goodness' sake.

2511
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,180
(The watermelon opens.)

2512
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:54,460
Hey.

2513
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:55,660
How will we eat that?

2514
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:56,660
Hold on.

2515
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,630
Put on gloves. Seriously.

2516
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:00,970
- It's tasty.
- Seriously.

2517
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:03,090
You didn't go
to the restroom today, did you?

2518
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:05,100
- No.
- You did.

2519
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:09,300
Did you wash your hands afterward?

2520
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,170
- Yes.
- You didn't.

2521
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:12,340
I washed my hands.

2522
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:15,580
(He squeezes the watermelon
for the juice.)

2523
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:17,580
Juice is coming out.

2524
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:19,140
I didn't touch that.

2525
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:20,220
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

2526
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,160
Would you eat that?

2527
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,160
(The sight kills their appetite.)

2528
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:26,520
The watermelon smells incredible.

2529
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:27,720
It looks pretty good.

2530
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,630
He has to make it
without using any tools.

2531
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:32,700
It's what the viewers wanted.

2532
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:34,500
Pour Sprite.

2533
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,500
- Ice.
- Watermelon.

2534
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,700
(Ice is essential
to the watermelon punch.)

2535
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:38,170
Doesn't it feel like
you are on a vacation?

2536
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,040
- It will be good without sugar.
- Is that Sprite?

2537
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,210
- Yes.
- You add Sprite.

2538
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:43,880
- You need to add a bit of milk too.
- But it really does feel...

2539
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,550
like a vacation.

2540
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:47,770
Don't lie.

2541
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,170
Now that he split a watermelon,
it feels like a vacation.

2542
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:53,090
We are on the third one.

2543
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:55,420
- Me?
- If you use your fingers...

2544
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,460
If you use your fingers...

2545
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:00,720
I didn't want to add too much.

2546
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:03,000
Just pour it into the bowl.

2547
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:04,700
Hey!

2548
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:07,260
- Hey!
- I had to take some out.

2549
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:08,970
I didn't want to add all of it.

2550
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:09,970
Your fingers...

2551
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:11,000
Stop using your fingers.

2552
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,560
You picked your nose earlier.

2553
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,040
That watermelon punch will be salty.

2554
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:16,430
I will mix it like this.

2555
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:17,510
(Se Chan's watermelon punch
will be salty.)

2556
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:18,770
All right. It's ready.

2557
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:20,510
(Chef Yang's watermelon punch
is ready.)

2558
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:21,810
I mean...

2559
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:26,120
- Hey.
- The viewers will be unhappy too.

2560
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:27,790
(He already has a bowl ready.)

2561
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:28,810
Try it.

2562
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:31,480
Try it, Jae Suk.

2563
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,960
Give it to me.
I have a strong stomach.

2564
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,020
- Thank you.
- Of course.

2565
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:37,050
I won't die.

2566
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:38,300
Who is next?

2567
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:41,000
Give it to me.
I should try the punch Se Chan made.

2568
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,970
It's especially sweet.

2569
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:45,340
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Did you add salt?

2570
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,840
(Eating)

2571
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,840
(Jae Suk tries a bite as well.)

2572
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:50,910
Is it good?

2573
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:52,170
Is it tasty? What do you think?

2574
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:53,250
(Choking)

2575
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:54,910
He got poisoned.

2576
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,010
How does the watermelon punch taste?

2577
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:59,310
- It's bland.
- I will try it.

2578
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:00,810
Hey.

2579
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:02,850
- What?
- You shouldn't have blown...

2580
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:04,850
on the bowl.

2581
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:08,380
- You...
- Why did you do that?

2582
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:09,850
- Did you do it to remove the dust?
- He did it without thinking.

2583
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:11,460
- The dust.
- He did it without thinking.

2584
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:13,870
It was my attempt to make it clean.

2585
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:15,090
Hey, Se Chan.

2586
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:17,200
You should eat that one.

2587
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,600
- Okay.
- You should eat that one.

2588
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,060
Dust will be cleaner...

2589
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:23,340
- than your breath.
- Although it's tasty...

2590
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:24,880
Se Chan.

2591
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,470
- It's tasty.
- We should share the punch. Look.

2592
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:31,250
(We should share the punch. Look.)

2593
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:34,120
(He suddenly decides to share
the watermelon punch.)

2594
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:35,550
That's right.

2595
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:36,920
It's sweet and good.

2596
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:41,260
Mr. Park, have a bowl.
He must be hot.

2597
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:42,630
Give it to Hyung In and Bo Pil.

2598
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:43,800
That's right.

2599
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:44,920
- That's right.
- Give me more bowls.

2600
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,000
- Give us more bowls.
- Yes.

2601
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,060
- It feels like a holiday.
- It's pretty good.

2602
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,260
- Should I make more?
- The staff members work hard.

2603
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:51,560
- Make more.
- Make more.

2604
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:52,870
My goodness.

2605
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:55,210
Have a bowl.

2606
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,580
Have a bowl. Come on.

2607
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:00,600
Hey, you should have some.

2608
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:03,270
Just try it. Hey.

2609
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:04,970
We can't do that.

2610
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:06,720
Hey, have some.

2611
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:10,010
That's nice, Se Chan. I like it.

2612
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:11,180
Do you like fruit?

2613
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:12,720
Do you want more?

2614
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:15,460
Just say stop when you have enough.

2615
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:16,830
Do you want more?

2616
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:19,200
- We should give this to him.
- He should try this.

2617
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,920
Say stop. Do you want me to stop?

2618
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,540
Hey, it's not bad. It tastes good.

2619
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,470
- It's tasty.
- Mr. Park. It's delicious.

2620
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:26,510
But why aren't you eating?

2621
01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:29,710
- It tastes good.
- But...

2622
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:31,600
- why aren't you eating it?
- I'm eating. It's good.

2623
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,600
It tastes really good.

2624
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,770
- You're just pretending to eat.
- I like it.

2625
01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:36,310
I just tried it. It's really nice.

2626
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:37,380
It's really good.

2627
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:38,640
Gosh, this tastes good.

2628
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:40,590
- I like it.
- Me too.

2629
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:42,590
Why do you put your thumb in it?

2630
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:44,760
(Putting his thumb in it)

2631
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:45,920
That's just...

2632
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,330
- It's just...
- It's all right.

2633
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:48,590
You did a great job.

2634
01:21:48,590 --> 01:21:50,000
- It's nice.
- I have no tools.

2635
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,630
But you don't have to put
your thumb in it.

2636
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:53,630
This is my sincere heart.

2637
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:56,700
That's what they do
when they serve seolleongtang.

2638
01:21:57,230 --> 01:21:59,470
Mr. Park, have some. It's hot today.

2639
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,710
Try this.

2640
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:02,270
Put down the camera and eat this.

2641
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:04,600
- We're family.
- Of course.

2642
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,300
Gosh, this is nice.

2643
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:09,550
- It must be cool.
- All right!

2644
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:13,380
We should give it
to the assistant directors.

2645
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:15,590
Here. Try this.

2646
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:18,220
- Se Chan made it for us.
- We couldn't...

2647
01:22:18,590 --> 01:22:19,830
eat it without you guys.

2648
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:21,520
I washed my hands. It's all right.

2649
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:23,350
I liked the ramyeon and everything.

2650
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:24,550
This is really nice.

2651
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:28,000
Now we will move to our
last destination to have fun.

2652
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,760
- Okay.
- Let's pick the quiz.

2653
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,760
- I want the quiz.
- Having Fun at Water Park.

2654
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,560
- Okay.
- Okay. This is it.

2655
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:34,730
- I like it.
- Having Fun at Water Park.

2656
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:36,840
What's the water park? Is this it?

2657
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:39,800
- We're eight years old.
- Jae Suk.

2658
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,910
- Eight years old.
- Can you do that?

2659
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:42,920
So Min.

2660
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,620
This is the last one.

2661
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:47,480
Our viewers want to see you
find your childhood innocence.

2662
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,310
- I like that.
- All right.

2663
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:52,550
The eight-year-old Running Man
members are on a school trip.

2664
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:53,720
Are we eight years old?

2665
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:54,760
You are all of the same age.

2666
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,420
- We're of the same age.
- We are friends.

2667
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:57,420
There you go.

2668
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,920
I want to be my eight-year-old self.

2669
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:00,920
So Min, what are you doing?

2670
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:04,870
What kind of eight-year-old boy
has age spots on his face?

2671
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:06,600
Why does he have long hair
on his face?

2672
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,600
I'm eight years old.

2673
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,470
My mom got me a new bag.

2674
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,640
Hey, you can't put anything...

2675
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,710
- in your bag.
- Teacher.

2676
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:16,010
(Feeling dizzy)

2677
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:17,380
Eight-year-old boys can speak well.

2678
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:18,840
Teacher.

2679
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:20,980
Suk Jin wet his pants.

2680
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:23,810
I didn't wet my pants. They're dry.

2681
01:23:23,810 --> 01:23:25,630
What kind of eight-year-old boy...

2682
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:27,630
An eight-year-old boy
wouldn't wet his pants.

2683
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:29,220
(The 8-year-old members
go to the water park.)

2684
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:30,920
This is a vacation.

2685
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,220
(The 8-year-old members
go to the water park.)

2686
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:35,560
This is a water park.

2687
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:36,760
- This is nice.
- I love it.

2688
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,000
We're...

2689
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,910
- at a water park!
- This is a water park.

2690
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:43,470
(This isn't product placement,
but they are making an ad.)

2691
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:45,970
(Shouting)

2692
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:47,910
(Screaming)

2693
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:48,920
My goodness.

2694
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:51,050
So Min, what are you doing?

2695
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,920
Is this your first time
at a water park?

2696
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,810
You have to get wet
under the huge bucket first.

2697
01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:56,810
- All right.
- Let's do this.

2698
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:57,850
Here we go.

2699
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:01,180
We can't call it a vacation trip
without getting wet.

2700
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:02,720
This is a vacation trip.

2701
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,420
I will never fall over.

2702
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:05,670
I won't fall over.

2703
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:07,130
Let's have fun!

2704
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:08,520
Swag!

2705
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,560
- Bring it on!
- It's coming.

2706
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:14,840
(Getting doused with water)

2707
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,840
(Falling on their buttocks
pathetically)

2708
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,450
- Darn it.
- My goodness.

2709
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:24,010
You got me. You're the best.

2710
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:26,120
(A surprise attack from the back)

2711
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,850
(The Nevis Swing Brothers are
slaughtered by the water.)

2712
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:30,090
(What the heck!)

2713
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:31,120
No.

2714
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,180
I'm scared, Ji Hyo.

2715
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:34,850
(Ji Hyo and So Min try
the water slide.)

2716
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:37,590
Gosh, So Min.

2717
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:38,720
(Starting)

2718
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:44,730
It's scary.

2719
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:47,370
- I'm so scared.
- My gosh.

2720
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:49,170
Hey, this is so fast.

2721
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:51,410
(She gets soaked in shock...)

2722
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:54,470
(and slides into the hole.)

2723
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:57,170
(Screaming)

2724
01:24:57,170 --> 01:24:59,720
(Turning over)

2725
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,010
(While the two girls are busy
enjoying the water slide...)

2726
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:02,180
It hurts.

2727
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:03,420
Okay.

2728
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:04,460
(Jong Kook is trying
the single slide.)

2729
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:05,590
Like this?

2730
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,050
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

2731
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,760
(Starting)

2732
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:13,970
(Shouting)

2733
01:25:13,970 --> 01:25:15,300
What? It's too dark.

2734
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,040
What's happening?

2735
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,200
(What's happening?)

2736
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:22,270
(It ends
after going straight ahead.)

2737
01:25:22,270 --> 01:25:24,210
(He just douses himself with water.)

2738
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:27,080
What was that? It wasn't fun at all.

2739
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:28,920
Darn it!

2740
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:29,920
(Jong Kook is bold,
but he is grumpy.)

2741
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,840
It's not fun at all!

2742
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:34,810
- There you go.
- Gosh, already?

2743
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:37,120
(Shouting)

2744
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,290
Gosh, it's too fast.

2745
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:41,550
(They go back to their 8-year-old
selves having fun in water.)

2746
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:43,200
Yes. I like this one.

2747
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,200
(They go back to their 8-year-old
selves having fun in the water.)

2748
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,470
(Like little kids,)

2749
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:47,630
Come here.

2750
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:49,500
(they frolic in the water
shouting out loud.)

2751
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:53,060
(They enjoy the vacation
on behalf of the viewers.)

2752
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:55,010
He's coming.

2753
01:25:55,010 --> 01:25:58,600
(The seven grownups forget about
everything and have a lot of fun.)

2754
01:25:58,910 --> 01:26:01,910
(You can watch the full version
on Running Man's YouTube channel.)

2755
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:03,620
Please gather around.

2756
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:04,920
(You can watch the full version
on Running Man's YouTube channel.)

2757
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,380
You need to fill in the blank now.

2758
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:08,640
Write down the name
of the person who's not here.

2759
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,010
- Let's do that.
- Who's not here?

2760
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:11,350
It's Seok Sam.

2761
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:14,590
(Seok Sam is still
having fun in the water.)

2762
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:16,760
Hey, this is really fun.

2763
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:17,920
(It seems like he doesn't
want to go home.)

2764
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:20,700
- What is he doing there?
- He's not here yet.

2765
01:26:20,830 --> 01:26:22,670
He never listens to us.

2766
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:24,540
- I'll put your name on it.
- Go ahead and put it.

2767
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:25,670
No.

2768
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:27,800
I'm riding the waves.

2769
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:29,730
This is today's penalty.

2770
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:32,010
You will put
on the vacation outfit...

2771
01:26:32,010 --> 01:26:35,270
and hand out 50 fans to people.

2772
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:37,010
(Hand out 50 fans to people
in the vacation outfit.)

2773
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:38,550
- Okay.
- This is harsh.

2774
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:43,120
(They have to find 50 people
under the scorching sun.)

2775
01:26:43,290 --> 01:26:44,290
- All right.
- Spin it?

2776
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:45,590
- Yes.
- No Penalty.

2777
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:47,420
(They will spin the roulette to pick
1 member to get the penalty.)

2778
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:48,920
(The roulette will decide
the members' fate.)

2779
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:49,960
Pick No Penalty.

2780
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,220
It will complete today's vacation.

2781
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:53,590
I'll spin it. If we get No Penalty,
it will complete our vacation.

2782
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:55,760
- I agree.
- One, two...

2783
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,230
(Spinning the roulette)

2784
01:26:57,230 --> 01:26:58,230
Please.

2785
01:26:58,930 --> 01:26:59,930
(Who among the four members
will get the penalty?)

2786
01:26:59,930 --> 01:27:01,340
No Penalty.

2787
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:02,730
- Please.
- No Penalty.

2788
01:27:02,730 --> 01:27:04,170
(Who among the four members
will get the penalty?)

2789
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:07,840
- Look.
- Okay!

2790
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,550
(No Penalty?)

2791
01:27:09,550 --> 01:27:11,380
- Okay!
- Yes!

2792
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,420
- Hey.
- I can't believe this.

2793
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:14,450
(They picked No Penalty
with a 50 percent chance.)

2794
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:16,120
- No Penalty.
- That's nice.

2795
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:18,760
- We don't get a penalty today.
- This is a real vacation.

2796
01:27:19,290 --> 01:27:21,020
The grand finale of the vacation.

2797
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:22,550
- You're the best, Jae Suk.
- We did it.

2798
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:23,760
- Nice.
- I knew it.

2799
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,670
- Nice.
- I didn't know why I was tired,

2800
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:27,000
but I just realized
that we played Tug of War.

2801
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,040
I'm so tired.

2802
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,930
- We had a long day.
- And we ran.

2803
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:33,230
- We ran a lot.
- It was really exciting.

2804
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:35,170
Tug of War, running, and rides.

2805
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:36,210
And we ate many things.

2806
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:38,910
We will fall asleep right away
as soon as we get home.

2807
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:40,380
- I'll fall fast asleep.
- I know.

2808
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,100
All right.
The Running Man Vacation is over.

2809
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:43,810
- Bye.
- Bye.

2810
01:27:43,810 --> 01:27:45,140
Bye.

2811
01:27:45,450 --> 01:27:47,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2812
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,350
- So Min, ride that one again.
- Nice.

2813
01:27:49,350 --> 01:27:50,680
I want to ride it again.

2814
01:27:51,790 --> 01:27:54,830
(The place that has
a lot of rumors flying around)

2815
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:57,000
(This is our matrimonial home.)

2816
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,300
(They finally go into...)

2817
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:00,800
(My Little Old Boy's place.)

2818
01:28:01,390 --> 01:28:03,840
(The VIP guests show up
without an invitation.)

2819
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:07,710
(In this place where they
stress each other out...)

2820
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:09,100
(Relieve your stress.)

2821
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:10,210
- Do you have a personal trainer?
- Watch.

2822
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:11,910
(Those who cry because of stress...)

2823
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:14,600
(are the third class.)

2824
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,270
(Biting the bullet.)

2825
01:28:16,270 --> 01:28:17,770
(Your home?)

2826
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:19,380
(Those who endure it
are the second class.)

2827
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:20,380
(Like son.)

2828
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:21,480
(Like son running around?)

2829
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,880
(Those who laugh off the stress
are the first class.)

2830
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,050
(Seal your anger...)

2831
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:26,090
(and be happy.)

2832
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:27,090
(I control my mentality...)

2833
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:28,330
(Slapping)

2834
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:29,800
(Laughter brings you good luck!)

2835
