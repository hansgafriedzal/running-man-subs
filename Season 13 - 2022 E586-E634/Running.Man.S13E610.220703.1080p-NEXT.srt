1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,650
(For the first time on Running Man,)

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,570
(Jong Kook has
a housewarming party.)

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,890
(Se Chan began alone
in the parking lot.)

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,890
No one's here yet?

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,580
What are we doing today?

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,150
Why are you all here?

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,060
There's a van.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,900
There's So Min.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,970
(He's puzzled
by the dash of the camera.)

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,700
So Min isn't shooting.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,660
(Looking around)

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,560
Has the shoot begun?
It doesn't look like it.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,610
(Has the shoot begun?
It doesn't look like it.)

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,450
No one's shooting.
It hasn't begun yet.

15
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,980
- It hasn't begun yet.
- What's going on?

16
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,270
- What are you doing?
- See?

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,380
What are you doing?

18
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,520
- I don't know.
- Hello.

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,550
Are you a spy?

20
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,590
- No. He just started shooting.
- Yes, you are.

21
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,780
- No.
- You are.

22
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,350
Why do you have a camera alone?

23
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,620
- I don't know. Hello.
- Hi.

24
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,690
Why is a camera there?

25
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,260
I don't know. They suddenly
turned the lights on...

26
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,850
- and started shooting me.
- The camera followed him first.

27
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,950
- The camera kept shooting him.
- No.

28
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,330
- I saw it.
- You saw it too, right?

29
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,660
- No.
- Why are you so puffy?

30
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,890
See?

31
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,390
- I ate gamjatang so much yesterday.
- Doesn't he look puffy?

32
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,200
I ate so much gamjatang yesterday.

33
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,530
- Was it that good?
- I ordered extra bones.

34
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,000
Now that you look puffy,

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,110
- you look young.
- Really?

36
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,410
- Do I look plump?
- Yes.

37
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,840
Yes.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,340
This is Jong Kook's house.

39
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,470
Ji Hyo.

40
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,220
You look like you came down
from his house.

41
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,940
This is our new house.

42
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,750
Good.

43
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,990
- You're amazing.
- You've been invited.

44
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,220
- Make yourselves home.
- I like how it's not too much.

45
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,450
What about food?

46
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,130
- I already got the food ready.
- Really?

47
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,130
Just wait and see.

48
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,130
Is it "Same Bed, Different Dreams 2:
You Are My Destiny" today?

49
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,640
No. I thought
it was "Master in the House."

50
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,270
I thought we were going to
"My Little Old Boy" studio.

51
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,500
- I think it's "Master in the House."
- It's a mix of many shows.

52
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,380
(This house looks familiar.)

53
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,050
(There were only rumors
about the ugly son's house.)

54
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,920
(A pair of socks left alone)

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,810
(The owner of the dull place...)

56
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,550
(that is full of black gym suits)

57
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,280
(533-month-old Kim Jong Kook)

58
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,830
It's nice to film at home.

59
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,420
I mean it.

60
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,330
(The house owner looks comfortable.)

61
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,420
Do they all know
they're coming to my house?

62
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,440
- They're all downstairs.
- Really?

63
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,030
- Isn't this Jong Kook's house?
- Yes.

64
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,800
How many times
do I have to tell you?

65
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,140
That was the first time.

66
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,830
- Hey. That was the first time.
- Why do you keep repeating it?

67
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,670
I never repeated it.
That was my first time.

68
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,350
His house is dark.

69
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,550
Let's go up.

70
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,920
The elevator is...

71
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,080
Which floor?

72
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,490
- Ji Hyo. Which floor?
- Floor X.

73
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,140
- I knew it.
- Ji Hyo knows.

74
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,260
(She can find her new house easily.)

75
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,710
You know.

76
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,920
Of course.

77
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,420
Ji Hyo. Then can we
not press the bell?

78
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,420
We're not that close yet.

79
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,730
Do you know the password?

80
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,020
That's why you're amateurs.

81
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,170
- Why?
- Why are we amateurs?

82
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,890
- There he goes again.
- He's showing off again.

83
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,360
There he goes again.
Do you know anything?

84
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,860
Look at his teeth.
He can't stop smiling.

85
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,170
- He's trying to tease us.
- He wants to tease us.

86
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,580
His teeth became more crooked...

87
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,110
- before teasing us.
- Jae Suk.

88
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,050
- Do you adjust them every morning?
- No.

89
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,080
- Before leaving?
- I turn them in the morning.

90
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,240
He can take them out.

91
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,820
I've been here a lot
for "My Little Old Boy."

92
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,520
He got a nice bicycle.

93
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,850
Jong Kook has a bicycle?

94
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,180
- Isn't this yours?
- That's mine.

95
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,260
- That's obviously Ji Hyo's.
- It's mine.

96
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,390
Ji Hyo.

97
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,890
- How do you go in?
- What's the password?

98
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,520
Why doesn't it... It's on.

99
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,990
Ji Hyo knows the password.

100
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,420
You should've just stayed home.

101
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,520
(Beeping)

102
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,890
(Alarming)

103
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,010
What are they doing?

104
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,370
Why are they pressing the password?

105
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,670
Seriously.

106
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,670
Open it.

107
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,210
- Jong Kook.
- Why are you pressing the password?

108
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,550
- Ji Hyo says she knows.
- Ji Hyo says she knows.

109
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,680
Darn it.

110
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,680
Don't be ridiculous.

111
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,450
- He caught us.
- What's she talking about?

112
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,020
Ji Hyo said she knew,
so she pressed it.

113
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,780
I know we're shooting at your house,
but it's still a shoot.

114
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,990
- What are you doing?
- What is that?

115
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,550
You need to put on clothes.

116
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,650
I am wearing clothes.

117
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,730
I don't need to dress up for home.

118
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,830
- Isn't this "My Little Old Boy" studio?
- What's this?

119
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,020
- What?
- Isn't this "My Little Old Boy" studio?

120
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,240
- Here...
- Have a seat.

121
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,530
- Let's get changed.
- Have a seat.

122
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,030
- Jong Kook. Can I get changed?
- Jong Kook.

123
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,770
- Can I get changed?
- You're wearing it inside out.

124
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,830
- You're wearing it inside out.
- No.

125
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,740
Sit here.

126
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,240
Jong Kook. Can I get changed?

127
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,950
- Sure.
- You're wearing it inside out.

128
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,740
- No, this is right.
- I take this too.

129
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,680
- I got one for free.
- Is this "My Little Old Boy" or what?

130
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,050
- This is "My Little Old Boy" studio.
- Can I have some coffee?

131
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,750
- This is my seat.
- I sit next to you.

132
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,180
- Can I have some coffee?
- This is Jong Kook's chair.

133
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,990
Jong Kook.
The floor became your closet.

134
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,900
Can you hold this?

135
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,450
- So it won't touch my hair.
- The floor became your closet.

136
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,530
Jong Kook. You have the AC on.

137
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,990
- What's gotten into you?
- You never do that.

138
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,100
You got more stuff.

139
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,260
It's packed.

140
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,740
- Jong Kook.
- Thank you.

141
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,840
How do Jong Kook's clothes
look on me?

142
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,930
(Jong Kook's gym clothes)

143
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,930
- Jong Kook's clothes.
- You look...

144
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,070
- like a world champion's father...
- What?

145
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,480
- visiting his son's house.
- Jong Kook. How do I look?

146
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,850
- It's nice.
- Jong Kook.

147
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,240
- Why are you wearing sleeveless?
- Jae Suk.

148
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,660
- Let me use the restroom.
- This is my best outfit.

149
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,920
- Let me use the restroom.
- Okay.

150
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,860
- There's no place to sit.
- Sit here.

151
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,230
Just sit anywhere.

152
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,860
- But there are clothes.
- Hang on.

153
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,170
I'm taking this chair.

154
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,600
- Why?
- In case Suk Jin takes it.

155
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,870
- Why?
- There's more space here.

156
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,110
Why are you keeping clothes here?

157
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,110
They're all gym clothes.

158
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,200
They're organized in their own way.

159
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,240
- How are they organized?
- Leave them alone.

160
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,370
Still, he changed a lot, right?

161
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,570
- What?
- He even turned the AC on.

162
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,780
- You turned the AC on.
- Why did you turn it on?

163
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,920
- I think...
- Hey.

164
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,180
I turn it on when it's necessary.

165
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,140
There are so many people
in my living room.

166
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,720
It's the first time my feet are cold
at home.

167
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,790
I didn't know you had an AC at home.

168
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,820
Your feet are cold at home?

169
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,050
Since last year, it's the first time
I'm using it in the living room.

170
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,260
- Really?
- Yes.

171
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,970
- You didn't turn it on last year?
- No.

172
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,130
(He paid 0 for AC last year.)

173
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,610
Why are you brushing your teeth?

174
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,060
(He's brushing his teeth
out of nowhere.)

175
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,200
Jae Suk.

176
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,910
Because my mouth didn't feel clean.

177
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,140
Did you eat something on the way?

178
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,740
Suk Jin. If you do that,

179
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,010
that will ruin the couch.

180
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,940
- If he were a kid,
- Jong Kook.

181
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,720
I'd say he was not disciplined.

182
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,950
- Stop it.
- Don't.

183
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,550
(He wants to do it more
when people stop him.)

184
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,450
- Suk Jin. You better say this.
- It'll become an issue.

185
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,250
- What?
- "Don't curse at me."

186
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,100
You should say it.

187
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,800
(Here's the "Don't curse
at me" incident.)

188
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,500
(He suggested his random
steamed egg to So Min.)

189
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,740
(Getting angry)

190
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,240
(Suk Jin predicted his future.)

191
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,240
What do you mean,
"Don't curse at me?"

192
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,850
Suk Jin.

193
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,450
(Despite his long experience,
he appealed to viewers.)

194
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,120
You should say that again.

195
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,620
- It's time for you to say it.
- No.

196
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,860
- It's not that serious.
- People will blame you.

197
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,190
- Right?
- It'll be an issue.

198
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,250
People will blame him.

199
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,870
That day,

200
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,760
as soon as I said that,

201
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,800
I realized people would blame me
for it.

202
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,040
My mom blamed you so much.

203
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,430
We watched that episode together.

204
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,040
What did she say?

205
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,680
"What's wrong with that prick?"

206
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,910
(That's what her mom said.)

207
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,850
(That wakes him up.)

208
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,880
Ma'am. I'm sorry.

209
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,510
- She's more like a friend.
- She's more like a friend.

210
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,660
- She's a friend.
- A friend.

211
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,250
Sis. I'm sorry.

212
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,930
I didn't do that
because I hated her.

213
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,890
How can you be so mean
to your friend's daughter?

214
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,190
It's not that I hate her.
I was only trying to be funny.

215
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,970
Please don't take it wrong.

216
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,260
"Don't curse at me, sis."

217
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,130
(Laughing)

218
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,060
So Min. Isn't that chair cozy?

219
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,610
- It's so nice.
- Right?

220
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,340
- It's so nice.
- I'll let you experience it.

221
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,280
Is this a rocking chair?

222
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,940
It's a really old chair.

223
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,620
Is this the chair you've used
since your parents' house?

224
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,090
This is awesome.

225
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,120
Jong Kook.

226
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,290
- You have a good reaction.
- Enjoy your rest.

227
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,590
- This is so nice.
- Right?

228
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,180
That's 18 years old.

229
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,790
This is really nice.

230
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,430
It's perfect for you two
to lie down.

231
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,820
- Really?
- It's perfect.

232
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,030
It's just big enough.

233
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,730
Se Chan.

234
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,990
(Se Chan.)

235
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,820
(She summons
her business boyfriend.)

236
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,970
I'll bite you with my front teeth.

237
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,600
Look at her eyes.

238
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,630
(The chair is enough to make
the cheesy girl happy.)

239
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,760
I imagined it.

240
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,980
- That's funny.
- That's hilarious.

241
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,540
- It's nice to film at home.
- Yes.

242
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,240
- What...
- We should take turns...

243
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,870
- and film at home.
- What's Ji Seon doing today?

244
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,810
She was actually here today,

245
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,240
so I sent her home.

246
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,950
- You still need clothes.
- She said she'd leave after lunch.

247
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,380
- Clothes?
- You need clothes.

248
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,620
I am wearing clothes.

249
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,450
- They're comfy.
- Is this "Master in the House..."

250
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,730
or "My Boss?" I mean...

251
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,600
- What's that called?
- "My Boss?"

252
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,870
"My Boss?"

253
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,170
- Hey.
- Sorry.

254
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,300
It's "Same Bed, Different Dreams 2:
You Are My Destiny."

255
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,390
"Same Bed, Different Dreams 2:
You Are My Destiny?"

256
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,990
Or is it "My Little Old Boy?"

257
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,000
Someone needs to get married for...

258
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
"Same Bed, Different Dreams 2:
You Are My Destiny."

259
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,240
(Is she using 2 wipes at once?)

260
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,300
I heard SBS bought this house.

261
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,800
(Is she using 2 wipes at once?)

262
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,440
- I heard you're living in a studio.
- This is their studio.

263
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,940
Cameraman Chan Hee also...

264
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,720
Hey. Use only one wipe at a time.

265
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,010
Or Jong Kook will curse at you.

266
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,410
- I just felt guilty.
- You can't use two.

267
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,560
- No.
- Don't you know...

268
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,960
- whose house you're at?
- Why did you use two?

269
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,730
(Why did you use two?)

270
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,200
It's a habit.

271
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,230
Clean your hands first
and wipe the floor with it.

272
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,070
- Okay, Jong Kook.
- Get it?

273
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,470
If you use more than
one wipe at a time,

274
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,160
Jong Kook will curse at you.

275
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,210
Ji Hyo even uses it again
after blowing her nose.

276
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,610
Did you think I'd throw this out?

277
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,740
I'm not.
I'm going to use it again later.

278
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,350
- Right.
- Don't be a hypocrite.

279
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,140
- Why do you do that?
- Suk Jin.

280
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,670
There's a clip of your fake life
on YouTube.

281
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,910
(Suk Jin is the biggest example
of a hypocrite's life.)

282
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,380
- A fake life.
- That went viral.

283
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,590
- Right.
- My fake life.

284
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,120
- For real?
- Yes.

285
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,360
Because he's a real hypocrite.

286
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,700
By the way, this place...

287
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,830
- What?
- What about it?

288
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,990
Well...

289
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,730
It's nice.
Isn't it nice to live alone?

290
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,390
- Yes.
- What's it like to live alone?

291
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,870
- You should visit me often.
- What?

292
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,940
- Is it nice to live alone?
- You should come and visit.

293
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,070
What's it like to live alone?

294
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,610
- Are you lonely?
- It's so nice.

295
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,340
- But sometimes you get lonely.
- Never.

296
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,670
Jong Kook will live alone,

297
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,110
- and when he's about to die,
- Die?

298
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,140
- he'll take the 10kg...
- The dumbbell?

299
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,410
- dumbbell.
- Tied to him.

300
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,850
We should send him
with a dumbbell tied to him.

301
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,220
- Since I don't have a child,
- Yes.

302
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,250
- I could donate my assets.
- That'd be amazing.

303
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,560
- He must've earned a lot.
- It would be really nice.

304
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,650
You see, sometimes I find it hard
to believe...

305
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,330
- that he makes a lot of money...
- Yes?

306
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,370
because he's not interested in
luxury goods.

307
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,390
- He doesn't spend much on them.
- Right?

308
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,970
- I wonder what he spends...
- If I get married...

309
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,030
If I get married, I'd spend
the most money on my wife and kids.

310
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,270
- But I'm still single.
- Surprisingly, So Min imagines...

311
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,710
what it could be like
if she were with you quite often.

312
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,910
- No, it's not like that.
- She wants his money.

313
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,880
- She...
- That's why she imagines that.

314
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,910
I talked to So Min on the phone
three days ago,

315
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,380
and she said, "Jae Suk."

316
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,960
- Was she making a plan?
- "I don't think about it often."

317
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,420
"But I have thought about it
a few times."

318
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,620
- "If I..."
- Yes.

319
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,390
- Ji Hyo is drinking water.
- "married..."

320
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,260
- "Jong Kook..."
- It's not like that. Trust me.

321
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,470
- She keeps drinking water.
- Hey.

322
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,810
She must believe she can buy
whatever she desires.

323
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,210
You don't have a chance with him.

324
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,840
- So Min.
- Ji Hyo won't let that happen.

325
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,640
- You have an enemy to remove.
- "No! My money!"

326
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,000
- But...
- My gosh.

327
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,270
Let's order delivery food.

328
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,850
- Let's do that. I want a burger.
- We can cook some ramyeon.

329
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,270
- A burger sounds good.
- Sounds great.

330
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,380
- Let's cook some ramyeon.
- Stop it.

331
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,620
What are we going to do today?

332
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,910
- Can we just hang out here?
- Yes, that's the plan, but...

333
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,960
- Are you serious?
- You can order food if you want.

334
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,750
There's a gukbap restaurant
that Jong Kook often orders from.

335
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,230
- Great.
- Yes, I order gukbap...

336
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,960
- The one he has every morning?
- Yes.

337
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,490
Jong Kook, how about budaejjigae
from that place...

338
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,570
- so we can reminisce the old days?
- Reminiscing about the old days?

339
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,970
- What do you mean by that?
- Reminiscing about the old days?

340
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:14,990
- What do you mean by that?
- Gosh.

341
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,570
- I was so taken aback.
- What does that mean?

342
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,770
I thought, "What memories do we have
to reminisce about?"

343
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,580
- Ji Hyo, that was a good one.
- The budaejjigae with chicken.

344
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,770
- I have no idea...
- Don't you remember that?

345
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,210
- I don't think we had it together.
- This is hilarious.

346
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,850
- Have you forgotten about it?
- No, I know we had it together.

347
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,370
- I remember it.
- Ji Hyo, you're doing great.

348
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,910
- Ji Hyo even looks so pretty today.
- You remember it, right?

349
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,220
- Indeed. She looks pretty today.
- We had 401 budaejjigae.

350
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,120
Let's try the gukbap
that Jong Kook has every morning.

351
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,460
I'll order it
if you really want to try it.

352
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,690
Let's eat it. I'm serious.

353
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,860
- Don't spoil them by ordering it.
- No. Jong Kook.

354
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,060
- Come on. Let us have it.
- It's okay. I'll order it for you.

355
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,390
You had Naju beef bone soup
without us.

356
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,600
- I brought R coins too.
- Don't spoil him.

357
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,920
- Should I not order it?
- No, you shouldn't.

358
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,370
- Haha, I'll buy it for you.
- Right.

359
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,370
I'm not saying it
because I don't have money.

360
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:50,970
I'll buy it for you.

361
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,030
He's trying to stop him
from ordering food for us.

362
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,480
- He had Naju beef bone soup.
- Haha...

363
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,620
Haha hates it most when Jong Kook
and I pull a prank on him together.

364
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,120
Just order it if you want.
You don't need their permission.

365
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,450
I'll order it by myself.

366
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,460
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

367
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,820
- What will you guys have?
- What do you want to eat?

368
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,190
I want a cheeseburger.

369
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,250
Suk Jin hasn't treated us
in a while.

370
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,960
- He's so cool.
- I'm touched.

371
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,290
Are you treating
the staff members too?

372
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,160
- No.
- You should treat them too.

373
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,660
- He answered right away.
- Thank you, Suk Jin.

374
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
"No."

375
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,940
(He answered honestly
only in 0.5 seconds.)

376
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,990
How many are our staff members?

377
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,740
- About 20.
- Are there 20 of you?

378
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,210
- Yes.
- I'll order food for you guys too.

379
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,840
(I'll order food for you guys too.)

380
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,980
- Are you serious?
- What?

381
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,370
- Why?
- Do you mind if we edit it out?

382
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,240
"Do you mind if we edit it out?"

383
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,410
That's the scariest thing to hear.

384
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,220
- Please don't cut it all out.
- They won't make him look good.

385
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,140
- Show just a little bit, please.
- It doesn't have to make it to air.

386
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,620
- It's so funny.
- But I'd like you to know...

387
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,090
that we'll do a product placement,
and it's a tteokbokki brand.

388
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,360
- I see.
- Then let's eat that.

389
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,520
- So don't eat too much.
- Can't you wait an hour?

390
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,290
- I can wait for an hour.
- Let's wait for an hour.

391
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,120
- There's something we prepared.
- What is it?

392
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,600
One of the popular things
people do these days is...

393
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,570
a likability test with an AI.

394
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,070
- A likability test?
- Is there such a thing?

395
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,710
- What would an AI know about it?
- With an AI?

396
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,900
- With an AI?
- Take a look.

397
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,000
- Let's take a look.
- Okay.

398
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,610
- Did you have us tested?
- Let me see.

399
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,740
(As a result of letting an AI
assess the members' likability...)

400
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,980
Have a look at this too.

401
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,820
He's in the top ten percent.

402
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,410
- Who?
- Jong Kook is ranked high.

403
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,510
- Really?
- Really?

404
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,060
"The charming type that can be
in favor of anyone."

405
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,380
(Top 10 percent of likability)

406
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,420
"The most popular type.
There are many people..."

407
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,020
"who like you
although they never tell you that."

408
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,730
(Fully satisfied)

409
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,660
- But check out Se Chan's result.
- Okay.

410
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,990
- He's also ranked high.
- He's in the top ten percent.

411
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,030
- Nonsense.
- Me?

412
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,660
- It's not total nonsense.
- This is...

413
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,470
"The charming type that can be
in favor of anyone." It's the same.

414
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,570
- Right.
- Maybe his photo...

415
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,210
- It's the same as Jong Kook.
- The AI recognizes me.

416
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,400
Next up is Haha.

417
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,040
- He's in the top 30 percent.
- Good.

418
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,640
"The comfortable, likable type."

419
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,910
- "Approachable and trustworthy."
- That's right.

420
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,120
"Since you look friendly,
many people like you as a friend."

421
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,880
"But you need to approach someone
you're interested in first."

422
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,960
(Darn it.)

423
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,490
- That's so true.
- I agree.

424
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,990
- It's accurate.
- You need to approach her first.

425
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,860
- Not many would approach him first.
- True.

426
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,460
- That's true.
- Most people want to be his friend.

427
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,020
- Ji Hyo's result is the same.
- Next up is Ji Hyo.

428
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,890
"Top 30 percent of likability,
the comfortable, likable type."

429
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,100
- "Approachable and trustworthy."
- She is?

430
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,310
- I'm not sure if this is reliable.
- Ji Hyo?

431
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,500
- And the comments are the same.
- Let's check out our results.

432
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,170
- What's wrong with it?
- "Top 30 percent of likability."

433
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,080
"The comfortable, likable type."
Oh, that's me.

434
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,210
I'm in the top 50 percent.
"Average likability."

435
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,870
"The ordinary type that can change
by the overall look and clothes."

436
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,990
- I see it's not completely wrong.
- The AI is right about that.

437
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,880
"People often say you'd look great
if you were dressed nicely,"

438
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,560
"but you never take their advice."

439
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,380
- This is accurate.
- It's not total nonsense.

440
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,860
- This is accurate.
- Right.

441
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,460
- It's really accurate.
- Look at this.

442
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,160
He's in the top 70 percent.

443
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,760
(Only one member is left.)

444
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,160
(He's ranked the lowest of all.)

445
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,490
"There's a need for change
in your appearance."

446
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,740
"The type that needs to make efforts
to boost confidence..."

447
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,240
- "and manage his or her image."
- That's true.

448
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,870
"This type of people don't
have a face..."

449
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,940
"that's commonly recognized
as likable."

450
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:46,410
"But those with high self-esteem are
recognized as unique."

451
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,770
- This isn't an accurate assessment.
- I know, right?

452
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,640
- I'm in the lowest 30 percent.
- That's right.

453
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,410
You're in the top 30 percent
of unlikeable people.

454
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,090
Gosh, seriously.

455
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,380
Is he unlikeable
from an AI's perspective?

456
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,830
(Seok Sam is ranked the lowest
when it comes to appearances.)

457
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,730
- Something's wrong with the AI.
- In the top 50 percent?

458
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,470
- He's in the last place.
- There are all sorts of tests.

459
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,260
- I'll tell you about the rules now.
- Okay.

460
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,240
- Today's race is House Jong Kook.
- Yes.

461
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,840
This is a belated housewarming party
for the first time on "Running Man."

462
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,870
Isn't it too late for that?
He moved here a long time ago.

463
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,870
It's been a long time.

464
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,500
For Jong Kook who happily invited
us all to his house,

465
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,370
we prepared gift certificates
as a gift.

466
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,720
(The staff prepared
gift certificates as a gift!)

467
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,850
That's so nice of you.

468
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,120
But it wouldn't be fun
if we just give him our gift.

469
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,490
You'll be given a mission...

470
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,880
- every 30 minutes.
- Good.

471
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,920
The worth of the gift certificate
he'll get will go up if you succeed.

472
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,420
I see. Help me get the one
that's worth the most.

473
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,990
You get 500 dollars...

474
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,790
- for each mission you complete.
- My gosh. Did he say 500 dollars?

475
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,600
You can get up to 2,500 dollars
by playing 5 different games.

476
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,570
Jong Kook will receive
half of the amount you achieved,

477
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,810
and we'll donate the rest
to charity.

478
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,080
(Half will go to Jong Kook,
and the rest will be donated.)

479
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,110
Really?

480
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,500
- Really?
- That's great.

481
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,400
- Let's do this.
- I'll take this seriously.

482
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,320
- I don't need that much money.
- It's for Jong Kook.

483
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,580
- Yes. It's for Jong Kook.
- I mean it.

484
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,240
- All right.
- You can get a new TV or something.

485
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,490
- Since it's a housewarming party,
- I don't need a new TV.

486
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,860
you must spend the day
without getting stressed out.

487
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,360
We'll measure the stress levels
of the six of you.

488
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,420
Those of you whose stress levels
are higher...

489
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,020
when we measure them
after the race ends get a penalty.

490
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,390
But how are you going to measure it?

491
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,130
- We'll give you a device for it.
- Is there a device to measure it?

492
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,030
We'll measure
your stress levels now.

493
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,030
- And you'll keep wearing it.
- Yes.

494
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,710
- We'll measure it again...
- The higher it is now, the better.

495
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,270
- Jong Kook, help me.
- I'm actually stressed out now.

496
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,370
Me too. I need to poop right now.

497
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,140
I'm so stressed out.

498
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,170
(All of them except for Jong Kook
wear a stress measuring device.)

499
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,590
- I'm stressed out.
- How does it work?

500
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,010
It's a state-of-the-art device,
right?

501
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,720
I didn't know there was a device
like this. Ouch.

502
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,120
- Why did you pinch me?
- Get stressed out. Good.

503
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,920
Why did you put it upside down?

504
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,100
(It's upside down.)

505
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,920
I wouldn't mind
if you stressed me out.

506
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,100
I need to get stressed out...
No, in the opposite direction.

507
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,260
(It'd be advantageous
if their stress levels were high now.)

508
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,570
Jae Suk, did you get the result?

509
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,070
- It says it's still measuring.
- Why would you be stressed out?

510
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,370
No, I'm still...

511
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,810
- Do I check it like this?
- Did you get the result?

512
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,940
- Everyone else has received it.
- Why would you be stressed out?

513
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,080
Why am I the only person who hasn't
received it? This stresses me out.

514
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,370
I was told to wear it tightly.

515
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,740
Good. It's my turn.

516
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,820
It says I'm relaxed right now.

517
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,240
- Is this upside down?
- Hasn't a number appeared?

518
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,860
- I'll check it for you.
- It's 29.

519
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,490
- Twenty-nine?
- Yes.

520
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,330
- That's very low.
- Is it low? Jae Suk.

521
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,460
- I guess he's not stressed out.
- It's 29.

522
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,390
- Wait. That's not good.
- Why?

523
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,160
- Later on...
- Raise it.

524
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,270
(The higher the first result is,
the better it is for them.)

525
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,430
- Shout out loud just as I did.
- Wait. Let me check it again.

526
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,570
So Min.

527
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,610
- You see, I'm already...
- Slap Jae Suk in the face.

528
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,080
The noises they're making are
stressing me out.

529
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,200
Suk Jin, stop it.

530
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,810
(He's trying to stress himself out.)

531
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,200
It's going up a little
since I made myself upset.

532
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,250
- You never get anything right.
- I'm so stressed out.

533
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,850
Gosh, I'm so stressed out.

534
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,980
- I'm so stressed out.
- Darn.

535
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,820
Oh, mine is quite high. It's 48.

536
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,020
Forty-eight?

537
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,760
- Mine is 42.
- Got it.

538
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,030
She's quite stressed out too.

539
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,420
Gosh, I'm so stressed out.

540
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,560
I'm stressed out.

541
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,860
My stress level is 56.

542
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,070
- Haha, that's good.
- Gosh, I'm stressed out.

543
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,730
Why does it say
the measurement has failed?

544
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,960
Jae Suk, wasn't your result 29?

545
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,730
- Let me measure it again.
- Is it 29?

546
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,610
- No.
- I see. Yours is 29?

547
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,430
I guess he's not stressed out.

548
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,510
I just got the result. It's 51.

549
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,400
- That's quite high.
- You're lying. It was 29 earlier.

550
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,910
- It's 51. See it for yourself.
- That's good.

551
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,350
- I guess I got stressed a little.
- I think so.

552
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,910
- The first result stressed me out.
- Right. That stressed you out.

553
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,820
- That gave me stress.
- Because you might get a penalty.

554
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,150
It's not fair that he was allowed to
measure it again.

555
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,560
It's not fair.

556
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,760
- Then we'll use the average number.
- Okay.

557
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,720
We got everyone's first result,

558
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,690
and we'll get the data transferred
every five minutes.

559
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,220
My stress level went up to 60.

560
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,660
- It's 60 now.
- You can't change it.

561
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,730
- I know. I'm so stressed out now.
- Earlier, your stress level...

562
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,960
We'll use that number
to calculate the average.

563
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,470
We'll start the first mission
right now.

564
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,670
- What is it?
- You can get 500 dollars...

565
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,780
- or nothing.
- Got it. That's good.

566
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,280
Not even the smallest error is
allowed in this mission.

567
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,850
- It's Relay Human Tape Measure.
- What is it?

568
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,260
- Relay Human Tape Measure?
- You get to decide the order.

569
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,860
Starting at the workout room,
stand at a distance from one another.

570
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,220
We'll show an object
to the first player in that room.

571
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,190
The player measures the object
using his or her hands.

572
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,600
Then the player shows
the next player the size.

573
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,040
The final measurement must be
within a margin of 1.5cm.

574
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,570
- Using our arms?
- That's easy.

575
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,930
- Of course, we can do that.
- It doesn't sound fun at all.

576
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,730
- It's a piece of cake.
- Right.

577
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,870
- It's not difficult.
- I don't think it will be easy.

578
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,200
- We just have to be still.
- All right.

579
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,020
- The first player is important.
- Maintain the distance.

580
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,140
Who wants to be the first player?

581
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,090
- Who should be the first player?
- It should be Suk Jin.

582
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,380
I'll be the 2nd or 3rd player.

583
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,150
- Then I'll be the first player.
- Go ahead.

584
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,710
- I'll go first.
- It could be a tiny object.

585
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,880
- Go ahead.
- So Min, will you go next?

586
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,180
- Yes. I'll be the second player.
- You can do this.

587
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,220
I'll be the second last.

588
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,650
- I'll go last.
- You're the last player.

589
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,760
- Okay.
- Should we just stand like this?

590
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,920
- Okay. Are you ready?
- Okay.

591
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,960
- Go, Se Chan!
- Let's do this!

592
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,040
The first player must never tell
the others what the object is.

593
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,270
- Got it.
- Okay.

594
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,900
- That's right.
- Everyone, stay calm.

595
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,110
- Try not to get stressed out.
- It won't be hard.

596
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,230
- Okay.
- Get ready.

597
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,870
- Don't worry.
- It's easy.

598
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,440
Jong Kook, can I have
a cup of coffee before we begin?

599
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,610
Sure. Go ahead.

600
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,670
- Hey.
- It's in the fridge.

601
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,780
- We're about to begin.
- You might...

602
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,350
You might get stressed out
because it's hard to open the lid.

603
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,790
- I understand.
- It's a little tight.

604
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,950
I mean, we should enjoy ourselves...

605
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,360
- not to get stressed out.
- Absolutely.

606
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,450
- Have as much as you want.
- Hey, I see...

607
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,560
you already opened this one.

608
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,330
- Which one?
- The bottle in the front.

609
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,030
- It's already open.
- Oh, I see.

610
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,330
You can have it
or open a new bottle.

611
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,830
You two look really close
to each other.

612
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,340
Hey, that wasn't open.

613
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,630
- It's a new bottle.
- Yes, it is.

614
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,340
- It's a new bottle.
- It's really good.

615
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,900
(Meanwhile, Se Chan is showing off
his strength.)

616
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,850
(Grunting)

617
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
(Groaning)

618
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,440
That's the weight
that Jong Kook's mother uses.

619
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
- What? This is?
- Yes.

620
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,210
For real? Gosh. Why is it so heavy?

621
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,560
(He fusses while using the weights
used by Jong Kook's mother.)

622
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,620
- His mother must be very strong.
- He said she could do it easily.

623
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,000
- Really?
- Yes.

624
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,070
What is this? Hold on. My goodness.

625
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,770
Wait. We're in trouble.

626
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,540
Se Chan, come out when you're ready.

627
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,900
He's coming out.

628
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,400
- That looks fun.
- What?

629
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,010
- Why?
- It's too small.

630
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,200
- Is it small? That should be easy.
- But...

631
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,010
Hey, you should've kept your elbows
at your sides when you measured it.

632
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,550
He didn't? Gosh. He should've.

633
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,910
- It's okay.
- It won't be easy.

634
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,590
- Measure it.
- Hey.

635
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,480
- Hey, So Min.
- All right. I know.

636
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
- I see what you mean.
- Stop it.

637
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,090
- It's not like that.
- It's the width, right?

638
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,680
(It's the same as
the width of my chest.)

639
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Hey!

640
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,920
It's the same as
the width of my chest.

641
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,950
(She shares information
that's not related to the game.)

642
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,500
- Hey.
- It's wider than that.

643
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,220
It's wider than that. Good.
Keep them at your sides.

644
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,130
So Min never stops trying
to make it romantic.

645
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,460
You're keeping your hands
close to your chest. That's why.

646
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,040
I told you to keep your elbows...

647
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,580
- What are you doing?
- Keep your elbows at your sides.

648
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,730
Why are you keeping your hands
close to your chest?

649
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,010
So Min, stretch out your arms
a little bit.

650
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,050
I mean, watch me.

651
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,020
- Just put your elbows here.
- So Min, what are you doing?

652
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,940
- Why around your chest?
- So Min.

653
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,020
- Gosh, seriously.
- That's just weird.

654
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,480
Look. Keep your elbows
at your sides like this.

655
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,150
- She's so hilarious.
- I can't believe her.

656
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,530
- How should we do it like that?
- Seriously.

657
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,950
Just keep your elbows at your sides.

658
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,360
Ji Hyo, you go next.

659
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,860
- Come over here.
- You should enjoy yourselves.

660
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,890
- It's the width of my chest.
- This is...

661
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,370
Why did you leave so quickly?

662
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,370
- Jae Suk.
- Hey.

663
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,070
- This is...
- Why did you...

664
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,870
(It took him only one second.)

665
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,870
- Take your time.
- Don't be halfhearted.

666
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,810
- Take your time.
- Don't rush it.

667
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,310
- I think it's narrower.
- It's...

668
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,130
- It's narrower, right? I'll...
- No, it's not.

669
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,440
- I think it's gotten smaller.
- No.

670
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
- I'm accurate.
- That's the width of my chest...

671
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,810
- It's narrower than before.
- I agree.

672
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,750
- It's narrower than the width...
- Yes, I'll widen it slightly.

673
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,320
- It's the same.
- I'll widen it.

674
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,940
- No, don't do that.
- It's narrower than before.

675
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,020
It's narrower than before.

676
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,650
- That's not true.
- I'll widen it a little.

677
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,920
No, don't widen it.
The margin of error is only 1cm.

678
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,260
- I should measure it like this.
- Widen it slightly.

679
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,260
- It's good now, right?
- No.

680
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,120
- Inward.
- That's good enough.

681
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,270
Move them outward.

682
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,270
It's exactly the width of my chest.

683
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,840
Yes, I think this is correct.
Just this wide.

684
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,300
- Come closer. Let's do it again.
- Okay.

685
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,730
(They got as close to each other
as possible.)

686
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,900
- It's straight, right?
- Yes.

687
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,230
- Let's get even closer.
- That's good enough.

688
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,230
Can't you put them on your waist?

689
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,400
- No.
- You're right.

690
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,910
I mean, the widths of chests are
quite similar to one another.

691
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,370
I'm ready. Bring the tape measure.

692
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,050
- This is the right size.
- It's too big.

693
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,050
No. This is exactly the width
of my chest.

694
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,410
No, you're wrong.

695
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,360
- Can we lift it up?
- Of course.

696
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,680
- There's no difference.
- Okay.

697
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,420
- Measure it.
- I think we pulled it off.

698
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,480
- I think so too.
- It's 33cm.

699
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,650
It's 33.5cm.

700
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,920
- Is it 33.5cm?
- Yes.

701
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,460
- It's 33.5cm.
- Please step back.

702
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,570
- Is it 33cm?
- Our record is 33.5cm, right?

703
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,770
What is it?

704
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,630
(The object turns out to be
a dumbbell.)

705
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,930
- It looks too narrow.
- Please give me the tape measure.

706
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,730
- Put it down.
- So Min.

707
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,200
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

708
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,580
- Hey.
- What's wrong with you?

709
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,010
Stop it.
You're at my place, you punk!

710
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,900
I wanted to measure the width.

711
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,940
(The length of the dumbbell
should be between 32cm and 35cm.)

712
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,180
(It's 28cm long.)

713
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,750
- You failed.
- Gosh.

714
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,860
(They failed
at their first attempt.)

715
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,650
- How long is it?
- It's 28cm long.

716
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,590
- See? I said it was narrow.
- You were right.

717
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,180
- Suk Jin...
- Why did you widen it?

718
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,860
Ji Hyo was accurate.

719
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,860
Suk Jin,

720
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,120
- why did you change it?
- Why did you decide on your own?

721
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,300
- How long is it?
- He said it was narrow.

722
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,690
- How long is it?
- They said it too.

723
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,190
- Is it 28cm?
- He said it was hard.

724
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,510
- Why was it hard?
- It was hard to measure it.

725
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,660
I was right about it.

726
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,040
- The staff members knew...
- Ji Hyo, it was accurate.

727
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,470
- It's 28cm long. Look.
- You shouldn't have widened it.

728
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,730
- Right?
- Come on. Stop it.

729
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,080
Hey, enough.

730
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,780
I was right, Jae Suk.
It's 28cm wide.

731
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,140
Suk Jin shouldn't have...

732
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,750
- widened it just as he wanted.
- I won't do it again.

733
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,050
- Go ahead and measure it.
- Se Chan...

734
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,260
We should pull it off this time.

735
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,760
- What should I measure?
- It's a foam roller this time.

736
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,030
- Pardon?
- A foam roller.

737
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,060
Home run ball?

738
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,560
No, the object over there.

739
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,100
- What is this?
- It's a foam roller.

740
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,620
Oh, is this it? Wait.

741
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,220
Are you ready?

742
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,070
- How did it go?
- You can come out.

743
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,270
He's coming out.

744
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,460
- Come and stand here.
- Let's make it work.

745
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,800
- Se Chan.
- Remember that, okay?

746
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,130
Be careful
when you pass through the door.

747
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,310
Wait. I can't pass through the door.

748
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,310
Come out.

749
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,870
Hey, turn around.

750
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,410
- You need to feel it.
- You should turn around.

751
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,850
You should be confident
that you can control your body.

752
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,850
Hey.

753
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,620
How does it even work?

754
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,380
That's not how it should be done.

755
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,060
- Hey.
- Is it too long?

756
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,120
Couldn't you do it like this?

757
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,500
- Keep your elbows at your sides.
- Can't you do it like this?

758
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Can't you do it like this?

759
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,120
- Right. That's good.
- That's good.

760
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,420
- Let's do it that way.
- No!

761
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,420
But she just...

762
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,070
- widened it.
- Good. Yes, keep going.

763
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,070
- Good. Keep going.
- That'll cause an error.

764
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,430
Hey. It's okay. So Min, keep going.

765
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,370
- No, that'll cause an error.
- That's good.

766
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,630
We failed already.

767
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,630
No, we've got this.

768
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,050
- Now, come here.
- Don't move your arms.

769
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,810
- That's good.
- Come.

770
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,750
- Come just as you are.
- Move.

771
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,370
- No, stay there.
- Right. That'll work.

772
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,210
- Just stay still.
- That'll work.

773
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,750
- Just as you are. Don't move.
- Stay still.

774
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,650
- Right. Keep your elbows there.
- Come just as you are.

775
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,950
Don't move your arms. Good.

776
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,060
We are...

777
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,450
You'll be surprised...

778
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,920
- to see us pull this off.
- We're amazing.

779
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,220
- We're good at group missions.
- Come.

780
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,600
- Come without moving your arms.
- I'm worried...

781
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,300
- about Jae Suk though.
- Don't worry about me.

782
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,960
- He worries me.
- I...

783
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,040
- I didn't touch you.
- Don't give the next player a tip.

784
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,900
- Okay.
- I can keep my arms steady.

785
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,310
- No. Keep your elbows at the sides.
- Keep your elbows at the sides.

786
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,370
- Keep them at your sides.
- Keep them at your sides!

787
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,630
- Like this.
- No.

788
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,640
- Don't stress me out.
- But Jae Suk.

789
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,810
I'd get stressed out
if you forced me to do so.

790
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,810
- Keep your elbows at your sides.
- Jae Suk.

791
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,820
- You're stressing me out.
- But...

792
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,170
- Why would you get stressed out?
- Keep them at your sides.

793
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,250
You're stressing me out.

794
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,290
- Wait.
- My gosh.

795
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,850
- You're giving me stress.
- Keep them at your sides.

796
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,650
I think it was wider
when Se Chan came out.

797
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,650
- Right. That's why I don't do this.
- Then widen it slightly.

798
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,720
My stress level keeps going up.

799
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,800
I must be stressed out.
It went up to 61.

800
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,030
- Keep your elbows at your sides.
- Let me do it my way.

801
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,500
- If I do so...
- You should...

802
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,870
- keep your elbows at your sides.
- No, it's okay.

803
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,800
- Keep your elbows at your sides.
- It's better that way.

804
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,040
No. I can measure it accurately
like this.

805
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,270
- He said it wasn't wider than this.
- Watch me.

806
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,930
- But this is a better way.
- Look.

807
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,110
Just keep your elbows at your sides.

808
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,340
- Come on. Do as I say.
- Ji Hyo, this is the exact side.

809
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,340
Why won't you...

810
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,550
- Why...
- Just give it a try.

811
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,140
- Try my way just once.
- Keep your elbows at your sides.

812
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,640
- Keep them at your sides.
- This will work just fine.

813
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,550
- Gosh. What's his problem?
- This is the accurate measurement.

814
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,140
- You should've listened to me.
- Keep them at your sides.

815
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,910
It's better that way.
He never listens to me.

816
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,860
- Turn around.
- We're doing so well.

817
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,330
You'll be surprised.

818
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,030
- Is this it?
- It looks...

819
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,360
- Wait.
- Ji Hyo, I think you narrowed it.

820
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,370
No, I didn't.

821
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,030
- I'll widen it a little bit.
- My measurement was accurate.

822
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,600
It wasn't accurate at all.

823
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,870
- It was accurate.
- I widened it a little bit.

824
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,730
Suk Jin, just turn around,
and Haha, come close to him.

825
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,370
- Okay.
- Suk Jin, turn around.

826
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,230
Don't get stressed out.
Let's speak nicely to one another.

827
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,750
- Let's talk nicely.
- No, it's too wide.

828
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,810
- You can measure it now.
- Okay. Turn around.

829
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,320
Dong Hoon, turn around
without moving your arms.

830
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,670
Please accept that much.

831
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,250
- Please accept it.
- It got bigger.

832
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,440
I know. It's wider than before.

833
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
It's bigger?

834
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,450
- It's 95cm.
- It's 95cm.

835
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,260
- He's in a sitting position.
- It's 95cm, right?

836
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,030
- It's 94.5cm.
- Okay.

837
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,380
Okay. Now, bring out the object.

838
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,950
- What is it?
- Okay. What is it?

839
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,600
What could it be?
When I saw Se Chan measuring it...

840
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
(When I saw Se Chan measuring it...)

841
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,920
It felt a little strange.

842
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,570
- Why?
- What do you mean?

843
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,700
She's making this face again.

844
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,400
Honestly, I noticed it,
but I didn't say anything.

845
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,430
(She makes the face
frequently today.)

846
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,400
When I saw him spread his arms,
I wanted to...

847
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,250
When I saw him spread his arms,
I wanted to...

848
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,120
(Hugging)

849
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,180
I see you wanted to hug him.

850
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,950
(Love Frog got distracted
during the game.)

851
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,060
(Smiling)

852
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,590
Enough is enough.

853
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,920
My gosh. Honestly...

854
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,190
- She's so peculiar.
- She's unbelievable.

855
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,330
It was a foam roller.

856
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,270
- This was it.
- It was a foam roller.

857
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,960
- I see.
- Is this it? It looks longer.

858
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,000
- No. It could be 95cm long.
- I think so too.

859
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,840
I think it's exactly 95cm long.

860
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,630
- Look.
- We have a chance.

861
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,700
I'll measure it now.

862
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,850
- How long is it?
- Please.

863
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,670
(The length of it should be
between 93cm and 96cm.)

864
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,020
(What could be the result?)

865
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,290
Is it 92cm? It's 93cm.

866
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,860
- My goodness.
- Awesome.

867
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,650
(They pulled it off!)

868
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,680
Awesome.

869
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,420
- We pulled it off.
- All right.

870
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,030
There's not even
a one-centimeter difference.

871
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,000
- This is amazing.
- Really?

872
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:53,870
This is amazing.

873
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,340
- See? I knew it.
- This is who we are.

874
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,730
Hey, this is "Running Man."

875
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,730
Bring it on!

876
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,730
You saw that, right?

877
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:59,840
See? I knew we'd pull it off.

878
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,040
- Right?
- Great job.

879
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,550
- I widened it a little bit.
- Come on.

880
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,870
- Jae Suk is so funny.
- We're awesome.

881
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,910
Bring it on.

882
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:10,140
- This is unbelievable.
- We all thought we were wrong.

883
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,550
- Who said that?
- You should've...

884
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,560
- I widened it.
- He says he widened it.

885
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,760
I widened it slightly.

886
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,950
No, you didn't.

887
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,220
I calculated using pi.

888
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,560
That's nonsense.

889
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,120
- Just eat a pie.
- I calculated the length.

890
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,690
We shouldn't get stressed out.

891
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,220
- We're good at games like this.
- Oh, my.

892
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,770
It's fascinating.
My stress level went down...

893
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,830
- to 45.
- Really?

894
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,600
- From 60.
- Right. You felt accomplished.

895
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,660
- We're awesome.
- That was good.

896
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,460
We surprised ourselves.

897
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,670
As a result,
you achieved 500 dollars.

898
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,940
(They achieved 500 dollars.)

899
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,350
- We got it.
- Let's go.

900
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,320
- We'll start the next mission.
- Okay.

901
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,820
- Okay.
- Let's get that 500 dollars.

902
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,320
You are the best entertainers...

903
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,560
- who can beat any idol stars...
- Of course.

904
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,120
in every game.

905
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,450
- Of course.
- Yes, we can.

906
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,190
The next mission is something
you can definitely pull off.

907
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,330
It's Loyal Squats.

908
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,570
- What? Loyal Squats?
- Will we do squats?

909
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,040
The 6 of you have to do 600 squats
in total to win.

910
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,230
(The 6 of them have to do 600 squats
to win.)

911
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,110
- How do we do 600 squats?
- The 6 of us?

912
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,730
But we're seven people.

913
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,110
Jong Kook is your coach.

914
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,110
- What?
- He's your coach.

915
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,110
- How do we do it without the ace?
- That's nonsense.

916
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,310
- One, two, three, four...
- Six hundred squats...

917
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,370
Each of us should do 100 squats.

918
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,120
You can do 100 squats.

919
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,640
I can't do 100 squats.

920
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,680
You're a famous YouTube creator
for your workout videos.

921
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,650
- Yes. They can do it.
- You shouldn't count it...

922
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,260
- when they don't do it properly.
- I'll even check the angle.

923
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,650
- Okay.
- Gosh.

924
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,830
- You can do it.
- Okay.

925
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,060
You don't have to divide it evenly.
Just do 600 squats in total.

926
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,950
You can do 100 squats.
It's 5 sets of 20 reps.

927
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,300
Jong Kook, I have never done
squats in my whole life.

928
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,120
- Me neither.
- We should do it at once.

929
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,930
That's why it's hard.

930
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,460
- Sorry?
- We should do 100 squats in a row.

931
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,310
- You can do it.
- Can I do it my way?

932
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,310
I can't even do...

933
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,670
- ten squats at once.
- How do you do squats?

934
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:43,250
This is how I do squats.
While watching TV at home,

935
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,550
I sit on the sofa like this...

936
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,940
- No, that's not allowed.
- No.

937
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,640
(This is just sitting down
on the sofa and getting up.)

938
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,850
- You sit so comfortably.
- But...

939
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,210
- But...
- This is how it's done.

940
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,150
That's how grandpas do squats.

941
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,560
Did you just call me a grandpa?

942
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,830
- That's how grandpas do it.
- What?

943
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,650
He sat down too comfortably though.

944
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,030
- The three of you can go first.
- Us?

945
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,460
- Stop if you can't do any more.
- Okay.

946
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,070
Let's see you do a squat first.

947
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,390
- How can one do 100 squats?
- Jae Suk, go ahead.

948
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,840
It wasn't bad,
but keep your knees apart.

949
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,930
- Really?
- You have weak knees, so...

950
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,540
- Should I widen my stance?
- Yes, spread your knees out.

951
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,840
- How about this?
- Widen your stance.

952
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,080
- Yes, that's it.
- Perfect, isn't it?

953
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,580
- Yes, that's good enough.
- Two and three.

954
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,610
- Jae Suk, stop.
- That's perfect.

955
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,050
- Who's next?
- So Min.

956
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,550
I can't sit down
because of my jeans.

957
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,910
There's too much hip anteversion.

958
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,350
(There's too much hip anteversion.)

959
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,150
- Hip anteversion?
- Like this.

960
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,590
(Hip anteversion?)

961
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,450
Like this. It's common for women.

962
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,650
- One should lean backwards.
- It's not good for your knees.

963
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,190
That's right.
Be in a neutral stance.

964
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,560
Now, squat.

965
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,190
Don't push your hip out too much.

966
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,100
Wouldn't this stress us all out?

967
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,000
- Hold on.
- Wouldn't this stress us all out?

968
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,130
- Keep your knees out wide.
- This is stressing me out.

969
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,510
- Go ahead.
- Already?

970
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,070
- I almost made a mistake.
- I hate that tone of his.

971
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,510
Push your knees out
in the direction of your toes.

972
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,400
Squat. There you go. Nicely done.

973
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,200
Okay, that's good enough.

974
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,050
- Let us begin.
- Here we go.

975
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,820
Let's begin.

976
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,520
(Chatting)

977
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,790
Ready, get set...

978
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,820
(They chat when the others
are about to squat.)

979
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,980
- We're about to squat, guys.
- Pay attention!

980
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,150
- You can take your time.
- They're hilarious.

981
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,600
Se Chan thought Ji Hyo was me...

982
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
and punched her
in a place where it hurts.

983
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,190
- And then he apologized.
- Really?

984
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,570
(A few moments ago)

985
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,040
(Punch)

986
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,370
(He mistook Ji Hyo for Haha.)

987
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,400
What's wrong?

988
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,540
Did you punch her?

989
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,900
- This jerk...
- Did he think you were me?

990
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,230
He hit me where it really hurts.

991
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,970
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

992
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,910
It really startled me.

993
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,520
- Let's do this.
- Ready, get set, go.

994
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,120
- All right. One!
- Take your time.

995
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,760
- Two.
- Keep pace with each other.

996
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,860
(The merciless coach
will have anyone doing squats.)

997
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,220
- Slower.
- It's already a slow pace.

998
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,600
(But they're famous
for not listening.)

999
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,190
It's already a slow pace.

1000
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,260
- Three.
- Don't.

1001
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,460
- Five, six.
- Look at Suk Jin go.

1002
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,160
- I do squats at home.
- Seven.

1003
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,300
- Eight.
- All right!

1004
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,040
- Nine.
- It's a good pace.

1005
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,340
- Ten.
- My gosh.

1006
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,930
- My gosh.
- It's a fast pace.

1007
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,430
I still have more in me.

1008
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,900
- Twelve.
- I still have more in me.

1009
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,470
Thirteen.

1010
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,870
Fourteen. Keep the pace.

1011
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,140
- Fifteen.
- It's too fast.

1012
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,440
- Look at Jae Suk.
- Sixteen.

1013
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,680
- He has proper form.
- Seventeen.

1014
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,320
- It's too fast.
- Eighteen.

1015
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,760
- If you can, keep going, Jae Suk.
- Nineteen.

1016
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,480
- Twenty.
- Got it.

1017
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,980
- I'm feeling it now.
- If you can do 200,

1018
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,330
- that'll be admirable.
- Twenty-two.

1019
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,100
Is that the right count? 23.

1020
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,800
- And 24.
- That's 24.

1021
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,390
- I think I did more.
- And 25.

1022
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,830
That's why you should keep the pace.

1023
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,040
- That's 26.
- Count with your inner voice.

1024
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,660
- Jae Suk.
- That's 27.

1025
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,340
(So Min legs give in
after 27 squats.)

1026
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,540
- Hey!
- No, it's okay.

1027
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,630
(So Min comes back for now.)

1028
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,970
At least do 100.

1029
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,810
(If one gives up,
someone else must do the rest.)

1030
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:32,870
That's 35.

1031
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,120
If you think about it...

1032
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,280
- I can't.
- So Min, don't sit back too much.

1033
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,550
What do I do?

1034
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,680
- We'll do this for sure.
- I can't!

1035
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
It's all right. Keep going.

1036
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,450
- Keep going.
- That's 60.

1037
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,260
One...

1038
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,530
- Three.
- I can't do any more.

1039
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,480
- So Min, you've got this.
- You can do this.

1040
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,600
- You can do at least 100.
- Five.

1041
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,060
- Six.
- Seven.

1042
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,300
Seven.

1043
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,460
- Gosh, look at Jae Suk.
- Eight.

1044
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,800
Go, you sexy man!

1045
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,340
- Ten.
- That's 70.

1046
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,840
- One.
- Two.

1047
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,730
- I give up.
- Three.

1048
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,070
(So Min gives up after 55 squats.)

1049
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,700
- So Min did 55 squats.
- Seriously?

1050
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,080
- Five.
- Have you given up?

1051
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,050
- So Min did 55 squats.
- You could've done more.

1052
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,170
- Seven, eight.
- No, I can't.

1053
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,350
Suk Jin, standing on that
gave you great form.

1054
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,640
- Eighty.
- Seventy.

1055
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,520
- One.
- Two.

1056
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,880
- Four, five...
- Jae Suk, do 50 more.

1057
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,480
- Six.
- Five.

1058
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,880
- Seven.
- Six.

1059
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,220
- Eight.
- Seven.

1060
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,620
- Nine.
- How many are you at? 90?

1061
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,860
- Yes, 90.
- Okay.

1062
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,800
- One.
- Do 50 more.

1063
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,920
Ten. That's 80.

1064
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,070
Suk Jin, you're looking good.

1065
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,430
- Good job.
- Six.

1066
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,310
(Meanwhile...)

1067
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,660
- Ten.
- Good job.

1068
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,130
- Three.
- Six.

1069
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,340
Look at them go.

1070
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,970
- Keep going.
- Five.

1071
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,640
- Nine.
- Six.

1072
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,320
- Good job.
- Ten.

1073
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,590
(Rather than it being fun,
it's about stressing them out.)

1074
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,590
- Keep going.
- Eight.

1075
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,320
- Nine.
- Six.

1076
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,760
- That's 100.
- Seven.

1077
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,860
(Jae Suk hit 100 squats.)

1078
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,180
- Keep going.
- One. Two.

1079
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,650
- This is stressing me out!
- Three.

1080
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,770
(He swaps mental strength
for his physical strength.)

1081
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,830
That's 90.

1082
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,960
- Five.
- One.

1083
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,840
- I'm touched.
- How many has Jae Suk done?

1084
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,870
- Nine.
- He's at 110.

1085
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,110
- I...
- Nice.

1086
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,810
- Take a quick break.
- Keep going.

1087
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,930
- Seven.
- Get back to it.

1088
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,470
- Old man.
- Jae Suk.

1089
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,440
If you don't do 150...

1090
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,850
- We'll forfeit.
- We're going to give up.

1091
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,020
Okay.

1092
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,820
- I'm at 110.
- That's 92, 93...

1093
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,480
- Can I stop?
- No, keep going.

1094
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,480
That's 92, 93.

1095
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,060
That's 94.

1096
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,230
I can't keep going.

1097
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,150
- No, you can.
- Six.

1098
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,520
- How many are you at?
- Seven.

1099
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,830
- Five.
- That's 108.

1100
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,420
(He's already at 108.)

1101
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,670
That's 110.

1102
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,790
- This...
- One.

1103
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,900
- This is the grandpa squat.
- Two.

1104
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,170
- Three.
- That's how grandpas do it.

1105
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,670
(The old man lets out a cry.)

1106
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,080
- You only need 600 among you all.
- What?

1107
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,350
- What was that?
- Eight.

1108
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,880
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Nine. 130.

1109
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,250
- He apologized.
- What?

1110
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,290
Suk Jin, at his age...

1111
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,040
- He could yell at any time.
- That's 120.

1112
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,560
Seven, eight...

1113
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,880
- How many is that?
- Nine, 130.

1114
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,350
- Nice.
- That's 130.

1115
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,650
Just do 20 more.

1116
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,650
I did 130.

1117
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,190
- You're already seeing results.
- That's 130.

1118
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,270
- My legs are about to explode.
- Just do 20 more.

1119
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,460
One...

1120
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,500
(Jae Suk's goal is 150 squats.)

1121
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,770
- Four, five.
- We won't even bother.

1122
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:14,710
- Six, seven, eight.
- Six, seven, eight.

1123
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,540
- Nine, ten.
- Nine, ten.

1124
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,900
- You only have ten left.
- One.

1125
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,210
- Can you believe him?
- This is insane.

1126
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,580
- Seven, eight...
- Jae Suk, my gosh.

1127
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,210
Nine.

1128
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,580
- Ten. Darn it!
- He did it.

1129
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,020
Nine.

1130
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,190
(Ten. Darn it!)

1131
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,480
- He did it.
- That's 150 squats.

1132
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,630
- You're the best.
- I did 150.

1133
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,900
No way.

1134
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,420
- They're as solid as rocks.
- The muscles...

1135
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,270
See? Doing squats
is great for your health.

1136
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,370
They're as solid as rocks.

1137
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,060
- That's 140.
- Good.

1138
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,130
Should I stop at 150?

1139
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,560
Yes, 150 squats are enough.

1140
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,770
- Darn it.
- 150 squats...

1141
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,170
(He's truly annoyed.)

1142
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,810
Keep going.

1143
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,350
Go on. You've got this.

1144
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,710
(He's back at it again.)

1145
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,120
The muscles...

1146
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,790
See? Doing squats
is great for your health.

1147
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,690
- They're as solid as rocks.
- Keep going.

1148
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,520
That's 147, 148,

1149
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,060
and 149.

1150
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,400
- And that's 150.
- There you go.

1151
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,630
(Suk Jin managed 150 squats.)

1152
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,460
(Suk Jin is still healthy enough.)

1153
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,560
- Currently...
- How many is that?

1154
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,000
You managed 355 squats.

1155
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,500
- How many do we need to do?
- Only 245 more squats.

1156
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,560
Only 245 more?

1157
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,170
You must do at least 100 each.

1158
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,310
How can we not?

1159
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,880
- How can we not?
- You can do this.

1160
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,940
Jong Kook...

1161
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,250
Let's get him the 3,000 dollars.

1162
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,270
- Correct my form for me.
- Let's keep a steady pace.

1163
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,120
I have a short
Achilles tendon and...

1164
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,190
(Groaning)

1165
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,290
My body...

1166
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,650
Suk Jin, are you all right?

1167
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,310
And go.

1168
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,750
- One.
- One.

1169
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,230
One.

1170
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,290
- Two.
- Three.

1171
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,190
Haha, squat deeper.

1172
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,190
Squat deeper. That's two.

1173
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,960
Check your form
and widen your stance.

1174
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,500
- Go on.
- Got it.

1175
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,900
- Seven.
- How many did I do?

1176
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,400
- You've done ten.
- Ten?

1177
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,600
Ji Hyo, you're to hit 50 squats.

1178
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,130
Five.

1179
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,630
Six.

1180
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,310
Se Chan, squat deeper.

1181
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,600
Squat deeper.

1182
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,170
- Se Chan.
- What the...

1183
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,210
- That's it.
- The stress!

1184
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,690
- That's the one.
- Let's do this.

1185
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,020
- I know.
- Haha, watch your form.

1186
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,210
Don't stick your butt out.
Yes, that's better.

1187
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,480
Yes, that's how you do it.

1188
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,250
That was 100. I'm done.

1189
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,060
I did 111.

1190
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,600
- You did 57.
- They hit the quota.

1191
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,920
- That's it.
- You succeeded.

1192
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,520
- Okay!
- Nice.

1193
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,600
- Good job.
- They did it.

1194
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,830
- This is killer.
- I'm glad.

1195
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,130
I can't believe
you managed 100 each.

1196
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:25,460
They're making us do this
to increase our stress levels.

1197
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,440
- You're right.
- Just so you know,

1198
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,880
one of you reached
a dangerously high stress level.

1199
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,980
Who?

1200
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,350
Suk Jin's stress level was at 93.

1201
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,080
(Suk Jin's stress level
was dangerously high at 93.)

1202
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,520
You were in the red zone.

1203
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,150
- What did you expect?
- Dangerously high?

1204
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,520
Is that for real?

1205
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,020
- It went up to 93.
- Are you okay?

1206
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,020
Suk Jin, right?

1207
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,290
Does one die if it reaches 100?

1208
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,060
Suk Jin almost opened the doors
to the afterlife.

1209
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,790
I knocked, but no one let me in.

1210
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,600
You're trying to increase
our stress level.

1211
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,290
- You're trying to stress us out.
- That must be your goal.

1212
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,460
You can relax now.

1213
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,810
How are we supposed to relax?

1214
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:00,060
- I bet the tteokbokki is spicy.
- Right.

1215
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,670
No, it's just produce placement.

1216
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,500
Suk Jin's on his phone
when we're supposed to be working.

1217
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,120
- But we're not filming.
- He's on his phone.

1218
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,880
- We're on a bathroom break.
- Are you checking your stocks?

1219
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,540
- Unbelievable.
- No, my texts.

1220
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,080
- He's on his phone.
- Mine went up.

1221
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,620
Suk Jin was on his phone
when we're supposed to be working.

1222
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,790
Tell him not to be annoying.

1223
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,500
You two.

1224
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,750
- Are you aware of what's happening?
- What?

1225
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,460
Can you see that
we're keeping our distance?

1226
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,420
- Sit over there.
- Why won't anyone sit here?

1227
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,960
Someone should sit here.

1228
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,370
Okay, I will.

1229
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,600
His legs.

1230
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,000
- This is nice.
- Isn't it comfortable?

1231
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,830
- What's with your legs?
- They're not good today.

1232
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,440
I hate how the seat suits you.

1233
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,710
- What?
- Right.

1234
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,000
It's as if
it was tailor-made for you.

1235
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,750
(While they let their legs
take a break...)

1236
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,040
- What's that?
- That looks nice!

1237
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,710
- This is the real deal.
- No way.

1238
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,790
- Gosh.
- It's from the neighborhood.

1239
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,290
- Goodness.
- It's from the neighborhood.

1240
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,250
- It's like a local brand.
- This looks great.

1241
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,460
We should sit around the table.

1242
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,580
(My Grandmother's Tteokbokki)

1243
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,600
- It's like a local brand.
- We'll enjoy.

1244
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,020
- Check this out.
- What on earth?

1245
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,520
Everything looks incredible.

1246
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,600
There's more.

1247
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,600
- It's how I like my tteokbokki.
- Can you clean up over there?

1248
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,770
No way.

1249
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,100
- Check out this squid.
- Do you have any scissors?

1250
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,440
Check out the fried squid.

1251
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,210
- This is incredible.
- It was fried as is.

1252
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,670
Squid is all protein.

1253
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,540
- This is the real deal.
- That's good.

1254
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,810
(A short workout
increased their appetite.)

1255
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,040
That's so good.

1256
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,810
Some are made with rice
and some with flour.

1257
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,210
There are shorter ones too.

1258
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,710
I love how they serve
a variety of dishes.

1259
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,330
The tteok made with rice
is their best option.

1260
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,730
- It brings me back to my childhood.
- This is great.

1261
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,420
(The one they ate
at the stationery store.)

1262
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,370
- The stationery store tteokbokki.
- This is delicious.

1263
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,060
- The one sold outside the school.
- And the stationery store.

1264
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,130
Se Chan, did you even go to school?

1265
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,770
Going to elementary school
and middle school is mandatory.

1266
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,770
Of course I was in school.

1267
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,770
He went to school but never studied.

1268
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,120
- I bet you had a lot of fun.
- Really?

1269
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,520
I can't believe he asked
if I went to school.

1270
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,380
- I want to mash the egg.
- Let's do that.

1271
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,710
Only a few people know this.

1272
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,020
- That's right.
- But...

1273
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,650
- This is it.
- This is it.

1274
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,130
- Have a dumpling.
- I don't really like dumplings.

1275
00:39:58,650 --> 00:39:59,920
This is it, guys.

1276
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,900
- This is it.
- I wouldn't recommend it.

1277
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,400
- Hey. This is crazy good.
- Isn't it crazy good?

1278
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,420
- This is so good.
- It's so good.

1279
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,900
It's taking long to eat considering
it being product placement.

1280
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,900
- You're right.
- Right.

1281
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,100
They put in their everything
to make this.

1282
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,540
- This is really good.
- Jong Kook. Do you have some rice?

1283
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,080
It'd be nice to mix rice in it.

1284
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,400
I can heat it up.

1285
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,900
- Can you heat up one?
- Sure.

1286
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,810
- He listens to us well.
- Jae Suk.

1287
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,040
I don't have plain rice.

1288
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,250
- Hey! I only eat brown rice.
- That's good.

1289
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,150
- The dumpling is nice.
- Give us spoons too.

1290
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,190
Okay, Jae Suk.

1291
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,020
Can you give me some water too?

1292
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,060
Shall I?

1293
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,480
It's hard not to give her water
when she asked like that.

1294
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,150
- How can you not give her water?
- You're sitting...

1295
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,460
- She's like the lady of the house.
- like you live here.

1296
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,920
Jong Kook.

1297
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,190
- Yes?
- Can you give me a bowl?

1298
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,230
Jong Kook, Jae Suk wants a bowl.

1299
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,330
Jong Kook?

1300
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,630
Here, Ji Hyo.

1301
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,940
Jong Kook, get me a bowl.

1302
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,440
Can you hurry up?

1303
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,810
I don't want the flow to be stopped.

1304
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,040
He's doing everything for us
because we're at his place.

1305
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,580
I know. He's so kind.

1306
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,540
Thanks, Jong Kook. My gosh.

1307
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,850
Thank you.

1308
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:58,080
I'll mix it
with a little bit of rice.

1309
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,790
I've never seen anyone
mix it with rice.

1310
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,060
How come?

1311
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,920
- It's good.
- It's good.

1312
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,580
He doesn't know how to enjoy it.

1313
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,980
He doesn't know how to eat it.

1314
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,560
This is why he doesn't get
product placement.

1315
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,650
(The spokesperson for the advertiser
gives him a blunt comment.)

1316
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,630
- Suk Jin, this is...
- What?

1317
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,900
People love eating it this way.

1318
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,940
It's really nice
to mix it with rice.

1319
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,000
(Jae Suk's tteokbokki bibimbap:
Soup, brown rice, egg, laver flake)

1320
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,870
- The advertiser will love it.
- Of course.

1321
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,960
I can see why you get...

1322
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,040
- so many commercial deals.
- Of course.

1323
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,000
Advertisers adore me.

1324
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,600
It's a waste to throw the sauce
out because it's so good.

1325
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,020
(A reaction advertisers
would die for)

1326
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,020
It's so good.

1327
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,810
- Se Chan, try this.
- I wish there were more eggs.

1328
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:35,960
- We mashed all of them.
- This one is really good.

1329
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,420
- You'll go crazy for it.
- Really?

1330
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,170
I think you need to
heat up more rice.

1331
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,170
It's so good.

1332
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,190
(Se Chan makes a fuss
and asks for more rice.)

1333
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,500
This is crazy good! I'm serious.

1334
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,940
I told you. It's crazy good.

1335
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,670
- Try it!
- You know how Se Chan...

1336
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,310
When we got chips
for product placement,

1337
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,980
he said they'd be good with rice.

1338
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,100
That's not true!

1339
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,650
(For the gopchang flavored chips
product placement last year...)

1340
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:02,580
(He'd look for rice first
regardless of the type of food.)

1341
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,020
- But with this...
- Try making it.

1342
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,750
- No.
- I'll judge it objectively.

1343
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,210
- As soon as you take a bite...
- The shrimp almost jumped out.

1344
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,560
I told you. It's really good.

1345
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,630
It's really good.

1346
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,630
- It's good.
- Isn't it?

1347
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:17,060
- That's the reaction you'd get.
- Gosh, that is so fake.

1348
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,400
- It's really good.
- It's not fake.

1349
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,690
Suk Jin, this is for real.

1350
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:22,330
Suk Jin, you must say it now.
There's not much left.

1351
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,170
- It's fine. I won't eat it.
- But if you don't...

1352
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,600
- You should try it first.
- It's okay.

1353
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,330
It's really good! You'll love it.

1354
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,770
This is crazy good.

1355
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,210
- I didn't expect this at all.
- You'll really love it.

1356
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,580
Then let me try it.

1357
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,250
(Then let me try it.)

1358
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:36,120
(Embarrassed, he asks for a bite.)

1359
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,210
He finally asked for it
now that not much is left.

1360
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,520
"Let me try it."

1361
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,380
He needs to have a bite too.

1362
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,150
He must have it.

1363
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,230
This is really good.

1364
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,080
- Jae Suk, this is so good.
- Let me try just a little.

1365
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,020
- It's really good.
- It really is.

1366
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,060
It tastes like
traditional tteokbokki.

1367
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,670
Suk Jin, won't you treat us
to patbingsu?

1368
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,670
- Suk Jin.
- Let's have dessert.

1369
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,000
- I want iced Americano.
- We could have patbingsu or...

1370
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,230
- We want dessert.
- Then...

1371
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,270
- You want dessert?
- Let's go buy patbingsu.

1372
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:00,810
- Yes.
- Then...

1373
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,730
- We'll get it with your card.
- I want patbingsu too.

1374
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,270
Let's play a game
and decide who'll go.

1375
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,650
- The loser will go and buy it?
- Yes.

1376
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:06,750
Using their own card.

1377
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,540
- Okay.
- I don't have one with me.

1378
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,670
- Is that so?
- Let me borrow your card.

1379
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,710
I'll wire it back to you later.

1380
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,790
- No, you should use your own.
- No, let me borrow it first.

1381
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,480
- I'll pay it back for real.
- He said he'd wire it.

1382
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,710
- Let me borrow your card.
- You have your card with you.

1383
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:18,880
I don't have a card with me.
I use Samsung Pay.

1384
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,330
- Then we can use that.
- You need my fingerprints.

1385
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,500
- Then come with us.
- You can go with them.

1386
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,060
I'm too lazy to!

1387
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,230
We'll return the money.

1388
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,100
- We'll return it for real.
- It's not that.

1389
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,290
Then you can just give them
your thumb.

1390
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:31,830
Slice!

1391
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,400
- Only his thumb?
- He's scary.

1392
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,670
- That's a scary joke.
- Then...

1393
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,940
- Let's play a game...
- Let's do that.

1394
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,880
- and let two losers go.
- Two losers.

1395
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,350
- We can decide what to play?
- Yes, go ahead.

1396
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,170
- We haven't played that yet.
- Guessing the drawing.

1397
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,580
- Guessing the drawing.
- We haven't played that yet.

1398
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,150
- No, you played it too many times.
- Why not?

1399
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,380
What's wrong with it?

1400
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,790
But that's what we're here for.

1401
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:50,750
(Everyone has withdrawals
from the game.)

1402
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,650
Aren't we supposed
to play guess the drawing?

1403
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,400
I want to play guess the drawing.

1404
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,650
Then let's play that.

1405
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:56,900
That one.

1406
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,060
Are you talking about Game of Wits?

1407
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,290
- Please stop!
- Yes, Game of Wits.

1408
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:00,400
- I don't want it.
- It's the fastest one.

1409
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,460
- Why play that at my place?
- It's the fastest one.

1410
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,270
- Let's not play it again.
- Even the viewers...

1411
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,330
- must be sick of it.
- Get ready.

1412
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,270
- Let's not play that at home.
- The viewers must be sick of it.

1413
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,630
- Or we can play...
- One.

1414
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:09,830
- Two.
- Three.

1415
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:10,850
- Let's play...
- Four.

1416
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,580
- Five. All right!
- Six.

1417
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,120
We got one loser.

1418
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,620
- How about we play this?
- We got one.

1419
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,520
- Let's play Initial Game of Wits.
- We got one.

1420
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,520
- Initial Game of Wits.
- That sounds fun.

1421
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,580
- Right?
- That sounds fun.

1422
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,350
- That sounds fun. Wow, Suk Jin.
- That sounds fun!

1423
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:24,750
- Right?
- You're so cool, Suk Jin.

1424
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:26,150
- Initials.
- Initial Game of Wits.

1425
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:27,790
"GG."

1426
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,290
- Meat.
- Country.

1427
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,230
- Opportunity.
- Furniture.

1428
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,170
- High price.
- Organization.

1429
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,500
- Haha, you failed.
- You failed.

1430
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,040
- There's "health."
- "Health."

1431
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,040
(Ji Hyo and Haha will be in charge
of desserts.)

1432
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,100
Let's go, Haha.

1433
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,730
- All right!
- It's Haha and Ji Hyo.

1434
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,440
- Haha and Ji Hyo.
- Thank you for the dessert.

1435
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,580
Let's go.

1436
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,100
I want to have patbingsu.

1437
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,150
- I want weak iced Americano.
- I'll give you 20 dollars...

1438
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,210
if you go instead of me.

1439
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,080
- Then I'll go.
- Okay, you should go.

1440
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,080
- Twenty dollars? Are you serious?
- I'll pay you with KakaoPay.

1441
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,690
- Wait.
- I'll wire you the money.

1442
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,460
- Gosh, that's ridiculous.
- Give it to me now.

1443
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,480
All right.

1444
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,790
You should ask for 30 dollars.

1445
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:00,920
Twenty dollars?

1446
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,130
- She's going for 20 dollars.
- You're going?

1447
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,690
You're going to go?

1448
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:04,960
- Hey.
- Lower the price.

1449
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,270
I'll go if you pay me 19 dollars.

1450
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,690
(Trying to get the job
by appealing his cost-effectiveness)

1451
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:09,940
- Okay. Nineteen dollars it is.
- Nineteen dollars.

1452
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,730
- You should've said 50 dollars.
- That's 19 dollars.

1453
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:12,960
- Nineteen dollars.
- You should lower five dollars.

1454
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,670
Is there a cafe near here?

1455
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,770
I'll go for 18.5 dollars.

1456
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:16,770
Suk Jin, at how much will you go?

1457
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,440
So Min mentioned 18.5 dollars.

1458
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,600
Going on an errand.

1459
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,380
(Thinking)

1460
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,520
- I'll go for 18 dollars.
- Sold.

1461
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,850
Eighteen dollars it is.

1462
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:25,980
- Is it sold?
- All right.

1463
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,960
- Sold!
- Sold!

1464
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,310
- It's sold. Get going, Suk Jin.
- It's sold.

1465
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,630
- Go ahead.
- You'll be paid 18 dollars.

1466
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,480
He might have to spend 200 dollars
after receiving 18 dollars.

1467
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,060
- Go ahead, Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin didn't want to go.

1468
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,290
- You're sold at 18 dollars.
- You're sold, Suk Jin.

1469
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,100
- Let's go.
- Hurry up.

1470
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,870
- I'm not going.
- Why wouldn't you go?

1471
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:43,230
- You're sold.
- I only went along with the joke.

1472
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:45,460
Even the viewers won't be able
to understand it.

1473
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,980
- Why wouldn't they?
- Does this even make sense?

1474
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,730
- You're sold.
- They might think it's weird.

1475
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,250
- I actually wired him the money.
- You called for it.

1476
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,710
- I...
- He sent the money. You're sold.

1477
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,620
I'll send it back.
I'll even wire 20 dollars.

1478
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,310
- Just get going already.
- Hurry up. We have to go.

1479
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:59,440
Haha sent you 18 dollars.
Go get desserts now.

1480
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,580
You should go.

1481
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,880
- Then you should hold an auction.
- Hey.

1482
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,120
(Suggesting him another auction)

1483
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,830
- I...
- I won't go if it's not 50 dollars.

1484
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,850
- I'll go if it's 40 dollars.
- I'll never go if it's below 50.

1485
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,250
- It's so funny...
- I'll go if it's 40 dollars.

1486
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,770
- how he's so serious.
- Forty dollars?

1487
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,960
That's too cheap, you brat!

1488
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,100
- Just ask for 50 dollars.
- Jae Suk's been watching...

1489
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,400
to offer a lower price.

1490
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,060
- What on earth is this?
- It's hilarious!

1491
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,770
- Ask for 50 dollars, So Min.
- I didn't get paid anything.

1492
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:21,900
Forty dollars?

1493
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,130
- Make it 40.
- He'll accept it if you ask 50.

1494
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:24,350
How about 45 dollars?

1495
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,080
- Forty-five dollars? Okay.
- Because he said fifty dollars.

1496
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,670
- I know. I only want fifty dollars.
- Forty-five dollars it is.

1497
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:28,750
I'll give you 45 dollars.

1498
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,380
- Give it to me. I'll go now.
- This is weird math.

1499
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,420
Why does he have to take it
this far?

1500
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,850
(An unbelievable investor who uses
45 dollars after making 18 dollars)

1501
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:35,060
What was that?

1502
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,790
Why is it so expensive
to send someone on an errand?

1503
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:39,130
Also... So Min.

1504
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,920
- Sell it back to Haha.
- So Min. Hey.

1505
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,020
Hey!

1506
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,750
You should've asked for 100 dollars.

1507
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,670
Isn't this costing him more
than patbingsu?

1508
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,830
I got it.

1509
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:51,230
- Gosh, it's so funny.
- So Min, I'll go if you pay me 40.

1510
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:52,540
- Oh, gosh.
- Darn it.

1511
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,630
You'd have gone to get desserts
by now already.

1512
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,500
You'd have gone already.
You'd be ordering by now.

1513
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,400
All right. I'll go if you give me
40 dollars.

1514
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,150
- Then you'll go?
- Yes.

1515
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,810
- Okay, I call.
- Will you wire it to me? Okay.

1516
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:03,750
- Wait a minute.
- I made some money.

1517
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,080
Who spent the most money here?

1518
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,690
(Suk Jin lost 27 dollars,
when the other two made more.)

1519
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,210
- He spent the most money.
- This is some strange math.

1520
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,790
You were supposed to go anyway,
but I spent 45 dollars for nothing.

1521
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,560
You should've thought carefully
before saying anything.

1522
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,560
- I wired it because...
- He's a genius investor.

1523
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,630
- You...
- He's a genius.

1524
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:22,290
- Let's go.
- He made money.

1525
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,440
Haha, if you give me 20 dollars,
I'll go by myself.

1526
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,210
If you give it to me, I'll go alone.

1527
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:29,880
You won't be able to carry them all.

1528
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,710
- No, I can carry them.
- You should go.

1529
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,210
Go ahead, Mapo-gu residents.

1530
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,920
I want a weak latte, please.

1531
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,380
- A latte?
- I want iced Americano.

1532
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,650
- Iced Americano?
- I also want iced Americano.

1533
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:39,940
- A weak one.
- If they don't have patbingsu...

1534
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,020
Please don't make it sweet.

1535
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,190
If they don't have patbingsu...

1536
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:43,190
- You want iced Americano?
- Please make it weak.

1537
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:46,290
Then I'll have
an iced vanilla latte, decaf.

1538
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:49,060
You two won't remember
the order for sure.

1539
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,420
Just text me what you want.

1540
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,460
- You can't remember them.
- Just text me.

1541
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,870
If you're going to Starbucks,
can you get their chips?

1542
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,170
What chips?

1543
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,710
(Haughty)

1544
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:00,810
(Gosh, you!)

1545
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,600
(Gosh, you!)

1546
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,650
- He's so annoying.
- You did well.

1547
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,350
- Well done, Ji Hyo.
- She did well.

1548
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,080
- Get some snacks too.
- Please get me those.

1549
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,150
He was like the terrible fours.

1550
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:13,250
- See you later.
- See you.

1551
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:14,460
(Done ordering desserts, including
Jae Suk the terrible four)

1552
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,750
It's so humid.

1553
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:16,790
It's very humid.

1554
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:18,150
(Stressed by the humid and hot
weather as soon as they're out)

1555
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,150
(Frowning)

1556
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:23,330
Should we get hot drinks
for everyone? Let's get only ours...

1557
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,870
- in ice.
- In ice?

1558
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:25,960
(You want only our drinks
to be iced?)

1559
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,770
Let's get them something
so hot it'll burn their tongues.

1560
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,270
Come on, Haha.

1561
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,960
But I really want to buy
a hot drink for Jae Suk.

1562
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,040
He's so playful.

1563
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,040
(The more they think about him,
the more annoying they find him.)

1564
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,540
Didn't someone
order a vanilla drink?

1565
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,810
Let's just order caramel macchiato.
He won't be able to tell.

1566
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,020
Let's do that.

1567
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:46,480
A weak cup of latte, and...

1568
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,350
- Caramel macchiato, decaf.
- Make it decaf.

1569
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:51,520
And iced.

1570
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:56,290
- She knows the rest.
- We'll have six iced Americano.

1571
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,500
- Six?
- Yes.

1572
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,130
(While they half-heartedly
order drinks...)

1573
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:00,870
I feel like I'm less stressed now.

1574
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,370
I think I'm
constantly getting stressed.

1575
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:04,440
Gosh, Suk Jin.

1576
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,440
You're not so good with investments.

1577
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,900
Hey, my stress level is at 77.

1578
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:10,710
- That's high.
- Yours is rather high.

1579
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:11,900
It's very high.

1580
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,650
- So far, you've made 1,000 dollars.
- Yes.

1581
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:18,880
This time, the five of you
will carry out the third mission.

1582
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:22,480
The third mission is to hear
the latter part...

1583
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,620
- and complete a proverb.
- Sounds good.

1584
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,690
- Sounds fun.
- While they're gone?

1585
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:25,730
(Reap the whirlwind)

1586
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,350
(If they guess the first part
of the proverb correctly,)

1587
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:28,790
(they'll get the answer.)

1588
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:30,790
(Jumps onto the kitchen table)

1589
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:32,670
(A naughty calf)

1590
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,100
(Acorn)

1591
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,540
(Measuring height!)

1592
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,130
(With original answers,
they came up with new proverbs.)

1593
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:39,830
(A fish)

1594
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,100
We're guessing the latter part?

1595
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,100
- It was difficult.
- Not the first part?

1596
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,400
- It was really difficult.
- Isn't it...

1597
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,500
It's
"To kill two birds with one stone."

1598
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,980
What do you mean they'll tell us
the latter part?

1599
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,170
- They'll say the latter part...
- They'll say the latter part...

1600
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:48,350
- of the proverb.
- We need to complete it.

1601
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:49,350
We just need to complete it?

1602
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:50,750
He's frustrating too.

1603
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:51,810
It's okay if we complete it.

1604
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:53,620
He doesn't have
a good understanding.

1605
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,350
"Understanding."

1606
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:57,080
Can't you just get it immediately?

1607
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:59,850
- My heart is beating faster.
- He can't understand things.

1608
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:01,230
(My heart is beating faster.)

1609
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:03,650
- I'll give you three chances only.
- Okay.

1610
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:06,230
- All of you should pass just once.
- Okay.

1611
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,560
This will stress us out.

1612
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:10,000
Who will go first?

1613
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,440
- Let's decide the order.
- You come here.

1614
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,830
- I'll go there. You come here.
- Yes.

1615
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:13,940
I'll sit next to you.

1616
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,380
- All right.
- I'll go first.

1617
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,940
- He can't do it.
- Okay.

1618
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,440
A bolt.

1619
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,900
(A bolt)

1620
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:23,350
- Out of the blue.
- What? It's out of the blue.

1621
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:25,440
(Quiet)

1622
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,460
(A bolt out of the blue)

1623
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,750
- He's...
- It's "out of the blue."

1624
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,960
I was confused.
I couldn't think of it suddenly.

1625
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,980
I want to dropkick him.

1626
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,290
- In the back.
- What did you do?

1627
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:36,630
- I couldn't think of it.
- It's "out of the blue."

1628
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,100
How can you get it wrong?

1629
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,870
Why couldn't I think of it suddenly?

1630
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,130
You failed at the first attempt.

1631
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:42,270
Jae Suk, you sit here.

1632
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:43,940
- He must be crazy.
- Seriously.

1633
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,960
It was so easy.

1634
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,730
This is the basic.

1635
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:48,900
My goodness.

1636
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,980
- I couldn't think of it.
- Here I go.

1637
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:50,980
Let's do this.

1638
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:54,750
Little strokes...

1639
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,040
(Little strokes...)

1640
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,350
- Fell great oaks.
- That's it.

1641
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:59,080
- Gosh.
- Why did you...

1642
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,920
(Little strokes fell great oaks.)

1643
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,080
- Gosh.
- Why did you...

1644
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,080
- You should think.
- I mean...

1645
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,080
It doesn't come to your mind, right?

1646
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,250
- Why did you...
- It takes time to load.

1647
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:06,630
It was close.

1648
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,750
- It takes time.
- This is driving me crazy.

1649
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,420
Hey, you know proverbs, right?

1650
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,460
- Focus.
- I know the basic ones,

1651
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,100
but I get confused
when I'm given a fancy one.

1652
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,130
"Fancy."

1653
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:15,830
Not the fancy one.
I know "A bolt out of the blue."

1654
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:17,440
You should give him
what he knows, Bo Pil.

1655
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,830
- That's the basic.
- A bolt out of the blue.

1656
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,630
We've never given you
a difficult one.

1657
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:22,380
- That's the basic.
- Not the difficult one.

1658
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,900
Count three.

1659
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,500
- Go.
- It's very easy.

1660
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,480
It makes you even more nervous.

1661
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,480
(Se Chan who said he would be fine
as long as it's not a difficult one)

1662
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,650
A leopard cannot...

1663
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,940
change its habit.

1664
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,210
- Change its spots.
- Change its spots.

1665
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:35,460
(A leopard cannot change its habit?)

1666
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,920
- Change its spots.
- Change its spots.

1667
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,730
It's "spots," not "habit."

1668
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,980
- Change its spots.
- Change its spots.

1669
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,060
I thought it was "habit."

1670
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,100
(A leopard cannot...)

1671
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:48,000
(So Min made the same mistake
last time.)

1672
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,060
(Empty Heads' same wrong answer)

1673
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:51,710
- You failed.
- Gosh.

1674
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,810
- "Its habit."
- For real?

1675
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,230
- Let's start from here.
- For real?

1676
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:56,600
- Hey.
- He said "its habit."

1677
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,730
Jong Kook, come here.

1678
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,650
- I mean...
- That's not the problem.

1679
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:01,380
- I'll go first.
- Everyone should guess it right.

1680
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,480
Let's do it again.

1681
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,810
- I'm upset.
- I'll go first. Let's do it over.

1682
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,020
- He's upset.
- Let's go.

1683
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,650
- My heart is beating fast.
- Get it together.

1684
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:08,460
- We got this.
- Let's get 500 dollars.

1685
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,190
This isn't a joke.
We're filming at Jong Kook's house.

1686
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:12,290
(We're filming
at Jong Kook's house!)

1687
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,750
- Yes.
- We didn't come to play.

1688
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:15,900
Here I go.

1689
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,130
Even a monkey...

1690
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:19,230
(Even a monkey...)

1691
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:20,770
Even a monkey can fall from a tree.

1692
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,270
That was nice. That was easy.

1693
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:23,830
- What? It's not easy.
- Let's go.

1694
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:25,460
- When you have to answer...
- It's good.

1695
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:27,170
I'm fine
with this level of difficulty.

1696
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,080
Like draws...

1697
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,730
- To like.
- That's right.

1698
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,750
Gosh.

1699
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:32,940
That's right, So Min.

1700
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,310
- Let's go.
- Give me something like this.

1701
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:36,120
Why did you give me a difficult one?

1702
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,380
- I feel dizzy.
- Don't give me a difficult one.

1703
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,480
No, I won't.

1704
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,650
- You should relax.
- Okay.

1705
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,060
- You can't think when nervous.
- Right.

1706
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,380
It's an easy one.
Why would you be nervous?

1707
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,020
Both were very easy.

1708
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,330
I know.

1709
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:49,830
- Here I go.
- Be quiet.

1710
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,730
It's nothing.

1711
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:53,870
Of course.

1712
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,060
Hunger is...

1713
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,670
(Hunger is...)

1714
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:59,210
- The...
- The best sauce.

1715
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,170
(Timeout again)

1716
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,230
The best sauce.

1717
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,710
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.

1718
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:07,150
- I'm sorry.
- Seriously...

1719
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,250
I suddenly couldn't think of it.

1720
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,770
Even I knew it.

1721
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,650
- Knew what?
- What on earth...

1722
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:12,810
- is he doing?
- I knew it.

1723
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,650
- You couldn't think of it either.
- Why do you think so?

1724
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,080
Honestly...

1725
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,080
You honestly didn't know, right?

1726
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,290
- I thought it was "for frogs."
- He must be crazy.

1727
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:19,960
"For frogs?"

1728
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,830
- I thought "for frogs."
- Why did you give me a hard one?

1729
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:23,650
That was easy. Even I knew.

1730
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:24,770
Hunger is the best sauce.

1731
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:27,460
Give us two more chances.
It's because I'm sorry to Jong Kook.

1732
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,830
- He said yes.
- But...

1733
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,730
- I got chances.
- But it's ridiculous.

1734
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:31,730
I'll go first.

1735
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:32,900
- Go.
- Here I go.

1736
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:33,960
This is nothing.

1737
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,810
It is the tail...

1738
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,000
- Wagging the dog.
- Yes.

1739
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,540
- It's easy.
- If he got it wrong...

1740
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,810
- Good.
- I almost said something else.

1741
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,020
It will become a controversy.

1742
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,120
Go.

1743
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,190
- Let's go.
- He's nervous.

1744
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,380
He's nervous.

1745
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:47,750
Bite...

1746
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,350
(Bite...)

1747
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:52,850
- Your house?
- The bullet!

1748
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:55,000
(He suddenly thought
of "Bite your house.")

1749
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,020
- The bullet.
- Why would it be "your house?"

1750
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,060
Did he do it on purpose?

1751
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,170
Did you think
"your house" was better?

1752
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,460
I couldn't think of it.

1753
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,770
Did you do it on purpose?

1754
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:03,000
You did it on purpose.

1755
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,440
- I couldn't think of it.
- He wouldn't do it on purpose.

1756
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,170
- I couldn't think of it.
- Don't lie.

1757
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:07,440
I couldn't think of it.

1758
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,080
Jong Kook, you go first.

1759
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,270
- You try it.
- It doesn't...

1760
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:12,650
- make sense.
- You try it.

1761
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,750
- But it doesn't make sense.
- I couldn't think of it suddenly.

1762
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,810
I knew it was "the bullet."

1763
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:18,750
He didn't get it wrong so far.

1764
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,020
Good.

1765
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,850
- I'll get it together this time.
- Get it together.

1766
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:24,060
- I'll do it. Okay.
- Please do so.

1767
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,250
- Here I go.
- Yes.

1768
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:26,350
(The owner of the house who
was full of confidence debuted.)

1769
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,480
All noise and...

1770
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,350
- No side dish.
- Incorrect.

1771
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:30,850
- Hey.
- It's "substance."

1772
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:31,960
No substance.

1773
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,130
- Hey.
- No substance.

1774
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:34,170
I told you.

1775
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,370
Hey.

1776
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:37,130
- Won't you do it properly?
- He gave me a difficult one.

1777
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:38,230
- It's a hard one.
- He suddenly gave me a hard one.

1778
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:40,210
This one is hard. So Min, come here.

1779
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:41,940
- So Min got it wrong as well.
- All of a sudden...

1780
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,900
She just said "substance."

1781
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,710
It's "no substance."

1782
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:47,000
Let's do it again.
We have one more chance.

1783
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,810
- The last one.
- No substance.

1784
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,120
- You used all your chances,
- So Min.

1785
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,540
- but I'll let it slide.
- Just one more time.

1786
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,850
- Let's do it just one more time.
- Try it.

1787
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:54,540
It isn't easy.

1788
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,210
It was hard.

1789
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,560
- It was all hard.
- I said it was not easy.

1790
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,560
It's difficult to think
of the words that come next.

1791
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,020
Why do you think I said
"Bite your house?"

1792
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:03,100
- Try it.
- Starting from here.

1793
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,020
Give me an easy one this time.

1794
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:06,500
Experience is...

1795
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,870
(Experience is...)

1796
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:09,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

1797
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,130
- Incorrect.
- It's "the best teacher."

1798
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:12,830
- Experience is the best...
- The best teacher.

1799
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,040
(He was so confident.)

1800
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,980
What's wrong with you? It was easy.

1801
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:16,980
(He was so confident.)

1802
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,380
Why did he give me the one
I didn't know?

1803
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:19,440
It's not that you didn't know.

1804
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,440
Come out.

1805
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,540
- Come out.
- Come out.

1806
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,440
Let's do it again.
Jae Suk should go there.

1807
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,040
We'll make a dream team.

1808
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:26,150
- I should be in.
- Yes.

1809
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,150
I'll be in.

1810
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:29,190
- "Bite the bullet, the best..."
- Suk Jin.

1811
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:31,560
Is this a dream team?

1812
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,960
He suddenly gave me
the one I didn't know.

1813
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,060
We'll try with a dream team.

1814
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,650
Do you get how good I was earlier?

1815
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:38,670
I mean...

1816
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:41,870
He kept giving others short ones.
But he gave me a long one.

1817
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:45,040
- Look. "All noise" was long.
- Yes.

1818
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,940
- The "experience" one was long too.
- What?

1819
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:49,210
Give me something like
"Bite the bullet." Something simple.

1820
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:50,710
Or give us four-character idioms.

1821
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:52,040
- Four-character idioms.
- Four-character idioms.

1822
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,600
No. It's more difficult.

1823
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,020
- Four-character idioms.
- So if I give you two characters...

1824
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,480
Say the first two.

1825
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,710
He said
he would give us the last two.

1826
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,150
The one you suggested is harder.
It gives you a mental breakdown.

1827
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:01,350
No. Give me the first two.

1828
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:02,350
Give us the last two.

1829
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:03,380
"The relation between friends."

1830
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,850
- No.
- "The partnership between friends."

1831
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:06,380
- "The partnership between friends."
- "The relation between friends."

1832
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,380
- It's "Faith should reign over."
- "Faith should reign over."

1833
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,730
"Faith should reign
over the relation between friends."

1834
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:10,460
- Here I go.
- Yes. It's four-character idioms.

1835
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,670
- Will you give us the last 2?
- I'll say the last 2 characters.

1836
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:12,960
Okay. Good.

1837
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:14,230
That feeds you.

1838
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:16,230
- Bite the hand that feeds you.
- Yes.

1839
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,290
I know this one.

1840
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:20,730
- I know this one.
- Isn't it much better?

1841
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:22,400
- We have a good chance.
- I know it.

1842
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,000
Do it lightly, roughly. Relax.

1843
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,650
- Talk.
- Sweet.

1844
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,540
- I know it.
- Let's go.

1845
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,250
- Oh, no.
- Old Man.

1846
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,940
You know old sayings.

1847
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,540
He learned it at a village school.

1848
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:35,960
Yes.
He learned it at a village school.

1849
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,120
I learned it at a village school.

1850
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,150
Talker.

1851
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:39,750
- Faith should reign over.
- It's "smooth."

1852
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:40,920
(Incorrect)

1853
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,960
(Faith should reign
over the talker.)

1854
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,330
- It's "smooth talker."
- "Smooth talker."

1855
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,190
- Incorrect.
- It's over.

1856
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:48,230
It's a relief that it was over
before my turn.

1857
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:49,460
This is weird.

1858
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,940
It's a relief that he got it wrong
before my turn.

1859
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,230
This is...

1860
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:54,270
It's "smooth talker," Se Chan.

1861
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:56,830
- I've heard of it.
- "He's a smooth talker."

1862
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:58,480
You should give us three chances.

1863
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,040
- Give us three chances.
- Just once.

1864
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,350
The last one. Come here, So Min.

1865
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:02,480
Starting from So Min...

1866
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,120
- Four-character idioms are...
- Yes. Start from So Min.

1867
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,190
- We did four-character idioms once.
- Start from So Min.

1868
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,440
- I'll start from here.
- Okay.

1869
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,750
"Smooth talker." Gosh.

1870
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,750
If you three guess it right,
we'll do it too no matter what.

1871
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,020
- No matter what.
- I'll take it slow.

1872
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,630
- It was because I was in a hurry.
- We know many idioms.

1873
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,100
- We learned them in childhood.
- Yes.

1874
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,230
- Here I go.
- It's simple.

1875
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:18,270
Strong outside.

1876
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,060
- Soft inside.
- Good.

1877
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,270
By the skin of his teeth.

1878
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:25,230
(By the skin of his teeth.)

1879
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:27,230
- By the skin of his teeth?
- It's "He escaped death."

1880
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:29,040
- It's "He escaped death."
- By the skin of his teeth?

1881
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,440
(Jong Kook failed again.)

1882
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,350
- Hey.
- "He escaped death."

1883
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,150
- "He escaped death."
- "He escaped death."

1884
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,150
- Escaped, death.
- Escaped, death.

1885
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:39,210
This is the only thing
I didn't know.

1886
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:40,350
It's "He escaped death
by the skin of his teeth."

1887
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:41,440
- "He escaped death."
- For real.

1888
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:42,750
Even I knew it.

1889
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,480
"He escaped death
by the skin of his teeth."

1890
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,850
Let's do this with the four of us.

1891
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:48,750
- Was it an idiom?
- "He escaped death."

1892
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:49,920
"He escaped death
by the skin of his teeth."

1893
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,920
He's unexpectedly bad.

1894
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,100
Unexpectedly bad.

1895
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,670
I'm not lying.
I knew everything except for this.

1896
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:55,870
We have the last chance.

1897
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:59,210
Gosh, I can't tell him off
because it's his house.

1898
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:00,600
- Should we start from here?
- Yes.

1899
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,630
We have one last chance.

1900
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:02,830
Buddy.

1901
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:04,100
A bosom.

1902
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:05,350
- I knew it.
- A bosom buddy.

1903
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:06,750
What? You know it
because you heard my answer.

1904
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:07,980
Vow.

1905
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:08,980
(Vow.)

1906
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,150
Horse...

1907
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,150
- Isn't it "wedding vow?"
- "Wedding."

1908
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,250
(Horse?)

1909
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,710
He made a wedding vow
and still got it wrong.

1910
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:18,580
- What's with "horse?"
- You made a wedding vow.

1911
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,350
What's with "horse?"

1912
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:23,730
It's so strange. I know
all the idioms given to others.

1913
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:25,230
I know "wedding vow."

1914
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:27,060
- You...
- I couldn't think of it.

1915
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,040
- What's with "horse?"
- I know the idioms given to others.

1916
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,560
- "Horse vow?"
- This is strange.

1917
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,710
- "Horse vow?"
- What's with "horse?"

1918
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,170
This is hard.

1919
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:36,600
I gave you ten chances. You failed.

1920
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,350
Goodness gracious.

1921
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:40,650
- We can't do it.
- This isn't easy.

1922
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:41,920
I wanted to give the money
to Jong Kook.

1923
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,380
Can you give us one more chance?

1924
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,540
You know we all got it wrong
at least once, right?

1925
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,750
- Yes.
- Oh, no.

1926
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:49,650
What if I guess five questions right
by myself for 500 dollars?

1927
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:51,060
- You?
- Five questions by myself.

1928
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,080
- You?
- Five questions.

1929
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,650
- Five questions by myself.
- Why are you so confident?

1930
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:55,060
- Let's go.
- I'll go.

1931
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,290
Didn't you get many questions wrong?

1932
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:57,830
Let's go. Cheer me up.

1933
00:58:57,830 --> 00:58:59,290
- You got this.
- You got this.

1934
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:01,130
- You can do it.
- Four-character idioms only?

1935
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:02,600
Four-character idioms only. Okay.

1936
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:04,270
Give him five questions in a row.
Let's see how many he gets wrong.

1937
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:05,830
There's no penalty
for the wrong answer though.

1938
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,460
What?
I'll let you slap me in the face.

1939
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,000
Okay.

1940
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,830
By who? Hyo Im?

1941
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:11,850
(Hyo Im, the main writer?)

1942
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:13,650
- Okay.
- That's good.

1943
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:14,750
Getting slapped in the face
by Hyo Im.

1944
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,750
- That's good.
- It'd be comfortable for Hyo Im...

1945
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,920
- when she's not on camera.
- Film her arm only.

1946
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,850
- It's to make her comfortable.
- Yes.

1947
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,150
It's a penalty.

1948
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:24,750
- Here I go.
- It's stressing me out.

1949
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,080
(It's stressing her out
in the meantime.)

1950
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,960
- A hard place.
- Between a rock and a hard place.

1951
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,750
- It's good.
- Well done.

1952
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,060
The second question.

1953
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:33,770
Into rage.

1954
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:35,130
Into rage?

1955
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,830
- It's that one.
- Incorrect.

1956
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:38,730
- "Fly."
- It's "fly into rage."

1957
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:39,960
- Incorrect.
- "Fly."

1958
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,960
(Everyone flew "into rage.")

1959
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,630
Even I knew it. "Fly into rage."

1960
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:44,330
Hey.

1961
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,710
It's "Fly into rage."

1962
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:47,250
You got the really easy one wrong.

1963
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,920
- I'll get slapped.
- Go ahead.

1964
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,520
I will get slapped
behind the camera.

1965
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,920
It's okay if we only hear the sound.

1966
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,020
Hyo Im, come here.

1967
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,480
- Slap him properly.
- He needs to get slapped.

1968
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,150
For your anonymity,

1969
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:57,520
- we will use a tight shot.
- Use a tight shot.

1970
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,580
- Hyo Im, slap him properly.
- Slap me.

1971
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:01,130
- Slap him hard.
- Only your hand will appear.

1972
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:03,460
You are carrying out a penalty.
I asked for this.

1973
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:05,730
Don't feel guilty.

1974
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,400
- Slap him twice.
- Oh, no.

1975
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,460
(A light slap)

1976
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:10,770
- You slapped too gently.
- She slapped too gently.

59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,269
- Hyo Im, you slapped too gently.
- You slapped too gently.

1977
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:14,270
- Come on.
- Hyo Im,

1978
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:15,710
- you should have done this.
- Slap me harder.

1979
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:17,040
- Slap him harder.
- Do it, Hyo Im.

1980
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,350
- Carry out the penalty properly.
- Slap him hard.

1981
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:20,250
That wasn't bad.

1982
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:23,710
- She doesn't have much strength.
- Okay.

1983
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:25,710
- Let me try it. I will go first.
- Five questions.

1984
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:27,040
- Five questions.
- The house owner will go first.

1985
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:28,520
It should be a hard slap.

1986
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,190
- I will make up for my mistake.
- Okay.

1987
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:32,880
All the easy questions are gone.

1988
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,230
Why can't I remember anything
when I am answering the questions?

1989
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:36,500
Let me relax first. Hold on.

1990
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:38,370
- Relax.
- I will relax.

1991
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:40,170
- This is nothing.
- The first question.

1992
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,400
- Let's say that you are answering.
- That's a good idea.

1993
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,500
The first question.

1994
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:45,830
- The better.
- The more, the better.

1995
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:48,100
- Okay.
- That was an easy one.

1996
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,440
The second question.

1997
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,170
Are the best.

1998
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:52,380
Local products are the best.

1999
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,150
- That was a hard one.
- I know.

2000
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,350
- You are answering.
- Good.

2001
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,710
- Can't you do better?
- His mental control is incredible.

2002
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,250
Think that I am answering.

2003
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:02,420
- The third question.
- I think he will succeed.

2004
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:05,730
Can't be hidden.

2005
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:07,480
Talent can't be hidden.

2006
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,730
- Talent can't be hidden.
- Okay.

2007
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:10,230
I didn't hear it.

2008
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:12,400
- I swear I didn't hear it.
- He swears.

2009
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,330
- I swear I didn't hear it.
- I didn't say anything.

2010
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:15,370
I swear it.

2011
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:17,190
- I heard it too.
- Punish me if it's a lie.

2012
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:19,400
- You can bet your future, right?
- Punish me if it's a lie.

2013
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,560
- I didn't hear anything.
- It was a difficult one.

2014
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,730
- He knows the idiom.
- I swear it.

2015
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:23,710
I understand, but you get a warning.

2016
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:24,830
- Okay.
- Okay.

2017
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:25,980
- Seriously.
- We didn't hear it.

2018
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:26,980
I swear I didn't hear it.

2019
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,350
He swears.

2020
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:29,770
- He usually doesn't do that.
- Right now,

2021
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,120
- Jae Suk is answering.
- Okay.

2022
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:33,150
- Only 2 questions remain. Let's go.
- Only 2 questions remain.

2023
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,190
(Two questions remain.)

2024
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,310
Of visitors.

2025
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,210
- A constant stream of visitors.
- Good.

2026
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:38,980
- It was easy.
- Give him an easy one.

2027
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,190
One question remains.

2028
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:41,290
(Will Jong Kook be able to succeed?)

2029
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:42,420
No gain.

2030
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:54,630
No gain.

2031
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:56,550
No gain.

2032
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:57,780
- No pain, no gain.
- Yes!

2033
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:58,780
(No pain, no gain.)

2034
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,180
- You got 500 dollars.
- You got 500 dollars.

2035
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,380
The answers come easily...

2036
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:04,150
when you think they are
someone else's questions.

2037
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:05,950
- Good job.
- I could succeed...

2038
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:08,090
- because I expanded the realm.
- Good job.

2039
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,450
- You sweated so much.
- Feel his palm.

2040
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:10,630
Jong Kook sweated so much.

2041
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,720
Hey, my palms...

2042
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,300
He sweated so much.

2043
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:16,990
Suk Jin should go next.

2044
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:18,760
(Suk Jin gives it a try
for additional 500 dollars!)

2045
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,840
Jong Kook.

2046
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,470
- I am sorry. I will cross my legs.
- Think widely.

2047
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:23,760
- Let's say we aren't filming.
- That's a good idea.

2048
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:25,430
- The first question.
- Okay.

2049
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:27,630
- High horse.
- Beating a dead horse.

2050
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,200
(Incorrect)

2051
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,410
Oh, it's
"Getting on your high horse."

2052
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,180
- High horse.
- Beating a dead horse.

2053
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,450
(Getting on your high horse)

2054
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,780
Oh, it's
"Getting on your high horse."

2055
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,740
(He proudly yelled,
"Beating a dead horse.")

2056
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,180
For goodness' sake.

2057
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:40,280
- Come on.
- I mean...

2058
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,320
Who will do it?

2059
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,490
- Hyo Im?
- Get slapped.

2060
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:43,720
I thought it was
"Beating a dead horse."

2061
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:45,490
- You made it confusing.
- It's a different idiom.

2062
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:47,130
Why did you give a different idiom?

2063
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,260
For a second,

2064
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:49,530
- I was like, "What?"
- Getting on your high horse.

2065
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:50,570
- "Why did Bo Pil say..."
- I said it.

2066
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:51,930
- "the latter words?"
- Beating a dead horse.

2067
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:52,930
The answer was
"Getting on your high horse."

2068
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:54,200
I thought you made a mistake.

2069
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,510
- Hurry up.
- Do it.

2070
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,970
- It's okay, Hyo In. Slap me.
- Slap him.

2071
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:58,630
Do it.

2072
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,050
(He doesn't need
to be slapped again.)

2073
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:03,910
That was good, Hyo In.

2074
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:04,970
(The satisfactory slap
makes the customer happy.)

2075
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:06,110
Hey.

2076
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:07,470
- That was fun.
- That was good.

2077
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:08,680
- Say that you are okay.
- What?

2078
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:09,910
Say that you are okay.

2079
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,820
I'm okay.

2080
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:13,050
She slapped me hard.

2081
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:14,820
- It's nice.
- It was what we wanted.

2082
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:16,760
- Getting slapped by the crew.
- It's nice, right?

2083
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,300
- You know,
- We should do it often.

2084
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,220
I thought you made a mistake.

2085
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,490
You said, "High horse..."

2086
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:22,720
and I said, "Beating a dead horse."

2087
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,400
Why don't we make So Min answer
three questions?

2088
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:26,840
- I will do it for a finger flick.
- A finger flick.

2089
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,260
- Who will carry out the penalty?
- Se Chan.

2090
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:29,660
No.

2091
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:31,130
I won't do this.
I will do this instead.

2092
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:32,470
- No.
- Then it won't hurt much.

2093
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,200
I want...

2094
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,680
the camera director to do it.

2095
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:37,070
Really?

2096
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:39,650
- He can be scary.
- Okay.

2097
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:41,780
Hit her hard.
Otherwise, it won't be funny.

2098
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:42,950
Let's begin.

2099
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:45,180
Okay. I am not answering.

2100
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,860
- You are answering.
- Se Chan is answering.

2101
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:48,490
You are answering, So Min. It's you.

2102
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:49,590
Focus. It's you.

2103
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:50,930
- Focus.
- The first question.

2104
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,320
Focus. It's you.

2105
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:54,090
- It will be great if you succeed.
- Answer right away.

2106
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:55,490
- That's right.
- Focus.

2107
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:57,070
- Stop it.
- Focus. It's you.

2108
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:58,400
- It's you, So Min.
- Come on.

2109
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,130
- The first question.
- Okay.

2110
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,400
Sit up straight.

2111
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,340
The dumps.

2112
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:05,930
(Hesitating)

2113
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:08,030
- Incorrect.
- Down in the dumps.

2114
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:09,380
Down in the dumps.

2115
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,280
- For goodness' sake.
- So Min, it was a hard one.

2116
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,510
- Down in the dumps.
- It wasn't a hard one.

2117
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:15,090
It was a hard one.
I didn't know the answer either.

2118
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,680
We are currently down in the dumps.

2119
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,820
What? Do you think you failed
because of me?

2120
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:20,990
What did I do?

2121
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,320
- It was an easy one.
- Come on.

2122
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,220
(The owner of the house loves
watching people receive penalties.)

2123
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:26,260
For goodness' sake.

2124
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,050
Only your hand will appear
in the shot.

2125
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:29,260
Okay.

2126
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,360
(Yes!)

2127
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:35,740
(The older members
smile from ear to ear.)

2128
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:37,160
I told you that I would do it.

2129
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,430
Hurry up and say that you are okay.

2130
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:40,970
- I am okay.
- You are okay, right?

2131
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,050
- It's okay
- I am okay.

2132
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:44,910
- Everything will be fine
- Everything will be fine

2133
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:46,220
- That was great.
- Down in the dumps.

2134
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,510
Down in the dumps.

2135
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:50,180
- Did your chest turn sweaty?
- Where?

2136
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,010
- It's sweat.
- I sweated.

2137
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:53,410
- He was nervous.
- I sweated.

2138
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,720
He sweated because of the idioms.

2139
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,360
The idioms made Jong Kook sweat.

2140
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,660
I relaxed my body,

2141
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,400
but this area was tense.

2142
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,070
You wouldn't need to do
aerobic exercise today.

2143
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:05,300
- Idioms can replace it.
- Seriously.

2144
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,240
Idioms can replace aerobic exercise.

2145
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:08,570
I thought you were relaxed.

2146
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:10,070
- It's no joke.
- Only your face relaxed.

2147
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:11,200
- Only my face.
- His palms were so sweaty.

2148
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,200
So sweaty.

2149
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,010
My palms were sweaty.

2150
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:16,070
- Se Chan, give it a try.
- Three questions.

2151
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:17,680
- Give it a try.
- I will get slapped.

2152
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:19,510
- Ah Reum will do it.
- That's a good idea.

2153
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:21,450
- She is the type to go crazy.
- Seriously.

2154
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,780
She is the type to go crazy.

2155
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,090
- Ah Reum is a bit crazy.
- That's right.

2156
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:26,260
(She is known to be a crazy writer.)

2157
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,510
Go slowly.

2158
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:29,050
- Give me the ones I have heard of.
- It's your question. Focus.

2159
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,220
- The ones I have heard of.
- It's your question. Focus.

2160
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:31,820
- The ones I have heard of.
- Let's begin.

2161
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:33,550
- Open your ears like this.
- The first question.

2162
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:34,700
All right.

2163
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:36,630
Like son.

2164
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,490
Run about like son.

2165
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:41,570
(Run about like son)

2166
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,530
Like father, like son.

2167
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:45,180
Like father, like son.

2168
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:46,800
(The comedian who specializes
in idioms made people laugh again.)

2169
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,110
- Hey, what was that?
- Like father, like son.

2170
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,700
- It's "Run about in confusion."
- Run about in confusion.

2171
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:51,820
My goodness.

2172
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:54,650
- Like father, like son.
- Se Chan.

2173
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,490
- It was the easiest one.
- Hey.

2174
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:59,380
Why did you do that?
Why did you give such an easy one?

2175
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:01,180
- It was the easiest one.
- Get slapped.

2176
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,660
I knew the answer.

2177
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:04,490
- When it isn't my question...
- Slap hard.

2178
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:05,590
(Slapping)

2179
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:07,820
I am okay.

2180
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:13,260
- "Run about like son" was funny.
- All right. Let's wait for food.

2181
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,990
- That was funny.
- Run about like son.

2182
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:17,510
You got 500 dollars.

2183
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:19,630
- All right.
- We did well.

2184
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:21,570
That was funny. Thank goodness.

2185
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:24,150
- My stress level went up again.
- Let's see.

2186
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:25,340
(So Min)

2187
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:26,550
Mine went up, right?

2188
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:27,740
Mine went up.

2189
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:30,240
Shall we have a quiz
so that it skyrockets?

2190
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,490
Mine is 77 again.

2191
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,160
Yours is so high.

2192
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:35,780
- Look. It's 77.
- Why do you get so stressed out?

2193
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,280
Mine is 41.

2194
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,930
- Mine is 58.
- Why is mine so high? It's 77.

2195
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:40,200
Isn't it wrong?

2196
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,530
I am under constant stress.

2197
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:42,660
It's correct.

2198
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:45,070
You are in the situation
that puts you under constant stress.

2199
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:48,760
Look at the color
of Jong Kook's clothes.

2200
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,430
- They are so dull.
- They are so dark.

2201
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:53,570
All of them are black and gray.

2202
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,130
- He can do that...
- I live alone.

2203
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:57,680
- because he lives alone.
- It's convenient.

2204
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,110
You rarely discard things.

2205
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:01,570
I rarely discard things.
That's why I don't buy things.

2206
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:04,010
- You don't discard people either.
- No, I don't.

2207
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,450
Why do you keep doing that
to Jong Kook?

2208
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:09,430
- Why do you keep doing that?
- It's not like that.

2209
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:10,720
- Hey.
- Seriously.

2210
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:12,220
Why do you keep doing that?

2211
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:14,090
Why are you showing interest
in Jong Kook?

2212
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:15,590
- I was just asking.
- Do you think he is yours?

2213
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:17,030
- No.
- You think all men are yours.

2214
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:18,530
Are you struggling with work
these days?

2215
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,160
- Are you?
- So Min is ridiculous.

2216
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,340
You keep testing Jong Kook.

2217
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:25,070
If you aren't careful,

2218
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:27,130
bloody fights will break out
among the cast members.

2219
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,700
I was just asking.

2220
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,150
Se Chan, do you discard people?

2221
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,470
Why would I discard people?

2222
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,380
I don't do that.

2223
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:35,550
For goodness' sake.

2224
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:37,320
You do that.

2225
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,360
You discarded Se Chan.

2226
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,590
You discarded him.

2227
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:41,720
- You discarded him.
- She did that right away.

2228
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,090
(They can do anything to be funny.)

2229
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,090
- Gosh, So Min.
- How about you?

2230
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:46,720
I don't discard people.

2231
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,430
Suk Jin, stay out of this.

2232
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:49,470
I mean...

2233
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:52,240
- Suk Jin, stay out of this.
- Suk Jin.

2234
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,840
The moment you butt in,
this entire bit will get edited out.

2235
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,840
Don't be like that.

2236
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,360
- Stay out of this.
- Don't do that.

2237
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,360
- Stay out of this.
- Why would I butt in?

2238
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:00,470
- They are here.
- They are here.

2239
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:02,150
They are here.

2240
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,840
- Open the door.
- Open the door.

2241
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:06,720
- For goodness' sake.
- Did they open the door?

2242
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:08,220
- Open the door.
- Welcome back.

2243
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,380
- What took you so long?
- They brought back coffee.

2244
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:11,880
- Was the cafe far away?
- It's so damp.

2245
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,950
It's damp outside.

2246
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:14,180
- Is it hot?
- It's like a sauna.

2247
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,880
- Is it hot?
- Thank you.

2248
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,780
Thank you. We will enjoy it.

2249
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:20,550
- Thank you.
- Great.

2250
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,090
You bought a lot.

2251
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:23,300
- What is this?
- Good job.

2252
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,590
My goodness.

2253
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:27,070
I am exhausted.

2254
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,300
- My legs hurt.
- I am exhausted too.

2255
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,660
Gosh, my shin.

2256
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:33,200
(His legs became weak in one day.)

2257
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,650
Going outside
increased my stress level.

2258
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:38,920
- Really?
- It's no joke outside.

2259
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,210
- It's so hot.
- Is it that hot outside?

2260
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:42,880
- We exercised too.
- That's right.

2261
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:44,750
- We did squats.
- You are right.

2262
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:45,960
That's right.

2263
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,620
Think about how healthy you would be
if you do that much every day.

2264
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:50,160
Think about it.

2265
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,960
Being outside was better.

2266
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:53,590
Seriously.

2267
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:56,400
- They acquired 500 dollars.
- We played a game.

2268
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,420
- What did you do?
- Haha.

2269
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,400
- You would have never succeeded.
- You would have never succeeded.

2270
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,460
Why? What was the game?

2271
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:02,240
- It was hard.
- Idioms and proverbs.

2272
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,040
- It was really hard.
- It's true.

2273
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:05,630
There's no way you succeeded.
You sat out, right?

2274
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:07,970
- I participated.
- Do you know any proverbs?

2275
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:09,540
- What do you know?
- What?

2276
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:10,950
Proverbs that are common knowledge.

2277
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:12,970
- It's so hot outside.
- Is it that hot?

2278
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:14,650
- It's humid.
- It's very humid.

2279
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:16,490
It's the rainy season.

2280
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:19,050
I am going to Jeju Island
during the rainy season.

2281
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:21,120
It will begin raining there tonight.

2282
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,460
(Suk Jin will go to Jeju Island
when it's raining heavily.)

2283
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:25,960
I didn't think of that
when I planned the vacation.

2284
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,120
(Uninterested)

2285
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,570
- Good job.
- It will rain the day I arrive.

2286
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:31,370
- That's nice. It suits you.
- My goodness.

2287
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:35,370
You are trying to stress him out.

2288
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:37,040
Which places will you visit
on Jeju Island?

2289
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,430
On Jeju Island?
I will just stay in a hotel.

2290
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:41,870
Then you should stay here.
What's the use of going there?

2291
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:44,080
I see that you have begun.

2292
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:45,970
Seriously.

2293
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:46,970
(He pretends to be unfazed.)

2294
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:48,370
Think about it.

2295
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:49,650
Suk Jin is flustered.

2296
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:50,820
I won't get stressed out.

2297
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:52,420
- Think about it.
- I know it's your strategy.

2298
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:54,050
I won't get stressed out.

2299
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:57,250
- I mean...
- Suk Jin makes this gesture...

2300
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:59,590
- when it's an emergency.
- I won't get stressed out.

2301
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:01,960
- I won't get stressed out.
- It has begun.

2302
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,830
- Still...
- There are nice hotels here.

2303
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:06,740
But the atmosphere
is different there.

2304
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:10,800
- Let's begin the next mission.
- Okay.

2305
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,410
In the next mission,

2306
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:16,110
a single decision
will bring delight or frustration.

2307
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,450
It's the Perfect Touch.

2308
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:19,780
The Perfect Touch.

2309
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:23,650
All members will receive
a Pirate Roulette.

2310
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:24,710
What then?

2311
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:28,080
- Insert as many swords as you want.
- It will be hard.

2312
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,120
The team needs to insert
a total of 25 swords.

2313
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,290
Okay. I got it.

2314
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:34,200
- All right.
- Insert 3 to 4 swords.

2315
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,030
Let's relax and enjoy the game.
We earned some money anyway.

2316
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:38,200
- Insert 3 to 4 swords.
- Yes.

2317
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,430
We earned some money.

2318
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:41,130
- I don't have high expectations.
- I can insert ten swords.

2319
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:44,130
If you think the pirate will pop up,
leave it to the next person.

2320
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:45,580
- All right.
- The next person can take over.

2321
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:46,670
But the moment a pirate pops up,

2322
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:47,800
- it's over.
- Okay.

2323
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,910
Let's not blame anyone who fails.

2324
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:50,970
We won't do that.

2325
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:52,250
Don't blame anyone.

2326
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:53,250
Okay.

2327
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,320
Let's not blame anyone who fails.

2328
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,490
Let's not do that.

2329
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,880
Why don't we insert one sword each?

2330
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,080
- Yes.
- Go.

2331
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,120
There you go.

2332
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,250
Why did you put on sunglasses?

2333
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,250
They were laying around.

2334
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,330
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

2335
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:05,330
- While you were gone...
- Hold on.

2336
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:07,400
- I am not trying to start trouble.
- Okay.

2337
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,460
So Min kept showing interest
in Jong Kook.

2338
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:10,590
I will insert two swords.

2339
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,590
(She receives the news.)

2340
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:17,210
- I can keep going, right?
- Hey, don't change the subject.

2341
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:18,830
- I will insert another one.
- Don't change the subject.

2342
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:21,040
- Insert three swords.
- She is holding a sword.

2343
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,610
- Will you be okay?
- Hurry up.

2344
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:23,780
- Will you be okay?
- Hey.

2345
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,950
- Stop.
- Three swords.

2346
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:26,650
- Are you going to be like that?
- Good job.

2347
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:28,510
- I am done.
- You changed the subject.

2348
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,750
Okay. I get it now.

2349
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:31,880
- Shall I start?
- Yes.

2350
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,050
Someone needs to insert
three more swords.

2351
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:35,160
It doesn't pop up that easily.

2352
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,160
Why do I think
this slot will make it pop up?

2353
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,860
- Then choose another slot.
- The next one.

2354
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:40,960
Don't do it. You have a good hunch.

2355
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,370
- Choose the next slot.
- Which one? This one?

2356
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:43,700
- Yes.
- What if it's this one?

2357
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:45,400
It might be this one.

2358
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,960
Then go to the other side.

2359
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,430
I will insert it into the slot
I originally chose.

2360
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:49,830
(Remaining number)

2361
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:51,040
- It was a safe one.
- One more?

2362
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,240
- But...
- I am done.

2363
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,280
Really?

2364
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,210
Although Jong Kook has
muscular arms, he goes...

2365
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:58,280
(Trembling)

2366
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,750
"What should I do?"

2367
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,320
- His palms get sweaty.
- I felt like it would pop up.

2368
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,120
- His chest gets sweaty.
- I felt like it would pop up.

2369
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,420
No blaming others.

2370
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:06,490
For goodness' sake.

2371
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:08,120
I inserted it. I am done.

2372
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,490
(Remaining number)

2373
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:12,250
- Everyone is timid.
- Ji Hyo, insert some swords.

2374
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:13,720
- Ji Hyo, insert more swords.
- I think it will pop up.

2375
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,220
- Again?
- Insert more swords, Se Chan.

2376
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:16,400
- I am done.
- But...

2377
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,200
- My goodness.
- Good job.

2378
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:22,260
- Stop now, Ji Hyo.
- Stop now.

2379
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:23,800
- Stop now, Ji Hyo.
- Hey.

2380
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,370
- Stop now.
- Stop now, Ji Hyo.

2381
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:26,610
Okay.

2382
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:27,610
(She inserted 3 swords.)

2383
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,710
Why do I feel like it would pop up?

2384
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:31,410
Please.

2385
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:33,470
- Stop.
- Stop.

2386
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:34,820
Let's make a round first.

2387
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:36,840
- Someone like me...
- I am glad you stopped.

2388
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:40,180
(Remaining number)

2389
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,180
Isn't it the one behind?

2390
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:43,490
(Jae Suk succeeded
to insert one sword.)

2391
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:44,660
Shall I stop?

2392
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,000
How many slots are there? Eight?

2393
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,160
What's the remaining number now?

2394
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,160
Three.

2395
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:49,760
- Three.
- Insert all the swords.

2396
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,090
- Hold on. All the swords?
- Yes.

2397
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:52,570
How many swords will you insert?

2398
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:56,000
(The remaining number is 14.)

2399
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,610
- All the swords?
- How many swords will you insert?

2400
01:12:57,610 --> 01:12:58,670
Hey.

2401
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,500
- Jae Suk.
- You failed.

2402
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,780
- How many swords will you insert?
- Hey.

2403
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:04,000
(A pirate escaped.)

2404
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:07,210
(The mission ends
in the speed of light.)

2405
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:08,250
For goodness' sake.

2406
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,250
- Why did you do that?
- I told you to stop.

2407
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:11,540
Why did you do that?

2408
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:13,210
The first two attempts were good.

2409
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:14,490
It ended so quickly.

2410
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:16,720
- I mean...
- Why did you keep going?

2411
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:18,960
- You should have asked us.
- The first two attempts were good.

2412
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,360
Why did you act on your own?

2413
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,620
I thought the third attempt
would be the same.

2414
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,000
You were too confident.

2415
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,370
- I inserted four swords.
- You failed.

2416
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:27,540
I thought the third attempt
would be the same.

2417
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:28,960
- Five swords.
- No blaming others.

2418
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,000
You should have asked us.

2419
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,710
All right. You failed
to acquire 500 dollars.

2420
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:36,450
Let's move on to the next mission.

2421
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:37,910
- Jae Suk.
- For goodness' sake.

2422
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:39,870
Whatever.

2423
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:43,620
This place is so stressful.

2424
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:45,320
This place is so stressful.

2425
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:46,880
This is a pit.

2426
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,860
We have to get out.
Let's do the escape room.

2427
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:52,080
- That's the only hope.
- We have to get out.

2428
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,330
I want to go home.

2429
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:54,960
I want to hurry up and leave.

2430
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,790
- I am stressed out.
- Seriously.

2431
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:59,630
For the first time ever,
I want to go home and babysit.

2432
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:02,330
- It's time for the last mission.
- Okay.

2433
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:03,370
Let's do it.

2434
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:05,930
- When I give you a word,
- A word?

2435
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:08,670
change the 1st letter
of the 1st and 2nd syllables...

2436
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:10,000
in three seconds.

2437
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,410
- What do you mean?
- Let me give you an example.

2438
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:14,420
If the word is Yoo Jae Suk,
say, "Ju Yae Seok."

2439
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,620
- This is hard.
- Can we use any words?

2440
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:17,340
- No.
- I will give you a word.

2441
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:19,250
- Y and J got switched.
- The first letters.

2442
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:20,320
- Yes.
- This is hard.

2443
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,960
- If it's Ji Suk Jin,
- Yang Se Chan.

2444
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,180
the answer is See Jeok Jin.

2445
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,530
- Kang Je Chan.
- Sang...

2446
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:27,220
- Sang.
- Y and S.

2447
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:28,900
- Y and S.
- You follow the order.

2448
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,070
(Switch the first letters
of the first 2 syllables.)

2449
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,830
- Let me tell you this in advance.
- Sang Ye Chan.

2450
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:33,370
I can't do this.

2451
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:34,790
- Try it.
- Sang Ye Chan.

2452
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:36,800
- Try it for Song Ji Hyo.
- Song Ji Hyo.

2453
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,610
- Jong Si Hyo.
- Ji Suk Jin.

2454
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:40,740
Let's begin. Only 4 out of 7 people
need to succeed.

2455
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:41,740
That's good.

2456
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:42,840
- Who wants to go first?
- That end.

2457
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,750
Let's stay calm.

2458
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:46,250
- All right.
- All right.

2459
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,510
Only four people need to succeed.

2460
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:49,320
- It's time for aerobic exercise.
- Stay calm.

2461
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,040
- Jong Kook.
- He will do aerobic exercise.

2462
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,040
(It's time for Jong Kook
to do aerobic exercise.)

2463
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,580
- It will be like aerobic exercise.
- Se Chan.

2464
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:55,750
- Give Jong Kook a towel.
- He is sweating already.

2465
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:58,080
- He is sweating already.
- Stay calm.

2466
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,750
- Stay calm.
- Let's begin.

2467
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,220
This is like aerobic exercise
for him.

2468
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:02,420
Who will go first?

2469
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:03,720
- We will start from this end.
- Okay.

2470
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:07,540
Rhinoceros.

2471
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:08,830
(Rhinoceros)

2472
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:10,930
Nhiroceros.

2473
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:12,630
- That's correct.
- Nhiroceros is correct.

2474
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:15,000
- You did well.
- You did well.

2475
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,500
You are good at things
that don't require knowledge.

2476
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,580
Seriously.

2477
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,450
This is a matter of association.

2478
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:21,580
- A matter of what?
- Association.

2479
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:23,340
You did well, So Min.

2480
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:24,420
Let's go.

2481
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:27,180
- Here it comes.
- Don't say it quickly. Go slowly.

2482
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:29,620
Kang Ho Dong.

2483
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:32,960
Hang Kong Hok Dong.

2484
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,920
(Incorrect)

2485
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:35,960
Hang Ko Dong.

2486
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,760
- One person succeeded so far.
- This is hard.

2487
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,040
This requires imagination.

2488
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,900
- Let's begin.
- Then it's "Ttaengkkong bug."

2489
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,170
No, it isn't.

2490
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:44,430
Susaek Station.

2491
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:45,500
(Susaek Station)

2492
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,240
- Sosaek... No.
- It's the same.

2493
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,740
- It's just Susaek Station.
- Susaek Station.

2494
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:50,450
- Sosaek... No.
- It's the same.

2495
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:52,780
(It's just Susaek Station!)

2496
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,250
- It's Susaek Station.
- Susaek Station.

2497
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:56,010
It's just Susaek Station.

2498
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,290
Are you stupid?

2499
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:58,950
That fool.

2500
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:00,660
(He laughs due to embarrassment.)

2501
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:02,420
- You didn't have to change it.
- It's just Susaek Station.

2502
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:03,550
S and S.

2503
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,790
- Se Chan.
- I ended up going,

2504
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:07,220
"Sosaek..."

2505
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:09,590
- Se Chan.
- S and S.

2506
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:11,260
It's okay.
Just grow up into a nice man.

2507
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,240
- Se Chan.
- I also thought, "Susaek?"

2508
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,290
"What is it?"

2509
01:16:14,290 --> 01:16:15,910
Susaek Station. That's right.
The first letters are the same.

2510
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:17,800
- Gosh.
- This is impossible.

2511
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:18,830
Is it Ji Hyo's turn?

2512
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,410
- I am ready.
- All right.

2513
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:21,540
Okay.

2514
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,110
- Do well.

2515
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:26,080

2516
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,710
The second part is Kim.

2517
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,420
- Kim.
- Ikeok Kim Jeong.

2518
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:30,710
She said it so seriously.

2519
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:31,950
- Kim.
- Kim...

2520
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:34,660
All three of us need to succeed.

2521
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:36,550
All three of us need to succeed.

2522
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:37,620
- That was funny.
- Go.

2523
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:39,120
- Go.
- Let's do this, married men.

2524
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,220
- Focus.
- Married men!

2525
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:41,860
Focus.

2526
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,090
Here it comes.

2527
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:45,720
Swallowtail butterfly.

2528
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,930
(Swallowtail butterfly)

2529
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:49,170
- It's over.
- Lwalsowtail butterfly.

2530
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:50,210
- Incorrect.
- Come on.

2531
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,430
- It's too late.
- Lwalsowtail butterfly.

2532
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:52,910
- Lwalsowtail butterfly.
- Lwalsowtail butterfly.

2533
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:54,130
- It's too late.
- Let me off this once.

2534
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:55,580

2537
01:16:58,340 --> 01:16:59,840
- It's a bezzer-butter.
- It was too late.

2538
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,450
- It was too late.
- You mean "A buzzer-beater."

2539
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:02,820
"A bezzer-butter?"

2540
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:04,840
- Even I got it right.
- A buzzer-beater.

2541
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:07,180
The first attempt failed.

2542
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:09,920
- Haha will begin now.
- It's the second attempt.

2543
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,830
- I will give you three attempts.
- Jae Suk needs to try it.

2544
01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:13,500
It's hard when you actually do it.

2545
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,590
That's right.

2546
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,420
Jo Biden.

2547
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:18,920
Three, two...

2548
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,240

01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,610
- This one was easy.
- I know.

2552
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:26,610
- Bo Jiden.
- For goodness' sake.

2553
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:28,710
- Let's see how well you do.
- Watch.

2554
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,450
- Watch.
- It's hard when you actually do it.

2555
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:31,500
I will succeed right away.

2556
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,580
Let's begin.

2557
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:34,820
- Jeong Yak Yong.
- What?

2558
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:36,380
Jeong Yak...

2559
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:37,420
(Jeong Yak Yong)

2560
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:39,360
(What?)

2561
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,120
Don't do that.

2562
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:42,580
- All right.
- You are buying time.

2563
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:44,160
- All right.
- Why did you answer?

2564
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,290
- All right. I will do it properly.
- Why did you go, "What?"

2565
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:48,420
- Why did you go, "What?"
- "What?"

2566
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:49,570
- Why did you do that?
- Hey.

2567
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:51,090
It's Yeong Jak Yong.

2568
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:52,290
It's late.

2569
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:53,760
It's Yeong Jak Yong.
Let's start over.

2570
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,540
- All right.
- You need to answer right away.

2571
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:57,800
- All right. Don't worry.
- He did it to buy time.

2572
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,110
Don't worry.

2573
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,670
Ji Hyo, you should study.

2574
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:03,280
- I am studying now.
- Here it comes.

2575
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,580
Bring it on.

2576
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:06,150
Han Seok Kyu.

2577
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:07,920
Han Seok Kyu. Well...

2578
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,120
Incorrect.

2579
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,150
(Han Seok Kyu!)

2580
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:12,420
(Well...)

2581
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:14,820
- San...
- San Heok Kyu.

2582
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:17,180
You said "incorrect" too quickly.

2583
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:18,830
You used up time by talking.

2584
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:20,830
- You said it too quickly.
- San Heok Kyu.

2585
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:22,960
- For goodness' sake.
- Okay. Did we fail?

2586
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,200
- Ji Hyo.
- Okay.

2587
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,260
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

2588
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:27,790
Fried shrimp.

2589
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:28,900
Two, one.

2590
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,410
Sried fried.

2591
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:31,540
- Incorrect.
- "Sried fried?"

2592
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,040
- Sried fhrimp.
- Sried fhrimp.

2593
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,630
- It was an easy one.
- It was an easy one.

2594
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:36,910
Song Ji Hyo.

2595
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:38,650
- Go.
- Two...

2596
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:40,120
Jong So...

2597
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,620
- Jong So Hyo.
- Incorrect.

2598
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:44,010
- This is hard.
- This is hard.

2599
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:45,340
- Three-syllable words are easy.
- Incorrect.

2600
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:46,580
This game is hard.

2601
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:48,880
- This game is hard.
- They stress us out...

2602
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,920
and measure our stress levels.
It's annoying.

2603
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,290
It's difficult.

2604
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:53,620
It's at 79.

2605
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:55,830
This is getting stressful.

2606
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:57,960
- This is stressful.
- This is difficult.

2607
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,590
- It's hard.
- This game gives me so much stress.

2608
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:02,830
- It's...
- All missions are over.

2609
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:06,040
- I have the final result.
- Okay.

2610
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:08,500
The person with the biggest
difference doesn't place last.

2611
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,000
- That's not how it works.
- No.

2612
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,450
It seems So Min had a lot of stress.

2613
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,970
- First, it's Jae Suk.
- Yes.

2614
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:17,210
- You were at 40 in the beginning.
- At 40.

2615
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:18,950
- You dropped to 41.
- In the end,

2616
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:19,990
you were at 42.

2617
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:21,250
Okay.

2618
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:23,220
- You're on the list.
- You're on the list.

2619
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:25,160
Forty means there's barely anything.

2620
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,030
- Next is Suk Jin.
- You still went up.

2621
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:29,500
You were at 36. In the end,

2622
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,120
it was at 63.

2623
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:33,130
- That's high.
- How can you escape?

2624
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:35,170
The fact you thought
you could escape...

2625
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:37,670
Haha. You started at 56.

2626
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:38,910
It ended at 61.

2627
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:39,970
(Haha becomes a penalty candidate.)

2628
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:41,130
- You're also on the list.
- I knew it.

2629
01:19:41,130 --> 01:19:42,500
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes.

2630
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,950
- You started at 42.
- At 42.

2631
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,670
- It ended at 52.
- That's high.

2632
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:48,420
- She was under a lot of stress.
- It's the four of us.

2633
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:49,490
You started at 45.

2634
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,750
- It was low.
- It was low.

2635
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:51,790
Forty eight.

2636
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:52,820
It ended at 43.

2637
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:53,990
(Se Chan avoids the penalty.)

2638
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:55,320
- That was close.
- No stress.

2639
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,920
So Min. You started at 48.

2640
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,160
- Eighty six.
- Fifty two.

2641
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,920
It ended at 47.

2642
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,050
(So Min avoids the penalty.)

2643
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:03,090
(So Min and Se Chan avoid
the penalty.)

2644
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:04,330
- You dropped?
- She dropped.

2645
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:06,500
So, these four are up
for the penalty.

2646
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,740
- Okay.
- Good.

2647
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:09,710
This is too much.

2648
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:11,610
It'll be one of you four.

2649
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:15,040
- Gosh. Excuse me.
- It's always me.

2650
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,650
- You should give them out.
- Jong Kook. You distribute them.

2651
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:18,540
- Okay.
- You should distribute them.

2652
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:21,320
I had a penalty recently.

2653
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,040
- I know.
- But he doesn't know.

2654
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,250
- Right.
- He doesn't know what it is.

2655
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:25,710
- You don't know, do you?
- No.

2656
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:27,160
Go.

2657
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,180
Here.

2658
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:29,720
Gosh.

2659
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,250
Thank you in advance, Jong Kook.

2660
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:32,830
- You bet.
- Thank you, Jong Kook.

2661
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:34,620
Thank you in advance, Jong Kook.

2662
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:35,860
You bet, Jae Suk.

2663
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:37,170
- Shall we open it one by one?
- Okay.

2664
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:39,070
- Okay.
- Let's open it one by one.

2665
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:40,500
Go.

2666
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,760
- Just relax.
- One, two, three.

2667
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,930
(If it says penalty, the person
has to receive the penalty.)

2668
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:44,110
No, it's not her.

2669
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:45,960
- You should do it.
- No, it's not her.

2670
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:47,830
- It's not her.
- See? It's not her.

2671
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:49,240
- It wasn't Ji Hyo.
- Gosh.

2672
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:50,500
Right?

2673
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,250
- I hope it's Suk Jin.
- He's going to Jeju Island.

2674
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:53,250
Suk Jin.

2675
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:56,510
(Suk Jin also avoids the penalty.)

2676
01:20:57,490 --> 01:20:59,210
Not again.

2677
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:01,490
- It's them again.
- You should switch.

2678
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:02,880
- It's "How Do You Play?"
- It's these two again.

2679
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,860
- Jae Suk.
- I'm not switching.

2680
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:08,530
(They remained to the end again.)

2681
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,120
- Jae Suk.
- I'm not switching.

2682
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,760
- There must be something.
- One.

2683
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:12,930
You should switch.

2684
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:15,500
- No.
- There must be something.

2685
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,000
It's always those two.

2686
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,170
I was right.

2687
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:21,870
(Jae Suk gets the penalty.)

2688
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:25,970
(Jae Suk gets the penalty again.)

2689
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:29,680
(Everyone is laughing.)

2690
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:31,950
I had no idea.

2691
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,790
- He didn't know.
- I didn't know.

2692
01:21:33,790 --> 01:21:35,880
Jae Suk got the penalty
two weeks in a row.

2693
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,990
He's getting the penalty every time.

2694
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:39,920
That's amazing.

2695
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,030
How is this possible?

2696
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:43,170
You should get an exorcism.

2697
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:44,620
- Jae Suk.
- You should do that.

2698
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:46,240
Before I announce the penalty,

2699
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,900
here's the housewarming party gift
you won.

2700
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:50,430
Congratulations.

2701
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:52,430
- He did it.
- I'm not sure if I deserve it.

2702
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:54,430
You deserve it.

2703
01:21:54,430 --> 01:21:57,170
It's not easy to film at home.

2704
01:21:57,170 --> 01:21:59,300
- Thank you.
- Not everyone...

2705
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:01,470
- reveals their house.
- Right.

2706
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:03,250
- Right.
- This means a lot.

2707
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:06,660
We'll donate the rest
to a good place.

2708
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:09,460
Here's today's penalty.

2709
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:12,330
You were under
a lot of stress today.

2710
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:15,220
To relieve your stress,

2711
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:18,220
you have to sing alone
in the coin karaoke.

2712
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:19,830
(Sing three songs
in the coin karaoke alone.)

2713
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:22,170
(He gets to go
to the coin karaoke alone.)

2714
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:23,630
- Bye.
- Bye.

2715
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:25,240
Goodbye.

2716
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:26,240
(Other guests get ready to go home.)

2717
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:28,970
(Jae Suk happens
to hate it so much.)

2718
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:31,040
I don't know if I deserve this gift.

2719
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:35,840
(Coin karaoke?)

2720
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,510
Jae Suk.
I'll take that for 50 dollars.

2721
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:39,860
(Jae Suk.
I'll take that for 50 dollars.)

2722
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:40,860
(She suggests trading the penalty.)

2723
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:41,920
I'll do that for 50 dollars.

2724
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,860
So Min.

2725
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,790
Good. I'll pay you.

2726
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:46,860
- For 50 dollars.
- For 50 dollars.

2727
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:47,860
- Fifty?
- Fifty.

2728
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:49,120
- Really?
- For fifty.

2729
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,030
- Hang on. Sixty?
- So Min. Raise the price.

2730
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:52,870
- Fifty.
- Call 100.

2731
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:55,900
You should call 100. It's Jae Suk.

2732
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:57,430
- Sixty.
- Sixty. Okay.

2733
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:59,040
- You'll do it?
- Yes.

2734
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,040
Thank you so much.

2735
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:02,080
I hate singing alone in the karaoke.

2736
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,950
- I love it.
- Really?

2737
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:05,450
This is great.

2738
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:07,840
So Min. This is great.
I'll send you 60 dollars now.

2739
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,120
I'll allow that trade
only for today.

2740
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,210
- Okay.
- Okay.

2741
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:13,680
Now, that's all for
Jong Kook's housewarming party.

2742
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:16,380
- What should I sing?
- Thank you.

2743
01:23:16,830 --> 01:23:17,920
- Thank you.
- It was successful.

2744
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,790
That was neat.

2745
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:23,830
Thank you, So Min.
I'll give you 60 dollars now.

2746
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:25,960
- Of course. It's fun.
- Good work.

2747
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,760
- Good work.
- First,

2748
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,500
I'll sing Fin.K.L.

2749
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,610
(To start with)

2750
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:32,830
I don't know recent songs.

2751
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:36,580
Fin.K.L and...
I actually prefer ballad.

2752
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:40,150
So I'm going to sing mostly ballad.

2753
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:42,820
Come in. It's so spacious
for a coin karaoke.

2754
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:44,820
Then I'll start.

2755
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:45,820
(Then I'll start.)

2756
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,680
It's Cameraman Bong Jo's request.

2757
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:51,830
(Her cameraman requested "Dash.")

2758
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:53,050
(Getting ready to dance)

2759
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:55,900
I used to know this dance,
but I forgot now.

2760
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,830
(Come on.)

2761
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:04,500
(The cheesy girl's
extraordinary dance)

2762
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:18,490
(The ghost wave)

2763
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:23,860
(She ignores the tone and beat.)

2764
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,030
There's only Young Chul's version.

2765
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:32,220
This is really fun.
You should jump with me.

2766
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:36,070
(Ring)

2767
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:38,240
(Forced to dance)

2768
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:41,870
(She enjoys the beat alone.)

2769
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:44,150
(Bouncing)

2770
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:46,370
(I'm your girl.)

2771
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:50,210
(The retro style dancer
dominates the small room.)

2772
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:53,210
(It's all heated up.)

2773
01:24:53,210 --> 01:24:56,250
(I'm your girl.)

2774
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:15,610
(The dance balladeer mixes air
in her voice.)

2775
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:19,780
(I want to seduce you tonight.)

2776
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:25,620
(So Min already sang
more than three songs.)

2777
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:30,380
(She adds emotions that
no one told her to do.)

2778
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:34,530
(The production crew is flustered
as it gets long.)

2779
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:37,420
(Balladeer Jeon forgot
about going home.)

2780
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:40,900
(Some crew end up joining
Jeon So Min Show.)

2781
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,170
Say, I'm a fool.

2782
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,500
- I'm a fool
- Okay.

2783
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,240
Se Chan!

2784
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:47,330
(Se Chan!)

2785
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:50,450
This song is for Se Chan.

2786
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:53,170
("Pride" by Fin.K.L)

2787
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:55,580
(A song for a foolish man who
doesn't understand the girl's heart)

2788
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:02,820
(As So Min isn't likely to stop...)

2789
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:07,120
Where are you going?
Keep filming me.

2790
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:10,620
(The penalty deputy enjoyed
the penalty so much.)

2791
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:12,920
That's so high.
What should I sing next?

2792
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:14,430
Something fast.

2793
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:16,870
Our encounter

2794
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:20,970
(To X Generation Running Man...)

2795
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:23,540
(and the old man KCM,)

2796
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:24,870
(MZ Generation pays a visit.)

2797
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:26,080
(Park Cho Rong, Yoon Bo Mi)

2798
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:27,950
(Mirani)

2799
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,790
(A class on MZ's hip...)

2800
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:31,150
(to overcome the generation gap)

2801
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,540
(Learn...)

2802
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:33,550
(the hip gesture.)

2803
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:34,550
(You look like you're cold, So Min.)

2804
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:35,550
(Enjoy...)

2805
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:37,050
(the hip restaurants.)

2806
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:40,500
(Will we...)

2807
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,530
(be able to become hip?)

2808
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:43,590
I'm getting sick of you.

2809
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:44,760
It's funny because that's so lowly.

2810
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,240
(At that moment)

2811
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:50,760
(You'd even eat poo
if people say it's hip.)

2812
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:51,760
It's more shocking
when the AI says it.

2813
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,800
(Will you conquer the hip...)

2814
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,450
(or be conquered by it?)

2815
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,840
(War of Spoon)
