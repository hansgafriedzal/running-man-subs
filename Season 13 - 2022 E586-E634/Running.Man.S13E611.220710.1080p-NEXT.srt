1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:06,530
What happened to your clothes?

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,570
- Hello.
- Hi.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,300
They're nice.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,300
(Jong Kook's ready.)

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,030
- Why are you so early?
- What?

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,810
Why are you here already?

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,600
I had something in the morning.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,600
What's up with your clothes?

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,540
You're wearing dress shoes.

10
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,540
What's going on?

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,080
To kick you.

12
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,110
(Running away)

13
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,110
I'm scared.

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,490
Let's get ready for the shoot.

15
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,380
- Let's get ready.
- Did you get bitten?

16
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,650
Isn't it nice?

17
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,860
You look cute.
You lost so much weight.

18
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,400
How can you spit all the way here?

19
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,120
I'm sorry.
Because I have a protruding mouth.

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,030
You lost so much weight.

21
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,330
I was talking to Se Chan,
and he spit on me.

22
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,540
It's amazing. It's unbelievable.

23
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,260
We were talking, and he spit on me.

24
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,140
I'm sorry.
I have a protruding mouth.

25
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,180
My mouth is in good condition today.

26
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,400
Did you want to call dibs on me
that badly?

27
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,280
Seriously. No matter how far we are.

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,720
How did I spit all the way there?

29
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,650
I saw the show yesterday.
We were very close.

30
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,650
Did you know...

31
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,480
- I watched it too.
- your hat matched my hairband?

32
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,580
Really?

33
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,930
(Matching green clothes)

34
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,360
(They also had a hug to celebrate
which only couples do.)

35
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,020
You hugged me...

36
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,100
like we were dating.

37
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,410
I was surprised to see that too.

38
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,630
In fact, you were doing this.

39
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,570
She was that happy to win.

40
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,740
She hugged me like
I was her boyfriend.

41
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,550
I worked out yesterday.

42
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,010
Yesterday?

43
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,380
- You texted me yesterday.
- The stairs? Okay.

44
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,240
You have to go lower...

45
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,320
to use your hip muscles
and hamstrings.

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,080
It rather feels heavy.

47
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,580
I'll teach you later.

48
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,300
- Jong Kook. The shoot has begun.
- What?

49
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,400
- The shoot has begun.
- Already?

50
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,900
It has?

51
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,770
- Already?
- You should've told me.

52
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,830
Are the cameras rolling?

53
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,330
What's taking them so long?
Tell them to hurry up.

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,460
He was sitting like this
for too long.

55
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,770
Jong Kook.

56
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,300
- I was...
- You were like this the whole time.

57
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,010
I thought it was a calendar shoot.

58
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,510
A personal conversation.

59
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,910
What are you wearing?

60
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,210
- What?
- I asked the same question.

61
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,910
A celebrity should dress nicely.

62
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,490
- Haha. Your sunglasses are...
- He has something today.

63
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,290
Haha.
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

64
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,030
He's trying to look cool.

65
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,190
If he takes them off...

66
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,920
From some point on,
you stress me out.

67
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,000
Why?

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,190
She nags at me now.

69
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,730
- Why?
- The camera must've captured it.

70
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,940
When I look at you, you're like...

71
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,100
(What are you looking at?)

72
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,780
I used to do that.

73
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,840
She does that to me.

74
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,880
When I saw your head,
I wanted to try it.

75
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,250
- Hey.
- No, Ji Hyo.

76
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,380
- Ji Hyo.
- Anything but this.

77
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,880
- She'd really do it.
- Just wear a wig.

78
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,250
- Wear a wig instead.
- That's wrong.

79
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,250
- Don't go this far.
- Not this.

80
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,660
I support your hairstyle,
but that's gone too far.

81
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,980
- If you want to try it,
- I want to try it.

82
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,420
- you should join a movie.
- Wear a wig instead.

83
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,630
What's taking Suk Jin so long?

84
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,560
What's wrong with him?
Why is he late?

85
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,290
Because he forgot where he started.

86
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,570
Can you video call him?

87
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,840
I'll video call him.

88
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
(Jae Suk video calls Suk Jin.)

89
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,660
- No.
- But it's true.

90
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,760
He's not picking up.

91
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,440
He noticed it.

92
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,310
He noticed it?

93
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,170
- Is he in the elevator? No.
- I think he's in the restroom.

94
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,350
He'd still answer it.

95
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,880
He's never late,
but he's late today.

96
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,010
Suk Jin is full of himself now.

97
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,380
- Yes.
- He's...

98
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,090
- in the early stage.
- This is...

99
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,910
Nothing else explains it,
but that he's full of himself.

100
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,980
He's in the early stage.

101
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,920
The manager is nervous,
but the celeb is like, "It's fine."

102
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,030
"I'm supposed
to be five minutes late."

103
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,160
That's how it begins.

104
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,500
You can see through this shirt.

105
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,030
What are you doing?

106
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,630
I know.

107
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,630
- She touches him now.
- You can see it through.

108
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,510
- She doesn't hesitate.
- I can see my fingers through it.

109
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,570
- Still, don't put your fingers in.
- It's okay to see it through.

110
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,100
- Hey.
- That's wrong.

111
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,280
You can see my fingers.

112
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,380
- I mean,
- Ji Hyo's become bold.

113
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,970
- I love it.
- A shirt can be that thin.

114
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,440
- I'm a fan.
- What about his nipples?

115
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,380
You can't see them.
What are you talking about?

116
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,450
- The pockets make two layers.
- Don't take it too far.

117
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,380
When you act like that,
I don't want to join you.

118
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,880
- This is crazy.
- We were probably on the same page.

119
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,920
You have to show
that you don't like it.

120
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,370
Now that Ji Hyo is so aggressive,
I think it's time for me to move on.

121
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,720
- Are they breaking up?
- No.

122
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,040
I have to look for
another make-believe relationship.

123
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,630
We better try harder.

124
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,510
- We must work hard.
- But he's not interested in us.

125
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,340
You're...

126
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,440
I'm sorry.

127
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,440
(They're not his concern.)

128
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,070
I'm sorry, but I'm not interested
in your relationship.

129
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,170
We need one more person.

130
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,880
What do you think about
Se Chan making moves on me?

131
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,070
I was like, "Hey."

132
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,910
- He's...
- We will...

133
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,250
- No.
- That's not it.

134
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,190
When you do that, you look pitiful.

135
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,210
I see.

136
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,380
- If you do that,
- When I do that?

137
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,430
you look pitiful.

138
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,560
Why isn't he picking up?

139
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,020
He's in the restroom.

140
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,190
He has the mic on.

141
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,130
- Does he have the mic on?
- How could he go to the restroom...

142
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,130
with the mic on?

143
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,670
If he goes to the restroom with
the mic on, it records everything.

144
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,130
But no matter how much he tries,
nothing records.

145
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,260
- Really?
- Yes.

146
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,570
- No matter how much he strains,
- There's nothing to record.

147
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,010
there's no sound whatsoever.

148
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,480
He's weak. He's here.
The star is here.

149
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,550
- Hello.
- Suk Jin.

150
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,710
You were supposed to be here
by 9:30 a.m.

151
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,120
- You're late.
- Why didn't you tie your shirt?

152
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
Why did you cut your clothes?

153
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,440
- Is that hanbok?
- Wear your clothes properly.

154
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,750
- What's going on?
- He's wearing new clothes.

155
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,760
You're not supposed to tie them.

156
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,360
- Where do I sit?
- You know nothing about fashion.

157
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,080
- You can sit here.
- Just stand up.

158
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,880
- Stand up.
- Sit here.

159
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,730
- Sit here.
- It's been a while.

160
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,630
- Sit here.
- That stings.

161
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,930
- You can sit here.
- Move aside.

162
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,570
You were supposed to be here
by 9:30 a.m. Why are you late?

163
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,940
I was waiting in the car.

164
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,740
- What? I didn't see you.
- There was no place to wait.

165
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,570
- I parked my car somewhere else.
- Suk Jin.

166
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,200
You already got criticized
by viewers.

167
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
- It's okay now.
- Because I'm late?

168
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,750
- Tell them not to curse at you.
- From the beginning.

169
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,480
That's not it. Dear viewers.
It's not that I'm late. They're early.

170
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,070
- "Dear viewers."
- They got here early.

171
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,120
He's fighting with them now.

172
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
- "Dear viewers?"
- Don't curse at me please.

173
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,650
- I love it.
- Me too.

174
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,490
- "Don't curse at me."
- I mean...

175
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,930
"Don't yell at me."

176
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,080
I mean, they got here early.

177
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,630
- It's true that we got here early,
- But you were late.

178
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,020
but you were a bit late,
and the camera rolled early.

179
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,800
- Right.
- It was already rolling.

180
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,130
All those conditions made
people blame you.

181
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,830
- But...
- If you apologize, it'll be over.

182
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,130
- I was waiting.
- You have no choice.

183
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,530
- If you apologize, it's over.
- You have to apologize first.

184
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,130
- But I did nothing wrong.
- If you weren't...

185
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,750
If you weren't late,
it would've been fine.

186
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,440
- But you were late a bit.
- You have no choice.

187
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,710
- Apologize first.
- I'm not late.

188
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,480
- It was 9:30 a.m.
- You should've been here by then.

189
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,750
- What time is it?
- The call was...

190
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,710
- We had to standby at 10 a.m.
- Yes.

191
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,510
- The shoot begins at 10 a.m.
- It's still 9:59 a.m.

192
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,230
You were supposed to be here
by 9:30 a.m,

193
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,820
- but you weren't here.
- The call was at 9:50 a.m.

194
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,520
Fine. Is it over if I apologize?

195
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,520
Yes.

196
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,650
Ask for their forgiveness.

197
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,190
"Don't blame me. I'm sorry."

198
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,190
You won't blame me, right?

199
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,940
From the start?

200
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,000
That's how misunderstanding begins.

201
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,670
That's how it begins.

202
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,700
Something happened lately.

203
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,440
Jong Kook and So Min made...

204
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,250
- a YouTube clip together.
- On MBTI.

205
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,640
- MBTI?
- He checked his.

206
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,210
In the clip,

207
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,490
he said...

208
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,490
we manipulated the soccer scene.

209
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,950
Don't be ridiculous.
It wasn't manipulated.

210
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,280
- How was that manipulated?
- I think...

211
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,150
Let's be honest.
The shoot was manipulated.

212
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,630
Do you agree?

213
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,570
Think about it. I never said...

214
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,170
I was good at soccer
on Running Man before.

215
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,890
I never said I was good.

216
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,830
I always say I'm not bad.

217
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,400
- How can we manipulate it?
- Jong Kook.

218
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,030
You thought it was so unfair.

219
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,750
You played soccer on "My Little Old Boy."

220
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,880
- I was good on "My Little Old Boy."
- You were very good.

221
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,680
When I was shooting "My Little Old Boy."

222
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,120
there were some women watching us.

223
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,380
They all said this,
including the judge.

224
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,820
I shot Running Man the week before.

225
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,580
They said, "That was manipulated."

226
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,080
What are you talking about?

227
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,360
It wasn't manipulated.

228
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,860
Look.

229
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,870
Bad and good aren't
the only expressions.

230
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,930
- What else is there?
- What?

231
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,390
That I'm not bad.

232
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,630
- I'm not that good.
- Good job.

233
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,170
- There are various expressions.
- That's...

234
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,240
very positive.

235
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,460
- Why do you always say...
- He's making a concession.

236
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,400
I'm bad or I'm terrible?

237
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,110
- So people think I'm terrible.
- You may not be terrible.

238
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,010
But it's also nice
when I go play soccer.

239
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,510
People think I'm terrible,

240
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,710
so if I do well even for a bit,

241
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,050
they say, "You're very good."

242
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,210
(You're very good.)

243
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,650
"You're not that bad."

244
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,990
Everyone says that.

245
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,060
They're surprised.

246
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,360
It's good because they don't have
high expectations of me.

247
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,890
We say Jong Kook is terrible...

248
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,360
because compared to his passion
for soccer...

249
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,930
- and the amount of time he spends,
- So,

250
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,440
you should I'm not that good
compared to my passion.

251
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,240
- Don't just say he's terrible.
- Right.

252
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,940
Exactly.

253
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,460
- When it comes to soccer...
- I know.

254
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,940
- When it's about soccer...
- He's so sensitive...

255
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,400
- when it's about him.
- You get too sensitive.

256
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,700
Jong Kook.

257
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,770
(Glaring)

258
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,750
He goes crazy when it's about him.

259
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,420
Haha. Look here.

260
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,440
Don't turn your head that way.

261
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,450
- Everyone.
- Yes.

262
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,190
We have two teams...

263
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,150
who are coming back this summer.

264
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,450
- Two teams?
- Are there two?

265
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,300
I hear Jong Kook is releasing
a new song.

266
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,020
I know one.
I got the text yesterday.

267
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,760
It's Jong Kook and KCM.

268
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,940
- Kang Chang Mo.
- There are...

269
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,370
- KCM.
- two people who are coming back.

270
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,170
Let's bring them in.

271
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,680
- Who is it?
- Please come out.

272
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,130
- I hear high heels.
- Hello.

273
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,570
Chorong.

274
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,760
- Chorong.
- Hello.

275
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,100
(Bomi and Chorong of Apink)

276
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,570
- Bomi.
- Bomi.

277
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,760
They're Apink.

278
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,430
(Chorong and Bomi of Apink
are debuting as a unit.)

279
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,610
Are they our guests today?

280
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,900
Bomi. You lost so much weight.

281
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,210
You lost so much weight.

282
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,850
- You...
- What's going on?

283
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,640
Long time no see.

284
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,640
- We'll say hello. In 1, 2, 3.
- They created a new unit.

285
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,750
- Hello. We're from Apink.
- Hello. We're from Apink.

286
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,220
- Chorong.
- Bomi.

287
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,880
- We're ChoBom.
- Bom.

288
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,620
What was that?

289
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,250
- We're ChoBom.
- Bom.

290
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,280
- Do it again.
- Try it again.

291
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,860
- Do it again.
- Is it ChoBom?

292
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,250
We're still new.

293
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,700
- Do it again.
- Let's try that again.

294
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,230
- Hello. We're from Apink.
- Hello. We're from Apink.

295
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,740
- Chorong.
- Bomi.

296
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,260
- We're ChoBom.
- We're ChoBom.

297
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,500
- It's ChoBom.
- It's a new unit.

298
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,000
- It's a new unit?
- Yes.

299
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,170
Twelve years after our debut,

300
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,980
we debuted as ChoBom.

301
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,320
- We're in a live cafe today.
- Yes.

302
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,170
We misunderstood the theme.

303
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,280
You didn't know
you were singing live?

304
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,380
We thought we were performing
as we always do.

305
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,720
Did you think you were singing
with the AR on?

306
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,230
- You can do that.
- Do that then.

307
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,150
- Do that then.
- That's what we did.

308
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,390
- What?
- What?

309
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,020
But it's a live cafe.

310
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,740
Just do it then.

311
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,870
Our new song...

312
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,210
- hasn't been released yet.
- Really?

313
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,800
So we can only show it
to you briefly.

314
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,900
Is this the first time?

315
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,770
Yes. We're revealing it
for the first time on Running Man.

316
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,640
- Thank you.
- Let's do that.

317
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,140
- Good.
- We'll reveal it here.

318
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,450
(Revealing ChoBom's new song
for the first time)

319
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,540
- This is it.
- The new song.

320
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,360
- Is it ChoBom?
- ChoBom.

321
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,380
("Copycat" by ChoBom)

322
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,680
Come on.

323
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,330
(Cheering)

324
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,100
Come on.

325
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,500
(Men are excited.)

326
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,260
Come on.

327
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,740
- Good.
- Let's go.

328
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,880
(The key choreography is addictive.)

329
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,270
(Here's the bad example.)

330
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,990
(Cheering)

331
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,490
- Good.
- Good.

332
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,920
- They're stars.
- Good.

333
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,960
- Good.
- Good.

334
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,290
Stars. We have stars.

335
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,920
- They're stars from my town.
- ChoBom.

336
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,100
- Go, ChoBom.
- It was very nice.

337
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,240
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

338
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,470
I liked it.

339
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,500
The dance reminded me
of the tyrannosaurus.

340
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,900
Is it a cat?

341
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,930
- It's a cat.
- That was a cat?

342
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,610
- Because...
- I liked the dance.

343
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,710
It's a cat.

344
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,500
- We'll stop here.
- That was nice.

345
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,010
- Thank you.
- Have a seat here.

346
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,380
- Apink is pretty much...
- They're pretty.

347
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,680
- Our family.
- our family.

348
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,180
Right. They worked with us
many times before.

349
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,220
There's another performance.

350
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,490
- I know who this is.
- It's another special guest.

351
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,020
We already said it's KCM.

352
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,390
- I know who it is.
- We already talked about it.

353
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,700
- Hang on.
- Jong Kook is...

354
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,230
I need to change my voice
from talking to singing.

355
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,920
- Change your voice.
- The singer mode.

356
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,290
Jong Kook wears black pants...

357
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,760
- for weddings or...
- He's wearing dress shoes.

358
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,900
You're not wearing shorts.

359
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,930
- He had a reason.
- You're not wearing shorts.

360
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,300
- Because he has to sing.
- First,

361
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,240
let's bring in one of the duo.

362
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,880
- Duo?
- Duo?

363
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,170
- Duo?
- They sound like thieves.

364
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,910
Are they thieves? A thief duo?

365
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,250
Hey. They sound like robbers.

366
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,950
He's here.

367
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,280
- KCM.
- My Running Man.

368
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,550
- Dear brothers and sisters.
- Harmonica.

369
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,280
Maybe not sisters. Hellucca.

370
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,230
(Hellucca.)

371
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,360
- Jong Kook doesn't like it.
- I'm sick of it.

372
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,660
- I'm sick of it.
- Jong Kook.

373
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,730
- Jong Kook doesn't like it.
- He brought a harmonica with him.

374
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,260
He's too cheerful.

375
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,500
(Upbeat)

376
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,900
They look like two thugs
from the neighborhood.

377
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,240
Two thugs.

378
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,400
They look like thugs from a cartoon.

379
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,630
They look like two thugs...

380
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,400
singing together.

381
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,820
- I'm wearing a gold necklace.
- Hang on.

382
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,750
- A gold necklace?
- Do you have a name?

383
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,380
We don't have a name.

384
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,780
We just do it.

385
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,680
You should be Kook and Myun.

386
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,780
- Kook and Myun.
- That's a good idea.

387
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,860
- Kook and Myun is perfect.
- Kook and Myun.

388
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,520
That's a good one.
You should go with that.

389
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,000
- Kook and Myun.
- Kook and Myun.

390
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,470
I don't know if I can sing a ballad
in this mood.

391
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,890
You should go with Kook and Myun.

392
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,500
How about Soup and Noodles?

393
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,740
Stop it, Suk Jin.

394
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,340
Stop what?
That was the first thing I said.

395
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
You kept saying
Kook and Myun repeatedly.

396
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,130
Kook and Myun is perfect.

397
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,880
It's the global era.

398
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,170
- Go with Kook and Myun.
- I love this mood.

399
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,980
- It's a perfect duo.
- A duo.

400
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,380
- Right.
- It's hot in here.

401
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,580
- Will you tell us the title?
- They're unexpected.

402
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,640
They won't even tell us the title.

403
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,720
I've been waiting for these two.

404
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,010
- It's new.
- What's the title?

405
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,250
- "I Luv U".
- "I Luv U".

406
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,520
(We know it
From looking at each other)

407
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,550
Nice.

408
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,700
(I can never get enough of it)

409
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
- Good job.
- Nice.

410
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,710
They're perfect together.

411
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,160
They're perfect.

412
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,210
(The word we always say)

413
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,770
(I luv you)

414
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,640
I love you!

415
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,820
Come on.

416
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,040
(The thug duo sound sweeter
than they appear to be.)

417
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,830
- I love it.
- It's so nice.

418
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,920
(They already love the melody.)

419
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,390
(The first moment)

420
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,790
(We met)

421
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,000
- It's so sweet.
- It's sweet.

422
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,260
(Still excites me)

423
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,370
Kick him out.

424
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,130
(You know that feeling)

425
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,300
I like it.

426
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,450
(It feels perfect)

427
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,540
They're good.

428
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,450
(Like we're meant to be)

429
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,540
(We began like destiny)

430
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,750
Nice. I like it.

431
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,960
It's sweet.

432
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,020
(Since the moment I met you)

433
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,200
(All I think about)

434
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,470
I really like this song.

435
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,630
(Is you)

436
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:27,470
(I can see it from your eyes)

437
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,500
So Min.

438
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,630
(Laughing)

439
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,210
(She winks because she's excited.)

440
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,980
(The word we know without saying)

441
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:43,380
(The word we always say
I luv you)

442
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,460
(I luv you)

443
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,020
I love you.

444
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,460
(Sweet protein ensemble)

445
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,600
(Heart)

446
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,290
- They're good.
- Good.

447
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,930
- I like it.
- Good.

448
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,320
(The song reaches the climax.)

449
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,220
I want more!

450
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,450
(The word we know without saying)

451
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:21,750
(The word we always say
I luv you)

452
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,230
(Someone appears.)

453
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,330
Who's that?

454
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,520
Who's that?

455
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,630
- Mirani is here.
- That's Mirani.

456
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,340
- Who is she?
- She's Mirani.

457
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,300
(Rapper Mirani)

458
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,900
(You are my map on a hard day)

459
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,500
(I hope you say the same thing,
I get excited every day, baby)

460
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,580
(Please stay as you are)

461
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,350
(I like you more each day)

462
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,910
(Our love gets better)

463
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,220
(Mirani's rap part...)

464
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,180
(completed the two workout lovers'
mellow performance.)

465
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,380
(To me)

466
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,330
(You're the one who shines
the brightest in the world)

467
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,660
(The words)

468
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,390
(That I can say only to you)

469
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,160
- I love you!
- I love you!

470
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,870
(I love you!)

471
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,930
(I love you!)

472
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,900
I love this song.

473
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,770
(The song for those who wish
to fall in love this summer)

474
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,380
("I Luv U")

475
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,720
("I Luv U" by Kim Jong Kook and KCM
with Mirani)

476
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,380
- I love you!
- I love you!

477
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,360
- I love you!
- Jong Kook and KCM!

478
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,500
- I love you, Jong Kook and KCM!
- I love you!

479
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,550
- The duo!
- Thank you.

480
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,200
- The duo.
- Thank yucca.

481
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,000
- Duo, I love you!
- Jong Kook and KCM!

482
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,070
- That's an incredible song.
- I love you!

483
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,870
- It's amazing.
- I liked Mirani's part too.

484
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,970
- Thank you.
- That was amazing.

485
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,900
We should call them a trio,
not a duo.

486
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,930
- I really like their song.
- Oh, my.

487
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,480
- It's a great song.
- Indeed.

488
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,170
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

489
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,750
Can you put on that face
while shooting the show as well?

490
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,120
Right. Look at us with loving eyes
as you did while singing.

491
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,720
I was so embarrassed
to sing in front of you guys.

492
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,360
- He always feels that way.
- That's true.

493
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,150
Mirani,
can you perform your song as well?

494
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,150
- The song title is "VVS".
- "VVS"?

495
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,600
- Yes. I'll perform the song...
- You mean, the wheel brand?

496
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,420
- Pardon? A wheel brand?
- That's a famous brand.

497
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
- You don't know?
- What do you mean?

498
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,760
- The brand used to be popular.
- It's a wheel brand name.

499
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,000
- VVS.
- You don't know?

500
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,390
Only old people would know.

501
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,800
- I see.
- The popular wheel brand.

502
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,340
- A wheel brand.
- I see.

503
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,110
- It's understandable.
- Is it "You fool, I love you"?

504
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,240
"You fool, I love you"?

505
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,170
- You mean, does VVS stand for that?
- VVS?

506
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,580
- You guys...
- That's lame.

507
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,470
I see you're trying hard
to get to know her,

508
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,940
but you don't seem to know how to.

509
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,480
You're all approaching her
in such an old-fashioned way.

510
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,650
- Why would you do that?
- Hey.

511
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,910
- He's the worst of all.
- You're the most old-fashioned.

512
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,860
- Your hairstyle is old-fashioned.
- You're the worst.

513
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,950
- So are your sunglasses.
- Just talk to her naturally.

514
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,990
He thinks he's the hippest man
in the world.

515
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,990
Forget it.

516
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,370
Mirani is here as a guest
for one episode anyway.

517
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,430
- You're right.
- Yes.

518
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,270
- Thank you for trying.
- We're the hosts. That's all.

519
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,400
- Mirani.
- Yes?

520
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,660
- Yes?
- Perform "VVS" for us.

521
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,010
- Sure. I'll do that.
- Please, sing it for us.

522
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,310
- Shall I do it here?
- "VVS".

523
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,400
- Please go up on the stage.
- On the stage?

524
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,470
- Show us.
- I'm excited.

525
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,050
- It's a really famous song.
- Yes.

526
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,080
Okay.

527
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,080
- You look fabulous.
- Clap, everyone.

528
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,850
It's a great song.

529
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,360
(They chant
in an old-fashioned way.)

530
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,830
(They cheer in the wrong way
from the start.)

531
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,530
(I'm going to show you)

532
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,420
(To those who said I would fail)

533
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,420
(Hopping)

534
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,800
(Dancing)

535
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,270
That's hip hop.

536
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,630
(Mirani's trademark dance move)

537
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,780
(Shaking)

538
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,280
(Her shaking dance drew attention
as well as her song!)

539
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,560
This is exciting.

540
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,290
(Hey, new water, new VV,
I ditched work to be on this stage)

541
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,150
(My poverty shines in my lyrics)

542
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,560
She's so cute.

543
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,870
(They're all dancing to the rhythm
in their own ways.)

544
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,920
She's fabulous.

545
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,600
(I'm here to back-stab
the disgusting world)

546
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,870
(Scream louder, calling my name
Everyone gets surprised to see me)

547
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,400
(Mirani is on TV)

548
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,840
(Take off the tag
Get a new one, yeah, yeah)

549
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,970
Look at her.

550
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,970
(They try every dance move
they know to look hip.)

551
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,090
(She's giving
such a hip performance,)

552
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,150
(but the audience members can't
seem to keep up.)

553
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,180
(They don't know how to enjoy it.)

554
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,130
(Some don't know how to enjoy it
while others go overboard.)

555
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,390
Thank you.

556
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,270
(The old audience members
hit it off with one another though.)

557
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,930
- Awesome!
- Mirani!

558
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,430
(Mirani gave a great performance
in front of a difficult audience.)

559
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,340
- That was incredible.
- I'm impressed.

560
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,840
She was amazing.

561
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,010
- I really like this dance move.
- Exactly.

562
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,230
(They all pretend they enjoyed
her performance properly.)

563
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,850
(Mirani's signature shaking dance)

564
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,400
- Awesome.
- Impressive.

565
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,640
I saw Suk Jin checking
the water temperature.

566
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,320
(He checked the water temperature
before washing his hands.)

567
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,790
Suk Jin did it.

568
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,650
He checked the water temperature
while watching her performance.

569
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,420
(He wanted to be hip but just looked
like a man in the restroom.)

570
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,860
That's what should be called hip.

571
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,160
- "VVS" is the best.
- Right.

572
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,690
So Min, you seemed cold.

573
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,300
You were shivering like this.

574
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,730
- So Min does it too.
- She seemed cold.

575
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,460
- She had chills.
- Right, she had chills.

576
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,670
So Min had chills.

577
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,580
Why can't I do it as she does?

578
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,380
I looked around
during her performance.

579
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,740
Surprisingly, Chorong and Bomi
couldn't enjoy themselves.

580
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,410
- They didn't know what to do.
- I guess they've reached the age.

581
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,050
- Bomi was taken aback.
- You all seemed excited.

582
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,360
- They couldn't enjoy themselves.
- Oh, no.

583
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
And I saw KCM doing
such an old dance move.

584
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,420
- It was an old dance move.
- He looked like an old fossil.

585
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,800
- You looked like an old fossil.
- I saw him.

586
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,560
He started with a different move.
This is how he danced at first.

587
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,190
(One, two, three, and four)

588
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,270
- I didn't realize I was doing that.
- We all danced like that back then.

589
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,630
We did that move to any song.

590
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,690
I mean, it's such an old dance move.

591
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,270
- The combination of those two...
- I'm excited about them.

592
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,960
- We talked about it a lot before.
- Yes, we did.

593
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,780
- The masters of high notes.
- Their fans wanted this.

594
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,780
Actually, it began...

595
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,740
when "Do You Want to Hear My Voice?"
was released.

596
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,120
I had a chance to sing that song
with Jong Kook.

597
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,480
- Was the song for the two of you?
- Really?

598
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,790
- I had no idea. Yes?
- Songwriter Park Keun Tae...

599
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,910
- made the song for them.
- That's right.

600
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,920
- Did they hear the song too?
- But Suk Jin snatched it.

601
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,450
- Because he liked it so much?
- I went to see him.

602
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,450
He said he had made a song.
I asked him, right?

603
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,800
- Yes, you did.
- "Have you given it to Jong Kook?"

604
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,530
He said he hadn't.
So I said, "Then it's mine."

605
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,330
(- I haven't given it to him yet.
- Then it's mine.)

606
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,630
- He's greedy.
- You have an ear for music.

607
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,340
- Se Chan is right.
- He has an ear for music.

608
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,400
The song became a hit.

609
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,930
Which one of you convinced her
to collaborate with you?

610
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,700
- I bet it was KCM. I'm sure of it.
- It was KCM.

611
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,470
We were working on this song,
and I thought...

612
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,020
- Mirani would be perfect for it.
- Right.

613
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,910
So I contacted her right away...

614
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,380
- through her agency.
- Did you have her number?

615
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,980
- Of course.
- And Mirani...

616
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,380
- happily said yes and thanked us.
- Yes, I did.

617
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,380
- She willingly accepted the offer.
- Mirani made the right decision.

618
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,720
- This will make her famous.
- I'm happy.

619
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,560
What are you talking about?

620
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,570
- Mirani is really famous.
- Suk Jin, I'm sorry,

621
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,960
but she's more famous than you.

622
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,160
(Mirani wins.)

623
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,300
- Gosh, you.
- You made the right decision.

624
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,460
Mirani, if I were your manager,
I would've made you do it.

625
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,660
- I know. I'm so excited.
- Of course.

626
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,810
You should let more people know
about your rap skills.

627
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,670
She should release a diss track
against Suk Jin.

628
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,350
Haha is right.
You've crossed the line.

629
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,240
- Are you offended, Mirani?
- Not at all.

630
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,080
- Talk about this in your diss song.
- I'm happy.

631
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,710
- Ji Seuk Jin is the best.
- She called him Ji Seuk Jin.

632
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,980
(Ji Seuk Jin is the best.)

633
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,180
- Ji Seuk Jin.
- Nice.

634
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,650
- It's getting intense.
- Hey...

635
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,150
- Hey, Ji Seuk Jin.
- Ji Seok Sam!

636
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,390
- Ji Seuk Jin.
- I like her comment.

637
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,720
- Ji Seuk Jin...
- Ji Seuk Sam.

638
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,490
- I'm sorry.
- Hey...

639
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,490
"I'm getting started now."

640
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,370
- Ji Seuk Jin.
- Guys, stop it.

641
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,340
Suk Jin doesn't know
how to handle this situation.

642
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,700
- He's moving his hand like this.
- He doesn't know what to do.

643
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,880
- Suk Jin must be frustrated.
- Right.

644
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,900
Look at that weird pose.
He's moving his fingers like this.

645
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,580
What's with this pose?
What does it mean?

646
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,910
Doesn't it look so weird?

647
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,780
- Hey, let's move on already.
- Sorry?

648
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,980
- You've done enough.
- All right.

649
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,710
- Please move on.
- Okay.

650
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,680
I'll explain about today's race.

651
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,130
There are many popular restaurants
on social media...

652
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,420
- for the food or the atmosphere.
- That's right.

653
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,460
Do you guys often visit such places?

654
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,660
- No, we can't do that.
- No.

655
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,660
I never visited such places.

656
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,770
The hottest place I've visited was
Yeongdong Seolleongtang.

657
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,010
- That's a 40-year-old restaurant.
- Right.

658
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,610
That was the hottest place
I've been to.

659
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:54,010
We know that the members always
go to the same places.

660
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,400
- That's true.
- I go to the same places.

661
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,740
- The places I go to regularly.
- That's why today...

662
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,790
Since we have the guests
who are Generation MZ,

663
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,790
today's race will be held at places
that Generation MZ likes.

664
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,650
- Really?
- It's Spoon War Race.

665
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,450
- Spoon War Race?
- I think we'll have delicious food.

666
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,180
- I bet some of us won't get to eat.
- Today,

667
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,150
you will go to three restaurants
we've picked.

668
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,420
And you will be divided
into two teams.

669
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,600
- We'll be divided.
- Two teams?

670
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,030
But you will go all together.

671
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,100
You'll play a game,
and the winning team...

672
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,660
will enjoy the food.

673
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,610
The losing team should do something
in order to eat food.

674
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,630
- I knew it.
- Of course.

675
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,880
We'll tally each team's score
achieved in the missions.

676
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,910
The losing team will get a penalty.

677
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,620
- I see.
- We'll divide you into teams first.

678
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,360
KCM and Mirani are on one team.

679
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,560
- That's nice.
- Okay.

680
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,680
- Let's go!
- Chorong and Bomi...

681
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,130
- are on the other.
- Yes.

682
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,180
The four of them will play
a simple game...

683
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,130
and recruit the members 1 by 1.

684
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,420
- I'd be happy to join any team.
- Us against them?

685
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,190
- Both teams are great.
- Any team would be nice.

686
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,930
- I'll join Team ChoBom.
- All right.

687
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,630
Here's the game that they'll play.

688
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,200
The members played this game
last week.

689
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,380
Is it the drawing game?

690
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,170
I'll say the last two characters
of a Chinese idiom,

691
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,080
- and you say the 1st 2 characters.
- It's quite hard.

692
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,410
(Jae Suk got jintoeyangnan right.)

693
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,790
Jajeon.

694
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,860
(Wuwangjajeon?)

695
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,030
(Last week, the mission threw
the members into chaos.)

696
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,790
- Oh, you say the last characters?
- Since he says the last ones,

697
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,190
- It's difficult.
- it's hard to get a correct answer.

698
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,150
- Will they be okay?
- No, we won't.

699
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,570
- Are we doing it here?
- If you get it right,

700
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,870
- you can recruit a member.
- It's better to go first.

701
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,390
- We'll go first.
- You should... That's good, Bomi.

702
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,600
- It's better to go first.
- You can recruit a member.

703
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,930
(We'll go first.)

704
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,370
- Go for it.
- Okay, Bomi.

705
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,010
Chorong, you should go first.

706
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,730
- There's no way I'll get it right.
- I'm not confident.

707
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,670
Chorong, will you go first?
Let's begin.

708
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,740
(Chorong decided to go first
in the end.)

709
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,610
- Chorong is very smart.
- I can't believe you.

710
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,880
- Chorong is smart.
- Yes.

711
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,050
Bangga.

712
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,520
Bangga.

713
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,260
- Goseongbangga.
- Is it "goseong"? Goseongbangga.

714
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,320
(The answer is goseongbangga.
She failed.)

715
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,650
(Even the empty heads knew
the correct answer.)

716
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,450
- Hey, that was easy.
- It's goseongbangga.

717
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,030
- It's an easy question.
- It's goseongbangga.

718
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,220
- It was so easy.
- It's your turn now.

719
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,300
(Following Chorong who failed,
it's Mirani's turn.)

720
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,370
Cheonseon.

721
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,990
Jingak. What?

722
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,870
- It's "gaegwa".
- It's "gaegwa".

723
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,460
- He said the last two characters.
- Gaegwacheonseon.

724
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,230
- Oh, I get it.
- You say the 1st 2 characters.

725
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,630
- No wonder...
- Gosh, I knew the answer.

726
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,280
- But it was close, right?
- What a shame.

727
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,610
- Cheonseon.
- Next up is Bomi.

728
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,900
(It's Bomi's turn now.)

729
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,120
- Daneung.
- Dajae!

730
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,940
(The answer is dajaedaneung.)

731
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,290
(Bomi pulled it off!)

732
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,980
- That was too easy.
- Hey, I thought...

733
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,720
- It was difficult for her.
- No, it wasn't.

734
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,630
I thought you had passed
a national exam.

735
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,330
- Bomi did a great job.
- My gosh.

736
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,220
That was a difficult question.
I'm impressed.

737
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,990
I just realized... Hold on.

738
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,040
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

739
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,540
When she failed, you said,
"Well, that was a little difficult."

740
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,230
Didn't you get all the questions
wrong last week?

741
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,630
- I want to join their team.
- Okay.

742
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,110
- Now...
- It's difficult.

743
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,110
He's trying to impress them.

744
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,940
Now, please choose one member.

745
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,940
- Did we win?
- Yes.

746
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,740
- We choose Haha.
- That's great.

747
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,820
- Okay.
- Thank you, guys.

748
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,440
- He kept asking them to pick him.
- Next up is KCM.

749
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,290
- Yes.
- You've got this.

750
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,980
I don't want to join that team.

751
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,260
Cheomhwa.

752
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,760
- Geumsang.
- Geumsung.

753
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,130
- It's "geumsang".
- Cheomhwa.

754
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,560
(Geumsungcheomhwa?)

755
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,460
- Pardon?
- It's "geumsang".

756
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,830
Mirani even told him the answer.
She whispered, "Geumsang."

757
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,540
- I haven't heard it in a while.
- He said, "Geumsung."

758
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,810
- It's an old TV brand.
- I'm so embarrassed.

759
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,840
Next up is Chorong.

760
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,510
Here's your question. Hoho.

761
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,400
Gaga.

762
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,900
(The answer is gagahoho.)

763
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,900
(Finally,
Chorong got a correct answer.)

764
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,410
- Nice work.
- She got it right.

765
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,940
- She's so smart.
- Gagahoho.

766
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,180
- She must've felt rushed.
- What was that?

767
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,620
- She must've felt rushed.
- Chorong.

768
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,910
Why did you make a weird voice?

769
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,910
What's with your voice?

770
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,410
- What was that?
- She sounded like a monster.

771
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,920
- You did a great job.
- Why did you do that?

772
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,330
- What was that, Chorong?
- She did well.

773
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,830
- I was surprised.
- What was that?

774
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,360
- I choose Jae Suk.
- Okay!

775
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,990
(Team Chorong and Bomi recruited
Haha and Jae Suk.)

776
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,230
- I'll move to that side. Okay.
- All right.

777
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,390
Mirani, it's your turn.

778
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,930
Jichu.

779
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,160
- This one is difficult.
- Jjangjjang?

780
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,630
What's jjangjjangjichu?

781
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,580
(Jjangjjangjichu)

782
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,310
- She's never watched "Running Man".
- Jjangjjangjichu.

783
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,380
- It's "nangjungjichu".
- It was difficult for me.

784
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,410
- It was a difficult question.
- This one was difficult.

785
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,640
Why did you give Mirani
a difficult question?

786
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,880
- Hey.
- It was difficult.

787
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,820
- How would she know nangjungjichu?
- That was too difficult.

788
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,820
- What was the answer?
- Nangjung...

789
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,450
- It's "nangjung".
- It's "nangjung".

790
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,720
- It's "nangjung".
- It means "an awl in a pocket".

791
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,720
Next up is Chorong...
I mean, Bomi.

792
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,300
Gowu.

793
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,330
- Jukma!
- That's correct.

794
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,890
- Great job, Bomi.
- Oh, my.

795
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,160
Why do you give them
only easy questions?

796
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,540
- Good job, Bomi.
- That was great.

797
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,960
I'm not sure. Whom should I choose?

798
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,840
- Se Chan.
- Yes!

799
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,580
(She chose Se Chan.)

800
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,730
(Disappointed)

801
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,280
Here's your question. Gamrae.

802
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,140
- Gojin.
- Great.

803
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,140
Gojin!

804
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,240
- Okay.
- Please choose one member.

805
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,020
- Great job.
- I pick Jong Kook.

806
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,820
(The first member Mirani chose was
Jong Kook.)

807
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520
(The singers of "I Luv U"
teamed up again.)

808
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,020
Nice work, Mirani. Okay!

809
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,560
- Great.
- Good job.

810
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,330
- Ji Hyo.
- Me?

811
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,220
Thank you, my friend.

812
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,420
- He's your friend, right?
- The couple is on the same team.

813
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,390
Poor So Min.

814
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,660
(He giggles while saying,
"Poor So Min.")

815
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,130
- Poor So Min.
- So Min...

816
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,460
- So Min.
- Okay. Good.

817
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,280
- Daebal.
- Daebal? Nobaldaebal.

818
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
(The answer is nobaldaebal.)

819
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,340
They keep getting easy questions.

820
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,440
- It was easy.
- No, it was difficult.

821
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,780
The remaining members are
So Min and Suk Jin.

822
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,280
- Don't point at me.
- Who is remaining again?

823
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,670
You're not popular, So Min.

824
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,740
Pick one of them.

825
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,380
I pick So Min.

826
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,650
(I pick So Min.)

827
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,450
It doesn't cheer me up at all.

828
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,720
(It doesn't cheer me up at all.)

829
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,130
Gosh.
Can't I refuse to join the team?

830
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,330
- I want to be a one-person team.
- Then Suk Jin will join them.

831
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,720
What will Suk Jin do?

832
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,570
- He's on the other team.
- I see.

833
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,570
He's doing it again.

834
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,460
- His hand is shaking again.
- Suk Jin.

835
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,040
- Suk Jin, you're doing it again.
- Suk Jin, how about we...

836
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,400
How about we team up together?

837
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,230
I'm okay. Don't be upset
over such a petty thing.

838
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,240
(I'm okay. Don't be upset
over such a petty thing.)

839
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,400
I mean, it's not the first time.

840
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,280
- It's not the first time.
- If you get upset...

841
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
So he's not upset at all.

842
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,850
It doesn't matter.
I'm happy that I'm on this team.

843
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,380
Then why do you look so sad?

844
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,520
Please name your teams.

845
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,150
- Our team is Team ChoBom.
- Right.

846
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,150
- We're Team Kook and Myun.
- Team Kook and Myun.

847
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,880
- Team Kook and Myun?
- That's a good name.

848
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,630
- Team Kook and Myun.
- Team Kook and Myun, Team ChoBom.

849
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,030
- Yes.
- Let's go to the first restaurant.

850
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,920
- Let's go!
- Okay. Let's go!

851
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,160
It's over.

852
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,460
I'm so hungry.

853
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,300
- I'll eat all the food I get.
- Anything would be nice.

854
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,990
- Goodness, So Min.
- I'm hungry too.

855
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,430
Why are you sitting there?
Come and sit next to Chorong.

856
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,460
- Right. Go and sit next to her.
- But...

857
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,810
Come and sit next to Chorong
right now.

858
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,310
What's wrong with you?

859
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,200
- Thank you.
- He's being shy.

860
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,640
- He said, "Thank you."
- You're grateful, right?

861
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,020
- Earlier, in the waiting room,
- Yes?

862
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,320
- I asked Bomi,
- Bomi?

863
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,090
"Bomi, were you born in 1994?"

864
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,290
She said, "No, I was born in 1993."

865
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,120
Then Suk Jin said,
"Oh, you're from Busan?"

866
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,360
"Oh, you're from Busan?"

867
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,090
(Seok Sam talked nonsense
as if he were almost deaf.)

868
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,990
"Oh, you're from Busan?"

869
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,830
- It sounded like that.
- Stop it.

870
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,460
Go see a doctor. You might have
big chunks of earwax.

871
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,330
- That's enough. Be respectful.
- My hearing is fine.

872
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,040
- Are you sure?
- Don't be disrespectful to him.

873
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,460
- Don't speak rudely to him.
- It might be the case.

874
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,840
- I was distracted. That's why.
- Make sure...

875
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
to go see an ENT doctor.

876
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,370
- Stop it, Jong Kook.
- Why should I go see a doctor?

877
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,170
- My hearing is fine.
- I'm a big fan of Mirani's.

878
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,810
I watched the shows she appeared on.
She's a good daughter.

879
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,970
- Thank you.
- And she got good enough grades...

880
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,140
- I heard that too.
- to go to Ewha Woman's University.

881
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,240
- Really?
- Oh, that's right.

882
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,880
The reason why
she studied hard was...

883
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,710
that she wanted to make
her mother's life better.

884
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,760
But she disappointed me earlier.

885
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,330
Why?

886
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,260
Mirani, what was your major
in college?

887
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,720
I majored in
apparel industry management.

888
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,300
- My, that's cool.
- Really?

889
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,370
- You got good grades, right?
- That's amazing.

890
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,800
I got good grades, but...

891
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,990
I didn't know she graduated
from an elite university.

892
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,110
Mirani, is your real name Mi Ran?

893
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,110
It's actually Kim Yoon Jin.

894
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,670
- Yoon Jin?
- Kim Yoon Jin?

895
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,400
(Yoon Jin!)

896
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,280
- Yoon Jin suits you.
- The name Yoon Jin makes you...

897
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,310
- look really smart.
- Hey.

898
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,350
- Yoon Jin.
- I like that name.

899
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,470
It sounds like the top student
in a class.

900
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,520
- "Can you help me solve this?"
- Her real name is Yoon Jin.

901
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,820
- She must've studied hard.
- Absolutely.

902
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,060
Of course.

903
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,420
Suk Jin, don't look out the window.
Mirani is talking.

904
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,330
Suk Jin, Mirani graduated
from Ewha Woman's University.

905
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,890
Focus on what she says, will you?

906
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,890
- Hey, Mirani.
- Come on.

907
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:28,030
Why were you checking the bus route?

908
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,490
- Just get used to it.
- Do you want to go somewhere?

909
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,660
- You can do well on your own.
- He's ridiculous.

910
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,010
- Got it.
- She's doing well. What's wrong?

911
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,130
Listen to what she says.

912
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,540
She's doing well on her own.
What's the matter?

913
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,670
- She was giving us new information.
- Gosh, I can't believe him.

914
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,010
New information?

915
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,740
- I heard that.
- Why weren't you listening?

916
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,110
You got good grades, right?

917
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,050
And you majored in
a fashion-related field, right?

918
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,910
- You didn't have breakfast, right?
- Cho!

919
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,820
Chorong has... Rong! Long legs.

920
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,090
- Why did he do that suddenly?
- Why did you do that?

921
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,820
- That was random.
- I know.

922
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,420
Bo! Bomi is...

923
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,180
- Mi! Magnificent.
- Mi.

924
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,920
- That was good.
- Mi.

925
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,390
Mi! Mirani is...

926
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,390
- Rani.
- Rani.

927
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,530
What?

928
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,340
- "What?"
- That's funny.

929
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,570
- Good job.
- He's gutsy. He wouldn't stop.

930
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,540
- Indeed. He never hesitates.
- He's gutsy.

931
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,930
- Right. He never hesitates.
- Right.

932
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,230
Seok! Suk Jin is...

933
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,040
- Jin.
- Seriously annoying.

934
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,280
(Suk Jin is seriously annoying.)

935
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,050
That rhymes.

936
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,850
(It's short,
but it has the key point.)

937
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,050
Jae! Genuinely bored with...

938
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,880
Seok! Suk Jin!

939
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,820
(Genuinely bored with Suk Jin!)

940
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,020
- That was good.
- I like that.

941
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,420
- All right.
- I'm starving.

942
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,030
- I wonder where we're going.
- I'm so hungry.

943
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,630
Oh, my. I love the menu.

944
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,920
- I can't digest it.
- Since you're hungry. let's begin.

945
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,370
- Okay! Let's begin now.
- I'm starving.

946
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,430
Let's go!

947
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,900
People wait in line for a long time
to eat here.

948
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,930
It's a popular restaurant.

949
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,510
They serve
jjajangmyeon with truffle and steak,

950
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,470
mianbao xia
looking like a thick macaron,

951
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,850
scallop jjamppong,
and many more dishes.

952
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,050
- That sounds delicious.
- We prepared various dishes.

953
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,640
(The reinterpreted Chinese cuisine
drew a lot of attention.)

954
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,880
(Refreshing jjamppong
with a lot of scallops is ready too.)

955
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,290
- We have to win to eat food.
- You have to win the game...

956
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,890
- to eat food under no conditions.
- Exactly.

957
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,720
In the first mission,

958
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,300
you should get good grades to get
Generation MZ's favorite food.

959
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,300
It's Happiness Comes from Grades.

960
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,840
- Okay!
- That's nice!

961
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,660
(It must be a quiz game!)

962
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,200
I like the game name.

963
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,670
Happiness Comes from Grades.

964
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,970
I think we chose...

965
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,050
- I'm sorry.
- We chose the wrong members.

966
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,820
- Do you see the scoreboard?
- Yes.

967
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,410
- Pick any of those questions.
- Yes.

968
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,790
- You get the points written there.
- Okay!

969
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,720
- Okay.
- I see.

970
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,860
- Many of them went to college.
- Okay.

971
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,220
Look at our members
on Jae Suk's left side.

972
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,830
We're hopeless.

973
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,830
They have no hope.

974
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,430
We might be able to manage to win
thanks to me.

975
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,990
(We might be able to manage to win
thanks to me.)

976
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,840
- I'm serious.
- To be honest,

977
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,040
- Mirani is the only smart one.
- That's right.

978
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,200
- Chang Mo is not smart either.
- Hey!

979
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,140
- True.
- What are you talking about?

980
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,140
- About him...
- I'll get them all right.

981
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,440
I can't trust him anymore.

982
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,470
- Fine.
- Honestly,

983
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,820
I'm a little embarrassed
by Chang Mo.

984
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,790
There are two sinkholes
on that team.

985
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,880
- But...
- There's more.

986
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,360
The two teams will take turns...

987
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,830
- to pick a question, right?
- Yes.

988
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,650
But anyone can say the answer.

989
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,920
- I see.
- That's good.

990
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,190
The person who says
he or she will answer...

991
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,920
- will pick up that jar...
- Gosh.

992
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,930
and relay it to the next person
after saying the first syllable.

993
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,340
(The member will relay the jar
after saying the first syllable.)

994
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,540
- Oh, I see.
- Gosh.

995
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,570
That's too hard.

996
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,700
The other members will do the same
after saying one syllable.

997
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,670
- U.
- Why?

998
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,780
- Hey. Good.
- M.

999
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,820
- A.
- My gosh.

1000
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,440
(If one member gets it wrong,
the whole team fails.)

1001
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,240
- Then I should be the first to go.
- Right.

1002
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,640
What about me?

1003
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,880
- Where should I sit?
- You should go second.

1004
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,650
Listen. Your opponent team will
decide your seats.

1005
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,630
- What?
- Gosh.

1006
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,980
Please decide the seats
for the other team.

1007
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,920
I discussed it with Jong Kook
and everyone else.

1008
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,660
We want Jae Suk to move to the end.
The rest can sit anywhere they want.

1009
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,040
- Me?
- Yes.

1010
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,460
We just want you to move
to the end. That's all.

1011
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,270
Okay. So Min, come and sit here.

1012
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,630
- And Ji Hyo.
- Here?

1013
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,430
Chang Mo on her left side
and Ji Hyo on her right side.

1014
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,900
- Ji Hyo and Chang Mo around her.
- Gosh.

1015
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,940
- Okay. No problem.
- What about Mirani?

1016
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,310
She should sit there.

1017
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,850
- Oh, I get it.
- I want them to surround her.

1018
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,020
This is driving me nuts.

1019
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,590
Pick the first question.

1020
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,260
- We pick English.
- We have one more member here.

1021
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,020
How many points?

1022
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,410
- How many points?
- Well...

1023
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,830
- How about 20 points?
- English, 20 points.

1024
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,450
English, 20 points.

1025
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:17,720
If we start with Ji Hyo,
I'm the last one, right?

1026
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,330
English, 20 points.

1027
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,930
- Let's let them go first.
- What is it?

1028
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,320
Let's steal the answer.

1029
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,570
Spell out the word "December".

1030
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,140
(English, 20 points:
Spell out the word "December".)

1031
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,800
- Mirani!
- Okay. Go ahead.

1032
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,030
- Oops.
- It's okay. Go ahead.

1033
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,240
Say the first letter
and give it to the next person.

1034
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,950
- D.
- Give it to the next person.

1035
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,410
- Me?
- Yes.

1036
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,640
Say the next letter.

1037
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,950
- A.
- Gosh.

1038
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,390
- Hey.
- Let me answer.

1039
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,610
It's "December".

1040
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,010
- Okay.
- Let me answer.

1041
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,090
- Go ahead.
- D.

1042
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,220
- Go on.
- E.

1043
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:46,990
S.

1044
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,280
- Great.
- Ji Hyo.

1045
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,860
- Let me answer.
- We'll have another chance.

1046
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,820
- D.
- E.

1047
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,490
C.

1048
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,490
- E.
- M.

1049
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,140
(Please get it wrong.)

1050
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,360
- B.
- E.

1051
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:04,930
R.

1052
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,280
- We made it!
- R.

1053
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,410
We had a chance.

1054
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,820
- Who was the last one?
- What a shame.

1055
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,950
- I didn't know.
- I'm sorry.

1056
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,390
- Okay. We pulled it off.
- What a shame.

1057
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,610
We can get points
by getting another question right.

1058
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,990
Let's go for 30 points.

1059
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,860
How about Sports and Entertainment,
40 points?

1060
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,320
- Let's go.
- What should we pick?

1061
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,550
We pick Sports and Entertainment,
40 points.

1062
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,390
- I like the category!
- Forty points?

1063
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,390
- Forty points.
- Sports and Entertainment?

1064
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,490
Let's win 40 points!

1065
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,490
Sports and Entertainment, 40 points.

1066
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,070
- I've got this.
- Really?

1067
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,470
- Let's go for higher points.
- Come on!

1068
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,910
What is the name of the association
founded by FIFA...

1069
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,240
that registers soccer players
who have played in...

1070
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,340
- over 100 international matches?
- Let me answer.

1071
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,340
(The Century Club)

1072
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,410
Go on.

1073
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,740
(The Century Club)

1074
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,880
What is it?

1075
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,140
- I know what it is.
- Cen.

1076
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,820
Tu.

1077
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,610
(The Century Club)

1078
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,780
Ry.

1079
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,760
Ry.

1080
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,360
(Jae Suk's anxious.)

1081
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,390
(The Century Club)

1082
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,490
S.

1083
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,160
Let me answer!

1084
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,070
- Cen.
- Tu.

1085
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,130
Ry.

1086
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,530
Oh.

1087
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,990
What on earth?

1088
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,140
Oh.

1089
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,740
What on earth?

1090
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,300
What on earth is "Centuryoh?"

1091
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,910
- Are you kidding me?
- Let me answer.

1092
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,110
Come on.

1093
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,200
- Let us answer.
- We'll start from over there.

1094
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,110
Cen.

1095
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,510
Tu.

1096
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,780
Ry.

1097
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,110
- C.
- Lub!

1098
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,110
That's how you do it.

1099
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,660
(Team Kook and Myun scores
in the category chosen by Team ChoBom.)

1100
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,760
Okay!

1101
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,300
It's the Century Club.

1102
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,820
Son Heung Min recently joined
the Century Club.

1103
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,470
- That's right.
- That he did.

1104
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,070
Congratulations.

1105
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,840
Let's have them answer first...

1106
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,030
- and listen to half of it.
- We'll feed off their answer.

1107
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,470
It was my original strategy.

1108
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,280
- Which category?
- Let me see.

1109
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,840
- How about Current Affairs?
- Current Affairs?

1110
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,880
Forty points?

1111
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,180
Jae Suk may know the answer,

1112
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,780
but the others won't,
so let's do this.

1113
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,990
(The others)

1114
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,510
- The others are clueless.
- Exactly.

1115
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,590
(They can't really argue with that.)

1116
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,220
- Thirty or forty?
- Let's go with thirty.

1117
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,180
- Current Affairs, 30 points.
- Nice.

1118
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,630
- Let's show them, all right?
- Let's do this!

1119
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,890
Let's turn this around.

1120
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,220
- Go!
- Let's do this!

1121
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,490
- Here we go.
- My head's spinning.

1122
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,530
- I need to eat this.
- My head's spinning.

1123
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,390
- The National Assembly.
- The National Assembly?

1124
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:17,700
What is the debate that legally
prolongs or delays a vote...

1125
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,280
in the National Assembly?

1126
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,050
(So Min answered it correctly
in episode 602.)

1127
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,110
The debate?

1128
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,280
What is the debate that legally
prolongs or delays a vote?

1129
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,550
The debate?

1130
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,680
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

1131
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,140
Fi.

1132
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,590
Li.

1133
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,410
Seung.

1134
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,680
(That is incorrect.)

1135
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,780
- Seung.
- All right.

1136
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,780
Let me answer!

1137
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,320
Fi.

1138
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,390
Li.

1139
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,260
Mo.

1140
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,470
What was it?

1141
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,630
I think...

1142
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,070
You can't tell each other
the answer.

1143
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,360
Mirani, you first.

1144
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,570
- No, me first.
- No, her.

1145
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,430
- Start with Mirani.
- It can be either of them.

1146
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,570
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

1147
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,910
- Fi.
- Slide it over.

1148
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:51,910
Li.

1149
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,140
- Bu.
- S.

1150
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,450
(Filibuster)

1151
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,970
(Team ChoBom still has zero points.)

1152
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,640
(If Team Kook and Myun
gets it right,)

1153
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,880
(they'll have 90 points.)

1154
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,450
- Suk Jin, it's your turn.
- Me?

1155
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,590
Ter!

1156
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,990
(That is correct.)

1157
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,320
Filibuster!

1158
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,430
(They score another 30 points.)

1159
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,760
Okay!

1160
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,700
Filibuster!

1161
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,300
We knew this one, didn't we?

1162
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,030
It's not the 100-minute debate.

1163
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,660
(Jae Suk sighs with his eyes.)

1164
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,800
How are they that smart?

1165
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,930
(Once again, they lost their chance
to score points.)

1166
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,200
We're at a huge disadvantage.

1167
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,240
How did you know the answer?
Filibuster?

1168
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,410
Don't you know what that is?

1169
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,030
What is a filibuster?

1170
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,300
- He gave us the definition.
- The unlimited debate.

1171
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,570
Explain it to us once again.

1172
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,840
Minor parties...

1173
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,340
- What parties?
- Do debates...

1174
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,510
You all seem angry.

1175
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,490
I hate how Mr. Kimchi
thinks he's above us.

1176
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:39,010
- He didn't know that answer.
- Of course I do.

1177
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,590
They shouldn't be
feeding him the answer.

1178
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,950
No one did that.

1179
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,550
We didn't tell him anything.

1180
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,630
Guys, let's find our energy again.

1181
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,570
- Let's do this!
- So Min,

1182
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,470
- let's hear your voice.
- Don't let them intimidate you.

1183
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,140
- But...
- So Min,

1184
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,470
let us hear your voice.

1185
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,640
My head's spinning again.

1186
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,970
- I didn't know she was here.
- Hey, So Min.

1187
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,410
- So Min.
- Why aren't you talking?

1188
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,070
Should we turn off your mic?

1189
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,380
What do you say?
Should we take it off?

1190
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,680
- Please turn off the mic.
- I thought it was on purpose.

1191
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,050
Please choose a category.

1192
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,140
- Current Affairs, 40 points.
- Yes, Current Affairs, 40 points.

1193
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,390
- Here we go.
- Sure.

1194
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,990
It's the toughest question
in this category.

1195
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,660
What do you call...

1196
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,390
the increase of base interest rate
of over 0.75 percent...

1197
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,430
- Do you know what this is?
- by the Federal Reserve System...

1198
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,090
that is issued
to stabilize inflation?

1199
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,700
- You know this one, right?
- I do.

1200
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,660
I know this one.

1201
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,700
- You know this one?
- Really?

1202
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,660
(The two eldest members
seem confident.)

1203
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,910
Let me answer. I'll kick it off.

1204
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,430
- D.
- No, that's not it.

1205
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,570
- Okay, good.
- All right.

1206
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,780
- D is incorrect.
- Don't be fooled by it.

1207
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,820
- Jong Kook and I know the answer.
- That's right.

1208
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,450
(She doesn't seem to know.)

1209
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,720
It won't be easy, but let's take it
one syllable at a time.

1210
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,010
It's not commonly known.

1211
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,950
But I'm sure we'll go
back and forth on this.

1212
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,320
- Back and forth.
- We'll go back and forth.

1213
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,630
We'll probably go back and forth,

1214
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,390
- so remember the correct syllables.
- Just stay put.

1215
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,030
- Let's try this.
- No, don't.

1216
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,890
- They're waiting for that.
- Please go first.

1217
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,140
(They're trying to get
the other to go first.)

1218
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,200
- We need to wait.
- That's right.

1219
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,110
(Silence fills the room.)

1220
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,970
It has turned into a game of wits.

1221
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,430
I didn't even
understand the question.

1222
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,970
How about we sit here like this
for two hours?

1223
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,110
We'll stay silent for two hours.

1224
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:10,720
- On our team...
- Jae Suk.

1225
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,610
- Why not?
- Only I know the answer.

1226
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,740
- We can't afford to lose.
- No way.

1227
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,660
- We can't tell them.
- We must win this round.

1228
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,180
We're going to hold out.

1229
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,550
- Because...
- We're clueless.

1230
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,930
- Can we get some beer?
- This isn't like "filibuster."

1231
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,050
- Exactly.
- We can't afford to lose.

1232
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,700
- This...
- The first half is easy.

1233
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,090
- You know these English words.
- Don't tell them.

1234
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,570
G!

1235
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,640
- Are we going first? G.
- Here we go.

1236
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,070
Yes, you said the first syllable.

1237
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,570
- But you started it off.
- Go on.

1238
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,780
You said it first!

1239
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,880
Let us answer.

1240
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,470
- Go ahead.
- G.

1241
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,570
Good.

1242
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,740
- Go ahead.
- G.

1243
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,840
Good.

1244
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,140
A.

1245
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,590
It's similar to A.

1246
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,340
- No, don't do it.
- Let's try.

1247
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,990
- Even if we do...
- But...

1248
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,220
Did it come to you?

1249
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,760
(Does Se Chan know the answer now?)

1250
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,550
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

1251
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,680
- G.
- Good.

1252
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,800
What?

1253
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,090
Can she pass it over to me?

1254
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,930
- Of course.
- Go ahead.

1255
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,360
Let me answer. G.

1256
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,660
- I.
- No, you can't do that.

1257
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,760
It should bounce back to me.

1258
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,010
- This way?
- Yes, this way.

1259
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,030
- Really?
- G, I...

1260
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,180
G, I...

1261
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,010
- And?
- Ro.

1262
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,300
- That's not it.
- You heard it, right?

1263
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,570
Let's form a word together.

1264
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,880
- G.
- Good.

1265
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,140
- I.
- Yes.

1266
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,680
(Gi...)

1267
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,140
Only you need to answer correctly.

1268
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:25,910
- We only need you to get it right.
- It's an easy English word.

1269
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,090
- Ri.
- All right!

1270
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,490
(The ball is back in their court.)

1271
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,720
Jae Suk, go ahead.

1272
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,200
- Get thinking.
- It's all right.

1273
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,530
- KCM, it's all right.
- Don't tell them!

1274
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,490
- Don't mouth it to them.
- Let me answer.

1275
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,030
- No, don't.
- Hold on.

1276
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,640
Are they allowed to be angry at us?

1277
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,160
Don't mouth it to them!

1278
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,840
Are they allowed to be angry at us?

1279
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,470
Don't mouth it to them!

1280
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,180
I mean...

1281
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,700
- He almost cussed at us.
- You're mouthing it to them.

1282
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,570
- They don't know it.
- This way.

1283
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,340
Bomi, you kick it off.

1284
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,550
- Let me answer!
- Go ahead.

1285
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,610
- G.
- I.

1286
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,360
- An.
- T.

1287
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,660
(Giant?)

1288
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,360
- All right.
- You heard that, right?

1289
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,890
- You heard it, right?
- Nice!

1290
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,760
(You heard them, right?)

1291
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,430
(Time is up.)

1292
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,240
Let us answer. G.

1293
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,760
I.

1294
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,260
An.

1295
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,360
T.

1296
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,510
S.

1297
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,800
- Tep.
- Yes!

1298
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,030
(That is correct.)

1299
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,740
All right!

1300
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,140
Okay.

1301
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,320
(Thanks to their perfect timing,
they score 40 points.)

1302
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,280
You guys are so smart!

1303
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,390
I mean...

1304
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,140
Jae Suk, I knew this one.

1305
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,360
(Just like that,
a rare opportunity vanished.)

1306
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,490
We only knew up to "giant."

1307
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,820
- Right, but...
- That's all we knew.

1308
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,680
Even I knew this one though.

1309
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,760
This team...

1310
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,700
- They need to be separated.
- Exactly.

1311
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,890
- Right.
- They can't sit together.

1312
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,390
Seok Sam and Ji Hyo
should swap seats.

1313
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,640
How far behind are we?

1314
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,660
No winners are declared
in this game.

1315
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,800
The points you score
will be added throughout the day.

1316
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,140
- Got it.
- Let's answer as much as we can.

1317
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,470
No winner is declared in this game.

1318
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,640
Choose a category.

1319
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,700
- English, 40 points.
- English, 40 points.

1320
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,780
- English, 40 points?
- Yes.

1321
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,380
- Good.
- It's our last chance.

1322
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,490
The set of 26 English letters...
starting with A, B, C...

1323
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,740
is called the English alphabet.

1324
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,180
Please spell out "alphabet."

1325
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,280
Alphabet?

1326
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:07,530
Let's do this.

1327
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,320
- A.
- Alphabet?

1328
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,490
L.

1329
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,590
P.

1330
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,300
- A.
- L.

1331
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,470
- P.
- P.

1332
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,470
Was that B?

1333
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,840
Y.

1334
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,490
- No?
- It's all right.

1335
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,200
I'll take that. Let me answer.

1336
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,610
A.

1337
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:23,660
L.

1338
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,280
- P.
- H.

1339
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,610
A.

1340
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,700
- B.
- E.

1341
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,380
- T.
- T.

1342
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,450
- She told her the answer.
- E.

1343
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,450
- T.
- T.

1344
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:34,490
- She told her the answer.
- No, she didn't.

1345
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,550
We heard it!

1346
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,050
(Team Kook and Myun claim
that they told her the answer.)

1347
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,780
- Yes, they did!
- No, we didn't.

1348
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,550
- You heard them.
- Of course you did.

1349
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,260
- We all heard it.
- But...

1350
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,930
- It was that loud.
- Alphabet!

1351
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,700
- It was that loud.
- But of course she knew it.

1352
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,890
- Of course she knew it.
- Of course.

1353
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,490
That I know.

1354
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,470
Okay, fine. Bomi,

1355
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,740
spell it by yourself
and I'll let it go.

1356
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,840
I'll accept it too.

1357
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,410
- Do it.
- Okay.

1358
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:56,970
- Everyone stay silent.
- Okay.

1359
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,200
Go.

1360
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,300
And go.

1361
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,530
- A.
- All right.

1362
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,610
- R.
- Seriously?

1363
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,410
Okay!

1364
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,550
- R.
- Seriously?

1365
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,090
(She got stuck
at the second letter.)

1366
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,220
Okay, it's our turn, then.

1367
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,360
I...

1368
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,160
Can't I answer
the questions by myself?

1369
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,320
(Can't I answer
the questions by myself?)

1370
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,130
I want to go home.

1371
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,090
I'd like to go home.

1372
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,260
Let's do this.

1373
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,720
- You know what it is, right?
- I know I do.

1374
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,130
- You know what it is, right?
- Of course.

1375
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:24,660
A.

1376
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,160
- You heard them, right?
- L.

1377
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,260
I didn't catch it.

1378
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,570
- P.
- She didn't hear it.

1379
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,530
- P.
- She didn't hear it.

1380
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,380
I didn't catch what they said.

1381
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,070
Nice. All right.

1382
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,240
- We've got this.
- All right.

1383
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,680
- Me?
- Yes, let's start with you.

1384
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,320
Here we go. A.

1385
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,380
L.

1386
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:41,550
P.

1387
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,610
H.

1388
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,890
A.

1389
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,720
B.

1390
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,720
- E.
- T.

1391
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,820
Okay!

1392
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,930
(That is correct.)

1393
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,890
- There we go.
- Let them feed us the answer.

1394
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:54,090
- Jae Suk's in a lonely fight.
- Nice!

1395
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,130
- This will be the last round.
- Got it.

1396
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:57,530
Let's win this round.

1397
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,930
What is the lifestyle choice
of those who wish...

1398
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,610
to retire at an early age
through financial independence?

1399
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:03,760
Financially?

1400
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,340
Through financial independence...

1401
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,140
- You know this one. Go ahead.
- Let me answer.

1402
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,840
- F.
- Right.

1403
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:10,180
S.

1404
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,410
(That is incorrect.)

1405
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,140
(She at least speaks
loudly and clearly.)

1406
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,240
How can we let others know this?

1407
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,240
You know what it is, right?

1408
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,950
(Team Kook and Myun
hasn't grasped the answer yet.)

1409
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,110
How can we let others know this?

1410
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,030
- I know this one.
- Bomi...

1411
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,180
I know this one!

1412
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,590
- You do?
- Then go first.

1413
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:25,800
- Let me answer.
- Have Jae Suk go next.

1414
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:26,950
(Chorong goes first
since she knows the answer.)

1415
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,130
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1416
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,590
- F...
- I...

1417
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,930
- Re...
- S.

1418
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:31,930
Gosh.

1419
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,840
- You know it, right?
- Let me answer.

1420
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,760
- Start from there.
- I know.

1421
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,610
- F.
- I.

1422
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,640
Re.

1423
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,840
(FIRE)

1424
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,780
(Will they lose
this golden opportunity like this?)

1425
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,320
Movement.

1426
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,720
(FIRE movement)

1427
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,950
It's FIRE movement.

1428
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,990
It's FIRE movement?

1429
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,220
- Thank you for the "FIRES."
- They got the hint.

1430
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,320
We could get it thanks to "FIRES."

1431
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,390
- What's this? Is it this one?
- FIRE.

1432
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,070
- "FIRES."
- I mean...

1433
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,300
Is it the title of a new movie?
"FIRES."

1434
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,930
"FIRES" sounds good though.

1435
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:06,530
What is the FIRE movement?

1436
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:07,800
Fire. "FIRES."

1437
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,410
- But what's good about our team...
- "FIRES."

1438
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:11,140
is no one blames
the one who got it wrong.

1439
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,880
We acknowledge it.
"FIRES." It's very close.

1440
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,180
- Right.
- We never blame each other.

1441
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,110
- So...
- Well done.

1442
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:20,990
they won the first mission.
Bring the food.

1443
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,610
- Yes.
- It's nice.

1444
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,990
I do want to eat though.

1445
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,410
- Can we not eat at all?
- We can't.

1446
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,180
Okay. Let me explain
how you can eat.

1447
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,430
- What is it?
- You can eat it this way.

1448
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:35,070
- Pick two from Team Kook and Myun.
- Okay.

1449
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:39,390
- Send your opinions about them...
- Okay.

1450
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,610
to the number you're given.
"Suk Jin's nose is too big."

1451
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:42,860
- Something like that.
- Okay.

1452
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,570
You can send anything.
It could be a malicious comment.

1453
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,570
- The AI will read it.
- All right.

1454
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:50,780
But if the opponent can't stand it
and raise the "stop" sign,

1455
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,740
you will receive 30 points
and a chance to eat.

1456
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,450
- What if we can't stand it?
- You can stand it.

1457
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,610
If you raise the sign
as you can't stand it,

1458
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,260
- there won't be more comments.
- I see.

1459
00:46:58,450 --> 00:46:59,780
I see.

1460
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,450
I can just endure it
even if I'm angry.

1461
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,130
- The food will be served.
- I might get indigestion.

1462
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:06,090
Pick two people among them
as you want.

1463
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,130
First,
the one who gets angry the most...

1464
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,130
The one who is affected the most.

1465
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:09,970
It's Seok Sam
who can't put up with it the most.

1466
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:12,240
- Let's go with Seok Sam.
- You should pick one more.

1467
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,930
Jong Kook...

1468
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,070
- I'm fine.
- He can stand it.

1469
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,530
- I get upset, but I can stand it.
- He can put up with it.

1470
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,200
How about Chang Mo?

1471
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:21,610
I got cursed in every possible way.

1472
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,740
I won't be affected at all. Try it.

1473
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,380
- I'll choose you.
- Okay.

1474
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,090
We'll choose Chang Mo and Seok Sam.

1475
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,180
- Chang Mo and Seok Sam.
- These two.

1476
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,590
But they wouldn't know who wrote it.

1477
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,680
- Right. It's anonymous.
- We won't be scolded anyway.

1478
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,720
Okay.

1479
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,990
Let me tease the older guys
after a long time.

1480
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,430
I think you'll be good.

1481
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:41,700
Hey, we can put up with it.

1482
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,590
He's amazing.

1483
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:44,740
Here it is.

1484
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,300
(Surprised)

1485
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:47,860
(Impressed)

1486
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,640
(Shrimp mianbao xia
that is as thick as a macaroon)

1487
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,550
- It looks amazing.
- It looks good.

1488
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:56,680
It's not that side.

1489
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,280
- We'll just set the table.
- You just set the table?

1490
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,320
Thank you.

1491
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,990
He yelled again.

1492
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:03,450
(Seok Sam was surprised
that they might steal his food.)

1493
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,890
Gosh, this is so thick.

1494
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:07,050
It looks good. I want to eat it.

1495
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,180
The mianbao xia is so thick.

1496
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,200
It smells so good.

1497
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,990
It looks like a macaroon.

1498
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:15,720
Thank you.

1499
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,430
This is crazy.

1500
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,760
- I can smell truffle.
- Gosh.

1501
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,300
- This is crazy.
- This is insane.

1502
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:26,380
This is crazy.

1503
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,550
Can we eat?

1504
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,840
(Team Kook and Myun is enjoying
the perk of becoming the winner...)

1505
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,990
(after crushing the other team
at the quiz.)

1506
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,990
- I've never had something so good.
- Me too.

1507
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:39,160
(Not only Millennials
and Generation Z,)

1508
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,090
(but also Generation X
is impressed.)

1509
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,390
The jjamppong is amazing.

1510
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:45,990
(Scallop jjamppong
is the cherry on top.)

1511
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:46,990
This is insane.

1512
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:48,630
- It's so good.
- It looks so good.

1513
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,220
The meat itself is so tender.

1514
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:52,090
- It's not tough.
- I've never had...

1515
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,660
something this good in my life.

1516
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:56,030
It's so good.

1517
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,200
(On the other hand,
the losing team...)

1518
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,740
I'm going crazy.

1519
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,470
It seriously looks so good.

1520
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:03,910
(They start writing their opinions
anonymously, enduring hunger.)

1521
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,610
(Make Suk Jin and Chang Mo angry
and raise the "stop" sign.)

1522
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,950
This is good.

1523
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,390
I should change the setting again.

1524
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:11,590
(Everyone is thinking seriously.)

1525
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,680
- Who is it?
- Oh, no.

1526
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,360
We won't be shocked easily.

1527
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,090
The sunflower tattoo
on Chang Mo's belly...

1528
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:32,010
The sunflower tattoo
on Chang Mo's belly...

1529
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,900
smells like dead skin
under a toenail.

1530
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,180
(smells like dead skin
under a toenail.)

1531
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,840
(They start attacking him
with the smell of his tattoo.)

1532
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,610
I think he's mad.

1533
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:43,920
My goodness.

1534
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,880
Who smelled it?

1535
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,680
(It's not his business yet.)

1536
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,380
I think I know who wrote it.

1537
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,930
(Glancing)

1538
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,400
- It's so...
- Ants are coming out...

1539
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,050
from Chang Mo's philtrum.

1540
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:59,070
(What?)

1541
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,430
(Someone claimed that Chang Mo's
philtrum is a house of ants.)

1542
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,630
Who is it?

1543
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:02,760
(Someone claimed that Chang Mo's
philtrum is a house of ants.)

1544
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,360
Jjajang would get
on Suk Jin's nose.

1545
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,400
(Jjajang would get
on Suk Jin's nose.)

1546
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:09,570
Ji Seok Sam is such a boomer.

1547
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,550
It's more shocking
as the AI is reading it.

1548
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,490
(Writing a new comment on Suk Jin)

1549
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:20,760
Suk Jin,
if you take your glasses off,

1550
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,680
does your nose come off too?

1551
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,590
(If you take your glasses off,
does your nose come off too?)

1552
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:28,950
(Writing malicious comments
while hiding behind anonymity)

1553
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:31,030
I can feel it a little.

1554
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,800
Feel what?

1555
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,590
Suk Jin, close your mouth,
open your wallet,

1556
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:37,090
and go out right now.

1557
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:39,400
(Close your mouth, open your wallet,
and go out right now.)

1558
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,130
(Se Chan asked him to leave early.)

1559
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,610
Suk Jin.

1560
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:48,010
Put lipstick on Suk Jin's lips.

1561
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,740
Suk Jin, what are you doing?

1562
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:53,680
(He starts eating again
as people around him stopped him.)

1563
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,720
He doesn't look happy now.

1564
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,110
(The infamous netizen Mr. Yoo
who has been quiet starts typing.)

1565
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:59,880
Suk Jin, these are jokes.

1566
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,860
Suk Jin, transplant some hair.

1567
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,760
(Suk Jin, transplant some hair.)

1568
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,400
Hold on.

1569
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:09,930
No.

1570
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,360
Suk Jin, I said go out.

1571
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:16,610
Oh, gosh.

1572
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,800
(The persistent requests to leave
have cumulative effects on him.)

1573
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,880
It's hilarious.

1574
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,110
(How about this?)

1575
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,010
I think it will hurt him.

1576
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,050
Suk Jin, you smell like an old man.

1577
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:28,280
(Suk Jin,
you smell like an old man.)

1578
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,490
(Grandpa Seok Sam is the target
of the concentrated attack.)

1579
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:36,550
- Are you okay, Suk Jin?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1580
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,220
This is not a big deal.

1581
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,490
(Sending another one)

1582
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,070
Are you not leaving, Suk Jin?

1583
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:46,010
(Are you not leaving, Suk Jin?)

1584
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,180
The AI says it in the right tone.
When there's a question mark...

1585
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:52,550
I think the AI makes it
ten times more shocking.

1586
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:55,110
Because it's saying it
without any emotions.

1587
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,590
(Smiling)

1588
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,320
Suk Jin's earwax
is piled like a bowl of rice.

1589
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,320
What?

1590
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,280
- My earwax is like a bowl of rice?
- Suk Jin is an old fox...

1591
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,550
who doesn't act his age.

1592
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:08,720
(Suk Jin is an old fox
who doesn't act his age.)

1593
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:11,930
(An old fox who doesn't act his age)

1594
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,670
(Laughing)

1595
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,570
(Grabbing)

1596
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,070
- You can't.
- No.

1597
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,240
- What are you doing?
- Leave.

1598
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:22,680
No.

1599
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,800
I should eat it quickly.

1600
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:26,840
(He barely endured it.)

1601
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,970
"Your earwax
is like a bowl of rice."

1602
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:29,720
It makes me angrier as it rhymes.

1603
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,180
Suk Jin doesn't love Su Jung.

1604
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:36,180
- "Su Jung?"
- It's his wife.

1605
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,650
(Happy)

1606
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:40,650
You got five minutes left.

1607
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,200
Oh, no.

1608
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:44,820
Celebrities get cursed a lot.

1609
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,990
- Sure.
- So this is nothing.

1610
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:48,170
This is fine.

1611
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:51,860
It's my feeling. This is not...

1612
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,170
Suk Jin has been searching
for places in Cheongdam...

1613
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,530
where pretty girls come.

1614
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:58,900
(Suk Jin has been searching for
places where pretty girls come.)

1615
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,450
No, I have not.

1616
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:01,840
(Suk Jin raised the "stop" sign.)

1617
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,990
We'll give you time to eat.

1618
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:06,820
Give them to me.

1619
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,180
- Chopsticks.
- You don't have much time.

1620
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,610
- Chopsticks.
- You got two minutes and a half.

1621
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:13,150
- Grab your chopsticks.
- I raised it so that you can eat.

1622
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:15,400
- Try the mianbao xia.
- Thank you for the food.

1623
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,030
(They finally got to taste
what they could only see.)

1624
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,720
This is so good.

1625
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,570
- Thank you.
- This is really good.

1626
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:23,570
Gosh.

1627
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:24,700
(Savoring)

1628
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,800
How is it? Is it good?

1629
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,930
(It's so good.)

1630
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,300
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1631
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,680
(Having a bite of truffle
jjajangmyeon that he smelled)

1632
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,010
The smell of truffle.

1633
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,240
It smells so nice.

1634
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,240
(The first bite
makes everyone happy.)

1635
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,490
- Is it good?
- It's so good.

1636
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:43,550
It's delicious.

1637
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:46,260
- We don't have time.
- But the time is up.

1638
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,430
What?

1639
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:48,760
But the time is up.

1640
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,430
(The mealtime is over.)

1641
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,820
Let's go to the next restaurant.

1642
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,470
- What are you doing?
- I only had one bite.

1643
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:55,670
- Let's go.
- Just one bite.

1644
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,240
- Stop eating.
- It's over.

1645
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,360
Stop eating.

1646
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,760
- Hurry up and proceed to film.
- Stop eating.

1647
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,840
- For real?
- Put them down.

1648
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,110
Stop and put them down.

1649
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:05,970
Let us eat.

1650
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:08,010
I will eat the next menu
no matter what.

1651
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,110
I will eat it.

1652
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:11,150
- I'm hungry.
- Me too.

1653
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:13,180
- We're going to the next place.
- Yes.

1654
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,260
What's the menu?

1655
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,180
It's your favorite.

1656
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,680
- What is it?
- It's a snack bar.

1657
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,990
- Yes.
- Come on.

1658
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,030
- A snack bar?
- It's a snack bar.

1659
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,260
But...

1660
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,360
- I like it.
- It's my area.

1661
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,340
You're in my area.

1662
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,740
It's your area.

1663
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,740
- I walk around here.
- It's Apgujeong.

1664
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,240
What do you mean it's your area?
Cha Tae Hyun often comes here too.

1665
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,300
Come on.

1666
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,700
Many people walk around here.

1667
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,070
- I do too.
- I told you last week.

1668
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,050
You shouldn't talk
with people like these guys.

1669
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:43,280
- Okay? End of conversation.
- End of conversation?

1670
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,320
I know so many people
who often come here.

1671
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,860
- Let me give you a tip again.
- Many people come here.

1672
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,420
This is a great tip for social life.
Don't have a long conversation...

1673
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,530
with people like him.
It makes you tired.

1674
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:55,150
- Talk for a short while.
- Just for a moment.

1675
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:57,130
- Where is Mirani?
- Mirani.

1676
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:59,930
- It got me surprised.
- Se Chan said this to me.

1677
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,240
- That he likes Mirani.
- What?

1678
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,800
(Se Chan said he liked Mirani.)

1679
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,740
So I said I would say it
instead of him.

1680
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:06,840
- I was going to say it later.
- Se Chan did?

1681
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,570
Don't do it.

1682
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:09,840
- He's...
- Do you have a boyfriend?

1683
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,110
You're making it weird.

1684
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:12,150
Don't try to create something
between them.

1685
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,150
You don't even know how to do it.

1686
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,920
Se Chan likes Mirani.

1687
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,470
(Se Chan likes Mirani.)

1688
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:19,950
(Talking about his feelings
instead of him)

1689
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:22,320
- My goodness.
- He's weird.

1690
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,550
I'll give you a mission in the car.

1691
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:26,590
Okay.

1692
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,430
- We must win.
- This...

1693
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:29,900
is also popular on social media.

1694
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,470
But we must win.

1695
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:33,320
We can win this.
He said it's famous on social media.

1696
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,340
- Seriously. Bomi, Chorong.
- Yes.

1697
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,360
Let's cheer up.

1698
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,400
Cheer up.

1699
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:39,530
"FIRES."

1700
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:40,900
- Let me explain the game.
- Okay.

1701
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,200
Hold your laughter to try popular
food among Millenials and Gen Z.

1702
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,570
It's a Try Not To Laugh challenge.

1703
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:46,570
"Try Not To Laugh challenge."

1704
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:48,510
It's simple. One from each team
would make...

1705
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:52,320
a random weird noise.
Those who laugh will lose points.

1706
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,840
Okay.

1707
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,860
Like a sound effect?

1708
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,050
- Just make any random noise.
- Okay.

1709
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,780
You can make any noise.

1710
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,930
Something like this.

1711
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:00,930
Those who do not laugh...

1712
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,200
From now on...

1713
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,590
- But it makes me laugh.
- Oh, no.

1714
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,090
Smiling is fine, right?

1715
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:08,130
- You can't smile either.
- When he goes like this...

1716
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:09,170
So...

1717
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,340
What if someone smiles
when they're making a noise?

1718
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,430
- That's not allowed.
- Right?

1719
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:15,800
You can't laugh at yourself either?

1720
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,680
Please allow us to smile.

1721
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,550
No. You will lose then.

1722
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:20,950
- This is not allowed?
- Do you always smile?

1723
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,240
You can't smile either.

1724
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,720
You should have a straight face.

1725
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,050
How about this?

1726
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:26,820
This isn't allowed either?

1727
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,550
- Once you laugh, you keep doing it.
- How about this?

1728
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,360
- What?
- What's that?

1729
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,360
This isn't a smile.

1730
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,360
Show it to me.

1731
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,990
- You can do it.
- We'll follow our standards.

1732
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:37,800
- Who wants to go first?
- I'll keep a straight face.

1733
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,070
- Each team takes turns.
- Se Chan is strong.

1734
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:40,090
- We're on the same team.
- Se Chan is good.

1735
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:41,990
Among us, Chang Mo can do it.

1736
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:42,990
- Chang Mo.
- If you laugh,

1737
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:43,990
- your own team will lose points.
- Okay.

1738
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,360
- Chang Mo, do it.
- Chang Mo.

1739
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,840
- Start from Chang Mo.
- We must win.

1740
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,930
We must win it.

1741
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:49,530
- Don't worry.
- We must win.

1742
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:50,610
You can't laugh from now.

1743
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:53,550
(The Try Not To Laugh challenge
begins first.)

1744
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,570
Ready, go.

1745
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:56,570
(The game begins.)

1746
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,510
Harmonica.

1747
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:04,990
(Laughing)

1748
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:06,720
- I'm sorry. I'm so...
- Bomi lost points.

1749
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,990
Bomi. This is...

1750
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:09,820
- Bomi.
- You could've held it.

1751
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,200
Okay. I got it now.

1752
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,200
- I'm sorry.
- Honestly...

1753
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,800
You got it only now?

1754
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,300
What's the point
if you got it only now?

1755
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,130
Next. Who is going to do it?

1756
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,800
This is driving me crazy.

1757
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,340
- So Min, do you want to try?
- The captain should go.

1758
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,530
So Min, I'll do it slowly.

1759
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:22,700
- So Min, try it.
- So Min.

1760
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,380
- You shouldn't laugh.
- Try it.

1761
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,150
- Should our team not laugh too?
- Of course not.

1762
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,280
What should I do?

1763
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,470
Ready.

1764
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,380
Go.

1765
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:37,090
(Weird noises)

1766
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:38,090
Gosh. What's that?

1767
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:40,430
Jae Suk, you lost points.

1768
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:41,820
(Jae Suk lost points.)

1769
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,300
Why did you laugh?

1770
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,320
He laughed.

1771
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,170
It's too weird.

1772
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:49,090
It's a sound people make
when they soothe babies.

1773
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,630
- It's so weird.
- They make that noise...

1774
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:52,570
- to babies.
- It's too weird.

1775
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,300
- What's this?
- It was too weird.

1776
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,340
- Jae Suk.
- It wasn't professional at all.

1777
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,050
Next. Suk Jin.

1778
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,070
- Me?
- Yes.

1779
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,550
- I shouldn't laugh.
- I laugh easily.

1780
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:01,720
Me too.

1781
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,820
- You're on our team, right?
- Yes.

1782
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,150
Try your best.

1783
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,720
(Shouting)

1784
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,430
(Singing)

1785
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,990
- Don't laugh.
- How can you not laugh?

1786
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:16,200
- How can you not laugh?
- Pass.

1787
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,260
Next. Who is going to do it
from this team?

1788
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,300
I'm going crazy. I shouldn't laugh.

1789
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,320
- Should I attack them?
- Bomi.

1790
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,630
- Se Chan, you go.
- I'll do it.

1791
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:23,630
- Se Chan, let's go.
- Bomi, don't laugh.

1792
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:24,630
Okay.

1793
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,240
- I don't have any idea.
- I'll do it.

1794
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,930
(Laughing)

1795
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,340
Hold on.

1796
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:34,820
It's always our team that laughs.

1797
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:35,820
(Hold on.
It's always our team that laughs.)

1798
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,780
- Hey.
- Don't say that.

1799
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,820
- Hey.
- It's because...

1800
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,860
- It's not creative at all.
- It's our team that always laughs.

1801
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,260
I didn't even look.

1802
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,680
You're so weak.

1803
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,090
- Don't laugh.
- Why is it only us who laugh?

1804
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,450
- We will win for sure.
- Mirani, it's your turn.

1805
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:49,720
- Mirani.
- Mirani.

1806
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,130
There's nothing to do.

1807
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,900
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

1808
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,130
Try rapping with a weird voice.

1809
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:56,990
No. Just do what you were thinking.

1810
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,030
- Stay still.
- What's wrong with him?

1811
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:00,510
Are you an expert or something?

1812
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:01,900
- I mean...
- Stay still.

1813
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:02,930
In case it will confuse her.

1814
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,450
(Squeaking)

1815
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,570
(Laughing)

1816
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:11,150
Haha and KCM lost points.

1817
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:12,450
(Haha and KCM lost points.)

1818
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:14,420
Haha, what are you doing?

1819
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,860
- Next. Jae Suk.
- Why did you laugh?

1820
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,110
You should listen beside her.

1821
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:18,550
- Jae Suk will laugh at himself.
- Should I try?

1822
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,930
He will laugh at himself.

1823
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,760
- I laugh easily.
- That's why.

1824
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,220
I'll try.

1825
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,930
I haven't laughed once.

1826
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:29,930
(Singing)

1827
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,530
(Laughing)

1828
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,260
What was it?

1829
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:37,130
(Laughing alone)

1830
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,550
Many people laughed.

1831
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:42,740
(Laughing)

1832
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:46,050
- Many people laughed.
- It's only our team that laughed.

1833
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,820
He made the noise
and he laughed at it.

1834
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,920
- It was bad.
- My goodness.

1835
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,950
(A bad suicide goal)

1836
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,880
Everyone lost points except So Min.

1837
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,900
Hey, why is it only us who laugh?

1838
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,430
I don't know. Why did you laugh?

1839
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:58,260
- What's the matter with them?
- You should understand us.

1840
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,800
- It's funny as they're bad.
- Why did you laugh?

1841
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,070
- It's weird.
- I almost died because of her.

1842
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:04,740
It's Jong Kook's turn.

1843
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,430
- He will be funny.
- Jong Kook.

1844
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:07,930
- It's not funny.
- He's funny too.

1845
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,300
I have nothing to do.

1846
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,780
Try making a thick voice.

1847
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:12,570
Go.

1848
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,820
What if the sunlight

1849
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,840
(Laughing)

1850
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,240
- Haha.
- He's...

59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,400
- Come on.
- Come on.

1851
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,880
- Haha.
- Why did you laugh?

1852
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,550
He sounded so dumb.

1853
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:27,550
(He sounded so dumb.)

1854
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:30,630
- Why did you laugh?
- He...

1855
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:31,820
(He can't breathe.)

1856
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:34,630
How can he sing that bad?

1857
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:35,700
Oh, my gosh.

1858
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:38,530
I mean...
The way he sang it was so funny.

1859
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:40,340
I mean...

1860
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:42,740
- I'm sorry.
- Jong Kook made him laugh.

1861
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,380
- Chorong.
- It's because I liked it.

1862
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,950
Chorong, let's go.

1863
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:48,010
- Chorong, get ready.
- Everybody

1864
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,280
Ready.

1865
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,780
- Please let's not laugh, our team.
- Set.

1866
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,420
Go.

1867
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,420
(Go.)

1868
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,550
(Laughing)

1869
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:00,430
- Haha.
- What's this?

1870
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:01,930
- You keep laughing.
- I'm sorry.

1871
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:03,900
What's this?

1872
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:06,030
- I mean...
- This is...

1873
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,630
Hey, what is it?

1874
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,930
Chorong. She did her best.

1875
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:11,800
- She did her best.
- What's the matter?

1876
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,930
I could feel next to her
that she was doing her best.

1877
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:16,240
To the point that I wondered
if I should laugh for her or not.

1878
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:18,650
- Chorong.
- Overall,

1879
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:20,570
- I'm going crazy.
- it's funny because they're bad.

1880
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:21,950
- But...
- Everyone...

1881
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:24,950
- we have low standards.
- has low standards.

1882
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,950
- We have low standards.
- We sure do.

1883
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:29,380
- The worst one is So Min.
- It's so...

1884
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,280
(What's wrong with this?)

1885
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,530
Why?

1886
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:34,090
It's funny because it's bad.

1887
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,050
- It's Ji Hyo's turn.
- Ji Hyo.

1888
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:37,820
- Me?
- Yes.

1889
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,590
- "Me?"
- I'm crying.

1890
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,340
You shouldn't laugh.

1891
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,340
(He stops laughing.)

1892
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,840
I will not laugh for real.

1893
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,110
I can control myself.

1894
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:49,840
(Weird noises)

1895
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:53,550
(A random dog noise)

1896
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,450
I didn't think of it.

1897
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,610
- It was a unique sound.
- Ji Hyo.

1898
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:02,860
- It was so strong.
- It was unexpected.

1899
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:05,050
- It's how my dog barks.
- I didn't think of it.

1900
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:06,720
Ji Hyo, I couldn't think of it.

1901
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,990
- It was funny.
- Haha is over.

1902
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,800
- What should I do?
- The killer move.

1903
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,930
It's Haha's turn.

1904
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:13,470
I can't do it.

1905
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:15,360
- Shout "Ya, man."
- I'm crying.

1906
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:17,340
- Don't laugh.
- You end it later, Bomi.

1907
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,700
- Look to the front.
- No. I'll see them.

1908
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,260
- No.
- Look to the front.

1909
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,010
- Don't do that.
- Look outside the window.

1910
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:24,240
(Haha starts attacking them.)

1911
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,470
(Weird noises)

1912
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:32,510
It's so bad.

1913
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,320
(It's shockingly bad.)

1914
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,010
It's so bad that it drives me crazy.

1915
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,930
- What is it?
- He failed for the first time.

1916
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:41,450
- What's wrong with him?
- What's the matter with you?

1917
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:42,450
Haha.

1918
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,930
He laughed at himself.

1919
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,170
- What's so...
- He's weird.

1920
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:47,430
Me doing this is...

1921
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,130
- What are you doing?
- You know what it is, right?

1922
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,430
Oh, my gosh.

1923
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:52,070
I...

1924
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:53,900
(It was so humiliating
that he laughed automatically.)

1925
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:57,280
I feel like dying.

1926
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,380
- Did you lose then?
- Bomi didn't do it.

1927
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:00,700
- Bomi didn't do it?
- Bomi.

1928
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,110
- Bomi should do it.
- Should I do it?

1929
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:03,280
- Did we win?
- You should do it.

1930
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,050
- You should do it.
- You lost.

1931
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:06,050
It's okay
if you make more people laugh.

1932
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:07,110
We shouldn't laugh.

1933
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:08,150
Bomi, let's go.

1934
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,180
(Go.)

1935
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,360
Bomi has grit.

1936
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:21,260
(Weird noises)

1937
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:30,180
But it's a little...
It makes me not like her anymore.

1938
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,650
(It makes me not like her anymore.)

1939
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:34,510
Are you looking down on Running Man?

1940
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:37,340
It was so...

1941
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,110
- What was that?
- Bomi.

1942
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:40,950
- But it...
- Even her facial expression.

1943
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:43,420
- It makes me not like her anymore.
- I saw your look.

1944
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:45,450
Bomi.

1945
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:47,320
I'm sorry, but...

1946
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:51,220
- Bomi, it makes me not like you.
- Bomi. What should we do?

1947
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:53,300
- I feel dizzy.
- You ruined the game.

1948
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:54,720
And you ruined this too.

1949
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,030
What's this?

1950
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:57,430
- Bomi.
- Seriously.

1951
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:58,900
"It makes me not like you anymore."

1952
01:03:58,900 --> 01:03:59,900
(Sad)

1953
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:02,380
- Why is this so funny?
- This is hard.

1954
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,430
Them trying to be funny is funny.

1955
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:05,840
Yes. It's...

1956
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,550
- It's not the noise.
- I think...

1957
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:09,050
Looking at them trying so hard
is funny.

1958
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:10,650
I think it's funny
because it's childish.

1959
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:12,180
- Did we lose?
- Let me count.

1960
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:13,920
- Did we lose?
- Yes, we did.

1961
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,450
- Jae Suk and Haha kept laughing.
- Did we win again?

1962
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:17,820
How can I not laugh when it's funny?

1963
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,050
I didn't want to win, but we won.

1964
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:21,150
Team Kook and Myun
laughed six times.

1965
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:22,300
- Really?
- It's over.

1966
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,300
Team ChoBom...

1967
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:25,930
laughed 16 times.

1968
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:26,990
We have more members.

1969
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:28,260
We have...

1970
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,130
- more members and laughter.
- That's right.

1971
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:31,340
We are nice.

1972
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,470
We couldn't help but laugh.

1973
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:34,880
Team Kook and Myun won points.

1974
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:37,110
- What are we going to do?
- This is nice.

1975
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:38,970
We lost today.

1976
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,110
Does this place sell street food?

1977
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:45,090
I didn't know this place was here.

1978
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:49,880
(Sweet and spicy tteokbokki...)

1979
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,780
(and a sandwich that contains
freshly-fried tonkatsu)

1980
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:54,860
Tonkatsu sandwich looks tasty.

1981
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:57,700
I have often ordered deliveries
from this place.

1982
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:58,760
(Gimbap with yukhoe and
rice bowl with salted pollack roe)

1983
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,990
It sounds tasty.
Tteokbokki with fried fish cake.

1984
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:03,590
This place is famous
for tonkatsu sandwich.

1985
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,170
I want to play this game again.

1986
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,470
(Clucking)

1987
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:10,510
(Neighing)

1988
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:13,800
(Apgujeong safari opens.)

1989
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,800
(Singing)

1990
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,050
That came out of nowhere.

1991
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,680
This building...

1992
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,840
- belongs to Lim Ha Ryong.
- That's right.

1993
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,550
(Screaming)

1994
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,820
- Stop it.
- Does it belong to Lim Ha Ryong?

1995
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:29,900
(He is imitating Maenggu.)

1996
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,760
- Come on.
- He doesn't have anything new.

1997
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,320
You are obsessed with this game.

1998
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:35,590
- You know,
- Seriously.

1999
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,170
he laughed all ten times.

2000
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:40,130
- Let's play it again.
- He laughed all ten times.

2001
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:41,340
I am dying.

2002
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,510
Which dishes would everyone enjoy?

2003
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:46,280
- Yookgaejang ramyeon.
- Ramyeon would be nice.

2004
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,450
Can't we eat?

2005
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,180
Can't we eat?

2006
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:50,320
(Sad)

2007
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,050
- There are so many tasty dishes.
- Are the rules the same?

2008
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:53,450
I am writing comments.

2009
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,150
Are the members KCM and Suk Jin?

2010
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:57,680
No, I am writing comments
about Jong Kook.

2011
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,550
Let's have everyone receive
the hate comments.

2012
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:02,260
Shall we make everyone open
for comments?

2013
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:04,930
- Let's do that.
- Sure.

2014
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:06,360
You can write comments about anyone.

2015
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,170
Let's eat by ourselves.

2016
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:09,800
- It will be easy.
- Seriously.

2017
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,900
- It will be easy.
- The comments don't mean anything.

2018
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,900
We didn't fill our stomachs.

2019
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,880
- Jong Kook punched me once...
- We didn't get the food yet.

2020
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,950
and I was so surprised
because it didn't hurt at all.

2021
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:23,320
(I was so surprised
because it didn't hurt at all.)

2022
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,510
We didn't get the food yet.

2023
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,720
Bring it on.

2024
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:30,860
It didn't hurt at all.

2025
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,450
- He throws soft punches.
- I bet Jae Suk wrote it.

2026
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,320
Jong Kook is hopeless at soccer.

2027
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,820
(Jong Kook is hopeless at soccer.)

2028
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:41,590
Kim Jong Gukbap.

2029
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:44,260
(Kim Jong Gukbap)

2030
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,130
- It's short and strong.
- There are such comments.

2031
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:48,430
There are such comments.

2032
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:50,470
Suk Jin is a dirty old geezer.

2033
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:52,900
(Suk Jin is a dirty old geezer.)

2034
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,340
(Attacks on his age and smell
are always effective.)

2035
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,550
That was funny.

2036
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:00,610
Mirani.

2037
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:01,990
(There is a comment for Mirani.)

2038
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:04,610
It's me, Se Chan.

2039
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,320
Do I...

2040
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:07,780
like you?

2041
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:10,860
(It's me, Se Chan. Do I like you?)

2042
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,930
(Do I like you?)

2043
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:17,470
(He confessed his love
like Tan in "The Heirs.")

2044
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:18,510
You wrote it, right?

2045
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,010
- You wrote it.
- My goodness.

2046
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,800
What was that?

2047
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,510
What was that?

2048
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:27,180
(The culprit is Maenggu,
the man who is obsessed with love.)

2049
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,320
"Do I like you?"

2050
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:32,990
(The fake confession of love
seems to be effective.)

2051
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:34,180
The voice lacks soul.

2052
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,680
Hold on. The food will enter.

2053
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,780
Let's eat.

2054
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:39,860
Thank you.

2055
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,320
Tonkatsu sandwich looks tasty.

2056
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,860
- It's famous.
- Tonkatsu sandwich is famous.

2057
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:47,130
Is it over?

2058
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:49,430
(Giggling)

2059
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:53,610
(Which comment did they read?)

2060
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:54,840
What is it? Is it for Mirani?

2061
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:56,030
Hurry up.

2062
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,130
Mirani.

2063
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:58,130
Hurry up.

2064
01:07:58,130 --> 01:07:59,240
Mirani.

2065
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:03,340
It's me, Se Chan. 0, 1, 0, 9...

2066
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:04,740
It's my actual number.

2067
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:06,590
Don't air it.

2068
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:08,920
- Hey.
- It's my actual number.

2069
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:11,110
- Is that allowed?
- Mirani.

2070
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:12,680
- That was nice.
- It's me, Se Chan.

2071
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,860
- Is that allowed?
- Mirani.

2072
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:16,700
- That was nice.
- It's me, Se Chan.

2073
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,200
- It was better than mine.
- Let's go out.

2074
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,430
I love you like crazy.

2075
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,760
(I love you like crazy.)

2076
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:29,970
(Mirani raises a stop sign.)

2077
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,610
For goodness' sake.

2078
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:33,800
(A manly confession of love
by the man with big gums...)

2079
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,180
(leaves Mirani feeling dizzy.)

2080
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,390
It was manly.

2081
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,420
- It was nice.
- It was manly.

2082
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,890
The AI voice made it funnier.

2083
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:43,420
- It was manly.
- It was so funny.

2084
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:45,930
The voice was so funny.
It was insane.

2085
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:47,090
How was it so funny?

2086
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,320
She raised a stop sign,

2087
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:50,930
- so Team ChoBom can eat as well.
- Okay.

2088
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,430
That was so funny.

2089
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:55,230
- That was so funny.
- "It's me, Se Chan."

2090
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,440
That was hilarious.

2091
01:08:58,270 --> 01:09:00,030
What is that? Tonkatsu?

2092
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:01,640
It's tonkatsu in bread.
It's really tasty.

2093
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,770
(Sweet, crispy, and moist)

2094
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:04,340
It's tasty.

2095
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,070
The meat has been cooked perfectly.

2096
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:09,420
He knows how to eat.
He dipped it in sauce.

2097
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:10,440
He dipped it in sauce.

2098
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:11,980
(Impressed)

2099
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,690
(My goodness!)

2100
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:17,060
(Giving LA reactions)

2101
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:18,590
I am chewing already.

2102
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:19,760
What's this?

2103
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,260
- It's tasty.
- What an idea.

2104
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,650
It's tasty, right?

2105
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:24,760
- Yookhoe gimbap.
- What's up with gimbap?

2106
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,190
- Yookhoe gimbap.
- What's inside? Yookhoe?

2107
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:27,470
Jae Suk.

2108
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,940
- Yookhoe gimbap is tasty, So Min.
- What's this?

2109
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,340
- What's this?
- It's seriously tasty.

2110
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,940
- It's so tasty.
- It's tasty.

2111
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:41,310
- Yookhoe gimbap.
- Despite being street food,

2112
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:44,140
it's nutritious.
The meat is so thick.

2113
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,190
(Glancing over)

2114
01:09:48,190 --> 01:09:49,220
(Laughing)

2115
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,280
Who are you looking for?

2116
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:52,520
If the food is tasty,

2117
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,450
you have to make eye contact
with the owner.

2118
01:09:57,230 --> 01:09:59,430
(Making eye contact)

2119
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:00,800
The ingredients are fresh.

2120
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:02,840
- Seriously.
- The food is tasty.

2121
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:03,940
(Nodding)

2122
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:04,990
(My goodness.)

2123
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,200
Stop making us uncomfortable.

2124
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,440
- And the meat is tender.
- What?

2125
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,570
For real.

2126
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:15,240
My goodness.

2127
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,420
They added so much yukhoe.

2128
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,940
They did that.

2129
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:21,220
Mirani, isn't this ridiculous?

2130
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:23,110
Don't they care about
other restaurants?

2131
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:25,390
Hold on.

2132
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:27,560
Is that a compliment or a threat?

2133
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,450
- Which one is it?
- I mean...

2134
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:30,600
(He compliments the food
as he huffs and puffs.)

2135
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,890
It makes no sense.

2136
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:35,170
Let's move to the last place
for dessert.

2137
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:36,800
- Let's go.
- All right.

2138
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:41,440
It's this place.

2139
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,900
(They move to a different place
for dessert.)

2140
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:46,810
Look at the chandelier.

2141
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:48,440
This place is nice.

2142
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,640
It's nice.

2143
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,690
- This place is nice.
- Haha, sit down.

2144
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:54,940
Sit down.

2145
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,020
(Inching closer)

2146
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:58,760
Would it be okay
if Se Chan sits next to you?

2147
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,990
- Sure.
- Se Chan, I asked her.

2148
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:03,320
You can sit next to her.

2149
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:04,730
For goodness' sake.

2150
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:06,020
You know,

2151
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:07,600
I can't look at her because of you.

2152
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:10,890
I have no feelings for her,
but I can't look at her...

2153
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:12,270
because of what you did.

2154
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:14,270
I can't look at her.

2155
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:16,310
I can't do it.

2156
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,940
I can't look at Mirani
because of Haha.

2157
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:21,350
- It's awkward.
- You know,

2158
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:23,550
- Mirani stopped talking too.
- Seriously.

2159
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:25,440
Haha made it seem like
I had confessed to her.

2160
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,220
Haha messed up the atmosphere.

2161
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:29,560
- What's wrong with him?
- For real.

2162
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,650
- Look at his face.
- "Do I like you?"

2163
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,650
He ruins everything.

2164
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:35,600
He should just leave people be.

2165
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:38,890
This is the last place.

2166
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:41,670
- With colorful desserts...
- They will be delicious.

2167
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:44,690
and romantic atmosphere,
it captivated Generation MZ.

2168
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:45,770
It's a bingsu place.

2169
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:47,670
(There are different types of bingsu
Generation MZ likes.)

2170
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:48,730
It's a bingsu place.

2171
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:50,640
(We love bingsu.)

2172
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:54,880
- Bingsu, patbingsu
- Everyone is happy.

2173
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:56,980
We love you

2174
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:58,270
Bingsu is the best.

2175
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:00,220
- We should eat bingsu.
- We should eat it.

2176
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:01,890
- I want to eat this the most.
- Let's eat it.

2177
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:03,720
For this mission,

2178
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:07,130
all team members except for the one
who will guess the answer...

2179
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:10,890
will draw the given sentence
separately for 30 seconds.

2180
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:12,020
- A sentence?
- Yes.

2181
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,600
- A sentence.
- After 30 seconds,

2182
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,820
all drawings will be revealed.

2183
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:17,440
Then the one remaining member
has to guess the sentence.

2184
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,640
We can do it.

2185
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,770
Okay.

2186
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:20,940
Sit down.

2187
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:22,900
Let's win this time.

2188
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,340
- That's right.
- We have to win.

2189
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,810
Let's eat bingsu.

2190
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:27,640
Don't worry. Draw in a relaxed way.

2191
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:30,070
This team has many members
you have to watch out for.

2192
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:31,480
- I am bad at drawing.
- Come on.

2193
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,480
- We don't do that.
- We don't do that.

2194
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,590
This is...

2195
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:36,780
a matter of drawing
what comes to your mind.

2196
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,780
Please help them stay on track.

2197
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:41,020
Even if we want to help,
they won't listen.

2198
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,950
Here comes the first question.

2199
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:45,730
Don't worry and draw.

2200
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:47,320
We have many members
who can draw well.

2201
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:49,730
(Se Chan picks his teeth
with the N Seoul Tower.)

2202
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:51,270
Please lower the level.

2203
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:52,840
We have many members
who can draw well.

2204
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:53,860
This is hard.

2205
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:56,480
- It's easy.
- I would answer it in a heartbeat.

2206
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:00,740
- It's easy.
- It's so easy.

2207
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:02,480
My goodness.

2208
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,740
Oh, no.

2209
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:06,110
- Bomi shouldn't show hers.
- Two,

2210
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,480
- one. Hold it up.
- This is very...

2211
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:09,220
Bomi shouldn't show hers.

2212
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,810
- This is hard.
- My goodness.

2213
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:12,230
- Hold it up.
- It's hard.

2214
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:13,390
I am not sure about this.

2215
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:16,320
Hey.

2216
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,320
(A masterpiece)

2217
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,390
(Two poor-quality drawings)

2218
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,630
Hey.

2219
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:23,440
That's me.

2220
01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:25,060
- What?
- You accentuated the teeth.

2221
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,400
- Don't give him any hints.
- Stop sharing information.

2222
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,340
I guess it isn't me.

2223
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:31,980
- Hey.
- There are no glasses.

2224
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,680
This person is picking his teeth
with a tower.

2225
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,680
(Impressed)

2226
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,720
It must be Se Chan.

2227
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,810
(It turns into 20 questions.)

2228
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:41,280
- My goodness.
- Let's see.

2229
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,560
Se Chan is... Let's see.

2230
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,280
- Aren't you going to count down?
- Don't give him so much time.

2231
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:47,630
Say the answer now.

2232
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:49,130
- Two, one.
- All right.

2233
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:50,190
What's the answer?

2234
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,560
On top of the mountain...

2235
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:55,270
(Incorrect)

2236
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,860
You were getting there.

2237
01:13:57,940 --> 01:13:59,060
All right.

2238
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:01,940
Why did you think it was you
when I didn't draw the glasses?

2239
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:04,530
- It's me.
- It's Se Chan.

2240
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:06,700
It looks like "Attack on Titan."

2241
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,350
- It isn't Se Chan.
- Come on.

2242
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:09,680
It's me.

2243
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:12,020
- I will get it right.
- The second question.

2244
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:13,020
(The second question)

2245
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:14,090
- Cue.
- Trust me.

2246
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,110
Cue.

2247
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:18,090
It's a simple game.

2248
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:19,520
There will be a member's name.

2249
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,890
(Jae Suk rides a scooter
while wearing pants on his head.)

2250
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:22,690
- It's easy.
- It's easy.

2251
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:25,020
It's really easy.

2252
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,190
- It's really easy.
- Ten seconds.

2253
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:28,390
Jae Suk will get it right.
Everyone is drawing well.

2254
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:30,140
Five, four,

2255
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:32,470
- three, two, one.
- Bomi can draw well.

2256
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:34,840
- Time's up.
- Bomi can draw well.

2257
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,570
Time's up.

2258
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,340
Bomi can draw well.

2259
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,010
(Se Chan and So Min's drawings
are ordinary.)

2260
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:41,570
(She made
another grotesque artwork.)

2261
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:43,720
It's me.

2262
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:46,550
While wearing pants on his head,

2263
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:50,610
(That's it!)

2264
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,090
Jae Suk rides a scooter.

2265
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:56,890
(Correct)

2266
01:14:58,490 --> 01:15:00,020
Correct.

2267
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:01,970
- I did well, right?
- Good job.

2268
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,440
- It was too easy.
- It was too easy.

2269
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,560
Okay. Good.

2270
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,140
How did you guys draw me?

2271
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:10,030
Isn't that an alien squid?

2272
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:11,700
- Bomi, you are bad at drawing.
- An alien squid.

2273
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,810
- Listen, the two of you.
- Prince Squid.

2274
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:15,810
You guys don't need to draw.

2275
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:19,940
The two of you
should just draw the person.

2276
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,560
- They will draw the situation.
- That's what we can't do.

2277
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:24,650
- All right.
- That's the key point.

2278
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:25,760
Let's go.

2279
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:27,690
Here comes the question.

2280
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,320
- Get the key points.
- I will focus on them.

2281
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,390
Cue.

2282
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:33,770
(Jae Suk plays the piano
with his teeth.)

2283
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:36,300
(Jae Suk plays the piano
with his teeth.)

2284
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,560
What a sentence.

2285
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,810
- It's easy.
- It's so easy.

2286
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:40,940
It's easy.

2287
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,100
It's easy. It's totally easy.

2288
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,480
What should I do?

2289
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:49,020
- For goodness' sake.
- I need to know who it is.

2290
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:51,180
- You have 15 seconds left.
- Hold on.

2291
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:52,740
Jae Suk.

2292
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:56,610
Five, four,

2293
01:15:56,610 --> 01:15:57,920
- three, two,
- Why are you laughing?

2294
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,060
- one.
- Is that a dinosaur?

2295
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:00,150
Hold it up.

2296
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:01,390
- Hold it up.
- That's a dinosaur, right?

2297
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,100
- Hold it up.
- It was hard.

2298
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,990
- That's me.
- No.

2299
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:06,490
Don't say, "No."

2300
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:08,430
- Don't say, "No."
- It wasn't easy.

2301
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:10,640
- Se Chan.
- It was easy.

2302
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,270
- Let's go.
- Come on.

2303
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:13,530
- It wasn't easy.
- Hey.

2304
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:15,530
Se Chan, is that a skull?

2305
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:17,070
- That's me.
- That's a skull, right?

2306
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,680
Isn't that me?

2307
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:19,980
There is no hair.

2308
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,770
(This cheater keeps drawing
while others' works are revealed.)

2309
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:24,180
- This is bad.
- Jae Suk.

2310
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:25,440
Jae Suk.

2311
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,480
- There is no hair.
- They didn't have time.

2312
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:30,090
- It's Jae Suk.
- Hold on. He wrote English.

2313
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,190
Come on.

2314
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,130
(He wrote English.)

2315
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,390
- English.
- He wrote "Chi" for "Teeth."

2316
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:37,260
- Hold on.
- I didn't need that hint.

2317
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,390
But you can't read "Chi."

2318
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:41,230
(She looks down on him.)

2319
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:43,800
- That's right.
- It's Bomi who can't read it.

2320
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,970
- That's not true.
- All right.

2321
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,530
If the person
with a protruding mouth...

2322
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:50,230
has glasses, it's Jae Suk.
Otherwise, it's me.

2323
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,640
- Okay.
- The hair doesn't matter.

2324
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,510
- The teeth matter the most.
- That's right.

2325
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:55,380
- If there are no teeth, it's Haha.
- Okay.

2326
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,610
- Understood?
- Here comes the question.

2327
01:16:57,770 --> 01:16:59,110
If the person is bald, it's me.

2328
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:00,350
(Mirani becomes angry
because of Se Chan's confession.)

2329
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:02,050
(Mirani becomes angry
because of Se Chan's confession.)

2330
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,280
This one...

2331
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,520
- This one is hard.
- Pay attention to who I am...

2332
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,850
Don't write any words.

2333
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:09,060
(Pay attention to who I am...)

2334
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,390
- Who I am...
- Don't write any words.

2335
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:12,520
It's easy.

2336
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:16,300
He is looking at the person
too much.

2337
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:17,890
(He gives a hint openly.)

2338
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:20,100
That's too much, Seriously.

2339
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,840
Jae Suk.
Keep your eyes on the paper.

2340
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,010
I need to look at her
in order to draw her.

2341
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:26,980
I am sorry,
but this is what you have.

2342
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,020
- You stared at her for so long.
- Wait.

2343
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,050
Ten seconds.

2344
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:32,920
- That's ridiculous.
- You always draw a stick figure.

2345
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,020
Seriously.

2346
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:37,190
Three, two, one.

2347
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:38,650
- Hold it up.
- Let's see it.

2348
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:39,730
(They hold up the drawings.)

2349
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,860
She drew well.

2350
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:48,320
She drew well.

2351
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:51,440
Chorong's drawing skills improved.

2352
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:53,010
Chorong drew so well.

2353
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:56,030
Okay. So there are two people.

2354
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:57,230
She drew well.

2355
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:58,980
Is this Speak with Your Actions?

2356
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,480
- Okay.
- Speak with Facial Expressions?

2357
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,740
Okay.

2358
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:06,590
- What are you doing?
- Jae Suk, what did you tell him?

2359
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:10,020
I didn't tell him anything.

2360
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:13,450
Se Chan confesses to Mirani.

2361
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:15,190
(Incorrect)

2362
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,190
You were close.

2363
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:17,950
(He missed the angry Mirani part.)

2364
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:19,820
- What's the answer?
- You missed her reaction.

2365
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,490
Mirani becomes angry
because of Se Chan's confession.

2366
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:23,730
I drew everything.

2367
01:18:23,730 --> 01:18:25,100
What's that?

2368
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,940
- Mirani is angry.
- How is that Mirani?

2369
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:31,140
These fringes
should tell you as much.

2370
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,550
- This is driving me crazy.
- Aren't those twigs?

2371
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:36,380
- What are you talking about?
- The next question.

2372
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:38,220
- Cue.
- Hold on.

2373
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:39,390
(Team Kook and Myun goes next.)

2374
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,390
It must be hard.

2375
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:42,450
- Hold it up.
- Here.

2376
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:44,480
- Time's up.
- What's the answer?

2377
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,480
- It's hard.
- KCM...

2378
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,950
plays the harmonica with a snake.

2379
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:50,690
Right?

2380
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:52,130
Hold it up.

2381
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:54,060
This is a person.

2382
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:55,770
(He plastered a squid
to So Min's face.)

2383
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:58,490
- You are too much.
- It's "The Lion King" character.

2384
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:01,060
So Min uses a squid as a sheet mask.

2385
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:02,380
Okay.

2386
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,510
(Thus, Team Kook and Myun
got 2 questions right.)

2387
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,900
Since it's a tie,
why don't you arm wrestle?

2388
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,180
(They will arm wrestle
to determine the victor!)

2389
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:12,390
- The representatives.
- Bomi, you are good at it.

2390
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:13,740
- Yes.
- Bomi.

2391
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:14,890
- Bomi, are you good at it?
- Yes.

2392
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:16,020
How about Bomi and Mirani?

2393
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:18,060
- Okay.
- Okay. Bomi versus Mirani.

2394
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:19,260
- Okay.
- Bomi looks strong.

2395
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:20,730
- Bomi is strong.
- Bomi is strong.

2396
01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:21,760
Okay.

2397
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,600
Bomi, show us.

2398
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,850
- Okay.
- Show us.

2399
01:19:25,150 --> 01:19:27,170
- Okay.
- I can do well.

2400
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:28,990
This match will decide
the winning team...

2401
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:31,190
that will eat bingsu.

2402
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:33,900
- Bomi, put your weight into it.
- We will eat bingsu.

2403
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,810
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2404
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,940
- Let's go.
- It's a single match.

2405
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,310
- Use your elbow.
- Let's go.

2406
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:41,680
Start from the middle. Get ready.

2407
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,020
- Get ready.
- Let's go.

2408
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:45,440
Get ready. Set, go.

2409
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:48,420
- What are you doing?
- It's the Top Roll.

2410
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:50,260
(The end)

2411
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:51,890
- What are you doing?
- It's the Top Roll.

2412
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:53,760
(They lost again.)

2413
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:54,950
It was the Top Roll.

2414
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:58,690
- Yes!
- Yes!

2415
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:00,930
It was the Top Roll.

2416
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:05,970
(Bomi lost in her specialty,
a match of strength.)

2417
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:07,840
Jae Suk, how did this happen?

2418
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,010
(I don't know.)

2419
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:11,070
Bomi.

2420
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:13,510
You lost in every match today.

2421
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,980
Don't cry.

2422
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:18,480
You should be good at something.

2423
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,050
- It was my specialty.
- We lost in every match.

2424
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:22,350
- Hold on.
- Jae Suk.

2425
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:23,810
- This team had the perfect victory.
- Okay.

2426
01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:25,110
(Team Kook and Myun had
the perfect victory.)

2427
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:26,390
We were going to lose this time.

2428
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:27,890
We were preparing the hate comments.

2429
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:29,820
We were going to write
the hate comments.

2430
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:31,390
We have to eat again.

2431
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:32,930
(Team Kook and Myun has no choice
but to eat again.)

2432
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,990
(Sweet and sour fruit bingsu enters.)

2433
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:37,530
- It's bingsu.
- Mango bingsu.

2434
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:41,140
- Is it supposed to flow?
- Yes.

2435
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,530
It's very tasty.

2436
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:43,530
My goodness.

2437
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:45,480
- We don't have anything to say.
- Bomi.

2438
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,010
- We don't have anything to say.
- Seriously.

2439
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,350
We had the complete victory.

2440
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:52,380
We were ready to write
hate comments.

2441
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,050
- That team...
- Shut up, Suk Jin.

2442
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:59,130
I am 50,000 percent sure
Jae Suk wrote that.

2443
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:00,690
How tasty.

2444
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:02,130
I chose the wrong team.

2445
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:06,360
(She has no words.)

2446
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,020
Hey, listen.

2447
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:11,030
If you say funny things
about each other,

2448
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:13,360
I will hold up the stop sign.

2449
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,670
You are out of things to say,
so criticize each other.

2450
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:17,570
Mirani. It's me, Se Chan.

2451
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,270
Can't I like you?

2452
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:22,810
You look pretty when you eat.

2453
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,890
(An avid fan's comment
appeared once again.)

2454
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:29,560
- That's so funny.
- They are attacking Mirani.

2455
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,520
- It's funny.
- Mirani.

2456
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:33,390
It's me, Se Chan.

2457
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:37,260
I am seriously going crazy
because of you.

2458
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:39,800
I am seriously going crazy
because of you.

2459
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:43,340
I want to drive you home
after the shoot.

2460
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,310
(The man who is going crazy
because of Mirani, Se Chan)

2461
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:49,980
She is nearly there.
Try a bit harder.

2462
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:51,480
(She is close
to raising the stop sign.)

2463
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,740
My goodness.

2464
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:55,640
(The woman who makes
Se Chan go crazy, Mirani)

2465
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:57,140
- It's so funny.
- I am a fan of that story.

2466
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:58,180
Mirani.

2467
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:00,140
Mirani. It's me, Suk Jin.

2468
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:01,980
I will give you a ride.

2469
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:05,420
Mirani. It's me, Suk Jin.

2470
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:08,230
(The dad offers a ride.)

2471
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:10,020
(The dad is worried about
how his daughter will get home.)

2472
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,060
Come on.

2473
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:13,060
(The dad is worried about
how his daughter will get home.)

2474
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:16,140
- Stop.
- Stop.

2475
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:17,890
- Okay.
- She held it up.

2476
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:19,640
The Mirani series is so funny.

2477
01:22:20,530 --> 01:22:22,030
"Mirani. It's me, Se Chan."

2478
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:23,770
"I am seriously going crazy
because of you." That was so funny.

2479
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,140
That was so funny.

2480
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,140
- Encore.
- It really sounded like Se Chan.

2481
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:28,680
(With the manly confession,
they clear the last menu.)

2482
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,140
It was funny
because it sounded so real.

2483
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,090
Now, I will give you
the ending rules.

2484
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:34,920
- Okay.
- The final score...

2485
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:38,720
is 210 points to 120 points.

2486
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,890
- My goodness.
- But...

2487
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:42,090
the score won't decide the result.

2488
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,100
Okay.

2489
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:45,350
Remember spinning the wheel...

2490
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:48,230
- for the N Number Race?
- Yes.

2491
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:49,270
I remember that.

2492
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:51,640
The points will give you
a certain number of slots.

2493
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,600
It's 1 slot per 50 points,

2494
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,530
so this team can write
the other team's name on four slots.

2495
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:58,940
- Please do that now.
- Wouldn't that be better?

2496
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:01,050
I had the same thought.
Let's put one here.

2497
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:02,680
Never mind.
Let's keep them as they are.

2498
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:06,050
All right. This team gets two slots.

2499
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:08,890
All right. The wheel is ready.

2500
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:12,690
You will now spin the wheel.
The team that gets picked will lose.

2501
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:14,690
I see. I remember doing this.

2502
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:18,150
With 4 and 2 slots filled each,
you will spin the wheel.

2503
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:22,130
If you get an empty slot,
add the other team's name.

2504
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:24,340
(If you get an empty slot,
add the other team's name.)

2505
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:27,900
When a team gets picked,

2506
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,100
that team will lose right away.

2507
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:33,100
That team will receive the penalty.

2508
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,050
- Spin it.
- Bomi, spin it first.

2509
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:36,110
- Bomi.
- Go, Bomi.

2510
01:23:36,110 --> 01:23:37,110
- Spin it.
- Let's go.

2511
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:38,570
- You can do it.
- What's the penalty?

2512
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:40,350
It would be great if we get
Team Kook and Myun right away.

2513
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:41,920
- Please.
- Then we will win.

2514
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,190
- Then we will win.
- Seriously.

2515
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:44,810
- Then we will win.
- I will win this one.

2516
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:46,480
- Okay.
- I haven't won once today.

2517
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,850
- Let's win.
- I will win this one.

2518
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:50,890
(The team that gets picked
will receive the penalty!)

2519
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:53,270
- Okay.
- If you get picked, we win.

2520
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:54,320
That's right.

2521
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,770
- If it's a blank, we add a slot.
- I think you will get picked.

2522
01:23:57,530 --> 01:23:59,060
- Team Kook and Myun.
- I think you will get picked.

2523
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:00,770
- Team ChoBom.
- Please.

2524
01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:04,730
(The team that gets picked
will receive the penalty!)

2525
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:07,550
- I think you will get picked.
- Team ChoBom.

2526
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:10,570
(Team ChoBom gets the penalty.)

2527
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:11,680
It only took one go.

2528
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:13,350
Team ChoBom.

2529
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:17,280
It only took one go.

2530
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,520
Team ChoBom.

2531
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,090
(Team Kook and Myun won
until the very end.)

2532
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,350
(Dumbfounded)

2533
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:28,270
(The big sinner)

2534
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:29,800
(Bomi causes trouble in the end.)

2535
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,440
Jae Suk. You have to do it again.

2536
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:33,060
Hey.

2537
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,530
- That's shocking.
- Get out.

2538
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,070
Get out of here.

2539
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:37,180
- Get out!
- Get out.

2540
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,480
Leave now.

2541
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,440
That was very close.

2542
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:41,700
- Hey.
- It's perfect.

2543
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,850
Take her with you.

2544
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:45,140
Get out now!

2545
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:48,020
I'm shocked.

2546
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,950
- How is that possible?
- How could that happen?

2547
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:51,220
It didn't work out all day.

2548
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:52,820
- Nothing worked out.
- How is that possible?

2549
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:53,930
Nothing worked.

2550
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:54,950
She's worse than me.

2551
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:57,350
Here's the penalty.

2552
01:24:57,430 --> 01:25:00,630
Among 6 balloons,
3 of them have flour.

2553
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:03,340
Take one with you. It's simple.

2554
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:05,940
If she doesn't get it,

2555
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,530
that's...

2556
01:25:07,530 --> 01:25:08,900
(Then the winner is ChoBom.)

2557
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,440
This is crazy.

2558
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:13,550
- Are you going to sit there?
- Just sit down.

2559
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:15,240
- I'll sit here.
- Then I'll sit here.

2560
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,480
Should I sit here?

2561
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,480
(Six stragglers are sitting
side by side.)

2562
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:18,680
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

2563
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,640
- All right.
- Let me just see.

2564
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:21,920
We'll start with these three first.

2565
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:22,950
- Yes.
- Okay.

2566
01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:24,980
- Three people here.
- I can already see it.

2567
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:26,280
- Do I go?
- Does it have flour?

2568
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,950
Wait. Do I go?

2569
01:25:27,950 --> 01:25:29,690
- Does it have flour?
- Do I just go?

2570
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:32,060
Yes. 1, 2...

2571
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:34,270
(Does one of these balloons
have flour inside?)

2572
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:36,140
Two, three.

2573
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:40,270
(Chorong got floured.)

2574
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:42,560
Hey.

2575
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,100
(Jae Suk and So Min were lucky.)

2576
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:46,700
It's annoying.

2577
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:48,100
Now there are two left.

2578
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,440
Two of them.

2579
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,180
Two of them?

2580
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:52,890
You're never this lucky.

2581
01:25:52,890 --> 01:25:54,280
That was awesome.

2582
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,480
Gosh.

2583
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:56,850
Do you want to switch?

2584
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,590
- No. Let's do this.
- Will you switch with me?

2585
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:00,350
- Let's do this.
- Will you switch with me?

2586
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:02,560
- Let's do this.
- Let's switch.

2587
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,820
What are you doing?
It'll get on him too.

2588
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:06,690
- Really? Do you want to switch?
- Let's do it.

2589
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:07,860
I did it already.

2590
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:10,990
- You already did?
- I already did it, Bomi.

2591
01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:12,470
- All right. One.
- Let's switch.

2592
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:14,270
- No switching?
- Two.

2593
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:15,270
Let's switch.

2594
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:16,480
One, two, three.

2595
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:19,270
Let's switch.

2596
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:20,980
(Se Chan and Bomi got floured.)

2597
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:21,980
Who is it?

2598
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:24,070
Am I safe?

2599
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:25,940
Awesome.

2600
01:26:26,190 --> 01:26:27,740
She's unlucky to the end.

2601
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:28,920
Still,

2602
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,280
I'm not even joking.

2603
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,090
Bomi and Chorong.

2604
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:34,430
- They're the worst.
- They're unlucky.

2605
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,260
Consider you avoided
something worse with this.

2606
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:37,760
- You got flour too.
- ChoBom.

2607
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:39,260
Your album will be a hit.

2608
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:40,470
Are you sure?

2609
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:42,430
- Right. Your album will be a hit.
- It will be a hit.

2610
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:43,890
- I hope that's true.
- Are you sure about that?

2611
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:45,530
You got rid
of all your bad luck here.

2612
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:46,940
(Thanks to Chorong, Bomi, Mirani,
and KCM for their appearance.)

2613
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:48,360
I hope our album becomes a hit.

2614
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:50,980
(The worst penalties...)

2615
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:53,050
(wait for the members.)

2616
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,510
(To avoid worst penalties ever,)

2617
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:57,880
(they promise to stay united.)

2618
01:26:58,180 --> 01:26:59,180
- Right.
- There are seven.

2619
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:01,980
(Step by step,)

2620
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:04,560
(they carefully enter...)

2621
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:08,450
(the mysterious universe.)

2622
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:09,990
(Doctor, president,
judge, scientist)

2623
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:12,060
(Act casually.)

2624
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,430
(I've already done...)

2625
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:15,630
(suction on that patient.)

2626
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:18,800
(If you don't pay attention,
it will cause big trouble.)

2627
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:19,970
The whole family is bald.

2628
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:23,730
(Their teamwork is
about to collapse.)

2629
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:27,550
(In the midst of
conflict and confusion,)

2630
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:30,740
(seven people are on trial.)

2631
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:32,980
(Before the temptation of coins,)

2632
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:34,940
(will 7 people stay loyal?)

2633
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:37,690
(The 2nd Sharing Playbook)
