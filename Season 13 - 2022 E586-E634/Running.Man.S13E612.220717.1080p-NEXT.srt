1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,100
It's so cool.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,760
Hello.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,330
- This smells like Southeast Asia.
- It feels like we're in Singapore.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,700
It smells like Southeast Asia.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,790
Doesn't this feel like Singapore?

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,370
- This is nice.
- Singapore.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,840
- I like it.
- This is what I always do.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,560
- This is so nice.
- I imagine I'm in Singapore.

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,130
- I love it.
- Don't you like my glasses?

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,950
- What are the glasses?
- Did you buy them?

11
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,340
Actually, they are
Jong Kook's glasses.

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,750
(Kim Jong Kook,
the owner of the sunglasses)

13
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,410
Why are you wearing them?

14
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,750
Jong Kook didn't want to wear them,
so I put them on instead.

15
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,050
You can have them.

16
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,120
Jong Kook, try these on.

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,120
- No.
- Just try them on once.

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,130
Just this once.

19
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,060
- No.
- Go ahead. Let's see how they look.

20
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,150
- Just try them on.
- What?

21
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,170
- Hey.
- Please.

22
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,960
- Stop it.
- Just try them on.

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,070
- Go ahead and wear them.
- I don't want to.

24
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,330
(Twenty minutes ago, the members
were gathered at the parking lot.)

25
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

26
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,330
- Hey.
- Hi.

27
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,570
What's with the glasses?

28
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,610
I have creases in my eyelids today.

29
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,940
- Let me see. You have creases?
- I'll just take them off.

30
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,750
- Jong Kook.
- Put them back on.

31
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,540
- Jong Kook, please.
- I just liked them.

32
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,850
- No.
- You looked cool.

33
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,680
- I don't need them.
- Just wear them for us.

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,060
- I shouldn't have mentioned that.
- It's Suk Jin's fault.

35
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,080
Jong Kook doesn't want to wear them.

36
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,800
- Try them on.
- I said no.

37
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,250
- Go ahead.
- No.

38
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,430
- I'm not wearing them.
- Hey.

39
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,860
Hey, why would you do that?

40
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,470
- I don't want to wear them.
- What's the big deal?

41
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,270
- The glasses...
- I'm not wearing them.

42
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,160
Just put them on. I want to see
how they look on you.

43
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,440
- Stop it.
- All right.

44
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,940
I told you to stop!

45
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,100
- All right.
- The thing is...

46
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,100
Suk Jin ruined everything.

47
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,410
He ruined it.

48
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,240
- As soon as he got here...
- Because I blabbered on it.

49
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,520
- Exactly.
- When we saw Jong Kook,

50
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,850
we said, "You look good today."

51
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,290
And he just left,
looking a little shy.

52
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,250
So I thought, "Okay, it's done."

53
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,850
(Okay, this is it for today.)

54
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,750
- "We got it."
- "I'll talk about it."

55
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,130
I didn't say anything.

56
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,800
But Suk Jin
suddenly showed up and...

57
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,600
- "Hey, what's with your glasses?"
- That guy in the net sweater.

58
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,970
I just said one thing.

59
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,740
- "What's with your glasses?"
- I didn't sound like that.

60
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,330
- What is it then?
- "Hey, what's with your glasses?"

61
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,890
- I sounded like this.
- No. "What are the glasses for?"

62
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,240
- You sounded more like this.
- Did I?

63
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,830
You know what Jong Kook is like.

64
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,600
- He finally decided to wear...
- Exactly.

65
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,350
the glasses that match his shorts.

66
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,140
My eyes get saggy as I grow old.

67
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,720
So I get creases in my eyelids.

68
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,240
- They are not saggy.
- Jong Kook. Try them on once.

69
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,640
Seriously, no!

70
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,120
- Stop it!
- Hey.

71
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,410
Don't come close to me.

72
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,220
These are what you were wearing
just a while ago.

73
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,000
- Don't do that.
- He got off the car...

74
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,450
wearing them.

75
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,720
I was just wearing them for a while.

76
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,220
- You're lying.
- Forget it.

77
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,730
Ji Seon says you've been wearing
tinted glasses a lot recently.

78
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,760
- Jong Kook.
- That's not true.

79
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
I'm saying this
because they looked good on you.

80
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
No. Forget it.

81
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,340
- He's right.
- Don't come close.

82
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,280
- Just stop it.
- It was so close.

83
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,100
- Jong Kook.
- So close.

84
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,850
- Just stop.
- Hear me out.

85
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,720
(Stop it!)

86
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,940
Stop it!

87
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,220
- What...
- My gosh.

88
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,450
Stop it. Okay?

89
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,750
- Gosh, it hurts.
- My goodness.

90
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,980
(He uses force to stop the prank.)

91
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,250
Gosh, I'm so upset.

92
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,880
- That was so close.
- I know.

93
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,900
What's wrong with Seok Sam?

94
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,070
Hey, let me try them on.

95
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,130
- Why would you wear them?
- No.

96
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,370
- I'll try them on.
- I bet they will look good on you.

97
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,370
- Let me see.
- They look great.

98
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,690
- Do you like it?
- They're pretty.

99
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,810
(He tries to make up for it
by wearing them himself.)

100
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,940
- They look so cool.
- You look unique.

101
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,200
It's like "Incredible Moment."

102
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
- They're pretty.
- In a net vest.

103
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,570
- A guy in a net vest.
- A guy in a net vest.

104
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,440
- A guy in a net vest.
- It's like "Incredible Moment."

105
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,720
A guy who always wears
tinted glasses and a net vest.

106
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,250
- You look cool.
- Do you like it?

107
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,040
- They look good on you.
- I don't know how to describe it.

108
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,320
You look ten years younger.

109
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,480
You look like a guy in his 50s.

110
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,850
Suk Jin loves to hear this.

111
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,950
You look ten years younger.

112
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,950
I know you're lying.

113
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,160
- No, I'm not.
- You do look ten years younger.

114
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,530
- That's not true.
- He likes that.

115
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,980
Suk Jin, you look
ten years younger.

116
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,060
Seriously, you look
ten years younger.

117
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,250
Suk Jin, you look like
you're in your 30s.

118
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,250
We're serious.

119
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,500
- You look young.
- Ten years younger.

120
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,370
- In his early 40s.
- You look 10 years younger.

121
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,160
You think so?

122
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,760
Gosh, we talked about
a pair of glasses for a long time.

123
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,970
- By the way...
- It was so close.

124
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,040
I went to Jeju Island
with my family.

125
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
- That's right.
- You did?

126
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,940
And I got a tip-off.

127
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,940
- What?
- About what?

128
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,940
You went to Jeju Island, didn't you?

129
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,940
- Me?
- What?

130
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,560
(Se Chan, you went
to Jeju Island, didn't you?)

131
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,210
Yes. You did, right?

132
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,210
- Recently?
- With who?

133
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,740
- I don't know when.
- With Jin Ho?

134
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,680
- He went there with Jin Ho.
- With Jae Joon.

135
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,370
- No.
- With Jae Joon.

136
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,280
No. You...

137
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,220
I got a tip-off that you were
with a woman.

138
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,540
(Did Se Chan go to Jeju Island
with a mysterious woman?)

139
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,540
- What? He just...
- Me? No.

140
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,020
- Seriously...
- Hey, tell us.

141
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,810
- He's caught.
- That's not true.

142
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,690
- I went with Jin Ho and Jae Joon.
- Ji Hyo.

143
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,560
- No.
- When Se Chan saw us earlier...

144
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,460
- As soon as we met,
- Oh, right.

145
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,820
he talked about a yacht party to us.

146
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,290
A yacht party.

147
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,400
(He talked about a yacht party?)

148
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,790
He did talk about a yacht party.

149
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,840
- He did.
- No, I didn't.

150
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,710
- Look how he's reacting.
- He...

151
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,300
As soon as we got here...

152
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,510
- That's ridiculous.
- He did talk about it.

153
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,410
- Hey.
- It was a smokescreen.

154
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,010
- He used Jin Ho and Jae Joon...
- He's been...

155
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,710
- as a smokescreen.
- Let me tell you.

156
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,540
- So...
- He's been busy playing golf.

157
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,610
- No.
- Look at him.

158
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,220
- That sly...
- You rented a car, right?

159
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,540
- Yes.
- You rented a car.

160
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,110
- I had some tea with a guy there.
- I see.

161
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,910
"Se Chan was here before."

162
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,330
- He said this.
- He went there.

163
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,180
So I said, "Oh, really? I see."

164
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,490
Se Chan looks nervous.

165
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,550
This is a scoop.

166
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,790
I know what a spy looks like.

167
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,790
- He looks nervous.
- He looks strange, right?

168
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,790
He's definitely hiding something.

169
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,790
I know.

170
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,790
He looks so anxious.

171
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,010
- He's anxious.
- Jae Suk, that's slander.

172
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,360
I can tell when I see his face.

173
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,800
- I'm sure...
- Isn't it that...

174
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
- you went there with someone else?
- I went with Jae Joon, Jin Ho,

175
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,280
and some other people.

176
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,710
Some other people?

177
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,220
Some other people?

178
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,610
Jae Joon, you...

179
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,610
- And...
- Jin Ho.

180
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,610
Jin Ho.

181
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,610
- That's three.
- Three.

182
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,720
And there were another three.

183
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,910
- They are some other people.
- That makes six.

184
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,980
(The rest 3 people are
shrouded in mystery.)

185
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,720
- Where are the rest 3?
- Where are the other 3?

186
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,720
What are you talking about?

187
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,400
(The mystery of the trip
to Jeju Island is getting bigger.)

188
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,900
Jae Suk, Jae Joon is...

189
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,790
- Was Eun Hyeong there too?
- The other three.

190
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,770
- She joined us later.
- She joined you later?

191
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,930
- So...
- They are smokescreens.

192
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,910
You should tell us about things
like that in advance.

193
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,410
- Right.
- Tell us when you're back.

194
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,780
- He's right.
- "I'm back."

195
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,040
- You should tell us the truth.
- You know what?

196
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,880
- You guys...
- That was a long time ago.

197
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,220
You guys might think...

198
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,340
they would keep it a secret.

199
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,450
- Right.
- But people talk.

200
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,680
- People can see you.
- They talk about what they see.

201
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,090
He's really flustered.

202
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,090
That was a long time ago.

203
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,720
I can't believe this guy.

204
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,790
People talk.

205
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,490
He didn't tell me though.

206
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,330
- Fortunately...
- He didn't say anything.

207
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,490
- He didn't say a thing, but...
- Then how did you find out?

208
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,660
"I can't tell you anything."

209
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,070
"I guess he came with a woman."

210
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,160
"I can't tell you anything."

211
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,600
Of course, he can't.

212
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,080
- He couldn't say anything.
- He didn't say a thing.

213
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,150
- Hey, Se Chan.
- No.

214
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,470
You look cool these days.

215
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,880
Se Chan went to Jeju Island
with some girls!

216
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,110
What are you guys doing?

217
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,410
- That was a long time ago.
- He's a man.

218
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,160
- He's a man.
- What happened to Jin Ho?

219
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,260
Do you still call her?

220
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,350
- Did she pick him over you?
- No.

221
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,830
It didn't go well.

222
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,960
(It didn't go well.)

223
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,220
"It didn't go well."

224
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,490
That's the term.

225
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,860
It didn't work out.

226
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,530
- Oh, no.
- I know what he means.

227
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,660
You should've told us about it.

228
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,430
- Right.
- We would've tried to help you.

229
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,710
You know I'm...

230
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,080
an expert in that field.

231
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,710
- What do you mean you're an expert?
- You should be careful.

232
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,780
I'm a dating expert.
I give dating advice.

233
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,040
- No, that's dangerous.
- Sure.

234
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,040
I was going to set So Min up
with someone,

235
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,150
- but I told her to wait.
- Wait.

236
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,410
I need to know more about him.

237
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,160
But he's been putting me
on hold for two years.

238
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,980
- It's been two years.
- You should give up.

239
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,220
Two years.

240
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,720
I put her on hold.

241
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,700
- Around this time two years ago...
- Okay.

242
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,720
- Two years ago?
- Last year?

243
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,290
You were told to share the R coins
equally to avoid a penalty,

244
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,340
- but you failed to divide them.
- We did?

245
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,530
(In 2020, Sharing Playbook)

246
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,170
(They took as many coins
as they wanted after each mission.)

247
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,210
Hang on.

248
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,020
(They wouldn't be penalized
if they shared the coins equally.)

249
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,180
(Empty)

250
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,090
- Forget it.
- What's wrong?

251
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,280
If you shared the coins equally,
you wouldn't have been penalized.

252
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,350
But someone wanted to win the prize,

253
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,350
and you failed
to split them up evenly.

254
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,350
That's right.

255
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,860
Today, we'd like to test
your loyalty and conscience again.

256
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,530
It's the 2nd Sharing Playbook Race.

257
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,840
- Again?
- We're doing it again.

258
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,270
The rules are the same as before.

259
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,100
After each mission, starting with
the person in the first place,

260
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,670
you'll take as many coins
as you want.

261
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,840
It will never work.

262
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,020
Unlike last time when the number
of coins decided the prize...

263
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,950
(Unlike last time when the number
of coins decided the prize...)

264
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,960
This time, the number of coins
will decide your penalties.

265
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,090
Penalties?

266
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,180
There will be
four different missions.

267
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,850
So you will divide
the coins four times.

268
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,130
Each time, you will get 35 coins.

269
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,070
That means you will be given
a total of 140 coins.

270
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,070
And you will take
as many coins as you want.

271
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,300
And the number of coins you have
will decide what penalty you get.

272
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,380
Please bring in the board.

273
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,910
- I need to see the penalty.
- When will we ever be...

274
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,470
able to avoid a penalty?

275
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,450
We just need
to share the coins equally.

276
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,650
Then we won't get a penalty.

277
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,650
Two years ago, we had that brat.

278
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,450
He's hot here today.

279
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,220
- You mean Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

280
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,720
He's not here anymore.

281
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,090
We need more than 50 coins
to avoid a penalty.

282
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,220
Gosh, we need 50 coins.

283
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,080
- We need more than 50 coins.
- How many are there in total?

284
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,290
There will be a total of 140 coins.

285
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,450
This is so easy.

286
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,460
- It's hard, Haha. It's 140...
- We just need to share them.

287
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,900
Seven multiplied by two
equals fourteen.

288
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,270
This one requires
at least two extra hours.

289
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,200
- Just get to the place.
- You know what?

290
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,410
And it's really scary.

291
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,880
The sky bridge is terrifying.

292
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,980
You know what this is.

293
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,040
What's that?

294
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,070
- Seriously, I can't do that.
- It's so scary.

295
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,110
Why would we do that?

296
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,350
(That's the world's highest bridge
at 541m above the ground.)

297
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,490
(They have to cross
the 11-meter-long bridge.)

298
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,050
- Seriously, I can't do that.
- It's so scary.

299
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,260
- Why would we do that?
- I'm not scared,

300
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,580
- but it's just bothersome.
- Why would one do that?

301
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,660
- Why would you do that?
- It's just bothersome.

302
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,050
You need to go to Jamsil.

303
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,100
I know. I don't want
to go to Jamsil.

304
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,130
I don't understand
why people enjoy it.

305
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,030
- And I don't want a costume.
- I don't like the costume thing.

306
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,460
(2-3 coins: Wear a costume
and makeup for the opening.)

307
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,660
(Running Man has shown
high-quality makeup...)

308
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,910
(with special effects
makeup artists.)

309
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,350
(And the video clips will be
preserved forever.)

310
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,150
This must be really embarrassing.

311
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,490
- BTS? My gosh.
- This is the worst.

312
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,160
- I just can't do this.
- I don't want to do this.

313
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,280
I don't understand...

314
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,310
- why people enjoy it.
- So it means we should...

315
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,920
- have at least seven coins.
- Let's give it a try.

316
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,630
- No, we need 11 coins each.
- Right.

317
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,790
Then it won't be so bad.

318
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,920
We can do this.

319
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,460
- Let's not cheat.
- If someone gets more coins,

320
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,030
- he can share them with others.
- Right.

321
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,530
- I'll share mine.
- Good.

322
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,690
You can't share the coins
you already took.

323
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,530
- Once you take coins, it's over.
- All right.

324
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,300
So we shouldn't
bring too many coins.

325
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,670
Let's have at least
seven coins each.

326
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,610
Guys, just make sure
not to take too many coins.

327
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,280
When we take coins? Okay.

328
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,110
It's 35 coins each.

329
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,650
Let's help each other.
We need at least this.

330
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,070
- At least seven coins.
- Good.

331
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,280
It's just seven coins.

332
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,680
- We have to do this.
- We should help each other.

333
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,710
In the middle of this year,

334
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,360
we should show our teamwork.

335
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,520
Don't put anyone in trouble.

336
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,360
What?

337
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,080
- You are dangerous.
- Even you find it funny.

338
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,320
You're dangerous.
Let's show our teamwork.

339
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,270
- In the middle of the year...
- You know what?

340
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,560
I bet he will be dancing
to BTS' song wearing the glasses.

341
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,060
In Jamsil. On the sky bridge.

342
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,830
I think you will be dancing
in the tinted glasses.

343
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,610
If you share the coins equally,
you'll take rubbings of your faces.

344
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,740
- What?
- If you split up the coins evenly,

345
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,040
- you'll make rubbings.
- That's not bad.

346
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,620
But the story of Se Chan's trip
to Jeju Island...

347
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,170
has had a strong influence on me.

348
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,750
It has nothing to do with this.

349
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,180
- I'm not feeling well.
- By the way,

350
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,810
it would be strange
if he went on a trip with you.

351
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,050
He's right.

352
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,310
So Min, I know you also
go on a date...

353
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,230
- with some guys.
- Right.

354
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,450
But he is...

355
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,600
- I mean...
- She was on my YouTube channel.

356
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,820
She wanted to go
to the US with Se Chan.

357
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,060
- That's what I suggested.
- I thought about it.

358
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,290
- She even said that.
- Just me and her?

359
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,600
No, including me.

360
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,030
- I said that.
- The three of us.

361
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,460
Why would I go to the US
alone with you?

362
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,960
Wait, Jong Kook.
You didn't say anything...

363
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,430
when I wanted
to go to the US with you?

364
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,070
(I told you to take me with you.)

365
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,150
(Cold)

366
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,020
Will you just stay quiet?

367
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,670
He didn't see this coming.

368
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,280
- Jong Kook is flustered.
- It's not like that.

369
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,860
Hey, it's just...

370
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,950
It would be strange
if we go to the US together.

371
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,890
- That doesn't make sense.
- This is what So Min said.

372
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,820
When Jong Kook goes
to the US for a concert,

373
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,630
she wants to tag along.
And he said, "Sure. You can come."

374
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,830
"Can I go with Ji Hyo?"

375
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,830
"No, not Ji Hyo."

376
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,500
- That's not it.
- See?

377
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,530
- He said that.
- I didn't mean I'd go alone.

378
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,030
- I said I wanted to go with So Min.
- Exactly.

379
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,930
- But he said I couldn't go. Why?
- I mean,

380
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,110
it would be strange
for us to leave together.

381
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,510
- He's afraid of rumors.
- Here's the thing.

382
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,110
It looks like we're using So Min...

383
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,520
- as a smokescreen.
- If you three leave together,

384
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,540
it will look like
So Min is a smokescreen.

385
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,580
Exactly.

386
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,780
He knows that
because he has experience.

387
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,120
Then all three of us can't go.

388
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,910
It would look like a double date.

389
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,950
- The four of us?
- Yes.

390
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,050
I never intended to go
with the three of you.

391
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,320
- He's too busy.
- You all can't go.

392
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,550
No one goes to the US.

393
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,000
- I have to go.
- You can't.

394
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,100
- Don't go.
- I...

395
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,730
- I have to perform there.
- Don't go.

396
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,370
It will be all settled
if I join you.

397
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,960
- Take me with you.
- But...

398
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,140
- It's all settled.
- If you join then,

399
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,800
the purpose of the trip will change.

400
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,930
It's like a trip with parents.

401
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,850
If I join you, it will just look
like a trip with colleagues.

402
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,010
Ji Hyo is so funny.

403
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,280
All right. Let's begin...

404
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,710
the first mission to distribute
the first batch of coins.

405
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,810
Let's chant together
before we start.

406
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,360
- We can do this.
- Let's help each other.

407
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,410
- We should help each other.
- Right.

408
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,550
- I just need seven coins.
- We can do this.

409
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,050
- One, two, three. Let's go.
- Let's go.

410
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,630
- Seriously, I'll do that.
- Sure.

411
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,730
(Will they change after 2 years?)

412
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,950
- I need only seven coins.
- All right.

413
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,630
Here's the first mission...

414
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,600
where you need good gut feelings
and supernatural powers.

415
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,110
- It's called Let Me Clock In.
- What is in?

416
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,460
- Clock in?
- What's that?

417
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,300
You will first check
the starting point.

418
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,140
Then you will put on a blindfold
and start walking.

419
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,440
You will fold your hands
behind your back...

420
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,040
and walk as much as you want
toward the door.

421
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,410
When you stop, you should stick out
your nose as much as you can.

422
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,680
The points of the spot
where your nose is placed...

423
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,260
and the number of steps you took
will be put together.

424
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,950
The one with the lowest points
will be the winner.

425
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,320
Simply put,

426
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,730
- there will be a door.
- Okay.

427
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,130
And you need to get
as close to the door as possible.

428
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,130
(The one who goes closest
to the door will win.)

429
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,270
- But...
- What if we touch the door?

430
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,190
you need to take
as little steps as possible.

431
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,770
The number of steps... I mean...

432
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,300
- Like this.
- You need to take long strides.

433
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,430
(Shaking)

434
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,670
- Like this.
- You need to take long strides.

435
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,750
The one who takes only
three steps is more likely to win.

436
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,070
- He doesn't understand.
- I shouldn't have told him.

437
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,570
- He would've done this.
- He's so lovely.

438
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,280
He's so cute.

439
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,210
He just can't wait to get a penalty.

440
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,020
He wants to go to Jamsil.

441
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,950
Can we do this?
We're not supposed to practice.

442
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,420
- My goodness.
- This is hard.

443
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,920
If you touch the door,
you get zero points.

444
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,790
- I see.
- Is it okay to go out of my way?

445
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,320
- Is it okay to practice?
- Can we practice?

446
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,270
- No.
- You can't do that.

447
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,930
- You can't practice.
- They are so uptight.

448
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,700
- You're not supposed to practice.
- Okay.

449
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,110
Hey, what are you...

450
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,610
(He takes a long step
after criticizing So Min.)

451
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,880
Why are you practicing it?

452
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,700
- You can't do that.
- All right.

453
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,440
I just walked.

454
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,980
You don't have to try so hard.

455
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,980
We will take only seven coins each.

456
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,980
- That's right.
- Sure.

457
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,780
- Why are you trying so hard?
- He's right.

458
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,350
- Jae Suk, what are you doing?
- Stop it.

459
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,210
You said you wouldn't practice it.

460
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,620
You don't have to try so hard.

461
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,550
- What are you doing?
- It's okay to get zero points.

462
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,680
- Why did you practice it?
- I didn't practice it.

463
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,730
- I should try going this way.
- All right.

464
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,420
All right.

465
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,820
Stop walking around.

466
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,660
(He's done
with the nose simulation.)

467
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,830
Why did you do that?

468
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,270
It's no big deal.

469
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,910
- Why are you trying so hard?
- Why?

470
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,430
- We'll just take seven coins each.
- What?

471
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,850
- Stop it.
- Let's just take five coins each.

472
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,300
Five times seven is thirty-five.

473
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,040
Who will go first?

474
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,120
- I'll go first.
- Are you sure?

475
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,250
- Yes.
- Really?

476
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,440
- Okay.
- You can make some noise...

477
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,180
to distract her.

478
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,050
- Can I kick her when she walks?
- No.

479
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,230
What if she goes out of the way?

480
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,950
Then it will increase the number
of her steps as she comes back.

481
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,260
- I shouldn't have gone first.
- It doesn't matter...

482
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,190
- because we will share the coins.
- We will get five coins anyway.

483
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,820
So Min. Why did you
want to go first?

484
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,660
- Why did you do that?
- You go first.

485
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,900
What do I do? Okay.

486
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,140
I shouldn't have said that.

487
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,270
Ready.

488
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,030
We're a team.

489
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,200
Start.

490
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,980
Start.

491
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,910
- Oh, gosh.
- She's good.

492
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,620
(One step)

493
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,940
(Two steps)

494
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,390
- You should keep counting.
- Oh, my. Be careful.

495
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,810
(Five steps)

496
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,520
You should keep counting.

497
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,660
(Six steps)

498
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,290
- Hey, stay on the mat.
- Oh, gosh.

499
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,950
- Hey.
- Seven.

500
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,100
How many steps did you take?

501
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,420
(She's walking straight
in the accurate direction.)

502
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,330
(Nine steps)

503
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,460
(She got close to the door
only with ten steps.)

504
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,780
(She's right in front of the door!)

505
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,070
(Could she get
as close to the door as she could?)

506
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,260
(She gets surprised and groans.)

507
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,780
(She hit her nose on the door.)

508
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,230
- You got zero points.
- Zero points.

509
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,100
(Frog hurt her nose
as she got too close to the door.)

510
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,270
Is your nose okay?

511
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,770
- Are you all right?
- You were getting too close to it.

512
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,160
- Are you okay?
- Gosh. What happened?

513
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,560
Why did I... That's weird.
I didn't think I was that close...

514
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
- I guess I was wrong.
- She did well in the beginning.

515
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,270
You got zero points.
You're in last place.

516
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,530
- She's in the last place?
- Yes.

517
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,910
- Do we put our noses on the floor?
- No.

518
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,040
- No.
- You should stick it forward.

519
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,670
- Why would you put it on the floor?
- I didn't know.

520
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,780
- What should I do?
- Why would you put it on the floor?

521
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,250
- Should I squat down like this...
- What's wrong with him?

522
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,310
- Why would you do that?
- I can just stick my head forward?

523
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,360
(Seok Sam always understands
game rules differently from others.)

524
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,050
What is he talking about?

525
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,080
I'll start.

526
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,160
(Next up is Haha.)

527
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,030
- That's 2.
- Yes, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

528
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,870
Do you remember
how many steps you took?

529
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,140
(He walked with long strides.
He's already halfway through.)

530
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,270
(Ji Hyo puts her palm in front of
his nose to disturb him.)

531
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,570
(Haha stops.)

532
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,750
(He walks with shorter steps now.)

533
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,620
- He got confused.
- Right.

534
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,710
(Will their plan to disturb him
work out?)

535
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,890
- He's almost there.
- Yes.

536
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,310
- He's close to it.
- No.

537
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,950
(He sticks his nose out carefully
as if he'd made up his mind.)

538
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,030
Is that it?

539
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,860
- You're a coward.
- That's it.

540
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,230
- You're a coward.
- He's a coward.

541
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,230
(The coward stopped
halfway through the track.)

542
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,370
- Gosh, seriously.
- You should've moved further.

543
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,600
- You coward.
- You got 19 points.

544
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,690
You're a coward.
You should've moved further.

545
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
I'll start.

546
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,410
(Next up is Se Chan.)

547
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,410
(Striding)

548
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,350
He has muscular calves.

549
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,650
Five.

550
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,210
(He's moving forward fast
with his muscular calves.)

551
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,480
Six.

552
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,010
(Sticking her lips out)

553
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,790
(The cheesy girl sticks her lips out
toward Se Chan.)

554
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:37,160
Seriously, she never stops.

555
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,020
Hey, what are you doing?

556
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,640
(They're about to kiss.)

557
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,900
Go ahead if you think you can do it.

558
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,930
You're really something.

559
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,640
Is that it? Okay. Stop.

560
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,580
Seven steps and two points.
You got nine points.

561
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,110
Okay. I'm in the first place.

562
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,470
- You're in 1st place.
- You're in 1st place.

563
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,670
(Se Chan got a total of 9 points
including 7 steps and 2 points.)

564
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,440
(Se Chan is currently
in first place.)

565
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,510
Good job.

566
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,550
I'll take only five coins.

567
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,850
- Hey, why did you do well?
- Just take five coins.

568
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,010
- Take no more than that.
- Why did you do well?

569
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,390
You took 14 steps.
Your total score is 18 points.

570
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,750
Eight points and nine steps.
You got seventeen points in total.

571
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,630
- Your total score is 18 points.
- I got 18 points?

572
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,720
(Jong Kook: 18, Ji Hyo: 18,
Suk Jin: 17, Jae Suk: 17)

573
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,190
As a result of the first round,
So Min is in last place.

574
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
And Se Chan came in first.

575
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,840
- Okay.
- Oh, my.

576
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,310
Jae Suk placed second.

577
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,230
- It must be really important.
- Suk Jin placed third.

578
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,930
Jong Kook placed fourth.

579
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,270
- Ji Hyo placed fifth.
- I can't believe this.

580
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,500
Haha placed sixth.

581
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,580
And So Min placed seventh.

582
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,440
- Please leave some for me.
- Of course.

583
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,910
We all agreed to take five each.
I didn't do my best.

584
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,180
- Of course.
- I'll take only five coins.

585
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,350
Don't worry.

586
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,480
- Right.
- You don't have to worry about it.

587
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,590
If our plan falls through
in the beginning,

588
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,830
- it will be that way to the end.
- That's right.

589
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,660
Haha's right. If you don't leave
coins for us, that means war.

590
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,750
- That means war.
- I'm serious.

591
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,990
Se Chan, you shouldn't take all
from the first round.

592
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,130
I'll take only five coins this time.
Okay.

593
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,300
Come on.
You have nothing to worry about.

594
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,930
- Don't provoke me from the start.
- It's ready.

595
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,500
- Se Chan, you can go now.
- Okay.

596
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,760
I think I'll be upset.

597
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,970
- I'll take five coins.
- I'll be upset.

598
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,340
- If there's nothing left,
- But Se Chan...

599
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,270
- I'll be upset.
- Don't do that in the first round.

600
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,310
If there are no coins left...

601
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,740
(The members seem so serious.
How many coins will Se Chan take?)

602
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,880
Wait.

603
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,480
(Contemplating)

604
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,980
(There are 35 coins
in front of his eyes.)

605
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,980
(Penalty List)

606
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,020
(The number of coins determines
the penalty they receive.)

607
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:22,830
(They promised to divide the coins
evenly regardless of the order.)

608
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,340
(The other members will be upset
if he doesn't keep the promise.)

609
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,840
(Se Chan picked up five coins
as he promised.)

610
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,880
Five coins.

611
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,380
What's the penalty for seven coins?

612
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,580
It's to have a bucket of ink
poured on you.

613
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,210
Gosh, that's not good.

614
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,980
Ten coins.

615
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,890
(He decided to betray the others.)

616
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,090
(Se Chan took 15 coins in a flash.)

617
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,690
I have 15 coins now.
That's good, right?

618
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,720
What's the penalty for 15 coins?

619
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,020
To have water poured on you.

620
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,220
No. I need more coins.

621
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,370
What's the penalty for 20 coins?

622
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,230
To make a rubbed copy of your face.

623
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,230
For 20 coins?

624
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,700
I have no choice.

625
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,410
I'll take 20 coins.

626
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,140
Please go that way
and get on the bus over there.

627
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,230
Got it.

628
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,150
The next member can go now.

629
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,350
Me?

630
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,170
I promise I'll just...

631
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,180
- I should've won the game.
- I trust you, Jae Suk.

632
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,680
I trust them.

633
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,180
Jae Suk, take only five coins!

634
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,680
Yes!

635
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,890
Jae Suk, take only five coins!

636
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,090
(But...)

637
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,400
(There are only 15 coins left.)

638
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,360
- How many coins did he take?
- There are 15 coins left.

639
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,400
- Fifteen coins?
- Yes. Fifteen coins are left.

640
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,400
- Fifteen?
- Yes.

641
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,870
You can take as many as you want.

642
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,600
(Jae Suk picks up coins
without hesitating.)

643
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,570
(How many did he take?)

644
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,380
I need to get
the least number of coins.

645
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,410
It's up to them. There could be war.

646
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,440
Absolutely.

647
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,970
I won't let it slide
if they provoke me.

648
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,440
- I'm...
- That doesn't mean anything.

649
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,620
I won't let it slide. I'm serious.

650
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,410
- Will they do it from the start?
- You're next after me.

651
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,090
You shouldn't expect anything.

652
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,750
- They'll probably betray us.
- Let's compete against them.

653
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,160
The third member, Suk Jin,
you can go now.

654
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,890
- Okay. I'll be quick.
- The 1st 3 will most likely do it.

655
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,630
Here?

656
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,160
This is it?

657
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,300
These are all that's left?

658
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,800
(Only four coins are left?)

659
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,840
These are all that's left?

660
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,840
There are four coins left.

661
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,810
Gosh. Those punks are unbelievable.

662
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,580
(Following Se Chan who took
20 coins, Jae Suk took 11 coins.)

663
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,770
I can't believe them.

664
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,550
(Suk Jin took all four coins
while grumbling.)

665
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,910
(There's no coin left now.)

666
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,510
Hey, that was not cool at all.

667
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,440
You guys, how could you?

668
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,160
- Why?
- Out of 35 coins...

669
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,790
- I mean...
- I took only five. What about you?

670
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,830
Did you take 30 of them?

671
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,130
- What are you talking about?
- You took five coins?

672
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,020
- Yes. How many coins were left?
- Gosh.

673
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,220
Four coins.

674
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,020
- Only 4 coins?
- There were 4 coins left.

675
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,830
- I bet you took all of them.
- Of course, I did.

676
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,300
You didn't even leave five coins.
Of course, I took them all.

677
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,270
- There's no coin left.
- You should take them out.

678
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,270
Come on. Take them out.

679
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,080
- There's no coin left.
- Are you serious?

680
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,700
Fine.

681
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,270
(He walks away angrily,
which means there will be war.)

682
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,650
I knew there would be no coin left.

683
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,350
(The next member Ji Hyo...)

684
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,680
(and Haha saw the empty tray.)

685
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,180
I feel so betrayed. Seriously...

686
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,290
There's no coin left.

687
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,020
(Everyone including So Min has
checked the coin tray.)

688
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,220
It's going to be a war.

689
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,400
- Jae Suk.
- The two of them took all of them.

690
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,190
Jae Suk,
you shouldn't have done it.

691
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,720
- Ji Hyo, it wasn't me.
- I'm disappointed.

692
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,640
- I'm disappointed too.
- I'm really disappointed.

693
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,610
- We all agreed to take 5 coins.
- To take 5 coins each.

694
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,340
- It could've been a great day.
- Who took...

695
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,840
- This means war.
- Forget it.

696
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,000
- Come here.
- Oh, no.

697
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,310
What are you doing now?

698
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,380
Hey, the two of them took
all the coins.

699
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,580
Look. Jae Suk took all the coins.

700
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,710
This means war.

701
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,740
- Let me pick them up first.
- I'm really upset.

702
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,550
I'm genuinely upset.
Be prepared for war.

703
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,250
- You came in last place.
- I'll teach you a lesson.

704
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,590
- Up to how many...
- We'll play four games in total.

705
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,860
- No. I mean, the sky bridge.
- One coin.

706
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,100
Up to one coin.

707
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,330
- Up to one coin?
- Yes.

708
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,070
I'll go cross the sky bridge
if I don't place first.

709
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,920
- Jong Kook.
- To make the staff members suffer.

710
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,260
- I think you're right.
- Yes? Right.

711
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,070
- I'll do that if I don't win.
- Gosh, I'm so upset.

712
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,200
- I took five coins.
- I see that Jong Kook is angry.

713
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,880
- This is...
- I'll go with the sky bridge.

714
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,500
- Jong Kook must be very upset.
- I've made up my mind.

715
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,240
- What's the penalty for 30 coins?
- It was empty when I went there.

716
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
(30 to 39 coins:
Drinking sophora root tea)

717
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,470
- It was empty.
- To drink sophora root tea.

718
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,120
- Sophora root tea?
- Ji Hyo, the worse penalties are...

719
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,440
Shut it, you punk.

720
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,940
- a bucket of...
- Exactly.

721
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,620
I only took five coins, Ji Hyo.

722
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,480
You punk, I don't want to hear
anything you say.

723
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,220
Okay.

724
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,160
- The five of us...
- Yes?

725
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,690
will aim to take down Jae Suk
and Se Chan no matter what.

726
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,690
- We have to win two games.
- You know what I mean, right?

727
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,230
- Those two will get a penalty.
- It's 5 against 2.

728
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,840
- He says that it's 5 against 2.
- Sorry?

729
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,580
- We don't have to film it today.
- We're their targets.

730
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,380
Do you understand?
We must work together.

731
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,240
- I think that Se Chan...
- Let's oust the two of them!

732
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
- Let's oust them!
- Let's do that!

733
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,680
- Listen.
- That's not necessary.

734
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,820
Suk Jin took a lot of coins.

735
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,910
Suk Jin will...

736
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,590
We took... I'll be honest with you.

737
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,160
I left more than ten coins.

738
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,920
(He's lying.)

739
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,490
- Suk Jin.
- It's true.

740
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,600
- That's true.
- Tell us honestly.

741
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,100
- I left more than ten coins.
- My gosh.

742
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,490
- After Jae Suk, it went faster.
- Hey.

743
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,640
- Exactly.
- Listen to me.

744
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,370
Does it make sense
that they left more than ten coins?

745
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,460
- Yes, we did.
- Of course.

746
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,310
It would make sense
if I took ten coins.

747
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,000
I bet you took 20 coins,
and he took more than 10 coins.

748
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
- No.
- You're wrong.

749
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,170
Suk Jin took more than ten coins.

750
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,550
- Why are you pretending you didn't?
- He took more than ten coins.

751
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,120
You know that I can't beat them
when they join forces...

752
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,980
- Okay. I believe you.
- You believe me, right?

753
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,120
I'll tell you honestly.

754
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,820
How many coins did you take?
Be honest with us.

755
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,980
- How many do you have?
- How many?

756
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,060
(Suk Jin suddenly said
he'd reveal how many coins he had.)

757
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,480
- Nonsense.
- You're lying.

758
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,490
(He lied that he had three coins.)

759
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,490
(Nonsense.)

760
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,600
Suk Jin. Everyone,
it's 4 against 3 now.

761
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,230
- Stop lying.
- No. I'm not lying. Hey.

762
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,410
- You have to believe me.
- We're sitting with our teams.

763
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,700
- You got the wrong idea.
- You got me wrong.

764
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,930
- Honestly, I took four coins.
- Stop lying.

765
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,910
I took four coins.
Now, try to guess.

766
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,170
Obviously, he took 20 coins,
and he took 11 coins.

767
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,050
- Stop talking nonsense.
- They took 20 and 11 coins.

768
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,010
- Suk Jin.
- That would be just as predictable.

769
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,620
- I'll tell you honestly.
- That makes sense.

770
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,390
- Se Chan said...
- I left eight coins.

771
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,090
that it would be predictable.

772
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,980
- I left eight coins.
- That makes him look suspicious.

773
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,060
- Suk Jin is unbelievable.
- Totally.

774
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,180
What did he say?

775
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,420
He said that what you said was
too predictable.

776
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,130
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- Yes?

777
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,260
He's acting strange
because of his trip to Jeju Island.

778
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,410
- He can't think clearly now.
- You're defending him.

779
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,700
- He can't think clearly now.
- He's defending Se Chan.

780
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,200
- He's not in his right mind.
- That's true.

781
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,880
- Anyway, it made things simple.
- But we can't edit it out.

782
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,120
We'll convince the staff
to edit that part out...

783
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
Yes?

784
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,740
- if you give us some coins.
- Right.

785
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,890
Am I allowed to give away coins?

786
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,660
(He's tempted.)

787
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,790
We'll begin the second mission
right away.

788
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,180
- Okay.
- It's worth ten coins.

789
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,720
In the second mission,

790
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,400
you will look back
at the past six years.

791
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,330
It's History Journal Running Man.

792
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,570
- History Journal Running Man?
- Gosh.

793
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,640
You will take turns
saying an episode number...

794
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,910
- of Running Man.
- An episode number?

795
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,770
The member who won in the episode
gets one point.

796
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,610
And the member who gets a penalty
loses one point.

797
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,670
Your total score will determine...

798
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,120
- your rankings.
- But...

799
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,510
those who got a penalty often are
at a disadvantage.

800
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,410
Isn't it unfair?
I'm at a disadvantage.

801
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,650
I'll probably lose a point
every time.

802
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,210
- Here.
- What's that?

803
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,160
These are the episode numbers
for each year.

804
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,250
- I don't remember clearly.
- I remember nothing.

805
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,130
- What's that?
- You can pick...

806
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,630
any of these numbers.

807
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,860
- Pick a time when you did well.
- I see.

808
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,220
The member who won the race
in the chosen episode gets a point.

809
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,040
But I didn't win in many episodes.

810
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,490
- You can pick a recent episode too.
- Got it.

811
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,310
- We can just remember the episode?
- Yes, that's correct.

812
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,500
- But I can't remember any.
- Okay.

813
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,410
We celebrated the 400th, 500th,
and 600th episodes.

814
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,270
- Yes.
- You can think of special episodes.

815
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,650
- Gosh, I can't remember any.
- The winner gets one point?

816
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,050
- I really can't remember any.
- I think I have a chance to win.

817
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,170
- I can't remember at all.
- Then...

818
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,210
Yesterday's episode was
the 610th episode.

819
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,710
- Don't look at that.
- When did I win?

820
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,710
- Any of you can go first.
- I never won.

821
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,010
- I don't remember.
- I don't remember either.

822
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,290
I'll just pick an episode randomly.

823
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,950
(I...)

824
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,920
(I pick Episode 600.)

825
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,420
- I pick Episode 600.
- I'll pick one randomly.

826
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,330
- Episode 600?
- It was a special episode.

827
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,660
- Where we teamed up together?
- Yes.

828
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,910
(The winner will get 1 point,
and the loser will lose 1 point.)

829
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,730
We can just reminisce about
those days.

830
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,040
In Episode 600,

831
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,050
Ji Hyo won the race,
and Suk Jin got a penalty.

832
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,110
(Suk Jin got a penalty,
and Ji Hyo won the race.)

833
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,170
It's the episode
where Suk Jin wrote a letter...

834
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,120
to thank the viewers
on behalf of the entire team.

835
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,820
- Oh, I remember that.
- One.

836
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,910
(Suk Jin wrote a letter
to the viewers as a penalty.)

837
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,620
(Episode 600, April 2022,)

838
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,320
(With Viewers
made with the viewers' ideas)

839
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,060
(At the final draw, Ji Hyo won,
and Suk Jin lost as expected.)

840
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,330
(Suk Jin wrote a heartfelt letter
getting emotional.)

841
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,690
(Their memories came back
as they heard about the result.)

842
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,190
- We shot the episode...
- I remember that.

843
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,840
- At a wedding venue.
- That's right.

844
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,460
Ji Hyo got 1 point,
and Suk Jin lost 1 point.

845
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,410
- Ji Hyo did a great job.
- I lost one point.

846
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,910
- I'll go next.
- Okay.

847
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,200
(Episode numbers by year)

848
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Episode 490.

849
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,580
- Episode 490?
- Who won?

850
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,510
- Episode 490...
- In Episode 490...

851
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,740
(Running Countdown)

852
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,180
Kang Han Na and Heo Kyeong Hwan
came on the show.

853
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,010
(What? Did I win the race?)

854
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,320
- I don't think I've ever won.
- I think I won the race.

855
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,920
The race continued in Episode 491,

856
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,480
so we didn't have the winner
in that episode.

857
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,630
Then what happens?
Won't he get another chance?

858
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,330
- No, he won't.
- Oh, no.

859
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,330
- I'll just...
- Suk Jin.

860
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,540
- I pick...
- Only after they joined the show.

861
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,490
- I pick Episode 555.
- I see.

862
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,810
- Episode 555?
- Yes.

863
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,410
- I just picked a random episode.
- Gosh, I can't remember at all.

864
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,840
- I picked it randomly.
- All right.

865
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,110
- In Episode 555,
- What did we do?

866
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,880
we had the Empty Head Land race.

867
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,380
Suk Jin and Haha got penalties,
and the rest won.

868
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,710
(Suk Jin and Haha got penalties,
and the rest won.)

869
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,890
Really?

870
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:05,390
(The other members escaped
Empty Head Land by knocking.)

871
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:11,800
(Haha and Suk Jin who were spies
made the empty head video clip.)

872
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,570
Each of the 5 members got 1 point.

873
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,130
- Jae Suk did well that day.
- Be careful.

874
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,340
(Suk Jin picked the episode
where he got a penalty.)

875
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,340
Gosh, why did I...

876
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,070
I was a spy in that episode.

877
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,200
Right. I remember that.

878
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,910
Are we going to get coins
after this game as well?

879
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,640
- Yes, of course.
- This is driving me nuts.

880
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,000
When was I called Jeon So Bal?
That was the only episode...

881
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,810
- in which I won.
- I must be in the top two.

882
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,320
- I don't remember when it was.
- Those who have won many races...

883
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,670
are at an advantage.

884
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,820
Jae Suk hasn't done it.

885
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,820
I haven't done it yet.

886
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,180
- Wait. Was it before that episode?
- Jae Suk.

887
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,250
Pick Episode 609.

888
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,220
You'll get a penalty
if you pick that episode.

889
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,220
Pick Episode 609.

890
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,560
You'll get a penalty
for three weeks in a row.

891
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,920
Pick Episode 609.

892
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,330
I pick Episode 605.

893
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,300
- Episode 605?
- Episode 605.

894
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Didn't you get a penalty?

895
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,070
- I think he did.
- In Episode 605,

896
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,730
Kim Ji Young, Hwang Seog Jeong,
and Hong Ye Ji came on the show.

897
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,730
- It wasn't long ago.
- Hold on.

898
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,140
Haha was the sole winner.

899
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,930
- That's right.
- He won.

900
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,200
- Yes, he won. He was a spy.
- How did I win?

901
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,770
- Oh, right. I was a spy.
- We failed to catch him.

902
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,880
- He was hiding.
- There was no penalty.

903
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,470
- He kept running from us.
- Right.

904
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,670
Yes, I remember that now.

905
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,710
- He was so sly.
- May I go next?

906
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,410
- What's the most recent episode?
- I can't remember the episode.

907
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,910
- Can I pick Episode 609?
- Yes.

908
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,830
- I pick Episode 609.
- Episode 609?

909
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,220
You picked it to take someone down.

910
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,330
(The target is obvious.)

911
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,250
- You little...
- It's Jae Suk.

912
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,130
In Episode 609, we went on vacation.

913
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,330
No one got a penalty.

914
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,430
- Oh, right.
- Good. Okay.

915
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,490
- I pick...
- Episode 608.

916
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,110
- I pick Episode 603.
- Episode 608.

917
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,310
- Episode 608.
- I'll check both episodes.

918
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,310
- Episode 603.
- In Episode 608,

919
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,810
- Jae Suk got a penalty.
- Gosh.

920
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,350
This is unfair.

921
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,120
In Episode 603,

922
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,440
we had The 1st Division Game race
where we used a roulette.

923
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,590
Jae Suk won,
and So Min got a penalty.

924
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,820
(Jae Suk won,
and So Min got a penalty.)

925
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,120
Right. So Min got a penalty.

926
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,320
That was good.
You picked the right one.

927
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,480
- Okay. I picked the right episode.
- Okay. Then I pick Episode 597.

928
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,660
Episode 597?

929
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,900
- Just one more, please.
- Let's keep going until we arrive.

930
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,130
Please let me find the episode
where I won the race.

931
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,340
So Min wants to find
the only episode where she won.

932
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,100
- The Jeon So Bal special.
- I've won just once.

933
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,640
- Really?
- Just once.

934
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,580
The guests were Park Ah In,
Kim Hee Jung, and Roh Jeong Eui.

935
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,310
So Min was the sole winner.

936
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,940
Suk Jin got a penalty.

937
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,380
- Darn it!
- How did you pick that?

938
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,470
How did you pick it?

939
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,050
Jae Suk and Suk Jin got penalties.

940
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,550
- He got a penalty...
- I got a penalty in every episode.

941
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,590
- How did you pick that episode?
- How did you do that?

942
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,410
- I thought of the episodes 1 by 1.
- She remembered...

943
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,590
Oh, I see.

944
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,420
- I'll go next.
- Around that time?

945
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,830
- That's amazing.
- I'll pick an old episode.

946
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,920
- I pick...
- I think I'll be in last place.

947
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,570
Episode 348.

948
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,020
- It was your 2nd week on the show.
- Our 2nd week on the show.

949
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,140
I got a penalty for weeks in a row
right after I joined the show.

950
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,430
All right. In Episode 348,

951
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,930
we went on a one-day trip
with Jang Do Yeon.

952
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:38,970
- Do Yeon.
- Right.

953
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,110
Jae Suk and Se Chan got
penalty stickers.

954
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,820
Gosh. Why are
those who got penalties...

955
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,320
always us?

956
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,510
Why us?

957
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,710
- Let me try.
- Sure. Go ahead.

958
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,980
Episode 632.

959
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,390
We haven't made 632 episodes yet.

960
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,660
(Episode 632?)

961
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,680
(It will air in the future.)

962
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,220
- Suk Jin, what's wrong with you?
- He saw the future.

963
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,660
- He's a time traveler.
- I pick...

964
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,960
- Who wins in that episode?
- A time traveler.

965
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,400
- It's not you.
- Episode 450.

966
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,340
- I pick...
- Who wins in that episode?

967
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,690
- A time traveler.
- Episode 450.

968
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,840
- Episode 450.
- Episode 450.

969
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,500
- Okay.
- I can't remember...

970
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,910
In Episode 450,
Lee Dong Hwi came on the show.

971
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,080
- Dong Hwi?
- Dong Hwi?

972
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,910
Jong Kook, Haha, and So Min won.

973
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,120
- Really?
- So Min?

974
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,790
And Jae Suk and Suk Jin
got penalties.

975
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,210
- Why is it always me?
- Not again.

976
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,210
I pick Episode 577.

977
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,720
Jae Suk and Se Chan got penalties.

978
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,220
- We got penalties?
- Oh, right.

979
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,920
Episode 604.

980
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,720
Suk Jin, Se Chan, and So Min
got penalties.

981
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,130
- Darn it.
- Oh, right.

982
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,830
- Oh, right.
- I lost in almost every episode.

983
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,430
- The one with black roses?
- Yes.

984
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,040
- Oh, right.
- I lost in almost every episode.

985
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,410
Ji Hyo is currently in first place.

986
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,640
- Really?
- Episode 598.

987
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,310
Suk Jin, Se Chan, and Jae Suk
went into the water as a penalty.

988
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:48,000
- Right. Darn it.
- I forgot about that.

989
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,850
- I remember that.
- The others won the race, right?

990
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,710
Why am I always the one
who got a penalty?

991
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,410
- I think...
- We got the result.

992
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,560
With 5 points, Ji Hyo placed 1st.

993
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,590
With 3 points, Jong Kook placed 2nd.

994
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,590
What? He placed second?

995
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,420
Haha and So Min are tied
for third place.

996
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,860
- They'll play rock-paper-scissors.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

997
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,130
- So Min, you have a chance to win.
- Haha and So Min, go ahead.

998
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,690
Rock-paper-scissors, okay!

999
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
You did well.

1000
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Haha is in 3rd place,
and So Min is in 4th place.

1001
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,340
Jae Suk placed 5th,
and Se Chan placed 6th.

1002
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,910
- I'm doomed.
- Suk Jin placed seventh.

1003
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,070
I'm doomed.

1004
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,310
How many coins do we get this time?

1005
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,580
- I wish I could place 1st...
- Do we get 30 coins?

1006
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,930
- You get 35 coins.
- I wish I could win just once.

1007
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,410
- Would you take all the coins?
- Suk Jin, we'll get five each.

1008
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,650
- Of course.
- Guys, just take five coins.

1009
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,320
Let's get out and collect the coins.

1010
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,510
- Okay.
- Okay.

1011
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,750
I haven't seen this in a long time.

1012
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,220
We're doing this again.

1013
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,720
The tray will be
on the conveyor belt.

1014
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,990
Please go into the booth
according to your rankings.

1015
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,730
Ji Hyo, you placed first.

1016
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,800
- It'll be a war again.
- You placed first.

1017
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,310
- I placed 1st.
- So Min, you placed 4th.

1018
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,310
When will I be ranked high?

1019
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,910
I want to place first
at least once before the end.

1020
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,650
Let's all be reasonable.

1021
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:57,270
You see, I have my own plan.

1022
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,380
I don't even expect them
to leave any coins for us.

1023
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,390
(Penalty List)

1024
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,910
The water, fresh cream, and ink...
Those are the worst.

1025
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,210
- Gosh.
- From 7 to 18 coins.

1026
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:08,330
I want to avoid ink and cream.
I need at least 11 more coins.

1027
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,660
I need 20 coins.
The face rubbing doesn't sound bad.

1028
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,020
If I get 40 coins, I only have to
break a gourd bowl.

1029
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,630
- Breaking a gourd bowl?
- Sophora root tea isn't so bad.

1030
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,930
- I want an exemption.
- Flogging? I can bear with it.

1031
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,910
- Flogging? Right.
- Yes. Flogging.

1032
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,700
Suk Jin, what's your limit?
Dancing in the lobby?

1033
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,470
- Dancing in the lobby?
- What's your limit?

1034
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,410
- Dancing in the lobby.
- I see.

1035
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,700
(4-6 coins: Dance to BTS
in the lobby without cameras.)

1036
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,670
- I see.
- We'll begin now.

1037
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,820
The conveyor belt will move.
Take as many coins as you want.

1038
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,940
- Gosh.
- I left more than ten coins.

1039
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,790
Everyone, take only five coins.

1040
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,480
Just take one.

1041
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,590
(The coin tray started moving.)

1042
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,830
Just take 5 coins each.
Let's divide 35 coins evenly.

1043
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,020
Ji Hyo, come on.

1044
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,690
(Ji Hyo takes 15 coins.)

1045
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,360
- Don't be too greedy.
- Okay.

1046
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,630
I'm sure Ji Hyo didn't take
all the coins.

1047
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,070
- Of course, she didn't.
- Don't take too many.

1048
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,430
Did Ji Hyo take them all?

1049
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,200
(There are 20 coins left.)

1050
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,470
Jong Kook.

1051
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,740
Jong Kook, leave some for me.

1052
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,270
You're a reasonable person.

1053
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,880
- Jong Kook.
- Let's divide 35 coins evenly.

1054
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,480
- Let us have one coin each.
- You're a reasonable person.

1055
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,620
(Jong Kook said he didn't need coins
because he'd cross the sky bridge.)

1056
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,510
- Oh, I see.
- Jong Kook.

1057
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,420
(4-6 coins: Dance to BTS
in the lobby without cameras.)

1058
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,660
(7-10 coins: Have a bucket of ink
poured on you.)

1059
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
(15-18 coins: Have a bucket of water
poured on you.)

1060
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,330
(He takes 15 coins suddenly.)

1061
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,520
You might not place first again.
Just take them all.

1062
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,690
No, I mean... Listen. Come closer.

1063
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:29,000
Let's take 15 each
and get the water bucket penalty.

1064
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,210
That sounds good.

1065
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,870
- We take 15 each? The water bucket?
- Yes.

1066
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,370
- Okay. That sounds good.
- What do you say?

1067
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,920
(That's why he took 15 coins.)

1068
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,310
Don't stick your head out.

1069
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,750
We can't see your hands anyway.
It's blocked.

1070
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,790
Stay inside the booth.

1071
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,580
- Just let us have one each.
- But we want to see you.

1072
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,790
You can see my hands.

1073
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,190
- Gosh, seriously.
- You can see my hands.

1074
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,920
- Jong Kook!
- Gosh. Hey.

1075
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,420
- Haha.
- I'm older than you!

1076
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,100
Haha!

1077
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,230
- I bet he didn't leave any coins.
- Haha.

1078
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,500
- There's no coin left.
- I guess it's empty.

1079
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,940
- Okay.
- Really?

1080
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,910
- They took all the coins.
- I guess it's empty.

1081
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,540
- Ten coins...
- I don't expect to get any coins...

1082
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,080
- because So Min is right before me.
- They took 20, 10, and 5 coins.

1083
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,100
My gosh. They're so mean.

1084
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
I mean...

1085
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,540
- So Bal.
- I mean...

1086
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,580
(There's nothing.)

1087
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,850
- There's none left?
- Unbelievable.

1088
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,080
(Flustered)

1089
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,190
There's none left?

1090
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,850
- Keep it coming.
- This was expected.

1091
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,100
This is how I see it.

1092
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,350
It's no use if you finish
below third.

1093
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,330
- This is how I see it.
- You can't finish below third.

1094
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,830
This is war.

1095
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,460
Only winning matters at the moment.

1096
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,730
I haven't seen a single coin today.

1097
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,910
- I'm good.
- This is war.

1098
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,100
- Please step forward.
- Let's go.

1099
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,870
- Darn it.
- This is war.

1100
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,250
- Where to?
- Suk Jin.

1101
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,440
- What?
- We need to unite.

1102
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,640
Yes, we should unite.

1103
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,480
(So Min's the only one
with no coins.)

1104
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,620
Are you kidding me?

1105
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,750
- I can't believe it.
- If it weren't for Ji Hyo,

1106
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,920
I could've ended up
on the sky bridge.

1107
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,980
The two of you...

1108
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,350
Suk Jin, please know
that we didn't get greedy.

1109
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,250
What good does that do...

1110
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,830
- when we're left with nothing?
- But Suk Jin...

1111
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,890
- We were reasonable.
- You know...

1112
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,690
- As if.
- So Min sees herself in Jamsil.

1113
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,830
Exactly.

1114
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,410
The tone was set this way...

1115
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,040
- in the first round.
- I know.

1116
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,640
- We couldn't help it.
- Now,

1117
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,940
we'll play a simple game
where you can win ten coins.

1118
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,250
- What is it?
- I'm going to win this one.

1119
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,270
You will call anyone you know.

1120
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,980
The three members whose calls
were answered the fastest...

1121
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,690
will receive 5, 3,
and 2 coins respectively.

1122
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,850
- We'll go one by one?
- We'll each make a call?

1123
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,980
Yes, one by one.

1124
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,350
This is crazy.
Someone who'll answer quickly?

1125
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,350
- The fastest...
- Can it be anyone?

1126
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,690
You can call anyone.

1127
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,250
- I'm calling my wife.
- It can be anyone.

1128
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,000
- Here we go.
- My wife might not pick up.

1129
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Please put it on speaker.

1130
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,620
(Start)

1131
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,670
Someone fast. Someone who isn't...

1132
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,170
- working right now.
- Who should I call?

1133
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,140
I'm curious too.

1134
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,400
Hold on.

1135
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,500
What's with her?

1136
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
(Flustered)

1137
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,210
We just talked a few minutes ago.

1138
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,600
It's over for him.

1139
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,080
- Hey, honey.
- Hello?

1140
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,850
I'm here on Running Man.
I'll call you back, okay?

1141
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,190
- Okay, good.
- I'll time you now.

1142
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,350
This is bad news for me.

1143
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,440
Would a celebrity
be a better choice?

1144
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,250
- Can I go?
- Go ahead.

1145
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,420
Please pick up.

1146
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,790
I wonder who'll pick up immediately.

1147
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,620
(Start)

1148
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,600
(Who is So Min calling?)

1149
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,770
Don't do this to me.

1150
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,230
- She's calling her dad.
- Dad, come on.

1151
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,290
- Really?
- You normally pick up instantly.

1152
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,770
He picks up my phone in seconds.

1153
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,330
Someone who'll answer quickly?

1154
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,480
Dad!

1155
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,370
(She surpasses Haha's record
which was 15 seconds.)

1156
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,650
- He must be playing soccer.
- What's with you today?

1157
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,710
- But my dad...
- There must be a soccer match.

1158
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,290
- He always has his phone on him.
- Hello?

1159
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,750
- Dad...
- What's her record?

1160
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,150
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

1161
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,310
- She's at 21 seconds.
- She failed.

1162
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,560
I'll call you back.

1163
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,330
- He has a sweet voice.
- Why did it take you so long...

1164
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,330
to pick up?

1165
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,290
- Who will it be?
- I'm calling Chang Hee.

1166
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,620
- What?
- I'm calling Chang Hee.

1167
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,230
- But I was going to call him.
- Go ahead, then.

1168
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,730
They're arguing over Nam Chang Hee.

1169
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,100
- Chang Hee...
- I'll call Chang Hee, then.

1170
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,310
Then I'll call Sae Ho.

1171
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,210
- Will you go first?
- I'll call Chang Hee.

1172
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,770
He stays busy, so you never know.

1173
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,400
- Doesn't he have a radio show?
- Please be in the middle of a show.

1174
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,170
- I hope he's working right now.
- He has work today.

1175
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,650
- His radio show.
- Please pick up, Chang Hee.

1176
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,420
- Hi, Jae Suk.
- Chang Hee!

1177
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,710
(It only took him 5 seconds!)

1178
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,020
- No way.
- Chang Hee!

1179
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,850
- How can this be?
- You're my savior.

1180
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,390
- But Chang Hee was mine.
- Nam Chang Hee!

1181
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,850
You are Nam Chang Hee

1182
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,520
Where are you right now?

1183
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,750
- It's as if he was on standby.
- I'm home at the moment.

1184
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,520
- My gosh.
- Push back the interview.

1185
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,230
You answered even before
your bell rang.

1186
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,900
- You answered before it rang.
- Hang up, will you?

1187
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,870
Chang Hee, thanks.
I'll call you later.

1188
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,940
Sure thing.

1189
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,310
- Who can I call?
- All right.

1190
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,710
I'm calling my friend Sae Ho.

1191
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,640
- I hope he doesn't answer.
- Go ahead.

1192
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,100
- Come on, Sae Ho.
- This...

1193
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,250
He's on standby on Mondays.

1194
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,150
He'll need to answer
in four seconds.

1195
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,670
Sae Ho, please.

1196
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,750
It's a Monday.

1197
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,750
- Se Chan.
- Sae Ho!

1198
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,020
- No way.
- Sae Ho, you're the best!

1199
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,080
(His record is 4 seconds.)

1200
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,690
(No way.)

1201
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,290
- Thank you so much.
- I should've called him instead.

1202
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,520
I should've called Sae Ho!

1203
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,690
- Sae Ho, we'll talk later. Thanks.
- Sae Ho didn't cross my mind.

1204
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,900
- Sae Ho...
- I'll call you back.

1205
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,100
He must've been on standby.

1206
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,440
Okay!

1207
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,600
- Sae Ho didn't cross my mind.
- My record is five seconds.

1208
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,170
You should've called Sae Ho instead.

1209
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,650
The game's already over for us.

1210
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,100
- I should've called Sae Ho instead.
- That was fast.

1211
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,580
I'll go next.

1212
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,770
Jong Kook, go ahead.

1213
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,850
(Jong Kook's up next.)

1214
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,520
- That was fast, right?
- He picked up at lightning speed.

1215
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,520
- Hello?
- That was fast.

1216
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,620
Hey, Carlow.

1217
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,890
(He's in 2nd place
along with Jae Suk!)

1218
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,250
Five seconds.

1219
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,650
He's the editor
for my online channel.

1220
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:29,790
It's Carlow.

1221
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,620
Of course his editor
would pick up immediately.

1222
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,670
He works for you.

1223
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,690
He's your...

1224
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,640
He stays busy, you see.

1225
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,810
- But you're his boss.
- I'm not.

1226
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,730
He's a freelancer.

1227
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,170
- Unbelievable.
- He has his own company.

1228
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,310
Anyway, it took you five seconds.

1229
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,850
- Okay, I'll go next.
- Thanks and bye.

1230
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,980
- So Min...
- I shouldn't have called my dad.

1231
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,040
- I'll go next.
- Sure.

1232
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,020
How could my dad do this to me?

1233
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,080
Yong Man wouldn't pick up.

1234
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,580
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- Soo Hyun!

1235
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,850
(It took her a second to pick up.)

1236
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:04,230
Soo Hyun, you're my savior!

1237
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,620
It was 1.5 seconds.

1238
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,770
- She must've been on her phone.
- You're my savior.

1239
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,730
Was she given word in advance?

1240
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,140
- No way.
- This is crazy!

1241
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,480
- No way.
- One second?

1242
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,140
- She had to be on her phone.
- Okay, I'll call you back.

1243
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,080
- Sure thing.
- Last but not least...

1244
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,270
Seok Sam's up.

1245
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,670
- Nice!
- You...

1246
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,170
You have to come in third.

1247
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,670
Call someone
who'd be on their phone.

1248
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,690
I'll call someone who works
with me on my channel.

1249
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,710
I hope he picks up quickly.

1250
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,580
- I hope he doesn't.
- He made the call.

1251
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,520
I don't think he'll pick up.
Put it on speaker, Suk Jin.

1252
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,900
- It's over.
- It's already over for me.

1253
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,670
(It's already over.)

1254
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,330
- Hey.
- That's eight seconds.

1255
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,370
- I was filming and...
- I came in last again.

1256
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,000
It's part of a game we're playing.
I'll call you back later.

1257
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,400
- It wasn't bad.
- Got it.

1258
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,640
His record isn't bad.

1259
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,870
But the top three are untouchable.

1260
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,350
Eight seconds
is a good enough record.

1261
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,020
Ji Hyo came in 1st and
Se Chan came in 2nd.

1262
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,310
You'll play rock-paper-scissors
to see who's in third.

1263
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,650
(A game of rock-paper-scissors
will determine who's in 3rd place.)

1264
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,810
- All right.
- As if this means anything.

1265
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,190
Rock-paper-scissors.

1266
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,520
Scissors. I won!

1267
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,120
Okay, it's all good.

1268
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,230
Getting a few more could
make you suffer something worse.

1269
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,290
- I shouldn't take these.
- You know what I mean, right?

1270
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,560
This is bad.

1271
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,520
- The next one's face rubbing.
- I shouldn't take these.

1272
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,690
- Could I give mine to others?
- You're right.

1273
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,370
- Water bucket is better.
- This is bad.

1274
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,830
- I badly want the whipped cream.
- We have a long way to go though.

1275
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,370
We have a long way to go.

1276
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:21,600
I still don't have any which means
I'll be on the sky bridge.

1277
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,310
The sky bridge.

1278
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,150
The next game...

1279
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,480
will help improve
your improvisational skills...

1280
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,750
which is a necessity
as a member on Running Man.

1281
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,810
(On Running Man,
being good at improvising is key.)

1282
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,850
The game is called...

1283
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,420
- Too Many Personas.
- What is it?

1284
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,620
(Running Man is a boss
at comedic sketches.)

1285
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,400
(The sketches on Running Man
aren't usually scripted.)

1286
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,500
Have you kissed a guy before?

1287
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,640
(They were subjected
to various situations.)

1288
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:57,540
(To stay on the show,
one must know how to improvise.)

1289
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:05,250
(The game will help them
improve those skills.)

1290
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,560
(Blind improvisational
comedy sketches)

1291
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,920
Behind where
you were seated just now,

1292
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,420
there are four rooms...

1293
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,600
that are of different concepts.

1294
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:22,440
For instance, you might find
a teachers' lounge.

1295
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,690
We'll be improvising.

1296
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:27,000
The second you enter
and take off your blindfold,

1297
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,900
you will have to get into character.

1298
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,440
Every time you say something
that fits the scene,

1299
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,580
- we will give you points.
- That fits the scene?

1300
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,270
- That fits the scene.
- I see.

1301
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,310
If it were a teachers' lounge,

1302
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:40,310
you can get points
by acting like teachers.

1303
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,920
If you say something
that doesn't fit,

1304
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,230
you won't score any points.

1305
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,520
Suk Jin, I'm worried about you.

1306
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,330
- You're bad at improvising.
- I might say something funny.

1307
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,420
It won't be fair for those
who didn't go to school.

1308
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,560
(If it's a teachers' lounge...)

1309
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,900
- I'll have to avoid it, then.
- There are four different rooms.

1310
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,190
You'll know once you head in there.

1311
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,290
Got it.

1312
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,440
Please don't let it be
the National Assembly.

1313
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,770
Please note that after a while,

1314
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,830
we will send in a certain object.

1315
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,500
The object must be melted
into your improvisations.

1316
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,580
Oh, no. I'm not that good
at improvisations though.

1317
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,520
Once your time is up,

1318
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,150
we'll announce it
through the megaphone.

1319
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,980
In the hallway,
you'll find out who's been cut.

1320
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,920
That person will come in last.

1321
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,250
- All right.
- Please standby...

1322
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,370
- while the cameras move in first.
- What do I do?

1323
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,900
You have at least one coin, right?

1324
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,020
- Of course.
- The water bucket is the best.

1325
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,960
I'm the only one without any coins.

1326
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,730
- Sophora root tea isn't so bad.
- So Min.

1327
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,810
You need to go to Jamsil,
so cancel any plans you have.

1328
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,040
If you were going to get a facial...

1329
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,980
(So Min calls someone.)

1330
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,100
Is it your dad?

1331
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,920
- Who are you calling? Busan?
- My dad.

1332
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,310
- Dad.
- Bucheon?

1333
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,440
What took you so long
to pick up today?

1334
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,810
Why? Is something wrong?

1335
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,310
Gosh, I came in last.

1336
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:49,560
(She complains to her dad
about picking up too late.)

1337
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,750
You normally pick up instantly.

1338
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,650
She's complaining to her dad.

1339
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:54,750
So Min, come on.

1340
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,790
Your dad has his own life...

1341
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,600
and can't be glued to his phone.

1342
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:02,040
It was a game and I came in last.

1343
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:05,140
Why are you complaining
about it to your dad?

1344
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,460
(She complains even though
she's the one bad at games.)

1345
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,100
The others picked up instantly.

1346
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,540
Maybe I should've called Mom.

1347
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:11,710
All right, Dad.

1348
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:12,940
(The cute daughter stops pestering.)

1349
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,020
Bye.

1350
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:17,810
If you move to the door,
we'll put the blindfold on you.

1351
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:19,290
- Let's move.
- Let's move.

1352
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,710
- Get ready for a skit.
- Okay.

1353
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:22,850
I should.

1354
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,650
- Get ready for the skit.
- Get ready.

1355
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,960
I will just follow Se Chan.

1356
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,000
I'm ready.

1357
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,420
- All right.
- Do I put on the blindfold?

1358
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,330
- Or what happens?
- It's like the room escape game.

1359
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,420
As soon as we enter...

1360
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,790
Do we all start together?

1361
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,270
Do we start together?

1362
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,540
- What's going on?
- What's this?

1363
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,460
- What are you doing?
- They're putting something on us.

1364
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,560
What is this?

1365
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:42,810
- They'll tell us to take it off.
- Take off your blindfold.

1366
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:43,900
Okay.

1367
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,040
- What is this?
- What is this?

1368
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,020
(The first skit is...)

1369
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,150
- What is this?
- What's this?

1370
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,790
- Let's start the meeting.
- What's this?

1371
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,080
(Doctors Academy Conference)

1372
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,750
Doctors Academy... My.

1373
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,150
(Glancing)

1374
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,290
- Let's sit down.
- Yes.

1375
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:58,420
- Dr. Yoo.
- Yes.

1376
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,350
- Dr. Yoo.
- Take a seat.

1377
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:03,020
First, it's the intubation.
Connect him to the ventilator.

1378
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,060
Get ready for the ligation.

1379
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,540
A total of 14 is seen
in the CT scan.

1380
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:11,040
That's what the CT scan shows,
but there could be more.

1381
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,370
Yes. Let's begin now.

1382
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,100
- It's going to be fun.
- I don't watch medical drama often.

1383
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,580
Me neither.

1384
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,810
(They never tried the doctor skit
due to lack of knowledge.)

1385
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:21,710
- This is going to be fun.
- It's like the room escape game.

1386
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,710
- Let's sit down.
- Yes.

1387
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:24,890
- Dr. Yoo.
- Yes.

1388
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,920
- Dr. Yoo.
- Take a seat.

1389
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,250
- What's this?
- My goodness, Dr. Ji.

1390
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,730
- You're working after a long time.
- Did you...

1391
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,150
- all have surgery?
- We're all wearing surgical gowns.

1392
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,060
Are you ready for the seminar?

1393
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,290
We do it every day.

1394
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:42,370
- Dr. Jeon. Have a seat.
- It was a tough surgery today.

1395
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,900
Dr. Song. What surgery
are you talking about?

1396
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,040
- Dr. Ha. I'm sorry. I...
- Now that surgery is over...

1397
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,850
- had organ transplantation today.
- What transplantation?

1398
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,400
An organ transplantation.

1399
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,850
You're an orthopedist. Why would you
perform organ transplantation?

1400
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:56,870
Put your shoes on.

1401
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,350
It seems it was one long surgery.

1402
00:45:58,350 --> 00:45:59,790
- Dr. Jeon.
- What?

1403
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,190
- Are you doing organ trafficking?
- Why...

1404
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,620
Why would an orthopedist perform
organ transplantation?

1405
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,980
I'm a thoracic surgeon.

1406
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,460
- What?
- I'm a thoracic surgeon.

1407
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,500
Heungboo? Did you say Heungboo?

1408
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,770
Are you getting turned on?

1409
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,900
(Heungboo is dumbfounded)

1410
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,190
I'm Nolboo.

1411
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,370
I'm too tired. Let me just...

1412
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:17,830
- Dr. Yang.
- Yes.

1413
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:21,170
The word says
you didn't go to university.

1414
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:23,270
I became a doctor without going
to university? That's not true.

1415
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:26,150
Dr. Yang. How did the seminar go
in Jeju Island?

1416
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,370
Oh, the seminar in Jeju Island?
It was very interesting.

1417
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:29,770
There are a lot of comments
about it.

1418
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:31,850
- People gathered and...
- I'm sorry,

1419
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,520
but do you know what a seminar is?

1420
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,620
A seminar?
Isn't that where you go and study?

1421
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:40,420
Dr. Yang. Can you spell out seminar?

1422
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,460
Hey. How dare you tell me
to spell it out?

1423
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,620
- "Hey."
- "Hey."

1424
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,830
I'm getting a new MRI machine.
How about a group purchase?

1425
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:48,330
- A group purchase?
- A group purchase?

1426
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,830
- It's very expensive.
- MRI and CT scan.

1427
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:52,460
What's your major?

1428
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,370
Me?

1429
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,170
- Neurosurgery.
- Pardon?

1430
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:57,770
- Neurosurgery.
- Neurosurgery?

1431
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,770
Neurosurgery? What do you do there?

1432
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,350
(Laughing)

1433
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,440
Dr. Ji.

1434
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,620
What do you do?

1435
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,350
- Dr. Ji.
- Do you want to hear it?

1436
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,290
When I was on rounds today,
the patient...

1437
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:11,020
seems to need surgery.
How are you going to do that?

1438
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,290
- He doesn't need surgery.
- All of a sudden?

1439
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:14,520
- Do you know what is going on?
- What?

1440
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,330
- Hey.
- I'm sorry,

1441
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:18,020
but where did you go on your rounds?

1442
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,170
I hear the empty can sound
from her head.

1443
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,370
- It's empty.
- Really?

1444
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,560
I've already done suction
on that patient.

1445
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:27,870
- Suction?
- Isn't that for dentists?

1446
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,730
You do that during surgery.

1447
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:31,940
That's for dentists.

1448
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,040
- Sir.
- You do that during surgery.

1449
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,520
- Do you know who that is?
- Who?

1450
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,750
(Hippocrates, father of medicine)

1451
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:39,850
Hip-hop something.

1452
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,920
- Hippocrates.
- Hippocrates.

1453
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,290
Did you say hippo?

1454
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:44,460
I said hip-hop.

1455
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,830
- Hippo?
- Hiphopcrates.

1456
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,830
You all know his oath.
Let's recite it.

1457
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,420
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1458
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,650
Can you recite the Hippocratic Oath?

1459
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:52,690
As you all know...

1460
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,020
- Let's do it together.
- Shall we do it together?

1461
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,270
- Shall we?
- All together.

1462
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,940
- Oath.
- Oath.

1463
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,230
- I...
- I...

1464
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,710
In order to...

1465
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,900
Let's say one word each.
Next person.

1466
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,210
In order to...

1467
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:04,980
Become a proud doctor...

1468
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,650
- What?
- Go ahead. You know it.

1469
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,040
But we must not joke about it.

1470
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,980
It's a skit. It's fine.

1471
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,190
It's a skit, but it must...

1472
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,580
Then do it for real.

1473
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,080
It must be based on facts.

1474
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,190
Recite the real oath.

1475
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,620
- You want me to do it?
- You know it.

1476
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,230
Hippocratic Oath.

1477
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,830
- Oath.
- Oath.

1478
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:25,460
I am...

1479
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,100
A pushover.

1480
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:30,790
I am a pushover.

1481
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,830
- I'm okay.
- Dr. Ha is funny.

1482
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:34,480
- He's funny.
- I'm a pushover.

1483
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,080
What's your major?

1484
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,100
- Someone's here.
- Dr. Song is very quiet today.

1485
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,750
- Someone's here.
- Dr. Song is very quiet today.

1486
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,540
You have a patient.

1487
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,210
- My.
- What's this?

1488
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,020
(They get pork belly
all of a sudden.)

1489
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:53,560
(You earn points if you put on
the appropriate skit with the prop.)

1490
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,500
(Nervous)

1491
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,100
(What am I supposed to do
with that?)

1492
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:58,500
- My.
- What's this?

1493
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,190
This is serious.

1494
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,290
It's full of fat.

1495
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:03,770
It's a serious fatty liver problem.

1496
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:04,940
This guy's in very
serious condition.

1497
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,560
If I were to comment...

1498
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:09,270
How dare you?
Check the patient's vitals first.

1499
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:13,770
As you can see, he has too much fat.

1500
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:16,370
He didn't take care of himself.

1501
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,650
Why are you suddenly
taking his pulse?

1502
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:20,250
Don't touch the patient
with your hand.

1503
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,890
Dr. Ji.

1504
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:23,580
You need to sanitize your hands
before taking the pulse.

1505
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,850
Are you an oriental medicine doctor?

1506
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:28,420
Don't take a pulse here.
You're supposed to make it realistic.

1507
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,520
Exactly.

1508
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,270
Let me get some blood.

1509
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:32,730
- Let me get some blood.
- It's already been removed.

1510
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,690
Do you know where the vein is?

1511
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:36,460
It's right below the bone.

1512
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,810
(Laughing)

1513
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,060
- Where's the artery?
- It's above the bone.

1514
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:42,640
- I...
- Wait!

1515
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,400
Leave the pork belly
to me and Dr. Kim.

1516
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,400
You're pork belly experts.

1517
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,980
I just measured the blood pressure.
It's at 401.

1518
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:51,540
Is that so?

1519
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,080
- The rates...
- Hold on.

1520
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,920
The vitals are unstable.

1521
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,390
- Vitals? What are vitals?
- And...

1522
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,230
The pulse.

1523
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,580
But...

1524
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,520
My goodness.

1525
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:05,370
- Let's diagnose his illness first.
- Wait.

1526
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:06,790
This isn't domestic.

1527
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,000
Are you neglecting him
because he's from abroad?

1528
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:10,540
What kind of nonsense is that?

1529
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:12,600
(Action)

1530
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,480
(Sniffing)

1531
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,310
She's right. It's from the US.

1532
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:18,650
- Can you tell from the smell?
- Yes.

1533
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,650
I don't know anything
about medicine.

1534
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,620
He seems to have a tumor.

1535
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,390
- A tumor?
- You mean the bone?

1536
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,080
- Don't you know what a tumor is?
- The cartilage?

1537
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,750
- I got a call. I'm going to the ER.
- Where?

1538
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,620
- I got a call. I'll be right back.
- If it's malignant,

1539
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,250
it might be a serious problem.

1540
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:37,120
She's using the lines she said
in her previous drama.

1541
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,420
(Locking)

1542
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,730
- You need to say the truth.
- It's locked.

1543
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:44,900
- Okay.
- This is...

1544
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,770
- absurd.
- Who is it?

1545
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,670
Who is it?

1546
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:51,100
Can't you take it more seriously?

1547
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:53,370
- Why do you keep walking around?
- We have a patient here.

1548
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,040
- Hey!
- Wait a minute.

1549
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,040
So Min. You're acting alone.

1550
00:50:58,210 --> 00:50:59,210
So Min.

1551
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:00,350
Can't you cooperate with us?

1552
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,850
That doesn't match the situation.

1553
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,810
She's pretending
her patient is dead.

1554
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,560
You're acting like it's a drama.

1555
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,060
- Shush.
- She's...

1556
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,420
She's suffering from mental illness.

1557
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,330
You know she's a patient.
Play along.

1558
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:14,500
- Let's play along.
- Yes. She's a patient.

1559
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:17,940
Her dream was to become a doctor.
Let's give her a break.

1560
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,440
- Dear doctors.
- Yes.

1561
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,440
Please move to the hallway.

1562
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,600
- To the hallway?
- Yes.

1563
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,600
Why does he want us in the hallway?

1564
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,520
Don't go any further.
Stay in the hallway.

1565
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:30,750
We'll announce who is eliminated.

1566
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:31,810
The eliminated person.

1567
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:32,810
(When you make sense,
you get a point.)

1568
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,420
Weren't we pretty good?

1569
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,480
This is pretty hard.

1570
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,920
- It was hard.
- It was hard.

1571
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,420
There are blindfolds.

1572
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,460
- The first...
- I don't know any medical terms.

1573
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,120
- person to be eliminated.
- I put on method acting.

1574
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,330
(Revealing the first
eliminated person)

1575
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,500
(Please wait here.)

1576
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,500
Here it is.

1577
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,500
(Song Ji Hyo is out.)

1578
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,770
Song Ji Hyo.

1579
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,170
(Song Ji Hyo is out.)

1580
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:55,770
- Why me?
- You were quiet.

1581
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:57,730
- Please go out the door.
- You need to leave.

1582
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:58,980
- You have to leave.
- Get out.

1583
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,580
- Ji Hyo is out.
- Is this a survival?

1584
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,750
- What?
- Is this a survival?

1585
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,440
The rest of you should put on
the blindfold again.

1586
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,150
- It's a difficult skit.
- It's hard.

1587
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,890
That was such an absurd prop.

1588
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:13,230
- It was pork belly.
- And there is no operating table.

1589
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,830
We need to perform surgery,
but there's no operating table.

1590
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:16,020
(What's waiting for them
in the next room?)

1591
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,520
- Take off your blindfold.
- Okay.

1592
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,770
- Take it off?
- What's going on?

1593
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:19,830
(Take off the blindfold.)

1594
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,370
- Take it off?
- Do we take it off?

1595
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,040
What is this?

1596
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,540
(Judges' gathering)

1597
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:31,980
A self-defense is not a preparation
for past or future invasion,

1598
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:35,370
but it must be a preparation
for invasion in the present.

1599
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,350
Do we take it off?

1600
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,060
- All right.
- All right. Let's have a seat.

1601
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:43,560
- Do I take the blindfold off?
- Head Judge.

1602
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,830
- Oh, yes.
- Grab a seat.

1603
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,620
- Why...
- You should sit in the middle.

1604
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:51,100
I'm the head judge.
What are you talking about?

1605
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,790
- Keep quiet in court!
- Are you the head judge?

1606
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,790
- Did you...
- Did you take the bar exam?

1607
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:56,460
- I did. I took the 29th bar exam.
- I'm sorry,

1608
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:00,330
didn't you pass the exam
after I did?

1609
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:02,830
- We all passed in the same year.
- Though I was a bit late...

1610
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:06,500
You must uphold
the majesty and order in court.

1611
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,350
I know you're older,
but you're my junior.

1612
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:12,310
Though I was late...

1613
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:14,750
You were too late.

1614
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,020
Excuse me, manager?

1615
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,500
- Bring me the document.
- Aide Yoo.

1616
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,290
- Yes?
- Bring me some tea.

1617
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:24,350
What?

1618
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,120
Can't you see
I'm in the judge's robe?

1619
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,770
- Take it off.
- Constitution Article 7 Protocol 3.

1620
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,440
Don't lean. Don't you know?

1621
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,830
- And...
- That's nonsense.

1622
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:36,310
some people went to law school.

1623
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:38,540
- Law school? I majored in law.
- Wait.

1624
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,350
- Yes?
- Didn't you go to I Love School?

1625
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:43,420
No.

1626
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,750
I went to Yongmoon High School.

1627
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,150
- Which law school did you go to?
- What?

1628
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:50,060
I took the bar exam.

1629
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,480
The bar exam? I knew it.

1630
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,920
You were suddenly
talking about law school.

1631
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,600
When did you pass it?

1632
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,600
- What?
- When?

1633
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:58,000
When did you pass?

1634
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,520
What about you?

1635
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,100
- He's a junior.
- I'm the 29th.

1636
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,000
- I'm the 25th!
- You're the 25th?

1637
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,270
I'm the 23rd.

1638
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:06,960
I'm the 21st.

1639
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,500
How dare you?

1640
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,870
He slapped me hard.

1641
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:10,980
Wait.

1642
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:11,980
- Look.
- Sorry?

1643
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,580
How about you?

1644
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:15,980
- I...
- How about you, Judge So Min?

1645
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,810
I had connections.

1646
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:20,710
It seems like you don't know,

1647
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:22,150
but you can't become a judge
through connections.

1648
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,150
I can't?

1649
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:25,390
You should have good grades
at the training institute.

1650
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:26,980
- I should?
- Of course.

1651
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,400
- She knows nothing about the law.
- By the way,

1652
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,290
I really like Judge Kim.

1653
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:33,500
- He wrote history.
- When?

1654
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,370
"From a Thug to a Judge."

1655
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,370
- Have you read that book?
- I actually...

1656
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:39,670
had a grudge about the ruling.

1657
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:42,440
- Right.
- And I decided to become a judge.

1658
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,480
- Is that possible?
- Judge Kim.

1659
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,270
You know the law
you accepted recently.

1660
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:49,650
- "The law you accepted?"
- "The law you accepted?"

1661
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,890
- From the Constitutional Court?
- It sounded like "silver grass."

1662
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:53,790
It's harsh to sentence the defendant
to a three years imprisonment...

1663
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,790
for urinating in public.

1664
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:57,250
- He didn't just urinate.
- Okay.

1665
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,250
He was naked when he did it.

1666
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,560
(Standing up)

1667
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,000
Ms. Jeon.
What's the matter, Judge Jeon?

1668
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,100
- Judge Jeon.
- Judge Jeon, what's wrong?

1669
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,100
I...

1670
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,170
despise the boy.

1671
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:09,790
- But So Min.
- Why...

1672
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:10,960
You're not in a drama.

1673
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,330
Did you see it on Netflix?

1674
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:14,540
- Do you want to be in a drama?
- Yes.

1675
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,310
You must know this.

1676
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:19,080
- The number of judges...
- I know.

1677
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,170
at the Constitutional Court.

1678
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:23,270
- I know.
- Of course, I know.

1679
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:26,540
- Three.
- That's the basic.

1680
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,710
- Why wouldn't we know?
- I know.

1681
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:29,190
Do you know
what the Constitutional Court is?

1682
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:30,650
- I know.
- What do they do?

1683
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:32,790
- They judge the constitution.
- How many judges are there?

1684
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,580
How many judges
are at the Constitutional Court?

1685
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,100
- At the Constitutional Court?
- We learned it.

1686
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,690
- How many? You learned it.
- At the Constitutional Court?

1687
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:38,900
There are three judges
at the "Current" Court.

1688
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,690
It's "Constitutional,"
not "Current."

1689
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,100
It's Constitutional Court.

1690
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,540
"Current Court."

1691
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,900
It's not current, past, and future.

1692
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,270
- It was a joke.
- And there are nine judges.

1693
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:48,810
- What do they do?
- It's nine.

1694
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,710
The Constitutional Court...

1695
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:53,440
makes the final decision
about state affairs.

1696
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,770
Why do they make the final decision?

1697
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:56,870
Such as the impeachment
of the president.

1698
00:55:56,870 --> 00:56:00,020
No. They decide whether it violates
the constitution or not.

1699
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,350
They make the final decision
about that.

1700
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:02,690
Okay, you're smart.

1701
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,520
The nine judges...

1702
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,920
- Wait.
- You...

1703
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,390
- "You're smart?"
- You're smart.

1704
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:08,920
- That's not what I'm trying to say.
- Junior Ji.

1705
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,730
- "Junior Ji?"
- It's a simple...

1706
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:11,920
You passed the 25th bar exam.

1707
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,100
That's true,

1708
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,370
- but this punk passed the 28th.
- "This punk?"

1709
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,190
- I think you're my junior.
- Hey.

1710
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:17,770
- According to the law...
- Do you even know it?

1711
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,560
Come on.

1712
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,640
Stop.

1713
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,870
- You're weird.
- Stop it.

1714
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:23,980
How can you sentence him
to a three years imprisonment...

1715
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,980
for urinating in public?

1716
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,770
- In Korea...
- He's my junior.

1717
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:28,370
- That's enough.
- Urinating in public...

1718
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:29,370
- That's enough.
- I said he had been naked.

1719
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:30,710
- Three years?
- All right.

1720
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:33,250
- Sir, what upsets me...
- All right.

1721
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,150
is that this punk stole
my son's bicycle.

1722
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:38,390
- What?
- Who is he to judge?

1723
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:39,580
- Okay.
- Hey.

1724
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,290
- What's outside belongs to others.
- Everyone is equal...

1725
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:42,350
- in front of the law.
- What?

1726
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:43,400
For stealing...

1727
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,290
Listen. We're here today...

1728
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:48,690
- as we need all hands on deck.
- Okay.

1729
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:50,670
- So I want to ask you this.
- Ask what?

1730
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:52,900
- About urinating in public.
- Okay.

1731
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,370
It's a minor offense.
We can finish it quickly.

1732
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,540
It's a minor offense.

1733
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,640
But he sentenced him
to three years' imprisonment.

1734
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,640
He filed a lawsuit.

1735
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,670
His friend turned on the headlight
of the car...

1736
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,170
towards him who was urinating.

1737
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:03,170
So he felt humiliated.

1738
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,980
He filed a lawsuit
as he had felt humiliated.

1739
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,480
- For the invasion of privacy.
- Privacy.

1740
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,690
- And many other things.
- He made him nervous.

1741
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,350
- Did he pee not hard enough?
- The judges...

1742
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,730
- Burbling.
- are divided...

1743
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,400
- about this.
- I know this case.

1744
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,290
I know it,

1745
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,520
but I side with the one
who urinated.

1746
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,000
- Honestly...
- You're at his side?

1747
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,170
His friend
turned on the headlight...

1748
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:25,540
- in front of him.
- What?

1749
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,540
Who is it?
We're in the middle of a meeting.

1750
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:30,140
- It's the evidence you requested.
- We're in the middle of a meeting.

1751
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,870
(Doenjang, the evidence, is here.)

1752
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:33,670
He took this.

1753
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:36,770
So he pooped.

1754
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:41,020
Is urinating pooping?

1755
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,790
(Another accusation against A)

1756
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:45,520
- He could've stopped here.
- It's poop.

1757
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,830
He could've stopped here,

1758
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:50,350
but he pooped on the street
as it was urgent.

1759
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:51,790
- He pooped.
- Yes.

1760
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:53,520
- To find clear evidence,
- So we took...

1761
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,040
- give it a taste.
- this poop...

1762
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,060
- from the scene.
- Give it a taste.

1763
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,060
(Dipping)

1764
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,060
It's poop.

1765
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:01,170
- I said it's poop.
- You touched poop.

1766
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,600
- He pooped in public.
- Pooped in public.

1767
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,870
He has healthy intestines.

1768
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:07,150
Considering the color
and the volume,

1769
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,420
he must've not been able to hold in.

1770
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,750
- He has healthy intestines.
- You should understand him.

1771
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,980
He would've not pooped
if it hadn't been urgent.

1772
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,190
- Okay. Sit down.
- I know.

1773
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:17,620
- Make a decision.
- Hold on.

1774
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:19,890
What do you want to have?

1775
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:20,920
Solomon's seal tea.

1776
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,560
Wait. We stopped
talking about the law at some point.

1777
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,690
(We stopped talking
about the law at some point.)

1778
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:27,560
(Spitting out)

1779
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,940
- Excuse me.
- Right now...

1780
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,770
What was it?

1781
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:32,170
- All of a sudden...
- Come on.

1782
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:34,900
- Judge Jeon.
- We stopped talking about the law.

1783
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,600
- Let's just have dinner.
- Forget about other things.

1784
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,730
Do you think he will have dinner?

1785
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,900
Let's just drink something...

1786
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,020
- as we have something to drink.
- Sir, where will we have dinner?

1787
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,710
- Hey!
- Why?

1788
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:46,620
Do you think we're joking here?
You're wearing shorts.

1789
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:47,810
Seriously...

1790
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:49,190
- You punk.
- Hey.

1791
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:51,350
- Do you think it's a joke?
- Hey.

1792
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,730
- You're wearing a cap.
- You punk.

1793
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,100
Hey, your glasses don't have lenses.

1794
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,730
He's nitpicking
as he got nothing to say.

1795
00:58:57,730 --> 00:58:59,400
How dare you come here in shorts?

1796
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,790
- Look at his glasses.
- It's ridiculous.

1797
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:02,640
I mean... Look.

1798
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,460
You're playing a judge.
Stick to the original plot.

1799
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:07,310
How dare you come here in shorts?

1800
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,440
He's not a judge.

1801
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,370
Is the court a joke to you?
You're ridiculous.

1802
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:13,670
Judge Kim is wearing them as well.

1803
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:15,150
Come here.

1804
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:16,650
Do a plank.

1805
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,710
Jae Suk, what's wrong with you?

1806
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:19,750
Do judges do that?

1807
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,390
- This is unfair.
- Come here.

1808
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,080
- Hey.
- Let's...

1809
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,650
talk about the law.

1810
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,190
Didn't you come wearing jeans?

1811
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:28,190
- Hey.
- Right?

1812
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:29,730
You should wear pants at least.

1813
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:30,730
He's wearing shorts too.

1814
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:32,420
- He's wearing shorts too.
- What?

1815
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:35,000
You guys should be careful.

1816
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,500
Judges, gather in the hallway.

1817
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,330
He's so ignorant.

1818
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:40,710
Being a judge is difficult.

1819
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,100
- I can't do it.
- I'll just get eliminated.

1820
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,330
- It's hard for me.
- It's hard.

1821
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,730
I don't know what's next, but...

1822
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:46,980
- I mean...
- I can play a teacher or something.

1823
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,150
- Playing a judge is hard.
- He's wearing shorts.

1824
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:50,650
- How can I act like a judge?
- I can't play a judge.

1825
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:51,650
I can't.

1826
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:53,480
It was like, "Okay. I got you."

1827
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,350
I'll announce the person
who is eliminated.

1828
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:58,830
- I'll announce it.
- Me too.

1829
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:00,920
(Who is the second person
to be eliminated?)

1830
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,020
Playing a judge is...

1831
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:05,770
(Se Chan is eliminated.)

1832
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,460
Thank goodness. I can't do it.

1833
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:09,370
- I can't do it either.
- Because of the "Current Court."

1834
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:11,170
- Why are you eliminated?
- It's the "Current Court."

1835
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:13,060
- I can't do this.
- Please leave, Se Chan.

1836
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:14,100
Wear your blindfold.

59:59,469 --> 01:00:00,800
I'll get used to it.

1837
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,270
I can't play a judge. It's hard.

1838
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:18,440
The judge at the "Current Court."

1839
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,480
They're dying.

1840
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:22,850
They're like, "I can't do this."

1841
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,650
This is hard.

1842
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,890
- Let's go.
- I'll get eliminated this time.

1843
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,460
- Me too.
- Where are we?

1844
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,690
Okay.

1845
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,250
Can we take it off?

1846
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:34,080
- Take it off.
- Take it off.

1847
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,460
I'm in trouble.

1848
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,400
- What's this? We're scientists.
- Scientists.

1849
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,900
(2022 Noble Prizes in science go
to 5 scientists including Jae Suk.)

1850
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:43,870
(You need to know difficult science
terms to play a Noble Prize winner.)

1851
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:44,960
- Let's sit.
- Let's sit down.

1852
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,770
- Gosh, this is...
- We...

1853
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,500
Here they go again.

1854
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,870
They will sit down,
check the hierarchy, and argue.

1855
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,670
- Scientists who came to receive...
- Sit down.

1856
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:57,620
What did you study?

1857
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,690
I studied stem cells.

1858
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,080
What stem cells?

1859
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,890
- Muscles and tendons.
- Okay.

1860
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:04,920
- Muscles and tendons?
- Yes. For regeneration.

1861
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:07,520
Stem cells...

1862
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,620
to regenerate...

1863
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,790
damaged muscles and tendons.

1864
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:15,190
- Isn't he a YouTuber?
- Yes?

1865
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,330
- I saw you often.
- I do that too.

1866
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:19,210
- I have my own channel too.
- You do?

1867
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,230
- How about you?
- Actually,

1868
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:22,980
I'm the first one...

1869
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:26,440
- The kidney of a pig.
- The kidney of a pig?

1870
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,750
- Transplant?
- Oh, I see.

1871
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,540
You're running
a pork belly restaurant?

1872
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:31,890
- The kidney of a pig.
- Pork...

1873
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:34,750
I transplanted it into a human body
for the first time.

1874
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,790
The person has survived
for eight years.

1875
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:38,390
- Didn't he pass away recently?
- Who is it?

1876
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:39,750
- Sorry?
- Who is it?

1877
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:40,920
Would you even know
if I say his name?

1878
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,790
Why do you speak informally?

1879
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:43,790
- Gosh.
- Is he alive?

1880
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:44,960
He's James.

1881
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:48,060
There they go.
They will start arguing. Look.

1882
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,790
In addition,

1883
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:52,500
as the result was successful,
I had more time.

1884
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,330
So I made seedless avocados.

1885
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,230
- Seedless avocados?
- Seedless avocados?

1886
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:59,170
- Don't you like avocados?
- Are you a successor of Dr. Woo?

1887
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:00,980
Seedless humpkins.

1888
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:03,020
You're the doctor from
"Parasite," right?

1889
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,080
- He's...
- It's...

1890
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,390
Seedless "humpkins?"

1891
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,580
(He got his tongue twisted
as he couldn't think of adlibs.)

1892
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:08,890
Seedless what?

1893
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:10,290
What are seedless "humpkins?"

1894
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:12,080
Isn't he Dr. Nose?

1895
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,560
Dr. Nose?

1896
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,520
- Oh, Dr. Nose?
- Dr. Nose.

1897
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,520
The master of origami, right?

1898
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,100
Dr. Nose is a nickname.

1899
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,190
- It's a nickname.
- Yes.

1900
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:23,000
- I...
- So...

1901
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,870
Come in.

1902
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:26,000
(An item for the skit is coming.)

1903
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,770
This is what I study. Give it to me.

1904
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:29,770
(They flock
as soon as they see the stone.)

1905
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:32,270
So it was here.
This is the heart of a pig.

1906
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:33,270
No, it's not.

1907
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:34,810
- It's the heart of a pig.
- It's a stone.

1908
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:37,170
- It's from the moon.
- I didn't know it was here.

1909
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,350
It's from the moon.

1910
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:39,520
Watching them here,

1911
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,350
I can see those who are uneducated
can't join.

1912
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,460
Those who are uneducated can't join.

1913
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:46,390
Haha and So Min are quiet.

1914
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:49,000
I study human history.

1915
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,270
I've been studying
the Old Stone Age again.

1916
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:54,560
- That's what you've been doing?
- I study how to prevent aging.

1917
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,190
So you study skin?

1918
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,670
- I'm sorry.
- How old are you?

1919
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:58,710
- Anti-aging properties.
- Excuse me.

1920
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:59,960
- I...
- Anti-aging properties.

1921
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,870
- Actually, this is...
- Yes.

1922
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:03,770
Ji Hyo.

1923
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:05,750
- Is this Ji Hyo?
- Did she turn into this?

1924
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,810
- She was born as a stone.
- She was born as a stone?

1925
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:09,520
She wanted to be born as a stone.

1926
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,250
- That's what she said.
- I turned her into a stone.

1927
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,480
This is an artificial heart I made.

1928
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:15,310
- What?
- It's beating.

1929
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,460
- You know what?
- What?

1930
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:19,690
I don't think
you're good at role-playing.

1931
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:21,730
It looks like a liver.

1932
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:22,920
- The shape is...
- I think it's a liver.

1933
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,150
This is...

1934
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,600
- Isn't it more like a liver?
- This is a heart.

1935
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,560
I think you're practicing BTS dance.

1936
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,500
This is...

1937
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,000
- Guys.
- This is the human heart.

1938
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,440
I don't know if I can say this,

1939
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,900
but you know Nature,

1940
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,770
- Nature?
- the world's leading journal.

1941
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:40,350
- I know Nature.
- I know it.

1942
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,810
- I know it.
- Recently,

1943
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:44,480
the world praised me for my work
on anti-aging substances.

1944
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,920
I'm sorry, but do you not use
those substances for yourself?

1945
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,920
- The ones you developed.
- I...

1946
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,480
I'm not sure if you're going to
believe it, but I was born in 1930.

1947
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,580
- You were born in 1930?
- I was born in 1927.

1948
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,690
(He attacks him as soon as he said
his age as if he has been waiting.)

1949
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:57,100
- How...
- Is it the anti-aging properties?

1950
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,190
- What did you use?
- Yes.

1951
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:01,290
- Hey.
- Why?

1952
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:03,770
- You were born in 1927?
- You can't do it to someone older.

1953
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:05,440
- He's older than you.
- Were you born in 1927?

1954
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,230
- Yes.
- Sir.

1955
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,400
You punk.

1956
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,580
They always...

1957
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,600
- Don't use a casual tone with me.
- You were born early.

1958
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,080
- In which year were you born?
- Me?

1959
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,040
- That's right,
- I was born in 1966.

1960
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,250
You punk.

1961
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:21,650
There is no way
you were born in 1930.

1962
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:23,190
I was born in 1930.

1963
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:24,520
You don't look that way.

1964
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,960
- You went through liberation.
- That's right.

1965
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,520
- He went through the war too.
- For a second...

1966
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,020
Here is the thing. Back in the day,

1967
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,330
- my family members were nobles.
- I see.

1968
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:34,520
Do you think
our family members were commoners?

1969
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:35,940
- So my old habits came out.
- I am sorry,

1970
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,830
but you stopped talking
about science.

1971
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,210
I waited for this moment.

1972
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,830
You stopped talking about science.

1973
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:44,140
- You are talking about history.
- No.

1974
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:45,600
I am sorry that I slapped you.

1975
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:47,440
I had a mortal enemy.

1976
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,500
A mortal enemy?

1977
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:51,480
- Why did you suddenly kiss a rock?
- Why did you kiss a rock?

1978
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:53,540
My goodness.
What did you do to Ji Hyo?

1979
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:54,790
What are you doing?

1980
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:56,150
Why did you suddenly kiss a rock?

1981
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:57,650
- Why did you kiss Ji Hyo?
- What did you do to Ji Hyo?

1982
01:04:57,650 --> 01:04:58,690
What was that?

1983
01:04:58,690 --> 01:04:59,920
- Suddenly...
- This is my invention.

1984
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,020
- Still, it's Ji Hyo.
- This isn't Ji Hyo.

1985
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,100
You punk.

1986
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,460
- Suddenly...
- Why did you kiss Ji Hyo?

1987
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,900
- It's my artificial heart.
- Why did you kiss Ji Hyo?

1988
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:09,790
They are fighting again.

1989
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,440
- It's my artificial heart.
- Why did you kiss Ji Hyo?

1990
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,330
- Why did you kiss Ji Hyo?
- Is this Ji Hyo?

1991
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:15,210
- All right, everyone.
- Okay.

1992
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,080
Now, I will share...

1993
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:19,350
- the research findings.
- Go ahead.

1994
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:21,480
- Give me a break.
- Go ahead.

1995
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,940
- Go ahead.
- Share the research findings.

1996
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:24,270
- Let's hear them.
- Hey!

1997
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,190
He will share the research findings.

1998
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:27,710
He thinks he is a doctor.

1999
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,150
Give me a break.

2000
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:30,690
- Go ahead.
- Let's hear them.

2001
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:32,650
I want to find out
how he got the Nobel Prize.

2002
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:34,790
Like I said earlier,

2003
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:37,420
my research covered
the origin of mankind...

2004
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:40,290
and the Paleolithic Period.

2005
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:43,690
You might think
that this is a simple rock,

2006
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,830
but there is a reason why
it was used as an axe.

2007
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:50,310
- Keep going. What is it about?
- What?

2008
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,370
- Keep going.
- Keep going.

2009
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:54,000
- Scientists.
- Yes?

2010
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,540
Please gather around
in the corridor.

2011
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,540
I didn't get to talk about
this rock.

2012
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,540
- That was insane.
- It was so hard.

2013
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:00,710
I hope I survive.

2014
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,460
- Are there four rooms?
- Who will be eliminated this time?

2015
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,480
- Let's see it.
- For goodness' sake.

2016
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,830
(Who will be the third member
to get eliminated?)

2017
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:07,120
- Let's see it.
- For goodness' sake.

2018
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:09,230
- Okay.
- So Min.

2019
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:10,790
(So Min got eliminated.)

2020
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:12,600
- I understand.
- So Min got eliminated.

2021
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,900
- So Min.
- Jae Suk.

2022
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,190
So Min, take the rock.

2023
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:17,500
Take it. It will be funny.

2024
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,770
- It won't come out.
- All right.

2025
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,370
- Take off the blindfold.
- Okay.

2026
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:22,810
(What will be the setting
for the last improv comedy?)

2027
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:24,230
Right now...

2028
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:27,000
(Summit meeting)

2029
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,370
I am the president.

2030
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:31,850
This weekend,
the G7 Summit will take place.

2031
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:36,190
(R4 Summit)

2032
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:38,460
(Gosh.)

2033
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,520
- My goodness.
- I am the president.

2034
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,730
(The 4 presidents enter.)

2035
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,250
- Pretending to be a doctor...
- There is a pattern.

2036
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,520
- was too...
- When they enter,

2037
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,790
they briefly play their roles.

2038
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:49,190
Then the topic of age comes up
and they begin to fight.

2039
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:51,190
- That's it.
- I couldn't enter the conversation.

2040
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:52,870
I couldn't. Is it a summit meeting?

2041
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:55,100
How... Now...

2042
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:59,270
The heads of the four countries
came together for a summit meeting.

2043
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,750
It's nice to meet you.

2044
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:04,310
- Today,
- I must sign this.

2045
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:06,520
- we have many things to decide on.
- I have something to do.

2046
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,750
I apologize, but I need to launch
a nuclear weapon.

2047
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:10,920
Pardon?

2048
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:13,690
- A nuclear weapon?
- Are you insane?

2049
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:15,620
- President Ji.
- Well,

2050
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:17,960
- it's only an experiment.
- Listen.

2051
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,000
Where are you having
that experiment?

2052
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,400
We are here to discuss
the spread of nuclear arms.

2053
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,000
- It's a sensitive issue.
- It's a sensitive issue indeed.

2054
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,640
How could you bring it up so easily?

2055
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,270
- It's just that...
- Listen.

2056
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:29,810
When will you pay me back?

2057
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:32,310
- Do I owe you money?
- When will you pay me back?

2058
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:33,650
How much do I owe?

2059
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:34,870
For goodness' sake.

2060
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:36,620
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

2061
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,670
I apologize for calling you
by your name.

2062
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:40,540
President Ji.

2063
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:41,790
- Seriously.
- Call me Pre-Ji.

2064
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:43,350
How did you become the president?

2065
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,790
I became one
through a national election.

2066
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:46,790
- I am sorry, but...
- Was there an election?

2067
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:48,560
- Of course.
- You used illegal means.

2068
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:49,850
What are you talking about?

2069
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:52,370
- Don't say that!
- I heard such rumors.

2070
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:54,690
(He is bad at acting.)

2071
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,440
They will talk about
seniority again.

2072
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:58,940
You turned the nation upside down.

2073
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:00,230
- Because of you,
- It's a matter of my country.

2074
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:03,310
- people are suffering.
- In your country,

2075
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:05,080
- people want a new president.
- It's insane.

2076
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,500
For how many years
have you been the president?

2077
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,370
The approval rating is
at 68 percent.

2078
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:10,350
- Excuse me?
- What's your approval rating?

2079
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:12,850
- What's up with that tone?
- Yours is at 15 percent.

2080
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:15,250
- Hold on.
- No one can become the president...

2081
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:17,850
- with that approval rating.
- Hold on.

2082
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:19,190
There are rumors
that you fabricated the rating.

2083
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:20,650
You took over the media.

2084
01:08:20,650 --> 01:08:22,500
You fabricated the rating.

2085
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,020
You banned social media.

2086
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,830
- What is my country anyway?
- You banned handwritten letters.

2087
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:28,940
- What is my country anyway?
- Seriously.

2088
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:30,640
Which country is it?
That's another country.

2089
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,270
- Pink country, yellow country, etc.
- Is that so?

2090
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,070
They will talk about
private matters now.

2091
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:38,030
Four countries' summit meeting.

2092
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:40,040
Did you go on a hunger strike?

2093
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,480
Baldness runs in my family.

2094
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,520
- You have hair.
- Baldness runs in my family.

2095
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,610
(As expected, they begin to talk
about private matters.)

2096
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:48,990
- For goodness' sake.
- I can't believe these people.

2097
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:52,020
Protruding trap runs in your family.

2098
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,390
- Trap?
- Listen.

2099
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:56,750
Criticizing appearances
won't do you any good.

2100
01:08:56,950 --> 01:08:58,750
- What are you talking about?
- You have a protruding trap.

2101
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:00,900
Among these four people,

2102
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,360
I am number two
in terms of appearances.

2103
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:05,160
- For goodness' sake.
- This is driving me crazy.

2104
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:07,910
- What are you talking about?
- We are number one and number two.

2105
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,810
- Give me a break.
- You are at the very bottom.

2106
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:13,740
- And...
- What will you do if it's a lie?

2107
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:14,950
- President Kim.
- Yes?

2108
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,370
I don't know about anything else,

2109
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:18,890
but you give children
protein-centered meals.

2110
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:21,780
- All the kids are getting gout.
- The kids...

2111
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:26,250
Children need to eat balanced meals.

2112
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,530
Those brats should look
after their own health.

2113
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,560
"Those brats?"

2114
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,860
They are responsible for it.

2115
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:33,100
- They are your people.
- As the president,

2116
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,460
you should look out
for the citizens.

2117
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,140
- They eat other food too.
- By the people, for the people.

2118
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:38,530
Other food they eat
will give them...

2119
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:41,000
- carbohydrates and fat.
- How did you become the president?

2120
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,370
The government
just gives them protein.

2121
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:44,530
- How did you become the president?
- Excuse me?

2122
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:45,810
I fought, okay?

2123
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:48,070
We had a UFC-style election.

2124
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:49,410
- You fought?
- Yes.

2125
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:51,650
- Was that how you got elected?
- Yes.

2126
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,520
- That was how I got elected.
- Let's not mind him.

2127
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,390
- Excuse me?
- We should talk without him.

2128
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:58,490
- What's the GNP in that country?
- Mister.

2129
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:00,620
- Forget about GNP.
- I have a problem with this.

2130
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:01,950
How could you doodle...

2131
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:03,750
- during a summit meeting?
- I didn't doodle.

2132
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:05,400
- What are you doing?
- I didn't doodle.

2133
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,290
I was thinking about GDP and GNP.

2134
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:08,770
GDP and GNP?
What's the GDP in your country?

2135
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:11,200
- He is saying everything he knows.
- What's the GDP in your country?

2136
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,000
It's over 50,000 dollars.

2137
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,240
I bet the Ji family
monopolized everything.

2138
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,240
- Seriously.
- In the past few years,

2139
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:20,780
everyone struggled due to COVID-19.

2140
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:22,350
We should think of a solution.

2141
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:25,820
Opening up the borders
to tourists is a sensitive issue.

2142
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:27,210
- Okay.
- Come to my country.

2143
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:30,020
- Come. Send the tourists.
- Why won't you open up the borders?

2144
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:32,230
I will talk
to the ministry of foreign affairs.

2145
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:33,750
- Come.
- Hold on.

2146
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:36,750
Their citizens can come,
but not yours.

2147
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:38,450
- Your citizens can't come.
- Why not?

2148
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:39,820
- Hold on.
- He is a nuisance.

2149
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,660
It doesn't matter...

2150
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:44,640
because neither my citizens nor I
want to go to this country.

2151
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,140
All my citizens were upset
about President Ji participating...

2152
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,330
- in this summit meeting.
- Nonsense.

2153
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:51,070
The country is too small.

2154
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:52,170
- In this summit meeting.
- Nonsense.

2155
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:53,980
The country is too small.

2156
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,350
- Stay still!
- Hold on.

2157
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:57,020
- Please give me one.
- Hey.

2158
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:58,210
- Stay still!
- Hold on.

2159
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:00,040
- Please give me one.
- Hey.

2160
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:03,110
- Stay still!
- Hold on. Please give me one.

2161
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:07,060
This is the reason why
I asked for a summit meeting.

2162
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:12,420
- Sit down.
- Calm down.

2163
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,160
- Calm down. I will use this.
- That's a chamber pot.

2164
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,490
- I will throw this.
- He wants to pee.

2165
01:11:15,490 --> 01:11:17,240
- I will detonate a bomb.
- Stay still.

2166
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,960
- I have a bomb.
- I will throw this.

2167
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,810
- Sit down.
- Stay still. I will pour this.

2168
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:21,940
- Stay still.
- I will pour this.

2169
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,940
- I will put this on my head.
- Sit down.

2170
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:25,200
- I will put this on my head.
- Stay still.

2171
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,980
- I will put this on my head.
- Sit down.

2172
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:28,240
(He suddenly provokes them.)

2173
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,070
- Stay still.
- Don't come near me.

2174
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:31,950
- I will put this on my head.
- Stay still.

2175
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,490
- Stay still.
- Step down as president.

2176
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:35,450
- What?
- Step down as president.

2177
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:37,250
- I will do that if you save me.
- Step down.

2178
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:39,660
- Sit down.
- You have been one for too long.

2179
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:40,780
I was elected by the people.

2180
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:43,120
- Sign it.
- Sign what?

2181
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:45,250
Sign a document
that waives taxes on my citizens.

2182
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:49,070
Customs.
Customs clearance. That thing.

2183
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:50,700
Don't you know the words?

2184
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,070
- Listen.
- Aren't you the president?

2185
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:53,500
Waive the duty.

2186
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,670
- Duty-free.
- But the free trade policies...

2187
01:11:55,670 --> 01:11:57,500
- Don't make me shoot.
- Okay.

2188
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,480
- Where are you going?
- It's nothing.

2189
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:02,370
- Hey. Where are you going?
- It's nothing.

2190
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:03,480
- What are you doing?
- He is trying to run.

2191
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,520
- Sit down.
- Duty-free.

2192
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,410
- Sign it.
- Okay.

2193
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:08,740
- Sign it.
- President Kim.

2194
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:11,360
Let's have an FTA,
a free trade agreement.

2195
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,690
FTA?

2196
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:15,190
I will give you FTA.

2197
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,250
- I will do that.
- Why are you using a dialect?

2198
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,990
I will give you FTA.

2199
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,160
- Don't make me shoot.
- Shoot!

2200
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:23,960
- Don't make me shoot.
- Shoot!

2201
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,940
(Shooting relentlessly)

2202
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:27,410
It's a war!

2203
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:30,030
- Shoot!
- Die!

2204
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:31,610
- Shoot!
- Die!

2205
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:33,240
(A water bomb war breaks out.)

2206
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,500
It's a war!

2207
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:36,650
Die!

2208
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:39,780
- Hurrah!
- All of us will die.

2209
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:40,950
All of us will die.

2210
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:42,890
Die!

2211
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:44,910
- All of us will die.
- Die!

2212
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,580
- Freedom!
- It's a disaster.

2213
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:53,700
The summit meeting ended like that.

2214
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,570
- All of us will die.
- Die!

2215
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:57,700
- Freedom!
- It's a disaster.

2216
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:00,500
- A disaster.
- Presidents, please gather around.

2217
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,910
We are really bad at this.

2218
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,810
Each one is the same.

2219
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:07,370
- The buildup is the same.
- Seriously.

2220
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,810
- The buildup.
- You begin.

2221
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:11,150
- We say everything we know.
- "How old are you?"

2222
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:17,660
(Pattern 1: Use a polite tone
to ask everyone to sit down.)

2223
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:22,920
(Pattern 2: Bring up seniority
when you have nothing to say.)

2224
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,360
(Pattern 3: When someone answers,)

2225
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,770
(claim that you have seniority.)

2226
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:32,240
(Waiting for the talk of seniority)

2227
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:38,480
(It always ends as a dogfight.)

2228
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:43,570
(Every improv comedy
proceeded the same way.)

2229
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:46,990
The costumes change,
but the plot doesn't.

2230
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,780
We wait for someone to ask,
"How old are you?"

2231
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,610
We fight because we have
no knowledge.

2232
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:54,990
Thus, Ji Hyo is in 7th place
since she got eliminated 1st.

2233
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:57,290
Se Chan is in 6th place
and So Min is in 5th place.

2234
01:13:57,290 --> 01:13:59,530
- I won't get any coins, right?
- As for the four remaining members,

2235
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:03,140
we counted the advanced terms
and expressions you used.

2236
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:05,270
In first place is Jae Suk.

2237
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:07,160
- In second place is Jong Kook.
- Why?

2238
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,170
- In 3rd place is Haha.
- Why am I in 4th place?

2239
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:11,170
- In fourth place is Suk Jin.
- I used advanced terms.

2240
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:12,870
GDP.

2241
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:15,610
- This changes things.
- What should I do?

2242
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:17,020
- Can I enter?
- Yes.

2243
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,020
Okay.

2244
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:20,020
Can you leave some coins behind?

2245
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:21,690
Jae Suk, leave us some coins.

2246
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:24,360
- Let's see.
- I need one more for flogging.

2247
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,250
(Jae Suk is in 1st place
with 13 coins.)

2248
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,390
Jae Suk, you don't need
to take a lot.

2249
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:29,600
I don't have any coins.

2250
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,100
Leave us some coins.

2251
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,250
Of course.

2252
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:33,290
Watch your hands.

2253
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:34,790
(Thirty-five coins begin
to get distributed.)

2254
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:37,830
(He charges at the coins.)

2255
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:40,330
(Taking all the coins)

2256
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:42,670
He is taking them all.
He isn't leaving any coins behind.

2257
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:43,910
(30-39 coins:
Drink sophora root tea)

2258
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:45,950
(He takes 20 coins.)

2259
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:47,200
There is no need for hope.

2260
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,780
- Listen to that sound.
- He took all the coins.

2261
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:50,040
All right.

2262
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:55,080
Please. They might strategize
and not take any more coins.

2263
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:58,250
- I don't have any coins.
- Who will do the flogging?

2264
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,230
Jong Kook, you don't need
that many coins.

2265
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:03,560
You have a lot of coins.
You don't need more.

2266
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,200
(Which penalty
will Jong Kook choose?)

2267
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:09,400
- It's because...
- Settle with the fresh cream.

2268
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:10,790
I am done.

2269
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:12,140
(Haha only has 5 coins.)

2270
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:13,200
Haha.

2271
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:16,240
- Go easy on us. Dance to BTS.
- I guess there aren't any coins.

2272
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,670
Haha, dancing to BTS
is a better choice.

2273
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:20,110
Haha, you will dance to BTS, right?

2274
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:23,110
- Haha, I don't have any coins.
- You get greedy.

2275
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:25,450
If you take more coins,
you will get a bucket of ink.

2276
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:27,280
Ink and fresh cream are the worst.

2277
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:29,280
Hold on.

2278
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,160
I decided to be nice
and left some coins behind.

2279
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:32,820
I left some coins behind.

2280
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:34,490
- I left some coins behind.
- Okay.

2281
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:35,820
(He only took 1 coin.)

2282
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:37,060
I took it easy.

2283
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:39,700
(Only 4 coins remain.)

2284
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,600
- I guess there aren't any.
- Right?

2285
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,100
- I took it easy.
- Se Chan, I guess there aren't any.

2286
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,310
So Min will need to go to Jamsil.

2287
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,980
I will need to go to Jamsil.

2288
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,330
(Suk Jin currently has 4 coins.)

2289
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,910
Let's dance together.

2290
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:57,070
He is choosing
between penalties, right?

2291
01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:58,170
That's right.

2292
01:15:58,170 --> 01:15:59,390
He is choosing a better one.

2293
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:00,450
(Thinking hard)

2294
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:03,190
Everyone prefers different things.

2295
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:04,360
(Will he dance to BTS
or get a bucket of ink?)

2296
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:08,860
Okay. I will think about it.

2297
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:14,660
Suk Jin decided to dance to BTS
so that he can stay clean.

2298
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:16,290
- That's right.
- I left some coins behind.

2299
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:17,330
(Two coins reach So Min.)

2300
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:19,310
So Min can choose the next penalty.

2301
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:20,830
She will carry out the penalty
for the opening next week.

2302
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:22,240
(2-3 coins: Wear a costume
and makeup for the opening.)

2303
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,670
Let's wear a costume
and makeup for the opening.

2304
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,280
It's the most bothersome.

2305
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,370
- The opening or the sky bridge.
- The opening.

2306
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:29,740
You have a choice now.

2307
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:31,950
- You gave her that choice.
- Yes.

2308
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:33,490
- So Min.
- I gave her that choice.

2309
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:35,580
- Go with the opening.
- You have one more chance.

2310
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:37,320
Didn't you take any?

2311
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:40,950
I can't believe it.
I left those coins for you.

2312
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:43,450
I prefer the sky bridge.

2313
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:45,100
(Se Chan currently has 23 coins.)

2314
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:46,900
Okay.

2315
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,120
Next.

2316
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,700
The coins reached the end.

2317
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,290
(The coins reached the end
for the first time.)

2318
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:54,110
- Everyone is adjusting now.
- Everyone is adjusting now.

2319
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:55,440
- All right.
- Okay.

2320
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,200
The distribution is over.

2321
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,530
Please gather around.

2322
01:16:58,530 --> 01:16:59,570
(The 2 remaining coins
go to Ji Hyo.)

2323
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:01,280
I will give you the rules.

2324
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:03,150
This is your last chance...

2325
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:04,710
- to avoid the worst penalty.
- What is it?

2326
01:17:04,710 --> 01:17:07,150
A single choice will change
the rankings...

2327
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:09,490
- in Choice Playbook.
- Oh, no.

2328
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:12,110
On the three tables
that will be brought in...

2329
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:14,360
- will have signs for places.
- Really?

2330
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,780
- The first place.
- That's so simple.

2331
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:19,290
Table 1 has the 1st and 7th places.

2332
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:20,620
(1st and 7th places)

2333
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:23,200
Table 2 has the 2nd and 6th places.

2334
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:26,830
Table 3 has
the 3rd, 4th, and 5th places.

2335
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:29,140
Pick the table you want.

2336
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:31,610
If more people want the same table,
decide by rock-paper-scissors.

2337
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,780
So Min, you have to aim
for the first place.

2338
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,950
Who will go
for the 1st or 7th place?

2339
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:38,320
- The 1st or 7th place?
- The 1st or 7th place?

2340
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,110
- The two of them.
- Hold on. The 1st or 7th place?

2341
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:41,450
- Me too.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

2342
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:42,950
- Come on.
- Why?

2343
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:45,190
The member who is the first place...

2344
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:47,620
- won't leave any coins behind.
- Seriously.

2345
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:49,750
- He or she will take everything.
- So we have to aim for it.

2346
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:51,100
- I will go for table one.
- Same here.

2347
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,200
The 1st or 7th place.

2348
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,230
- Which one?
- The 1st or 7th place.

2349
01:17:53,230 --> 01:17:54,920
- The 1st or 7th place.
- The 1st or 7th place.

2350
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,200
There are 4 people
who want the 1st or 7th place.

2351
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,830
- The 2nd or 6th place.
- The 2nd or 6th place.

2352
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:58,860
There are 2 people
who want the 2nd or 6th place.

2353
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:00,440
Two of you will go to the table
with 3rd, 4th, and 5th places.

2354
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,440
- The 1st or 7th place.
- Yes.

2355
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,740
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2356
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:04,740
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2357
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:06,170
(So Min and Suk Jin won.)

2358
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:07,850
The 2 of you will go to the table
with 3rd, 4th, and 5th places.

2359
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,020
- Please.
- One of you will also go there.

2360
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,690
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2361
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:13,780
(They play
rock-paper-scissors as well.)

2362
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,650
Bring in the tables.

2363
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:17,080
(The table with 2nd and 6th places:
Ji Hyo and Se Chan)

2364
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,160
- The seventh place.
- I love it.

2365
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,190
- I love it.
- I love it.

2366
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,660
You will either be
the 1st place or 7th place.

2367
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:27,100
- If So Min gets the first place,
- That's right.

2368
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:28,900
she will get the sophora root tea.

2369
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,240
- Hold it up at the same time.
- Who knows what So Min will pick?

2370
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,830
- This is nerve-racking.
- Sophora root tea.

2371
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:35,360
I am so nervous. What should I do?

2372
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,830
- I should have gotten this table.
- Look at that.

2373
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:38,240
I should have gotten this table.

2374
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,150
This one looks dreary.
I will choose the other one.

2375
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,610
- All right. Just grab it.
- Hold it up at the same time.

2376
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:45,040
- All right.
- Please let it be the first place.

2377
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,580
If it's the first place,
you will be set.

2378
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:49,150
Hold it up. One, two...

2379
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,560
(Who will take the 1st place?)

2380
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,580
Three.

2381
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:54,620
(7th place, 1st place)

2382
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:58,660
(So Min got the 1st place.)

2383
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:00,460
(Screaming)

2384
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,200
(She runs around screaming.)

2385
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,240
Jong Kook, it's meaningless.

2386
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:06,960
- It's meaningless.
- She will take all the coins.

2387
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,270
(A miraculous story
of the Jamsil sky bridge girl)

2388
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:09,330
Okay!

2389
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:11,610
(Jong Kook, it's meaningless.)

2390
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:12,950
She will take all the coins.

2391
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:14,480
So Min will take all the coins.

2392
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,500
She came from behind.

2393
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,040
- Okay.
- She came from behind.

2394
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,450
Please go ahead.
She might not take all the coins.

2395
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:20,780
You never know.

2396
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:22,890
- You never know.
- The 2nd or 6th place.

2397
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:25,690
- Which one do you want?
- One, two, three.

2398
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,660
Ji Hyo got the second place.

2399
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:28,750
It's meaningless.

2400
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:30,030
One, two, three.

2401
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:31,490
- The 3rd place.
- The 4th place.

2402
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:32,790
Please enter the box.

2403
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,070
- The fourth place...
- It's meaningless.

2404
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:36,790
It's meaningless.

2405
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:37,960
I won't get any coins.

2406
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:40,410
It's meaningless to be first place.

2407
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,480
All right.

2408
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:46,950
- It's too bad.
- Tell me about your stories.

2409
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,280
We have no stories. Just go.

2410
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,820
- Just go.
- No.

2411
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:51,780
We have enough coins
for the penalties we want.

2412
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:54,650
We are satisfied.
You can have the sophora root tea.

2413
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:55,910
Hold on.

2414
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:58,060
- Sophora root tea.
- How many coins do you have?

2415
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:00,360
- I can't tell you.
- Come on.

2416
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,900
So Min, I know you want to enjoy
the power, but just do it.

2417
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,700
- We are okay.
- I have to take...

2418
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,200
the remaining coins, right?

2419
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:07,700
Yes.

2420
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:09,360
If I end up taking more coins...

2421
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,270
(Suk Jin is worried about
taking more coins.)

2422
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:13,310
- You won't get coins.
- A bucket of ink, right?

2423
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,610
- We will start the conveyor belt.
- Okay.

2424
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,370
So Min should take everything.

2425
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:19,310
I bet she will take all the coins.

2426
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:21,200
- She should do that.
- I bet she will do that.

2427
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:24,480
So Min doesn't have any coins,
so she will take everything.

2428
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,280
- Take 30 coins for the tea.
- Yes. Take 30 coins.

2429
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,390
That's right.

2430
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:30,360
You don't need to go all the way
to the sophora root tea.

2431
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,280
You need 30 coins
for the sophora root tea.

2432
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,780
Take 24 coins for flogging.

2433
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:36,530
Let's leave the remaining coins
and give Suk Jin a bucket of ink.

2434
01:20:36,530 --> 01:20:37,530
Yes.

2435
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,120
- You don't need to do that.
- What do you think?

2436
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:43,100
- I will get the tea.
- Let's give him that penalty.

2437
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,600
- That's right.
- That's right.

2438
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,830
Hey!

2439
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:47,740
Hold on.

2440
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:50,870
(Meanwhile, So Min thinks hard.)

2441
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:53,570
I picked the penalty I want.

2442
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:54,870
Go on.

2443
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:56,850
Flogging isn't so bad.

2444
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:58,110
- What?
- That's right.

2445
01:20:58,110 --> 01:20:59,820
So Min, what's this? Hold on.

2446
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:00,890
Why?

2447
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:04,660
(So Min left 20 coins!)

2448
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,890
(Ji Hyo takes 10 additional coins.)

2449
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:10,450
So Min, which penalty will you get?

2450
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:11,750
The water bucket.

2451
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,620
Are you satisfied with that?

2452
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,860
That way, they will receive
worse penalties.

2453
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:19,810
- You are incredible.
- Worse penalties.

2454
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:22,360
I respect you so much.

2455
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,610
That way, they will receive
worse penalties.

2456
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:26,540
You dance to BTS
if you have 4 to 6 coins.

2457
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:29,240
- Suk Jin has at least four coins.
- There is no need...

2458
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,650
to worry about me.

2459
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,890
(The remaining coins
get delivered to Haha.)

2460
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:35,910
(My goodness.)

2461
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:38,690
(There are 10 coins.)

2462
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:43,920
(Haha gave up
and settled on dancing to BTS.)

2463
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,290
(Dance to BTS and get applauded
in the lobby without cameras.)

2464
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:48,360
(He controlled
the number of coins for that.)

2465
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:53,000
(He has an unexpected choice.)

2466
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,500
Haha, leave some coins behind
for the ink bucket.

2467
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:58,830
(7-10 coins:
Get hit with an ink bucket)

2468
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:00,310
Die.

2469
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:01,450
(Never mind then.)

2470
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:02,810
(Haha sacrificed himself
for the ink bucket project.)

2471
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:04,540
- Is he sending the coins?
- What?

2472
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,350
- He is loyal.
- Why are there so many coins?

2473
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:08,650
- He is loyal.
- Why are there so many coins?

2474
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:10,610
- Really?
- Really?

2475
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:12,390
Perhaps your plan will fall through.

2476
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:14,950
Hold on. Maybe
I should take some coins.

2477
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:16,920
You need to spare me 3 or 4 coins.

2478
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,030
Where?

2479
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:19,660
(He becomes nervous.)

2480
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:21,490
- If you want the ink show...
- The ink bucket.

2481
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:23,160
- If you want the ink show,
- I see.

2482
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:26,960
I should get four coins.
Then the ink show will take place.

2483
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,640
I see. Jong Kook,
do you want the sophora root tea?

2484
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,370
If it's possible, I will go for it.

2485
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:32,950
Otherwise,
I will enjoy the ink show.

2486
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:34,170
(They begin to calculate
the number of coins.)

2487
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:35,570
- In that case...
- In that case...

2488
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:37,480
How many coins does Suk Jin have?

2489
01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:40,540
- Let's enjoy the tea together.
- I will leave you ten coins then.

2490
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:42,580
I will send you four coins.

2491
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:43,660
Five coins for the fresh cream.

2492
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,690
I will send you four coins.

2493
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,190
(7-10 coins:
Get hit with an ink bucket)

2494
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:49,030
- Suk Jin.
- All right.

2495
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:50,530
(Suk Jin shows a mysterious smile
when 4 coins reach Se Chan.)

2496
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:53,230
- How many coins do you have?
- I can't tell you that.

2497
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:54,730
- What?
- I can't tell you that.

2498
01:22:54,730 --> 01:22:56,900
- Can't you tell me?
- I can't tell you that.

2499
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:58,070
How bothersome.

2500
01:22:58,070 --> 01:22:59,660
(The ink show is about to open.)

2501
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,940
How many coins will you give me?

2502
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,480
Enjoy that ink.

2503
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,700
(Enjoy that ink.)

2504
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,110
Please take the remaining coins.

2505
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:07,240
He has to take them.

2506
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:09,370
Must I take them?

2507
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,610
Yes.

2508
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:12,710
Please count the coins you have.

2509
01:23:12,710 --> 01:23:14,190
(They will reveal the final number.)

2510
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:16,150
- So Min, how many do you have?
- I have 15 coins.

2511
01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:17,750
So Min has 15 coins.

2512
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:19,160
I have 31 coins.

2513
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:21,360
Ji Hyo has 31 coins.

2514
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,390
I have six coins.

2515
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:23,450
(Dance to BTS and get applauded
in the lobby without cameras.)

2516
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:24,950
Haha has six coins.

2517
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,770
I have 33 coins.

2518
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:29,290
Jae Suk has 33 coins.
Sophora root tea.

2519
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:30,860
I have 23 coins.

2520
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:33,810
Se Chan has 23 coins. Face rubbing.

2521
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:35,140
I have 31 coins.

2522
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:36,980
- Sophora root tea.
- Sophora root tea.

2523
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:38,670
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin, how many do you have?

2524
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:39,700
(The last member, Suk Jin)

2525
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:41,170
- I have 10 coins.
- He has 10 coins.

2526
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:43,540
He will give us the ink show.

2527
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:47,350
(The ink show will take place.)

2528
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:49,410
- He got exactly 10 coins.
- Had he gotten 1 more,

2529
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:51,410
- it would have been fresh cream.
- Are you a team?

2530
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:54,080
- Had you given me 1 more,
- I told you that he has 6 coins.

2531
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:55,730
it would have been fresh cream.

2532
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:58,750
Must you see me get hit
with an ink bucket?

2533
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,960
- Next week, it will be a war.
- You didn't tell us the number.

2534
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:04,940
Let's bring in
the sophora root tea first.

2535
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,530
- Two cups of sophora root tea.
- It's bitter.

2536
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:08,770
There is a variety
of penalties today.

2537
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:10,000
The taste makes your stomach churn.

2538
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
This is...

2539
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:13,450
I can smell it from here.

2540
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,240
- All right. Thank you.
- The sophora root tea.

2541
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,650
- It's good for your health.
- It smells really...

2542
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:19,610
- It has a strong smell.
- I can smell it from here.

2543
01:24:19,610 --> 01:24:20,910
- Gosh, Jae Suk.
- Don't do that.

2544
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:21,950
(Shutting her eyes tight)

2545
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:23,250
Drink it up.

2546
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,610
The three of them are done.

2547
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:27,360
Next is face rubbing.

2548
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,450
- Close your eyes.
- This is the worst.

2549
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:31,030
- This is the worst.
- He looks like a fish.

2550
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:32,230
He's really ugly.

2551
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:34,100
He looks just like a fish.

2552
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,770
I think I need to do it again.

2553
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:36,990
What's that?

2554
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:38,400
Se Chan got the worst penalty.

2555
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,660
I know. This is the worst.

2556
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:42,240
Now bring in water buckets.

2557
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:44,480
One, two, three.

2558
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,480
(So Min wanted the water bucket.)

2559
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:48,450
(She gets a cool shower.)

2560
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:49,950
It's so cold.

2561
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:51,070
All right.

2562
01:24:51,070 --> 01:24:53,490
- Life can't always be fun.
- Are you all right?

2563
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:57,490
This will also leave me
with a good memory.

2564
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,160
Oh, no.

2565
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,450
(The ink show)

2566
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:02,730
- Oh, no.
- It's a face rubbing.

2567
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:04,120
You should take a face rubbing.

2568
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:06,860
Suk Jin. You don't need
black spray on your head.

2569
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:08,290
He has a good head of hair.

2570
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:09,570
You have very thick hair.

2571
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:11,240
Gosh, this is the worst one.

2572
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,360
- This is the worst.
- This is horrible.

2573
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,610
This is too much for ten coins.

2574
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:14,700
You don't need to dye your hair.

2575
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:17,740
Thank you for your hard work.
Haha will go downstairs now.

2576
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:18,740
All right.

2577
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:20,070
- Thank you all for today.
- Thank you.

2578
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:21,370
Your penalty is better.

2579
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:26,280
This is so awkward.
How would I do this?

2580
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:27,850
Am I supposed to dance
just like this?

2581
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:29,490
(Am I supposed to dance
just like this?)

2582
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:30,710
In the middle?

2583
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:32,990
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

2584
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:33,990
(A huge stage for him)

2585
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:36,620
Gosh, I just can't bring
myself to dance.

2586
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:40,770
I can't do this. My goodness.

2587
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:42,860
(He needs to dance
and get applauded here.)

2588
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,770
Can you join me, Jae Suk?

2589
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:50,910
(It's a lonely performance
without cameras and colleagues.)

2590
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:54,740
Gosh, I just can't start dancing.

2591
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:55,740
(The BTS song is playing
on Haha's phone.)

2592
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:56,910
I can't do this.

2593
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,850
(Walking by)

2594
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:06,490
(Dancer Ha starts dancing.)

2595
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:08,560
(In the indifference of people,)

2596
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:12,730
(he shows his performance art.)

2597
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:17,960
(People start paying attention
to the middle-aged man's grooves.)

2598
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:20,460
(Making a bow)

2599
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:25,030
(He tries to interact with
the audience to get applauded.)

2600
01:26:25,030 --> 01:26:28,570
(But all he gets is
a lukewarm response.)

2601
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:32,280
(What the heck...)

2602
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:37,450
(He tries to target
some of the audience.)

2603
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:43,360
(A dance performance from up close)

2604
01:26:48,730 --> 01:26:52,570
(The performance ends
with a grand finale.)

2605
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,530
(Right at the moment...)

2606
01:26:57,530 --> 01:27:01,740
(The audience finally gives him
a welcoming applause.)

2607
01:27:03,210 --> 01:27:05,370
(Thank you!)

2608
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:07,820
(Running away)

2609
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:09,950
(Dancer Ha fought
against humiliation...)

2610
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:11,250
I'm so embarrassed.

2611
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:13,160
(and finished his penalty.)

2612
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:14,420
(Once upon a time...)

2613
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:15,420
(What are you?)

2614
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:16,920
(I'm Nolboo, you punk.)

2615
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,860
(Two Nolboos under the same roof?)

2616
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:19,900
(Which one of you is Nolboo?)

2617
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,700
- I'm Nolboo.
- No, I'm Nolboo.

2618
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:24,030
(Someone is lying.)

2619
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,990
(Two people are insisting
that they are Madam Ppaengdeok.)

2620
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:27,030
- Can I get some food?
- What are you?

2621
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:29,330
(And there are three Heungboos?)

2622
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,700
(That Heungboo...)

2623
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:33,850
(is somewhat bleary-eyed.)

2624
01:27:34,810 --> 01:27:36,070
(He's trying to seduce someone.)

2625
01:27:36,310 --> 01:27:38,370
(Heungboos can't fall in love
with each other.)

2626
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:41,990
(Into traditional fairy tales...)

2627
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:45,080
(They have to single out the fake.)

2628
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,320
(Uninvited guests who are here
to ruin the fairy tales)

2629
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:49,390
(A chase to identify the fakes)

2630
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:51,200
(His face...)

2631
01:27:51,450 --> 01:27:52,860
(It's just that he's ugly.)

2632
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:54,230
(They are all thrown
into confusion.)

2633
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:55,700
(How will the fairy tale end?)

2634
01:27:57,330 --> 01:28:00,410
(Running Chronicles)
