1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,210
Let's go.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,250
Over here.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,610
All right. Hello.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,920
- Hi.
- Hey.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,780
So Min, you look good.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,850
Let's work.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,330
This is the concept.

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,950
Yes, sir.

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,060
- What are we doing today?
- Yes, sir.

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,700
- Am I a farmhand?
- Seriously,

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,200
I don't look good in this costume.
But it looks great on you.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,290
- It suits you best.
- Isn't this what you wore...

13
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,310
when you were in elementary school?

14
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,310
- When you were little.
- Right.

15
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,040
- I wore this all the time.
- With a knapsack.

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,740
- Hello.
- Hello.

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,880
I'm a farmhand.

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,580
- We're wearing costumes today.
- I know.

19
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,820
- What are we doing?
- What do we do today?

20
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,390
- Why are we dressed like this?
- By the way,

21
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,480
- So Min called me yesterday.
- Why?

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,860
"Jae Seok, we will be wearing
a slave costume tomorrow."

23
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,120
(Did the concept leak?)

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,220
- How did she know?
- I heard that too.

25
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,650
- She even knows about ads.
- Who is that?

26
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,400
I said I was hungry,

27
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,530
and she said, "Haha, we will
get to eat some chicken today."

28
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,530
What?

29
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,730
(So Min always knows about
concepts and ads before the shoot.)

30
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,760
(Episode 599)

31
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,800
(So Min always knows
where we will be doing the shoot.)

32
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,230
- Who told you that?
- Really?

33
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,830
- She hears it from an insider.
- It's an insider job.

34
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,930
She's close to the production crew.

35
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,940
Do you...

36
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,770
- I mean...
- Who are you dating? Tell me.

37
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,910
- I was...
- Who is it?

38
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,180
- There's someone.
- Who is it?

39
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,820
- Who told you?
- There's someone.

40
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,850
- Who is it?
- You're surprised too, right?

41
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,880
- Is that true?
- Who on earth is that?

42
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,580
She told me not to eat.

43
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,550
- She said we'd eat some chicken.
- She knows everything.

44
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,760
We need to know this.

45
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,080
We should enjoy the food...

46
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,930
- to please the advertisers.
- So where did you hear that?

47
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,020
- Who's the insider?
- Who told you that?

48
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,460
- Bo Pil.
- We have to find it out.

49
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,720
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

50
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,570
I'll offer a reward for that.

51
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,600
Seriously...

52
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,660
If you find it out, I'll give you
1,000 dollars in R money.

53
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,740
R money?

54
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,470
A thousand dollars in R money?

55
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,680
What would we use the money for?

56
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,440
- We can use it in Running Man.
- We will use it sometime.

57
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,910
- Give me the initials.
- I'm sure...

58
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,850
- it's her boyfriend.
- No.

59
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,270
- Listen to me.
- It's impossible...

60
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,190
- unless they're in love.
- Look at So Min.

61
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,710
She even braided her hair
for this costume.

62
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,490
- Isn't it good to know?
- Look at her hair.

63
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,850
- This is against the rules.
- I'm prepared for this.

64
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,630
- Just give me the initials.
- I wonder who it is.

65
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,690
- Why are you holding my hand?
- Who is it, So Min?

66
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,020
- It's hot.
- Who is it?

67
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,860
- It must be her boyfriend.
- Why are you doing this?

68
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,490
All right. Let me tell you
about today's race.

69
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,510
The name of today's race
is Running Chronicles.

70
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,600
- Running Chronicles?
- Running Chronicles?

71
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,740
I bet we will eat some jeon today.

72
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,600
You will be the characters of
many different fairy tales today...

73
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,810
- through the race.
- Fairy tales.

74
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,540
The rules of Running Chronicles.

75
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,690
The members will be characters from
many different fairy tales today...

76
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,290
for each mission.

77
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,660
But among the seven characters
they are going to pick,

78
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,690
there is a corrupt official,
which means a spy.

79
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,970
One of the characters will be...

80
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,040
a spy, which is called
a corrupt official.

81
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,540
- Really?
- Yes.

82
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,540
And this is what the spy is doing.

83
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,630
The member who picks a character
with the corrupt official stamp...

84
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,780
has to hide the identity of
the corrupt official in the story.

85
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,570
While the corrupt official
pretends to be a good person,

86
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,290
the prize money of 10 dollars
is accumulated every 5 minutes.

87
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,350
Meanwhile, the other
six members will get...

88
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,880
one penalty ball every 30 minutes.

89
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,000
The longer it takes them
to catch the corrupt official,

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,100
the more penalty balls they get.

91
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,500
The rest of the members can
reach an agreement...

92
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,230
to put the corrupt official to
the Bell of Truth and arrest him.

93
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,630
If the corrupt official is arrested,

94
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,440
he doesn't win the prize money...

95
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,850
and gets an extra 20 penalty balls.

96
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,620
If the corrupt official
is not arrested,

97
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,140
he wins the prize money,

98
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,880
and the rest of the members get
three penalty balls each.

99
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,320
Once the Bell of Truth rings,

100
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,190
they will pick one of the penalty
balls that have been accumulated.

101
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,820
And the member who's picked
will get a penalty.

102
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,040
Once the penalty is over,
the new fairy tale starts.

103
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,370
And the members will pick
new characters.

104
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,540
There can be a new corrupt official,

105
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,540
or the one from the previous story
can pick the corrupt official again.

106
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,510
- I don't want to be a spy.
- I know.

107
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,380
Once you arrest or fail to arrest
the corrupt official,

108
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,040
the next fairy tale begins.

109
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,290
(Whether the corrupt official is
arrested or not, the story changes.)

110
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,320
- And there will be a new spy.
- A new spy.

111
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,820
We don't know how many fairy tales
there will be until four o'clock.

112
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,950
We prepared many different stories.

113
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,630
Please remember that you can arrest
a corrupt official at any time.

114
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,660
Just put the corrupt official
on the straw mat...

115
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,660
and say, "Ring the Bell of Truth."

116
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,000
- The Bell of Truth.
- It's like "Truth Game".

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,530
It's been a long time.
I was the host of the show.

118
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,870
- Weren't you on the show?
- I was.

119
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,330
- Was he the first MC?
- No.

120
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,630
Seok Jin was after me.

121
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,980
I took over the show from him.

122
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,030
- You did?
- He took it over.

123
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,200
And it got canceled.

124
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,400
(He took it over,
and it got canceled.)

125
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,750
("Truth Game": A game show where
they found out what was real...)

126
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,840
(that aired from 1999 to 2008.)

127
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,190
(The last MC of "Truth Game")

128
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,930
(They will say the same thing
to arrest the corrupt official.)

129
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,950
- It got canceled?
- Yes.

130
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,130
- It was over after a year.
- Oh, dear.

131
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,690
- Were you the last MC?
- It was a great show.

132
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,930
I was the last MC.

133
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,370
- Let's begin the first fairy tale.
- What is it?

134
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,740
Chapter One of Running Chronicles,
"Heungboojeon".

135
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,530
Characters. Heungboo, Nolboo,

136
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,440
and Nolboo's wife.

137
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,110
All right. You will pick
the first characters then.

138
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,550
When you've gathered again,

139
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,940
- there will be a spy.
- Okay.

140
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,250
Does the spy have a special mission?

141
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,080
You seemed to understand
all the rules earlier.

142
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,950
When the corrupt official comes,

143
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,230
you should cook
the corrupt official.

144
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,020
- You should cook it...
- Like Beijing duck?

145
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,820
- With some water...
- Let me slap you.

146
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,170
I wonder what my character will be.

147
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,190
I want to be a spy.

148
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,240
(One of the scrolls has
the corrupt official seal on it.)

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,030
Does one of the scrolls
have the corrupt official seal?

150
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,810
I can play for money
if I become a spy.

151
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,640
- I can get the R money.
- Right.

152
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,980
You will get real money.

153
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,250
- Real money?
- Yes.

154
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,990
This is...

155
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,260
I want to be a spy.

156
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,560
- Does it say "corrupt official?"
- Yes.

157
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,820
(Jeerren Buffett wants to be a spy
and win the prize money.)

158
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,560
Ta-da.

159
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,150
(Did Seok Jin pick
the corrupt official as he wanted?)

160
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,190
So you picked Nolboo.

161
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,570
You punks.

162
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,690
We have 6 scrolls
with 3 different characters.

163
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,830
(It's Jae Seok's turn.)

164
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,130
I don't want to be a spy.

165
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,530
(I don't want to be a spy.)

166
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,270
(Jae Seok also picks Nolboo.)

167
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,340
What are you?

168
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,510
- Are you Nolboo?
- I'm Nolboo, you punk.

169
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,190
- What are you?
- I'm Nolboo.

170
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,380
- I'm Nolboo.
- I'm Nolboo.

171
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,210
You're a fake Nolboo.

172
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,490
- You can't be Nolboo.
- I'm Nolboo.

173
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,150
Don't be ridiculous. I'm Nolboo.

174
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,150
- Ridiculous?
- I picked it first.

175
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,370
I'm glad to hear that.
Move over, you punk!

176
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,520
How dare you...

177
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,070
- This is my seat.
- You punk.

178
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,500
You are a fake.

179
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,300
- Fake?
- I'm Nolboo.

180
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,770
This one looks tight.

181
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,340
We didn't mean anything like that.

182
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,570
(He picks one
after an unnecessary mind game.)

183
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,440
(What's Jong Kook's identity?)

184
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,050
The world is full of fake Nolboos.

185
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,580
Why do we have the same characters?

186
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,880
What? I bet you are
a corrupt official.

187
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,820
(Laughing out loud)

188
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,560
- That was sharp.
- You're being strange.

189
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,820
(You're being strange.)

190
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,520
This is really...

191
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,570
- I went overboard.
- You're being...

193
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,390
You're being strange.

194
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,570
Aren't you the corrupt official?

195
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,330
- If I were the corrupt official...
- The corrupt official?

196
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,610
- I'm not the corrupt official.
- You can't even look at me.

197
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,440
- Hey.
- It's Seok Jin.

198
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,570
- I just...
- You insolent brat!

199
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,610
- It's Seok Jin.
- I was going to say that.

200
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,820
- Welcome.
- It must be Seok Jin.

201
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,380
- Hey.
- He's being strange.

202
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,620
- He's really strange.
- He's weird.

203
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,920
- Don't sit down.
- He just sounded suspicious.

204
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,580
- You know that, right?
- That was unnatural.

205
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,860
Let me tell you something.
I was watching him from a distance.

206
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,730
- This is crazy.
- He had one hand here.

207
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,230
(Defective Kim is known
to have a good hunch.)

208
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,430
"You can't even look at me."

209
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,020
He was like this. He's strange.
It's Seok Jin.

210
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,430
- That's not true.
- What are you?

211
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,690
"That's not true, you punk."

212
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,300
- I'm Heungboo.
- Heungboo?

213
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,670
- You're Heungboo.
- Yes.

214
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,200
Hey, is he Heungboo?

215
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,010
We have the wrong person.

216
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,070
There might be...

217
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,440
- the corrupt official in there.
- Yes, that's possible.

218
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,610
- I pick this one.
- Okay.

219
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,750
(Haha is done
choosing his character.)

220
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,380
I'll pick this one.

221
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,250
I'm...

222
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,510
(Why is Ji Hyo smiling?)

223
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,860
- What are you?
- Your lips...

224
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,650
- Honey.
- Hey.

225
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,430
- You're Nolboo's wife.
- Who's Nolboo here?

226
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,630
- I'm Nolboo.
- I'm Nolboo.

227
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,730
- These two.
- I'm Nolboo.

228
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,130
He's a fake.

229
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,440
- I'm Nolboo.
- I'm Nolboo's wife.

230
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,740
He's the corrupt official.

231
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,240
- What are you?
- I didn't pick it.

232
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,460
- Are you Heungboo?
- She's Heungboo.

233
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,530
- Hello, Nolboo. I'm Heungboo.
- Hey, Heungboo.

234
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,810
- Hello, Heungboo.
- How are you, Nolboo?

235
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,010
Come here, honey.

236
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,200
"Honey?" What are you talking about?

237
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,310
I'm Nolboo.

238
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,620
- She's Heungboo.
- She's Heungboo.

239
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,820
- Hang on.
- Seok Jin.

240
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,750
- I'm your wife.
- What are you doing?

241
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,050
- I'm Nolboo's wife.
- What's with you?

242
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,490
- What are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

243
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,560
- Sorry, Ji Hyo.
- He's strange.

244
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,260
- No, that's not it.
- She's Heungboo.

245
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,490
- She's your younger brother.
- She's Heungboo.

246
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,590
You said you were Heungboo.

247
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,630
- I'm Heungboo, and she's Heungboo.
- Right.

248
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,290
- Two Nolboos and two Heungboos.
- What's wrong with you?

249
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,500
Hey, Heungboo.

250
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,970
- He's the corrupt official.
- No.

251
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,030
It must be him.

252
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,660
As soon as the rest
of the members get here, let's...

253
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,660
Okay. Let's do that.

254
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,130
Put him on the straw mat.

255
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,970
I can't believe this.
We're still here,

256
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,010
but all the cameras are gone.

257
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,350
Hey, there's Jimmy Jib.

258
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,880
(Hello.)

259
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,120
Right.
The biggest one is still here.

260
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,350
- Heungboo is unbelievable
- Heungboo is unbelievable

261
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,140
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

262
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,880
- Heungboo is unbelievable
- Heungboo is unbelievable

263
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,280
("Heungboo Is Unbelievable", 1995)

264
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,130
(It's a hit by Yukgaksu that swept
the country in the mid-1990s.)

265
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,730
(Those who are in their mid-30s
and over know this legendary song.)

266
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,430
- Heungboo is unbelievable
- Heungboo is unbelievable

267
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,470
(Yukgaksu returns.)

268
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,370
Heungboo is unbelievable

269
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,740
- Oh, dear, Nolboo
- Oh, dear, Nolboo

270
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,240
- How could you kick me out
- How could you kick me out

271
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,110
- Where am I supposed to go
- Where am I supposed to go

272
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,670
- In this freezing winter
- In this freezing winter

273
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,850
- Where am I supposed to go
- Where am I supposed to go

274
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,680
Do you expect me
to tell you where to go?

275
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,120
- Should I go to Mount Jiri?
- Should I go to Mount Jiri?

276
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,380
- This is...
- Only we know the song.

277
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,860
- Kids these days don't know it.
- They don't know.

278
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,890
What are you?

279
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,760
- Heungboo is unbelievable
- What are you?

280
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,920
- What is he?
- I'm Heungboo.

281
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,000
Why do we have so many Heungboos?

282
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,100
I'm Nolboo.

283
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,530
- Are you Nolboo?
- I'm Nolboo.

284
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,740
- Aren't you the corrupt official?
- You're right.

285
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,840
I'm bossam.

286
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,110
- Bossam?
- You're bossam.

287
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,030
- That's right.
- Is he budaejjigae?

288
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,710
- He's budaejjigae.
- Budaejjigae?

289
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,480
I'm Grandma One.

290
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,170
- You're a woman.
- What are you?

291
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,410
That's right.

292
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,350
- I'm Nolboo's wife.
- Ma'am.

293
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,490
- Yes.
- Ma'am.

294
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,860
- She was pretty when she was young.
- Hey.

295
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,910
Will you put it on right?

296
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,460
- You're an aristocrat.
- What?

297
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,960
Just don't put it on your head.
You should wear it properly.

298
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,390
- Right. Wear it properly.
- You should.

299
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,060
- I'm wearing it properly.
- Pull it low.

300
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,020
- Wear it properly.
- My gosh.

301
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,290
Your hairstyle is not important.

302
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,510
- Because of his hair... Come on.
- Come on.

303
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,060
- He just cares about his hairstyle.
- Don't do that.

304
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,930
- It took me an hour to do my hair.
- Grab him.

305
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,640
Grab him.

306
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,580
- Play some music.
- Don't do that.

307
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,220
- You should...
- Don't do it!

308
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,490
- Let your fringe down.
- Come on.

309
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,410
- That looks good.
- Gosh, you ruined my hair.

310
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,780
- Now, you're wearing it properly.
- That's good.

311
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,010
- Great.
- Gosh, my hair.

312
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,630
- Let your fringe down.
- You look great.

313
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,680
(Play music.)

314
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,890
(After pulling a prank,
they start a village party.)

315
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,060
(The last member So Min
who picked Nolboo's wife enters.)

316
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,260
- Hey!
- She's my wife.

317
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,100
(There are 3 Heungboos, 2 Nolboos,
and 2 Nolboo's wives.)

318
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,160
(One of them is
the corrupt official.)

319
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,470
Who are you?

320
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,710
- She's my wife.
- Me?

321
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,140
I'm Nolboo's wife.

322
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,880
Nolboo's wife?

323
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,350
- That suits her.
- She's Nolboo's wife.

324
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,220
- I'm Nolboo's wife.
- He's...

325
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,510
- Nolboo's wife too.
- Gosh, seriously.

326
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,450
- Honey, come and sit here.
- Hold on. Guys.

327
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,310
Guys, So Min took a lot of time.

328
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,720
She must've had a lot
to think about.

329
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,020
- She didn't even have a choice.
- What took you so long?

330
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,090
I bet she needed time to take it in.

331
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,100
- I had makeup done...
- I agree.

332
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,700
I mean,
there was only one role left.

333
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,630
- What role did you pick?
- I'm Nolboo's wife.

334
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,790
- You...
- I had to have makeup done.

335
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,060
Why are you Nolboo's wife?

336
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,030
- Hey, who are you?
- You...

337
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,200
- Why don't you sit here?
- Gosh.

338
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,340
- You sit here.
- Switch your seats.

339
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,530
My sister-in-law, please sit here.

340
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,740
- Right.
- Hey.

341
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,770
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, my.

342
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,980
Are you Nolboo's wife?

343
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,030
(The two Nolboo's wives started
a war of nerves.)

344
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,750
When did you get married?

345
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,380
- I got married 30 years ago.
- My sister-in-law.

346
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,720
- They're fighting.
- My sisters-in-law are fighting.

347
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,090
- I got married 35 years ago.
- Go for it!

348
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,680
- Who are you? You're bald.
- Hey.

349
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,960
Honey, sit down.

350
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,550
- I mean... Honey.
- Which one of us?

351
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,130
- Mister, put on your hat properly.
- Why?

352
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,020
- Come on. Stop it already.
- Grab him.

353
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,960
- All right. Let's grab him.
- I'll play other roles too.

354
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,560
- Leave me alone!
- Let your fringe down.

355
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,970
Don't touch my hair.

356
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,030
- Let your fringe down.
- Stop it.

357
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,100
Let your fringe down.

358
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,930
- How dare you style your hair?
- Good.

359
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,800
- How dare you style your hair?
- You're Nolboo. How dare you?

360
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,930
You should get into your character.

361
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,450
- You look cute with your fringe.
- You look cute.

362
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,400
- Do I look better with this style?
- You look cute.

363
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,670
- My wife told me to pull it back.
- Press it down.

364
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,270
Everyone else says I look better
with my fringe down like this.

365
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,990
- When did I say that?
- You look cute.

366
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,180
- When did I tell you to do that?
- Gosh.

367
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,490
Pull it back.

368
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,380
- You wench.
- He looks...

369
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,490
- Hey, you wench!
- You wench.

370
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,630
I'm his wife, you wench!

371
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,230
(They keep fighting over
Jee Nolboo.)

372
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,330
"I'm his wife."

373
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,260
I'm flattered to see them
fighting over me.

374
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,800
So this is how it feels.

375
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,930
Shall we ring the bell?

376
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,300
- The corrupt official gets...
- Who do you think it is?

377
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,710
- ten dollars every five minutes,
- Haha.

378
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,110
- and the others get...
- I'm sure of it.

379
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,800
an extra penalty ball
every 30 minutes.

380
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,670
- I think...
- It must be 1 of the 2 of them.

381
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,620
that the Heungboo over there is
the corrupt official.

382
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,620
- Why?
- Oh, really?

383
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,180
- You mean, Kim Heungboo?
- He keeps squinting.

384
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,680
- Me?
- He's suspicious.

385
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,380
- I squint my eyes?
- As if he were trying to seduce me.

386
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,280
- My eyes look...
- You can't love each other.

387
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,230
- We're both Heungboo.
- He has eyes like a snake's.

388
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,420
- A snake's eyes?
- Look at him squinting.

389
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,130
- My husband isn't the one.
- I'm not.

390
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,870
- What makes you think so?
- He's just Nolboo.

391
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,700
- You don't know that.
- He's just Nolboo.

392
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,800
Honey, what was that?

393
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,030
- What are you doing, honey?
- So Min.

394
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,380
- I can't...
- That'd make it look weird.

395
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,610
- I can't...
- They look weird...

396
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,540
I can't kiss you.

397
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,540
- But I can kiss him.
- Honey.

398
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,950
My goodness. Honey.

399
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,480
There are some people
who would criticize me.

400
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,910
I can't do that.

401
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,680
- But him...
- Please don't criticize him.

402
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,360
- Please don't.
- It's okay if I kiss him.

403
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,860
- He hates being criticized.
- Right.

404
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,760
- He'd be in big trouble.
- He hates being criticized.

405
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,130
- Seriously...
- I can't kiss you.

406
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,420
Please don't criticize Seok Jin.

407
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,630
- Please don't do that.
- That's okay.

408
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,700
- Please don't criticize him.
- That's okay. I don't mind.

409
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,500
- He cries all night long.
- No, I don't do that.

410
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,870
- We're just acting.
- I'm okay.

411
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,060
I can't make everyone like me.
Criticize me if you want to.

412
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,970
- He's lying.
- Yes.

413
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,300
My gosh. It went up to 20 dollars.

414
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,640
- The money is being accumulated.
- Oh, it's going up.

415
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,770
- That's right.
- We should hurry up.

416
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,880
- Let's catch the corrupt official.
- It goes up every five minutes.

417
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,950
We should hurry up.

418
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,880
The spy gets the prize money
if someone else is caught.

419
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,460
- If someone else is caught?
- Yes.

420
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,120
The spy should try to make us
believe that it's someone else.

421
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,180
But there's nothing we can do
to catch the spy.

422
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,460
- Should we just go with our hunch?
- Should we choose a random person?

423
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,130
- That's fine too. Or you can get...
- Right. There should be something.

424
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,100
a hint about the spy
by completing a mission.

425
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,430
That means that the spy will
try to fail the mission.

426
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,340
I'll explain
the first mission to you.

427
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,980
- What is it?
- It's the kind of game you like.

428
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,610
- It must be the drawing game.
- The drawing game?

429
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,010
- Is it the drawing game?
- Let's do that.

430
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,380
But it's not the drawing game.

431
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,750
- Gosh. Why?
- Oh, no.

432
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,120
You have to describe a proverb
using a single photo.

433
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,260
- It's One Photo Proverb.
- One Photo Proverb?

434
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,860
One of you guesses the answer.
The rest six of you...

435
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,600
- have 20 seconds...
- To take a photo?

436
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,870
to take a photo
that describes the given proverb.

437
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,840
It's similar to the game
where you explain with actions.

438
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,710
You win points if you guess
the right proverb from the photo.

439
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,470
Kind words...

440
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,980
Will come back...

441
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,900
- It sounds difficult.
- to you...

442
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,300
You have three attempts,
and if you succeed even once,

443
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,580
you get a hint
about the corrupt official.

444
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,620
It's difficult.

445
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,140
- I'll give you the proverb.
- Yes.

446
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,510
And 20 seconds after that,
we'll take a photo of you.

447
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,880
- All right.
- It's an order, I guess.

448
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,830
Twenty seconds will start...
Ready, go.

449
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,020
(To try to cook beans with lightning
and eat them)

450
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,330
Gosh, that's too difficult.

451
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,330
- We can pose like this.
- Make the shape.

452
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,060
(The members in the front describe
"lightning".)

453
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,390
- It's not easy.
- Lightning?

454
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,160
- How should we...
- Thor.

455
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,840
- We should describe...
- It's not easy.

456
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,300
Wait. Keep it there.

457
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,800
I'll describe "beans".

458
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,900
- You do that.
- "Beans".

459
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,930
Okay.

460
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,430
- Four, three...
- I'll join you guys.

461
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,250
Two, one.

462
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,880
- Click.
- This is too difficult.

463
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,950
It's too difficult.

464
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,880
(This is the photo
that's been taken.)

465
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,350
- Hold on.
- It's too difficult.

466
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,380
- It's difficult.
- What was Haha doing?

467
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,860
Look at the photo
and guess the answer.

468
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,490
- What were you doing?
- What was Haha doing?

469
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,680
What did you do?

470
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,020
- Now...
- Haha, what does that mean?

471
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,650
You're not allowed to
give him any hints.

472
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,100
- Okay. Let's be quiet.
- Haha didn't do a good job.

473
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,560
It starts here and ends here, right?

474
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,430
- Correct.
- It goes in this direction.

475
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,430
(Seok Sam tries to
figure it out calmly.)

476
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,870
Something is falling from the sky.

477
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,130
- What...
- It was so hard to describe.

478
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,840
- What is he trying to describe?
- My pose...

479
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,930
- Don't think about it.
- He ruined it.

480
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,480
Why didn't you do
what you said you'd do?

481
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,580
(Haha's pose makes it hard
for Seok Jin to deduce.)

482
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,980
He's the corrupt official.

483
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,040
Right. He must be.

484
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,120
- Three.
- What is this?

485
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,640
- Two. One.
- Gosh.

486
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,680
- I don't know. I really don't.
- It's too difficult.

487
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,310
It was so hard to describe
"lightning".

488
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,960
- To cook beans with lightning...
- Exactly. How...

489
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,460
One of us should've described
"beans".

490
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,460
- I did.
- One of us...

491
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,520
- I posed like I was cooking.
- I was eating them.

492
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,360
- I see.
- What did you do?

493
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,660
- Don't suspect me. I'm not the spy.
- Or maybe...

494
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,260
- Let's move on. I'll go next.
- Haha is suspicious.

495
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,290
- I think Haha was just confused.
- It's Jong Kook.

496
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,760
We should divide the words
to describe.

497
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,840
- Don't change the order.
- Right?

498
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,880
- I swear it's Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook, we'll start with him.

499
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,710
- Let's give it a try.
- I'm 100 percent sure.

500
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,770
Let's do this.

501
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,140
Hey, So Min.

502
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,850
Put them on, please.

503
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,170
- Okay.
- Me?

504
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,720
- I'm serious. Trust me.
- He's framing Jong Kook.

505
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,380
- Let's see how he acts this time.
- You have to believe me. I'm sure.

506
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,280
Haha, why would you frame him?

507
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,010
- That's suspicious too.
- Right.

508
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,020
I swear.

509
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,090
Hey, So Min.

510
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,460
- Put them on, please.
- I think it's Se Chan.

511
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,000
- Me?
- I'm sure of it. It's Se Chan.

512
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,390
- I'm not lying.
- Let's begin. Come here.

513
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,470
Let's see
if he gets the correct answer.

514
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,390
- But Haha is suspicious...
- Just do a good job in the game.

515
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,740
- He's trying to frame Jong Kook.
- Seok Jin, it's him.

516
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,030
- Believe me.
- It's not me.

517
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,980
- Well... Let's go.
- Let's discuss it after this round.

518
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,770
We'll give you the question.
You have 20 seconds.

519
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,100
Show them the question.

520
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,950
- Okay.
- This one is easy.

521
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,310
- This one is easy.
- Slapping.

522
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,420
- We can do this.
- Slap me.

523
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,720
- This one is doable. Here.
- Right.

524
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,950
Like this.

525
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,310
Look. It says "Han River".

526
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,690
(To get slapped at Jongno
and glare at the Han River)

527
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,310
(So Min, Se Chan, and Ji Hyo will
describe the latter part.)

528
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,660
- I'll describe the river.
- I'll cry.

529
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,050
- I'll describe the water.
- I'll cry.

530
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,050
Hold on.

531
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,960
- I'll describe tears.
- It's "glare".

532
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,470
- It says "glare".
- What does it mean?

533
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,090
- My gosh.
- Five.

534
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,440
- Four.
- It's "glare", not "cry".

535
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,260
- Three. Two. One.
- Stair angrily.

536
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,670
Click.

537
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,410
Three. Two. One. Click.

538
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,770
- Good.
- Okay.

539
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,370
- I wasn't ready.
- You weren't supposed to cry.

540
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,570
- Okay. Take them off.
- He's taken aback.

541
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,180
- You should've glared...
- Jae Seok.

542
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:57,840
- Jong Kook.
- What's wrong with Seok Jin?

543
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,610
I was...

544
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,550
My gosh. What's with this pose?

545
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,080
I wasn't ready.

546
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,160
Why didn't you...

547
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,760
- What is that?
- I mean...

548
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,120
- But he can get the right answer.
- What were you guys doing?

549
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,260
- He can get it right.
- What's that?

550
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,940
- Oh, I know the answer.
- Right.

551
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,000
- I know the answer.
- You can get it right.

552
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,060
- It's an easy one.
- Yes.

553
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,600
- It's an easy one.
- You can do it.

554
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,910
(Did he figure it out?)

555
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,710
To get slapped at the Han River...

556
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,250
- What?
- Five.

557
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,450
- Where do you get slapped? Wait.
- What did you say?

558
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,220
- To get slapped somewhere...
- Hey.

559
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,540
- Hey.
- Euljiro?

560
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,580
Right.

561
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,810
- Stop it. Gosh, you.
- It means...

562
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,010
you take your anger out on
someone who's not to blame.

563
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,020
- Just say the proverb.
- Give me a second.

564
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,590
- Why... What?
- Where do you get slapped?

565
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,020
Where do you get slapped?

566
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,090
- It's 100 percent certain.
- Wait.

567
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,200
Where do you get slapped?

568
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,970
Well, I never get slapped.

569
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,020
That's true.

570
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,090
- It's 100 percent certain.
- I don't get slapped.

571
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,640
- It's 100 percent certain.
- I mean, usually...

572
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,800
- Hold on a second.
- Apple trees.

573
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,910
"Hey, Doo Han."

574
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,210
- He keeps giving him hints.
- Wait.

575
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,340
- "Hey, Doo Han."
- Right.

576
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,270
Is it "To get slapped at Jongno"?

577
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,510
Yes, that's correct.

578
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,450
To get slapped at Jongno...

579
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,840
- Jong Kook, look at this photo.
- Look at the photo.

580
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,610
- Look at us.
- Five.

581
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,460
- Jongno... Come on. Wait.
- Four.

582
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,990
- Three.
- To get slapped at Jongno...

583
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,080
- Two.
- Han River.

584
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,230
- Gosh.
- One.

585
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,820
- To get slapped at Jongno...
- It's difficult.

586
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,960
- and run away to the river?
- Let's catch the spy.

587
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,730
- The answer is...
- To get slapped at Jongno...

588
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,500
- And glare at the Han River.
- Glare at the Han River.

589
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,760
(They failed to get a hint again.)

590
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,790
Hold on. What was Seok Jin doing?

591
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,970
It wasn't my intention.

592
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,330
I didn't hear him counting down.

593
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,910
- It's Se Chan.
- I'm not lying.

594
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,100
I told him that it's "glare",
not "cry", so many times.

595
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,750
- But he made a crying face.
- I was just pointing at my eyes.

596
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,370
To describe the word "glare",

597
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,990
you should've made this face.

598
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,220
Exactly. He's suspicious.

599
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,260
- I described the eyes.
- He's suspicious.

600
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,990
- Shall we go with Se Chan?
- Let's go with him.

601
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,780
- I'm not the spy. I meant the eyes.
- Let's do that.

602
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,890
- Shall we do it now?
- Yes.

603
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,730
- I knew it was Se Chan.
- I'm telling you, I'm not the spy.

604
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,400
- Is it Se Chan?
- Let's catch him for now.

605
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,200
You can catch him now.
If he's not the spy,

606
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,230
the spy gets the prize money,

607
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,900
and the others get
three penalty balls each.

608
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,970
- No.
- We must be cautious.

609
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:56,970
- Let's go with Se Chan.
- Right. Se Chan...

610
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:57,970
- Let's go.
- Se Chan?

611
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,710
- What if I'm not the spy?
- I'm sure you are.

612
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,980
- Isn't Haha acting suspiciously?
- He's suspicious.

613
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,450
- He's...
- I suspect Haha too.

614
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,480
I don't know why,
but he kept accusing you.

615
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,980
- He kept framing you.
- It's Se Chan.

616
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,070
I'm not the spy. I swear.

617
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,310
- Hey, come here.
- You suspected me before.

618
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,950
- It's Se Chan.
- I'm not the spy.

619
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,780
- Hey. I knew you were fake.
- Come here.

620
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,220
- Are you serious? Me?
- Go on.

621
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,780
- Me?
- He accused me?

622
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,850
- We'll pick Haha?
- Gosh.

623
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,900
- Okay.
- Wait.

624
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,700
I swear I'm not the spy.

625
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,670
- I'm not the spy either.
- Haha is definitely the spy.

626
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,760
I told you it was Jong Kook.

627
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,060
- See? He keeps...
- That's suspicious.

628
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,500
- Right. He can't be the spy.
- He thinks I'm the spy? That's odd.

629
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,940
- That's suspicious.
- How do we arrest the spy?

630
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,870
If all of you agree, ring the bell,
and let him sit under it.

631
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,010
- But if we complete the mission,
- Okay. Sit down.

632
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,600
- we get a hint, right?
- Yes, correct.

633
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,680
Then let's get a hint first.

634
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,420
- Why? Do we get a hint?
- Let's complete the mission.

635
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,680
But the prize money is going up.

636
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,420
- We can stop that.
- It's better to catch the spy.

637
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,510
- It's better to catch the spy.
- We can arrest the spy...

638
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,220
- after narrowing down the suspects.
- We already narrowed it down...

639
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,890
But we've made it this far!

640
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,890
(But we've made it this far!)

641
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,890
- Can you step aside for a second?
- We just have to ring the bell.

642
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,200
- Step back, please.
- The money is going up!

643
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,400
- Step back for a second.
- He's your older brother.

644
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,090
- Heungboo, he's your older brother.
- I'm Nolboo.

645
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,360
- I'm Nolboo.
- He's your older brother.

646
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,200
- I learned a low kick last week.
- He's your older brother.

647
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,710
- Jong Kook. I mean, Heungboo.
- What are you doing?

648
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,410
- What I'm saying is...
- You're his older brother.

649
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,680
- The money is going up.
- that we have...

650
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,040
no information right now.

651
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,600
It's 50 dollars...
It went up to 60 dollars.

652
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,010
- They won't give us a good hint.
- It just went up to 60 dollars.

653
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,420
- They won't.
- They'll give us a useless hint.

654
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,420
- I said I wasn't the spy.
- Let's check him first.

655
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,960
If you arrest the spy,
the spy gets 20 penalty balls.

656
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,690
- Okay. Let's do this.
- It's Se Chan.

657
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,390
- Let's just do this.
- I'm really not the spy.

658
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,260
Who picked me? You picked me, right?
And you too, right?

659
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,350
- I didn't pick you.
- And you suspected me.

660
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,400
- Let's check.
- Okay.

661
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,930
- Let's go ahead.
- Ring...

662
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,400
- the Bell of Truth!
- The Bell of Truth!

663
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,570
(The final suspect Haha is
in front of the Bell of Truth.)

664
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,150
- Haha...
- Haha.

665
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,740
- Is he the corrupt official?
- is...

666
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,850
Right?

667
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,430
(Haha was brought to trial
33 minutes after the beginning.)

668
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,050
(Could he be the corrupt official?)

669
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,670
- not the corrupt official.
- I told you so.

670
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,020
(They failed to arrest the spy.)

671
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,670
I told you I wasn't.
Why didn't you believe me?

672
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,530
Why did you accuse him suddenly?

673
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,530
What's wrong with you?

674
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,670
- She...
- She's not close to you.

675
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,030
- She always suspects me.
- Hey.

676
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,940
- Then it must be him.
- I'm not the spy.

677
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,950
The corrupt official will receive
60 dollars of prize money...

678
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,680
- right away.
- Gosh.

679
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,990
And the others will get
three penalty balls each.

680
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,010
- Now...
- But it's too hard to find the spy.

681
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,120
Here's 60 dollars.

682
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,550
The first corrupt official...

683
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,220
- It's not that hard.
- Se Chan.

684
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,750
Jae Seok, come and receive it.

685
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,320
(Jae Seok, come and receive it.)

686
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,050
(The real corrupt official is
Jae Seok.)

687
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,200
I said it was him...

688
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,900
- What?
- I knew it was him.

689
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,530
(Everyone is shocked
as no one suspected him.)

690
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,740
(Jae Seok receives 60 dollars.)

691
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,760
Why would you give it to me
right here?

692
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,330
Why would you give me this here?

693
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,030
You should've given me at the back.

694
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,500
- You corrupt official!
- Darn.

695
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,600
- How dare you?
- I can't believe this.

696
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,650
- See? I told you so.
- Why did you give me this here?

697
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,040
I said he was suspicious.

698
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,840
- I was going to do so.
- I mean, why would you...

699
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,510
- Why here?
- But he stopped me.

700
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,250
Why in front of everyone?

701
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,490
- Gosh.
- You evil man!

702
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,850
I'm sorry, everyone.

703
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,160
Gosh, that was embarrassing.

704
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,750
(When he picked his role...)

705
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,560
(Unlike his wish,
he picked the corrupt official.)

706
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,640
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

707
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,100
As soon as everyone is here...

708
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,300
(Jae Seok's strategy:
1. Framing Seok Jin)

709
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,100
(2. Telling on the members
who give hints)

710
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:29,390
(3. Following the majority opinion)

711
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:36,660
(4. Pushing forward with a trial
before completing the mission)

712
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,790
The six members got
three penalty balls each.

713
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,490
- Okay.
- We almost got him.

714
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,930
- Why did you act suspicious?
- There's nothing we can do now.

715
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,370
- I did my best.
- Now...

716
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,400
Why did he act suspiciously?

717
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,940
We'll pick the person
to get the first penalty now.

718
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,330
- Let's go.
- He distracted us.

719
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,800
- He rushed us to arrest the spy.
- That's right.

720
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,680
- Haha seemed suspicious.
- Let's dance to a fast song

721
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,480
- He did seem suspicious.
- Let's dance to a fast song

722
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,420
When I say I swear to the deity,
I'm telling you the truth.

723
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,950
- I don't believe you.
- But you lied many times before.

724
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,220
I had no idea.

725
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,220
- Just pick a ball already.
- Let's dance to a fast song

726
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,660
He's so excited.

727
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,550
Here it is. Let's see.

728
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,660
Who is it?

729
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,820
Well...

730
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,790
Yang Se Chan.

731
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,130
(Yang Heungboo will
get the penalty.)

732
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,140
Oh, no.

733
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,330
The first penalty is to reenact
the iconic scene of "Heungboojeon".

734
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,240
It's getting slapped
with a rice scoop.

735
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,500
Who should hit him?

736
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,640
- Let's let So Min hit him.
- That sounds good.

737
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,650
- Let's let her do that.
- Any one of you can do it.

738
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,000
- Right. She's Nolboo's wife.
- Yes.

739
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,270
- She's Nolboo's wife.
- You...

740
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,480
Did you come to my house
to borrow money?

741
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,510
My dear sister-in-law,
can you give me some food?

742
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,450
We have no food for you!

743
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,450
(We have no food for you!)

744
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,550
(Yu Jae Seok, the corrupt official,
won in Chapter One.)

745
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,160
- We have no food to give you!
- Okay.

746
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,820
We'll reveal the second story.

747
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,050
What is it?

748
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,560
Chapter Two of Running Chronicles,
"The Sun and the Moon".

749
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,440
The characters are
the big brother, the little sister,

750
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,090
and the tiger.

751
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,940
(Se Chan is the first member
to pick the role.)

752
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,000
I'll open it.

753
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,740
(What could be Se Chan's role?)

754
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,840
I thought it was her.

755
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
(He picked the little sister
in a red skirt.)

756
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,780
- Who are you?
- The little sister.

757
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,890
- Who are you?
- I'm the younger sibling.

758
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,160
- The younger sibling?
- Yes.

759
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,460
- Oh, the younger one is a girl.
- Yes, a girl.

760
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,490
Since I've been suspected,
I want to be the corrupt official.

761
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,020
(Did he become the corrupt official
as he wished?)

762
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,130
- He must be the older sibling.
- I'm the big brother.

763
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,470
- Your sister is here.
- He's my brother.

764
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,640
- Yes, I'm your brother.
- You didn't do anything.

765
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,400
No, they said I could come out
without makeup or anything.

766
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm the tiger.

767
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,710
I'm the tiger.

768
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,300
I'm the tiger.

769
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,950
- You must be the big brother.
- Gosh, seriously.

770
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,310
- Hey, get off the seat.
- Why?

771
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,650
(Hey, get off the seat!)

772
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,460
- I said, get off the seat!
- Why?

773
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,390
- Who are you?
- Don't you know I'm your brother?

774
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,460
- You're my younger sister. Leave!
- But...

775
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,960
- This is my seat.
- Leave.

776
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,290
That's how older brothers act
toward their younger sisters.

777
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,060
- An older brother in real life.
- Get off the seat.

778
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,230
- But... Brother.
- Get off the seat.

779
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,900
- What's your problem?
- Get off the seat.

780
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,940
Get off the seat.
Then I'll tell you.

781
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,410
- That's so realistic.
- Get off the seat.

782
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,640
- But why...
- Get off the seat.

783
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,140
- Can't you just...
- Get off the seat.

784
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,300
(I don't want to hear it.
Get off the seat.)

785
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,640
- Gosh.
- An older brother in real life.

786
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,340
- Why must you...
- Just leave.

787
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,950
- sit here?
- So this is how older brothers act.

788
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,510
- Gosh. I hate my brother.
- You're the tiger?

789
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,840
Why would he take the stress
from being singled out on me?

790
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,150
Their younger sisters would
get back at them.

791
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,510
- You mean, the older brothers?
- Yes.

792
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,510
Why would an older brother do that?

793
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,020
- Lifting up your skirt.
- An older brother...

794
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,350
Lifting up your skirt.

795
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,960
- Gosh, this is...
- Lifting up your skirt.

796
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,400
- What's wrong with you?
- Lifting up your skirt.

797
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,130
Lifting up your skirt.

798
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,260
(She's acting weird.)

799
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,030
I'm the tiger.

800
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,940
- So? What are you going to do?
- I roar.

801
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,500
I mean, you're not a real tiger.

802
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,180
Ji Hyo, why did you do that?

803
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,300
She lifted up his skirt.

804
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,380
- When little boys see a girl...
- Just be quiet.

805
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,480
wearing a skirt,

806
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,910
- they do that.
- You never act like that.

807
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,510
Ji Hyo, what...

808
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,040
- What happened to you?
- She's acting weird suddenly.

809
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,950
- Suddenly...
- She's acting weird.

810
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,740
- Did you see her roaring?
- No, she's not suspicious.

811
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,490
She usually becomes quiet
when she's chosen as a spy.

812
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,690
- No, she's acting differently.
- This is difficult.

813
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,930
In this mission,

814
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:00,290
- we'll give you a letter,
- Yes.

815
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,440
and you all have to write a word
that starts with that letter.

816
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,670
- A letter?
- But...

817
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,640
each object should be smaller
than the previous one.

818
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,670
You'll give us the first syllable?

819
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,000
The first syllable?

820
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,830
(They have to write an object
smaller than the previous one.)

821
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,880
(The first syllable: "han",
Korean Peninsula, Korea, Han River,)

822
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,740
(Korean beef, hanbok, hanji,
hallabong)

823
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,770
That sounds easy.
Of course, we can do it.

824
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,220
- In your position...
- Oh, we have to guess?

825
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,310
Yes, you have to guess.

826
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,650
You don't know what the person
in front of you will write.

827
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,490
Why don't we pick one person
and put him or her on trial?

828
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,660
Right.
Let's put Ji Hyo on trial now.

829
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,780
You're not the spy again, right?

830
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,890
- What?
- No, I'm not.

831
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,090
- Right now?
- Why suddenly?

832
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,930
- We should get a hint.
- Let's play it. It sounds fun.

833
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,250
- Right now?
- Are you the spy this time too?

834
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,590
- Why suddenly?
- To reduce the probability?

835
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,260
- Who do you think is the spy?
- Why would he...

836
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,530
- I don't know.
- He's suspicious.

837
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,030
It's possible that he became the spy
for the second time in a row.

838
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,140
- It's possible.
- Right.

839
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,910
But there's a low probability...

840
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,940
because there were only two roles
left for me to choose from.

841
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,940
Then why did you suggest that?
Let's get a hint first...

842
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,300
- this time.
- It'd make it easier.

843
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,540
Okay, then. Let's do that.

844
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,540
- He's really suspicious.
- Right? That's weird.

845
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,390
Please bring whiteboards
and partitions.

846
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,690
Since we failed last time,
let's get a hint first this time.

847
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,580
- Okay.
- This game requires good sense.

848
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,550
Since I'm the first person,
I should write something big.

849
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,550
Jae Seok,
why are you sitting in the middle?

850
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,020
(Jae Seok,
why are you sitting in the middle?)

851
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,590
- Why is Jae Seok...
- Then where should I sit?

852
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,240
- Sorry?
- Where do you want me to sit?

853
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,090
- Detective Kim, you seat us then.
- I mean...

854
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,140
You can sabotage the team easily
if you sit in the middle.

855
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,330
Then where do you want to sit?

856
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,040
(Glaring)

857
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,840
Where should I sit?

858
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,150
- Pardon?
- Where?

859
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,240
You should actively arrange
the order as I do.

860
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,510
You seem suspicious
because you're just sitting there.

861
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,740
- But actually...
- All right.

862
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,120
- You wouldn't be blamed...
- I mean...

863
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,690
- even if we fail.
- But that's not all.

864
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,550
He doesn't seem determined
to pull this off.

865
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,580
- Look at him.
- He's trying to...

866
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,550
- get away with it.
- He didn't analyze the game.

867
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,550
- Look at me standing here.
- He was just sitting there.

868
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,870
Do you even know the rules?

869
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,060
- Hold on.
- Do you know the rules?

870
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,240
- Do you want to pull this off?
- Why wouldn't I?

871
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,900
That's why I chose to sit
in the middle.

872
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,330
- But...
- Time is passing.

873
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,500
Then you should've arranged
the order.

874
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,640
Okay. Got it.

875
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,680
- Jae Seok must not be it, right?
- No.

876
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,650
It's possible that he became the spy
for the second time in a row.

877
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,240
- I don't think he's the spy.
- Jae Seok, sit at the end.

878
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,450
- I'll move to the end.
- The biggest thing...

879
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,040
should be something
we can think of right away.

880
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,120
- Write something huge.
- Okay.

881
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,150
Do not discuss or give one another
a hint. Here's the first question.

882
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,280
I'll write something predictable.

883
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,660
- Something predictable, okay?
- Yes, and something huge.

884
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,580
Also, I'm not the corrupt official.

885
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,660
Let's begin the first round.
Write a word that starts with "ji".

886
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,930
- "Ji"?
- "Ji"?

887
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:15,970
Write words that start with "ji"
from the biggest to the smallest.

888
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,260
- Write the biggest thing.
- "Ji"?

889
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,140
You're not allowed to discuss
or give one another a hint.

890
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,670
- Write the biggest thing.
- A word that starts with "ji".

891
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,330
- "Ji".
- "Ji"?

892
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,940
- Hey.
- What could there be such words?

893
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,100
- I'm done.
- The first word should be...

894
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,650
- that word.
- Of course.

895
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,340
- Right? You wrote it, right?
- You can think of nothing else.

896
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,770
There's nothing bigger than that.

897
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,980
- But that...
- It must be something huge.

898
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,120
How big is yours?

899
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,150
- You can't ask that.
- Come on.

900
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,650
- Use your brain!
- Five.

901
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,750
- Think of one.
- Four.

902
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,720
- Must I write one too?
- Yes, right now.

903
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,580
- I thought it was in order.
- Hurry up.

904
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,700
- Just a second. I didn't know.
- Five.

905
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,790
- Four.
- But...

906
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,520
- Three.
- Write down your name.

907
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,400
Two, one.

908
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:53,060
- Haha, say yours out loud.
- His is going to be short.

909
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,060
Haha, go ahead.

910
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,370
Earth.

911
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,440
- Good.
- Nice.

912
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,530
Jong Kook?

913
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:59,710
Mount Jiri.

914
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,840
- Okay.
- Nicely done.

915
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,480
- Nice, right?
- Ji Hyo, you're next.

916
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,010
- Jee Seok Jin.
- My gosh.

917
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,120
- My gosh.
- What?

918
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,680
- Jee Seok Jin.
- My gosh.

919
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,810
(Jee Seok Jin after Mount Jiri?)

920
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,040
- Seriously?
- Jee Seok Jin?

921
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,420
- What?
- After Mount Jiri?

922
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,810
- How's that a good answer?
- Seok Jin wrote subway. Fail!

923
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,080
Subway?

924
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,630
Seok Jin wrote subway. Fail!

925
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,020
- You wrote subway?
- Ji Hyo, come on.

926
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,170
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

927
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,590
I can't help but question Ji Hyo.

928
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,990
- What the...
- Seriously?

929
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,030
Se Chan wrote worm,
so you had no chance anyway.

930
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,000
- Worm was supposed to be mine.
- Come on.

931
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,910
- Worm?
- It had to be smaller.

932
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,910
Ji Hyo, why on earth
did you write Jee Seok Jin?

933
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,300
- Mount Jiri and then...
- Before worm...

934
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,210
The subway is too big.

935
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,540
- The subway isn't so bad.
- Right?

936
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,390
- I went with Mount Jiri.
- Yes, Mount Jiri.

937
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,240
How can the subway
come out in the middle?

938
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,350
Just think about it.
After Mount Jiri...

939
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,660
- No way.
- Mine was good enough.

940
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,080
- Mount Jiri and then...
- The subway isn't so bad.

941
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,280
- Seok Jin.
- But Ji Hyo...

942
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,630
- Let's swap seats.
- Sure thing.

943
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,550
- But Seok Jin...
- For the third word?

944
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,990
That was odd, right?

945
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,990
Jae Seok,
would you like to go first?

946
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:55,990
Okay.

947
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,290
Okay, Jae Seok will go first.

948
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,560
- The first word is the easiest.
- The middle section is difficult.

949
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,470
- Ji Hyo, go to the end.
- Sure.

950
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,880
- Will Ji Hyo be at the far end?
- Yes.

951
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,770
No, swap seats with Se Chan.

952
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,480
- I don't think it should be Ji Hyo.
- Se Chan, go to the far end.

953
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,540
- Who are you suspicious of?
- The far end?

954
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,270
We won't know until
we play one more round.

955
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,010
It really isn't me though.

956
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:16,490
- I think it's Seok Jin.
- Seok Jin?

957
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,190
- He suddenly suspects Seok Jin.
- Out of the blue?

958
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,190
Why are you suddenly accusing me?

959
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,930
- It's not me.
- I think it's Seok Jin.

960
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,350
- Doesn't it seem like Seok Jin?
- Suddenly?

961
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,930
- Why are you suddenly accusing me?
- But subway seemed all right.

962
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,320
It seems reasonable.

963
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,530
Subway?

964
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,790
I think it's Seok Jin.

965
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,300
- He assumed it would be Earth.
- Yes, Earth.

966
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,210
I thought the first word
would be Earth.

967
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,140
I get that, but...

968
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,710
- We'll go into the next round.
- This is impossible, you know.

969
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,800
Let's give it a try.

970
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,040
- We might get lucky.
- Let's try and beat this game.

971
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,510
- Seok Jin.
- That sounded forced just now.

972
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,120
"Let's try and beat this game."

973
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,810
- You're right.
- Think about it.

974
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,460
He said,
"Let's try and beat this game."

975
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,930
That sounds unnatural.

976
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,320
- "Let's try and beat this game."
- Who said that?

977
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Am I the target this time around?

978
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,900
- It has to be Seok Jin.
- I mean...

979
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,670
- It must be Seok Jin.
- "Let's try and beat this game."

980
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,090
- Why?
- How was that not weird?

981
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,000
- Trust me on this.
- "Let's try and beat this game."

982
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,330
- Let's give it another try.
- Right, just one more round.

983
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,500
- Let's give it another shot.
- Let's get ourselves that hint.

984
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,710
I'm sure of it.

985
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,680
- I know it's him.
- But...

986
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,650
- What he said got to me.
- Why?

987
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,270
"Let's try and beat this game."

988
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,120
Are you accusing me
because you're the spy?

989
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,190
I mean...

990
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,780
The spies are the ones
who fervently accuse others.

991
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,990
- Seok Jin...
- Keep that in mind.

992
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,580
- Next round.
- Sure thing.

993
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,320
The Korean word starting with "woo."

994
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,430
- Woo?
- Yes.

995
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,820
- I know what I'm going to write.
- Woo.

996
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,430
I'll write down something
that is of a similar size.

997
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,940
- I wrote down something huge.
- The first person has it easy.

998
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,560
The Korean word
must start with "woo."

999
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,500
- Just a second.
- The middle is not easy.

1000
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,480
- The spy must be smart.
- My pen.

1001
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,070
- Here you go.
- Just a second.

1002
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,150
- Give me a second.
- The spy has 50 dollars already.

1003
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,980
- This is of a similar size.
- The spy has 50 dollars.

1004
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,980
Hey!

1005
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,620
- I'm changing my answer.
- Seok Jin's the spy.

1006
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,190
- Why?
- He's taking the longest...

1007
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,690
to write down his answer.

1008
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,190
- No way.
- Why would that be?

1009
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,550
- Why are you accusing me?
- One and you're done.

1010
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,580
Open!

1011
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,090
- All right.
- Here.

1012
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,430
- Space.
- Of course.

1013
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,630
Jong Kook, you're next.

1014
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,930
- Uruguay.
- Uruguay?

1015
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,260
Darn, I wrote Uzbekistan.

1016
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,800
- We'll see which one is bigger.
- Seriously?

1017
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,530
(They will fail if Uzbekistan
is larger than Uruguay.)

1018
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,300
Wait, we must check
which country is bigger.

1019
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,240
You shouldn't have
written down a country...

1020
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,070
when I'm second in line.

1021
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,720
What could I have written?

1022
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,810
You should've known that
I would be writing down a country.

1023
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,240
- It's Seok Jin for sure.
- Seok Jin.

1024
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,620
Uzbekistan. Fail!

1025
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,990
- Why?
- Who wrote down Uzbekistan?

1026
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,490
- Let's put Seok Jin on the stand.
- It's bigger than Uruguay.

1027
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,780
Let's put Seok Jin on the stand.

1028
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,900
- Yes, let's do that.
- Put him on the stand.

1029
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,230
- Why?
- Get over here.

1030
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,430
- Seconds ago...
- We can get him this time.

1031
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,130
- Guys, it's not me.
- I'm sure of it.

1032
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,560
- When we talked about the spy...
- It's not me.

1033
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,030
You shouldn't have
written down a country.

1034
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,500
It's hard to decide
what to write in my position.

1035
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,680
Guys, don't let
Jae Seok persuade you.

1036
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,100
- Let's put it to a vote.
- Hear me out.

1037
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,600
- You should've seen him.
- What did I tell you?

1038
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,070
He faced the camera earlier...

1039
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,010
and smirked. I saw it.

1040
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,040
That's true.

1041
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,340
More than anything,

1042
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,150
he said,
"Let's try and beat this game."

1043
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,490
You know how that is, right?

1044
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,280
- Let's put it to a vote.
- Guys!

1045
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,190
- Jae Seok baited us all last time.
- It's Seok Jin.

1046
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,050
- It's Seok Jin.
- Him saying that is unnatural.

1047
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,200
Trust me on this.

1048
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,290
- Let's put this to a vote.
- Take your seat.

1049
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,630
(They put Seok Jin on the stand.)

1050
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,870
I'm sure of it.

1051
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,870
- It's Seok Jin.
- I know it's him.

1052
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,670
- Okay, let's do this.
- It's time.

1053
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:23,270
- Ring the Bell of Truth.
- Ring the Bell of Truth.

1054
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,080
- Uzbekistan was a weird answer.
- Exactly.

1055
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,750
After space, of course,
I would write down a country.

1056
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,580
- Seok Jin...
- It's him, isn't it?

1057
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,120
Chapter Two, "The Sun and the Moon."

1058
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,950
- The corrupt official...
- It's him, isn't it?

1059
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,490
- I know it's him.
- It has to be.

1060
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,640
(Is he the corrupt official?)

1061
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,180
- The corrupt official...
- It's him, isn't it?

1062
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,220
- It's Seok Jin.
- Yes!

1063
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,290
- It's Seok Jin.
- Yes!

1064
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,580
(They were able
to capture the corrupt official.)

1065
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,950
What did I tell you?

1066
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,290
I saw him smirk.

1067
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,790
"Let's try and beat this game."

1068
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,100
- You're right.
- "Let's try and beat this game."

1069
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,600
That's how I knew.

1070
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,290
"Let's try and beat this game."

1071
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,660
Let me be
a corrupt official for once.

1072
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,810
One, two.

1073
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,140
Darn it.

1074
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,040
You will play the role
of the sister...

1075
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,200
who is in fact a corrupt official.

1076
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,220
(He took the seat in the middle...)

1077
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,120
(which was a good position
to get the answer wrong.)

1078
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,950
(When Ji Hyo was accused
of being the corrupt official...)

1079
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:15,020
(He smirked proudly at the camera.)

1080
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,180
(But Haha caught him.)

1081
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,600
I think it's Seok Jin.

1082
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,600
Out of the blue?

1083
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,220
(He reacted awkwardly
completely flustered.)

1084
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,470
Let's try and beat this game.

1085
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,770
(Because he was flustered,
he said something out of character.)

1086
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,680
(Jae Seok saw
right through his words.)

1087
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,470
Just so you know,

1088
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,270
you managed to catch him
in 27 minutes...

1089
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,850
which means you didn't get...

1090
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,270
- any additional penalty balls.
- What a relief.

1091
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,870
Only Seok Jin has penalty balls,

1092
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,310
so he'll be receiving the penalty.

1093
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,950
- Okay!
- Nice!

1094
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,310
- Got you!
- All right!

1095
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,680
Here's the penalty.

1096
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,330
- After "space..."
- I knew it.

1097
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:49,120
- "Let us..."
- The penalty for chapter two.

1098
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,020
The corrupt official
will receive a flogging.

1099
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,450
And thus,

1100
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,390
they managed to capture Seok Jin.

1101
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,520
Nice!

1102
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,160
How could you write down Uzbekistan?

1103
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,100
- He will be flogged twice.
- All right!

1104
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,310
Twice?

1105
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,600
Do I get to choose?

1106
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,000
No, the others will choose.

1107
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,410
- Then...
- It should be one of the tigers.

1108
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,640
Just don't let it be Jae Seok.

1109
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,640
Don't let it be him.

1110
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,770
How else would it be funny though?

1111
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,520
- Don't let it be them.
- Okay, fine.

1112
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,250
- I'll take one from each of them.
- Okay.

1113
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,910
All right. Here comes the first one.

1114
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,750
The first one!

1115
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,790
My thighs!

1116
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,220
Darn, my thighs!

1117
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,450
- You hit the back of my thighs!
- Nicely done.

1118
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,470
Seriously?

1119
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,270
- Here's the second one.
- The second one!

1120
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,790
- The second.
- Go for it.

1121
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,600
It's all right.
You can aim for his thighs.

1122
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,540
(Ji Hyo aimed for
where So Min hit him.)

1123
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,240
- You only patted him.
- You didn't hit him hard.

1124
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,500
Then Ji Hyo...

1125
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,310
acted weirdly for no reason.

1126
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,410
(She acted weirdly
for no particular reason.)

1127
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,020
I was only messing with him earlier.

1128
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,120
- That ends the second chapter.
- Okay.

1129
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,250
And we'll now move onto the third.

1130
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,060
Not being a corrupt official
might be better.

1131
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,330
Chapter Three of
the Running Chronicles.

1132
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,600
"Chunhyangjeon."

1133
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,830
The characters are
Sung Chun Hyang, Lee Mong Ryong,

1134
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,470
and Magistrate Byun.

1135
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,500
("Chunhyangjeon")

1136
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,200
So Min, you're up first.

1137
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:10,200
I always went last,
so I never got to choose.

1138
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,100
This is the one.

1139
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,680
I don't want to be
the corrupt official.

1140
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,950
It'll only stress me out.

1141
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:21,250
(So Min didn't want to be
the corrupt official.)

1142
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,080
I wouldn't mind
letting others go first.

1143
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,850
Choosing a role
is just as nerve-wracking.

1144
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,790
- Who are you playing?
- Chun Hyang.

1145
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,390
Who is she supposed to be?

1146
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,890
(In comes the fair lady in red.)

1147
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,120
- Chun Hyang?
- Is this "Simcheongjeon"?

1148
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,890
Is this "Simcheongjeon"?

1149
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,540
Is it "Chunhyangjeon"
or "Simcheongjeon?"

1150
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,700
And she's Chun Hyang?

1151
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,200
(Modest and obedient)

1152
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,640
You're more like a nun.

1153
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,810
Serve me, woman!

1154
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,270
What?

1155
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,370
Serve me, woman!

1156
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,750
(What?)

1157
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,910
(What Seok Sam said
was completely irrelevant.)

1158
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,310
If I had...

1159
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,180
If I had chosen a role,

1160
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,790
they would've accused me
of being the spy.

1161
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,910
You would've accused me, right?

1162
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,660
- There comes Magistrate Byun.
- Darn scoundrels.

1163
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,450
- He's Magistrate Byun.
- Get going.

1164
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,390
You actually look the part.

1165
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,950
- You look the part.
- Is he a nice guy?

1166
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,200
- He's a villain.
- Is he?

1167
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,000
So Min,

1168
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,560
how does it feel
to be the corrupt official?

1169
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,140
- It's not me.
- How does it feel?

1170
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,560
I wasn't successful.

1171
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,470
(She didn't even bat an eye
at his question.)

1172
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,540
Are you the corrupt official?

1173
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,680
I'm not.

1174
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,470
- Are you the corrupt official?
- Over my dead body.

1175
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,180
There's a good chance
that the role will get chosen early.

1176
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,120
- Was that the case with you?
- Yes.

1177
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,180
It really isn't me.

1178
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,060
I saw So Min
when she came back out...

1179
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,490
and her expression seemed off.

1180
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,350
(Is So Min the corrupt official?)

1181
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,450
So Min's expression, I mean.

1182
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,700
- Really?
- Why are you accusing me?

1183
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,600
Chun Hyang!

1184
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,470
Are you going to serve me?

1185
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,930
No, I will not serve you.

1186
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,770
As I have promised myself
to someone else,

1187
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,000
- I cannot...
- You silly girl.

1188
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,310
How dare you speak so many words.

1189
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:52,140
(In comes
the pretty Magistrate Song.)

1190
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:55,370
- I will serve you, my lord!
- Magistrate Song.

1191
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,850
(Chun Hyang falls in love
at first sight.)

1192
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,770
- How dare you.
- Serve me, silly girl.

1193
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,410
- You want it easy, don't you?
- I will serve you, my lord!

1194
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,020
Magistrate Byun, will you serve me?

1195
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,180
Why you...

1196
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,220
You're the one who should serve me.

1197
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,100
You're hindering my role-playing.

1198
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Serve me, darn it.

1199
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,870
How dare you!

1200
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,370
(While the two magistrates argue
about who serves who)

1201
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,930
(In comes Chun Hyang
who is large in size.)

1202
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,310
Chun Hyang, you silly girl!

1203
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,580
The role suits you.

1204
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,640
Darling.

1205
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,580
- Are you kidding me?
- Darling.

1206
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,410
Why do you even like me?

1207
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,770
Why are you so obsessed with me?

1208
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,620
- What are you talking about?
- What do you like about me?

1209
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,310
Why do you like me?

1210
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,580
- Why do you...
- Don't you dare give him service.

1211
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,430
I'll kill you
if you give him service.

1212
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,120
I'll slap you in the face
if you do that.

1213
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,850
He won't let you live.

1214
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,330
My goodness.

1215
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,720
- Hey.
- Who are you?

1216
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:49,890
- I'm Chun Hyang.
- Who are you?

1217
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,160
- Are you Chun Hyang?
- You're fake Chun Hyang.

1218
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,790
When did you become Chun Hyang?

1219
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,330
- "When"?
- When did you become Chun Hyang?

1220
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,700
I'm the first.

1221
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,640
- I'm the second.
- You're younger than me.

1222
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,600
Hey.

1223
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,370
So Min had this horrible look
when she came out.

1224
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,450
It's because I'm tired.

1225
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,080
I think it's So Min based
on how she looked when she came out.

1226
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,950
She won't stay still if I ask her
when she became Chun Hyang.

1227
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:08,950
- I said I'm the second.
- That's true.

1228
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,140
She would make a fuss
if I say something like that.

1229
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,180
- I said I'm the second.
- She said it timidly.

1230
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,580
And So Min isn't making a fuss.

1231
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,990
- Listen up.
- She isn't making a fuss.

1232
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,250
Haha, can you just arrest her
as soon as she came out?

1233
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,450
- So Min is really...
- So Min.

1234
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,350
- Let's go with So Min once.
- She's been too quiet.

1235
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,390
It's so strange.

1236
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,890
- I'm really not.
- Come here

1237
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,330
(Let me carry you on my back)

1238
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,640
- Gosh.
- What is it?

1239
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,410
(Young Master Yu entered the room.)

1240
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,870
- He's Lee Mong Ryong.
- Gosh.

1241
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,350
- Hey.
- I should run away.

1242
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,080
No. Let's get married.

1243
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,750
I'll go to your bedroom.

1244
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:41,040
(She proposed to Magistrate Yang
to run away from Mong Ryong.)

1245
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,850
- Wait.
- No.

1246
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,080
I did wrong.

1247
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,560
Honey, I'm here.

1248
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,890
- Honey.
- No.

1249
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,520
- No.
- I'm a nice woman.

1250
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,830
- Magistrate Byun hit on me.
- No.

1251
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,790
- I like neither of you.
- Honey.

1252
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,140
- I've been waiting for 30 years.
- I like neither of you.

1253
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,970
You're not my type either.

1254
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,310
- I'm sorry.
- No.

1255
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,430
- My boyfriend is here. I should go.
- And I... Hold on.

1256
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:07,310
I should tell you guys this
in advance. I'm Mong Ryong,

1257
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,870
but I'll be single for a while.

1258
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,140
- What? Hey.
- Okay?

1259
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,140
- You're...
- Without any burden.

1260
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,220
- I've been waiting for a long time.
- It's okay.

1261
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,080
I want to be by myself
without any burden.

1262
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,490
It's Mong Ryong.

1263
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,810
- Oh, my.
- Little colleagues.

1264
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,020
- He looks like a crown prince.
- Hey.

1265
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,290
As you said, let's go with So Min
as soon as Jong Kook comes out.

1266
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,330
Yes. So Min is acting weird.

1267
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,270
- Let's do it right away.
- Her look was so strange.

1268
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,600
- Let's do it immediately.
- Let's do it immediately.

1269
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,790
So Min was too weird.

1270
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,240
- I just...
- Do it right away.

1271
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,830
Her voice got a little lower.

1272
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:36,470
- I know.
- She can't talk back.

1273
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,470
- She's awkward.
- It's not like that.

1274
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,830
I said a joke,
and she can't take it or talk back.

1275
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,000
- She can't.
- Let's do it right away.

1276
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,250
- It's because I'm hungry.
- That's possible.

1277
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,270
- No.
- Her voice...

1278
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,850
Shall we check
before Jong Kook comes?

1279
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,410
- I'm not.
- Let's do it right away.

1280
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,450
- It's Jeon So Min.
- Yes.

1281
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,350
I became confident about it.

1282
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:54,850
The corrupt official must be
having fun. I don't know who it is.

1283
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,120
- Okay. What's this...
- I really...

1284
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:59,950
I choose So Min.

1285
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,390
- So Min.
- Sit down.

1286
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,390
Let's check So Min first
before moving on.

1287
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,870
I'll do it when everyone agrees.

1288
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,500
- I'm not though.
- The Bell of Truth.

1289
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,700
I'm really not.

1290
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,830
(Chun Hyang quietly
takes a seat by herself.)

1291
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,830
- The Bell of Truth.
- So everyone agrees, right?

1292
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,040
- Yes.
- Okay.

1293
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,430
Do you agree as well, Jong Kook?

1294
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,500
- Of course, I do.
- I'm not.

1295
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,970
- Fold it and...
- You'll regret it.

1296
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,470
I'll check each of you.

1297
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,770
- Ring the Bell of Truth.
- Ring the Bell of Truth.

1298
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:19,870
I'm not.

1299
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,140
(Ring the Bell of Truth)

1300
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,140
(Who is the corrupt official
in "Chunhyangjeon" Chapter 3?)

1301
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:27,450
All right. The corrupt official
in "Chunhyangjeon" part two...

1302
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,930
It's only ten dollars.

1303
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,560
It'd be amazing if we arrest
the culprit as soon as it began.

1304
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,600
I'm not.

1305
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,120
So Min...

1306
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,200
Is she not?

1307
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,770
- Is the one.
- Is the one.

1308
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,040
So Min isn't the one.

1309
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,390
I told you. Who is it?

1310
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,270
(They failed to arrest
the corrupt official.)

1311
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,500
You should've told us.

1312
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,930
I did.

1313
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,080
You should've told us.

1314
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,770
I did.

1315
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,140
You should've kept telling us.

1316
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,640
Why did you not say it firmly?

1317
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,640
- I said it firmly.
- You were not into your role.

1318
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,120
That's not true.

1319
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,540
- She...
- All right.

1320
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:59,490
The corrupt official
of part three...

1321
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,290
Who was it?

1322
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,120
(The real corrupt official
who had it easy behind So Min)

1323
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,250
Congratulations.

1324
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,270
Congratulations.

1325
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,560
- It's Jong Kook.
- I did nothing.

1326
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,700
(Jong Kook, the corrupt official)

1327
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,790
- I was in the back.
- It's Jong Kook.

1328
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,640
I did nothing. I was in the back.

1329
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,910
He didn't even try.

1330
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,540
(Jong Kook who came last and agreed
with them is the corrupt official!)

1331
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,430
- I didn't even try.
- Was it left until the end?

1332
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,470
(I didn't even try.)

1333
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:23,680
Yes.

1334
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,140
There's one left.

1335
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,310
(A while ago)

1336
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,580
No way.

1337
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,910
Oh, my.

1338
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,350
Gosh.

1339
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,790
(He thought it was unlikely, but he
picked the corrupt official scroll.)

1340
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:36,520
(Gosh.)

1341
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,790
Do I really have to do this?

1342
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:42,770
(Young Master Kim went out
with worries.)

1343
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,000
Gosh, what's this?

1344
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,830
(As soon as he went out,
they insisted it was So Min.)

1345
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,540
- Do you agree?
- Of course, I do.

1346
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,830
(He sealed his victory even before
he finished wearing the headpiece.)

1347
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,970
(The corrupt official in Chapter 3
did nothing.)

1348
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,580
- Was it left until the end?
- I opened it, and it was the one.

1349
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,310
- This is unbelievable.
- We couldn't suspect you.

1350
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,310
Right?

1351
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:58,870
Because everyone
was ganging up on her.

1352
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,680
Jong Kook,
this is ten dollars for you.

1353
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:03,910
- I did nothing.
- He did nothing.

1354
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,950
I'm not.

1355
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,890
- You had a weird look.
- All of a sudden,

1356
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:09,660
he asked me if I agreed,

1357
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:10,950
so I said, "Of course."

1358
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,700
- As soon as you came out.
- Yes.

1359
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,720
- Gosh.
- You...

1360
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,390
- The penalty is the leg screw.
- Isn't it the leg screw?

1361
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,470
This one.

1362
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:19,770
- This would be painful.
- Okay.

1363
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,140
Get the penalty balls.

1364
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,740
There are three for each of you.

1365
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,240
Don't act weird.

1366
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,580
I didn't imagine
it would come out at the end.

1367
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,000
"Ji Hyo".

1368
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,140
(Ji Hyo was picked.)

1369
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,140
Screw her legs.

1370
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:35,890
(Painful)

1371
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,020
Don't hold it in.

1372
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,290
Why would you hold it in?

1373
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,520
Say it quickly.

1374
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,250
- Say it.
- But...

1375
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,750
there's a way
to make it not painful.

1376
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:44,830
How?

1377
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,220
How do you do that?

1378
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,120
Let me try it. Do it to me.

1379
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,560
- Not painfully?
- So that Seok Jin would believe it.

1380
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,790
- If it was a little less weird...
- Come here.

1381
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:51,890
- Look.
- Why?

1382
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,640
- This is...
- To make it not painful?

1383
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,600
- You can avoid it.
- How?

1384
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,810
- Try it.
- Okay.

1385
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,200
- You can avoid it?
- How can you avoid it?

1386
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,240
- Put them in.
- There's a way.

1387
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,680
- Look. Over there.
- You should put it here?

1388
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,250
- Try it.
- He said he would avoid it.

1389
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,370
- You can put it anywhere.
- You're going to avoid it?

1390
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,540
- Go.
- Try it.

1391
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,680
(Shouting)

1392
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:09,890
- Go.
- Try it.

1393
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:12,020
(Painful)

1394
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,890
- How can you avoid it?
- How can you avoid it?

1395
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,660
- How can you avoid it?
- Give me a moment.

1396
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,750
Get into a position you want.

1397
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:18,790
- There's a way to avoid it.
- Who?

1398
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,100
- The suspect?
- Okay.

1399
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,220
Look. You should...

1400
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,020
- put your legs like this.
- Okay.

1401
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,240
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1402
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,330
Is he straining his legs?

1403
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:28,370
I can't do it.

1404
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,330
- It will break the wood.
- Did you see it?

1405
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,310
I'll try it.

1406
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:34,470
No.

1407
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,410
(An unexpected scenario)

1408
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,640
Stand aside.

1409
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,250
- You're going to avoid it?
- No.

1410
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,250
- You don't know the situation.
- Try it.

1411
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,680
- Se Chan, did you tell him?
- I didn't talk with him yet.

1412
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,720
- It seems it's not arranged yet.
- You said you would strain them.

1413
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,000
- No. I mean...
- In 1, 2, 3.

1414
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,520
(They proceed to twist his legs.)

1415
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,970
- Tighten your muscles.
- You son of a gun.

1416
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,560
You said there's a way to avoid it.

1417
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,370
- It hurts.
- I did it because I was curious.

1418
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:02,770
- I'm sorry.
- We didn't talk about it yet.

1419
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,370
It hurts so much.

1420
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:05,500
Did you not talk about it?

1421
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,100
- No, I didn't.
- I'm sorry.

1422
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,250
- I'm sorry.
- I got it.

1423
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,410
I know what you were up to.

1424
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,370
If he had acted like it didn't hurt,
you would've made me do it...

1425
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,140
- and suffer the pain, right?
- Did you not talk with him?

1426
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,910
- I just heard about it too.
- It's funny.

1427
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,640
- I see.
- Yes.

1428
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,850
(The plan to twist Seok Sam's legs
failed.)

1429
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,060
It hurts.

1430
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,430
- Goodness gracious.
- Okay.

1431
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,330
The secret inspector is here.

1432
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,620
- Myung Jae.
- Myung Jae.

1433
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,450
(The secret inspector is here!)

1434
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:32,140
(A secret inspector appeared
in "Running Chronicles".)

1435
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,330
(The assistant director appeared
shyly in an expensive outfit.)

1436
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:38,410
- What are you doing?
- Myung Jae.

1437
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:39,540
What's the matter?

1438
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,540
Is it a mission?

1439
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,770
This is for sinner Jong Kook
and Haha.

1440
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:47,790
What?

1441
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,730
You don't deserve
to have product placement...

1442
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:51,630
as you're promoting other products.

1443
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:55,380
You shall be arrested for the damage
of product placement in our show.

1444
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,650
- Okay.
- Go.

1445
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,210
(You shall be arrested!)

1446
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:00,920
Get out of here.

1447
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,380
- Get out of here.
- Do I have to get this?

1448
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,880
Do we really have to get this?

1449
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,310
Why are you not cooperating
for the show?

1450
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:09,960
(They became criminals at once.)

1451
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,750
- How dare you promote other stuff?
- This is...

1452
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:14,060
I'll wait
until you have product placement.

1453
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:16,560
- They're in danger too.
- I don't have one.

1454
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,130
- They're in danger too.
- I don't.

1455
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,460
Why do they not let us
do product placement?

1456
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:24,340
- I want to do that and leave too.
- Me too.

1457
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,540
- It's cool.
- To where?

1458
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,270
I want to leave with them.

1459
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,500
It means
he wants to film a commercial.

1460
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,710
- Enjoy your food.
- Okay.

1461
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:30,750
- Go.
- Go.

1462
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:34,250
- See you later.
- Say what the whole family enjoys.

1463
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,540
- Don't worry.
- I'll say the line.

1464
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,750
You must say
that my son would like it.

1465
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,110
I'll eat it with rice.

1466
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:44,650
You guys eat this bibimbap here.

1467
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,290
- Thank you.
- Why are you speaking informally?

1468
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,360
You can't say that.

1469
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,960
That young man.

1470
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,090
(The role-play doesn't work
in the small room.)

1471
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:53,000
You don't even come out
to play soccer these days.

1472
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,190
I'm fine
with not being able to see it.

1473
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:55,500
(The two criminals
are imprisoned in the small room.)

1474
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,960
What's today's product placement?

1475
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:58,900
Okay.

1476
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,730
I'm having homemade food
after a long time.

1477
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:01,810
Really?

1478
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,480
- Because it's a "Mom."
- "Food from a mother."

1479
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,440
- Homemade food after a long time.
- It's coming.

1480
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,440
Mom.

1481
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,110
- The fried chicken looks amazing.
- It's fried chicken today.

1482
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:11,440
- It's a party.
- It looks delicious.

1483
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,710
It smells so good.

1484
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,250
Why are the burgers so big?

1485
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,630
She's not my real mom, but...

1486
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:16,860
(The hungry people will enjoy
their mom's food.)

1487
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:17,960
Mom.

1488
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,250
I haven't had homemade food
for a long time.

1489
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,920
This fits my taste.

1490
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,500
This fits my taste. It's thick.

1491
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,900
That's my line.

1492
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,460
- Why?
- "This fits my taste."

1493
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,960
- You...
- They will edit it nicely.

1494
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,730
Can you see what they're holding up?

1495
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,900
You'll take a bite and leave
as if you forgot something.

1496
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,670
(Jee Seok Jin is to leave
as if he has an urgent business.)

1497
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:41,920
You'll take a bite and leave.

1498
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,710
This is really to my liking.

1499
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:46,060
The combo that has
both burgers and chicken.

1500
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,150
(They try western food
without minding the conditions.)

1501
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:49,650
- The sauce is really nice.
- It suits my palate.

1502
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:52,250
- The chicken is quite spicy.
- It's good.

1503
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,400
It's really good.

1504
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:57,900
(They enjoy their lunch
while showing a natural reaction.)

1505
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,290
By the way, we look classy
without those two.

1506
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,060
We can have a talk at peace.

1507
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,380
With Haha, it'd look too tacky.

1508
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,810
- Haha is...
- Poor him.

1509
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,770
- He...
- He just says random things.

1510
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:11,610
He makes it look so cheap.

1511
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,250
There's a certain degree
you must keep for product placement.

1512
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,440
There's this standard we must keep.

1513
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,940
But he lowers the standard a lot.

1514
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,610
And we haven't mentioned
the world "family" the whole time.

1515
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:19,860
- Right.
- Right.

1516
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,790
- Seok Jin! I...
- I didn't know you were so classy.

1517
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,520
- Did you enjoy your meal?
- Yes.

1518
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,000
All right. Here's Chapter Four.

1519
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,130
Chapter Four.

1520
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:35,130
Running Chronicles Chapter Four.
"The Story of Terrapin".

1521
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:36,770
Characters.

1522
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:39,540
Rabbit, Terrapin, and Dragon King.

1523
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,630
It's "The Story of Terrapin".

1524
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,250
I hope I won't be
the corrupt official this time.

1525
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,710
Please, I ask of you.

1526
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,340
I'll choose the one in the middle.

1527
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,520
(All 7 of them chose
their characters...)

1528
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,940
(for "The Story of Terrapin".)

1529
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,150
- So you're Terrapin.
- I am Terrapin.

1530
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,630
- It's Terrapin.
- Look at the way he's walking.

1531
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,020
I wish I could be Terrapin too.

1532
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,020
- I got one that suits me so well.
- What did you get?

1533
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,230
- What did you get?
- You're Rabbit?

1534
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:03,830
How come a rabbit is so threatening?

1535
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:06,090
- He's one scary rabbit.
- He's here.

1536
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,000
- He's so threatening.
- Jong Kook.

1537
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,000
- It's like he's shooting lasers.
- He's not cute.

1538
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,110
It feels like he'll shoot laters
from his eyes.

1539
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,540
He looks like...

1540
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,710
a GMO rabbit.
A genetically modified one.

1541
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,400
He looks like a GMO rabbit.

1542
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,520
A rabbit whose genetics went wrong.

1543
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,250
The result of a research
that went wrong.

1544
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,920
- What's Seok Sam's character?
- Dragon King.

1545
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,650
Oh, he's Dragon King.

1546
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,690
- It suits him.
- Get on your knees.

1547
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,130
It suits him. Right, Ji Hyo?

1548
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,730
It feels like...

1549
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:33,020
I'm going into a Chinese restaurant.

1550
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,900
One jjajangmyeon, please!

1551
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,020
It feels like I'm standing in front
of a Chinese restaurant.

1552
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,540
- That's so funny.
- Like this.

1553
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,960
- That's hilarious.
- I feel like I have to go in.

1554
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,670
You should lower your hat.

1555
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,500
- I have to keep wearing a hat.
- That's it.

1556
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,810
Two servings
of jjajangmyeon, please.

1557
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,310
It's hitting your nose.

1558
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:50,310
- It keeps hitting my eyes.
- It keeps hitting his nose.

1559
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:53,420
I'm supposed to be Dragon King.
I'm not happy with it.

1560
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,440
It keeps hitting his nose.

1561
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,020
A table for three, please.

1562
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,190
(A table for three, please.)

1563
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:59,480
Gosh, it's like I'm in
a Chinese restaurant all day.

1564
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,980
- You're Rabbit.
- I'm Rabbit.

1565
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,980
You're Rabbit. It suits you.

1566
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:04,330
We have only one Dragon King.

1567
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,650
- There's only one Dragon King.
- How come there's only one?

1568
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:06,650
And we have three Terrapins.

1569
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:09,020
- Everyone, this mission...
- Yes.

1570
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,170
Yes.

1571
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:12,900
requires your teamwork.
It's really important.

1572
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:13,900
We have the best teamwork.

1573
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,500
It's called Team Play Running.

1574
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,610
- All right.
- Great.

1575
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:17,860
The rule is really simple.

1576
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,940
We'll hand these out.

1577
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,730
- It measures your distance.
- Our distance?

1578
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:22,500
Carry one of these.

1579
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,540
(Carry a smart tag
that measures your distance.)

1580
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:28,080
(Go as far as you can from
the starting point for 20 seconds.)

1581
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,750
For 20 seconds,

1582
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,980
go as far as you can
from the starting point.

1583
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:35,920
The total distance between
the 7 of you must be more than 500m.

1584
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,960
More than 500m?

1585
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,960
(They'll succeed if the 7 of them
traveled more than 500m in total.)

1586
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,000
(Travel more than 500m in total
within 20 seconds.)

1587
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
The total distance?

1588
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,170
You must all scatter.
You can't end up in the same spot.

1589
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:45,170
We need to travel 500m in total?

1590
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,730
The distance... Listen.

1591
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,940
If we come back to
the starting point by mistake,

1592
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,110
the total distance
could be shortened.

1593
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,230
- So we need to go as far as we can.
- Let's do this, then.

1594
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:54,840
Those on this side, run to the left.

1595
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,340
Those on this side,
run to the right.

1596
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,500
It's 500m starting from here, right?

1597
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,770
That's right. Since we need to
run too, let us get ready.

1598
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:02,980
Those who can run fast
should run the furthest.

1599
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,520
It needs to be
more than 500m, right?

1600
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,520
- Yes.
- It needs to be more than 500m.

1601
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,880
Let's say it takes 15 seconds
to run 100m.

1602
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,520
- Maybe 16 seconds?
- How many seconds will we get?

1603
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,560
You'll get 20 seconds.

1604
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:11,790
It's been a while
since we ran on the show.

1605
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:12,830
But it's...

1606
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:15,420
It's difficult for me to run.

1607
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,920
All right. Get ready!

1608
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,770
- Let's go!
- Get ready.

1609
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,040
- We're all running together?
- Yes.

1610
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,500
Ready, go.
You're all running together.

1611
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,040
- Hurry.
- Ready, go.

1612
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,230
(They're given 20 seconds.)

1613
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:25,810
- Hurry up!
- We can't be in the same spot.

1614
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:26,980
- Hurry!
- Run, So Min!

1615
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,540
- This is impossible.
- This won't do.

1616
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,340
- This won't work.
- Hurry up, Seok Jin!

1617
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,340
- You need to run more!
- This won't do!

1618
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:36,250
(They run as fast as they can
in different directions.)

1619
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,250
Darn it!

1620
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,340
You need to run more!

1621
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,460
I need to go as far as I can.

1622
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:40,690
I need to go as far as I can.

1623
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:41,960
I should go that far.

1624
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:47,920
(Jae Seok runs
to the farthest building.)

1625
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,770
(Jong Kook)

1626
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:52,840
I should go that far.

1627
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,610
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo
head in the same direction.)

1628
00:52:58,610 --> 00:52:59,610
Hurry up, Seok Jin!

1629
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,770
(So Min went elsewhere
all by herself.)

1630
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:06,250
What do I do?
Should I climb up here?

1631
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,750
(Jumping)

1632
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:12,150
(Se Chan went to the back
of the building from the start.)

1633
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,710
You shouldn't come this way.

1634
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:17,920
(Haha went to a secluded place,
following Se Chan.)

1635
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:19,860
(Grunting)

1636
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,420
Gosh, these hit my face so much.

1637
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,500
(Gosh, these hit my face so much.)

1638
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,420
- Stop!
- Gosh.

1639
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:29,540
(Time's up.)

1640
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,540
(The members who ran as fast as
they could come to a halt.)

1641
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,060
- Stop!
- I couldn't go that far.

1642
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,080
- Do we have to stop?
- Please stop where you are.

1643
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,500
Darn it!

1644
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,650
(Will the total distance
be over 500m?)

1645
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,610
Why didn't So Min run
in the beginning?

1646
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:42,080
How come you only went that far?

1647
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,710
- Let's do it one more time.
- They didn't run so fast.

1648
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:47,610
- This spot...
- Right, I had to turn the corner.

1649
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,860
How come you only went that far?

1650
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:50,920
This won't do.

1651
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,020
Why did you run so slowly?

1652
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,060
You should try running
with this hat!

1653
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,400
Then you should've gone last.

1654
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,040
They hit my face so much!

1655
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:02,060
I think I ran over 100m for sure.

1656
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:03,230
(They all ran pretty far.)

1657
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,040
- Gosh, these beads...
- You'll put on a blindfold now.

1658
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,110
Why?

1659
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,840
(The staff members are putting
blindfolds on them.)

1660
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,900
- Will you put this on?
- The blindfold?

1661
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,900
(The staff members are putting
blindfolds on them.)

1662
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,170
- You want me to put this on?
- Yes, hang it on your ears.

1663
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,440
- Why?
- Please put it on.

1664
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,750
I'll take your glasses.

1665
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,310
(They put on the blindfold for now.)

1666
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,360
Why are we putting a blindfold on
all of a sudden?

1667
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,150
Why are we putting it on?

1668
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,460
All right.

1669
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:25,830
We'll tell you the actual rule.

1670
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:26,900
What is it?

1671
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:27,900
(We'll tell you the actual rule.)

1672
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,900
(There's an actual rule
set aside for this mission?)

1673
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,020
Really?

1674
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,840
With your blindfold on,

1675
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:36,340
you'll find the other members
within two minutes.

1676
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,130
If all seven of you hold
each other's hands,

1677
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:39,440
- you'll succeed in this mission.
- Darn it.

1678
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,940
You'll find the other members
within two minutes.

1679
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,770
If all seven of you hold
each other's hands,

1680
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:45,080
- you'll succeed in this mission.
- With a blindfold on?

1681
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,080
(They must find the other members
and hold their hands in 2 minutes.)

1682
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,150
Gosh.

1683
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:49,810
Guys!

1684
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,250
- Se Chan, you should come here.
- Get ready.

1685
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,880
Set, go.

1686
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,880
- Se Chan!
- Ji Hyo!

1687
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,880
You know how it goes, right?

1688
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,420
- You should come.
- Come this way!

1689
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,520
Get ready.

1690
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,190
(The 2 minutes start.)

1691
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:00,460
- You know how it goes, right?
- I'll go to you, Seok Jin.

1692
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,590
- Come this way!
- Ji Hyo!

1693
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,190
- Hold on. I'm on my way.
- Hey.

1694
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,400
- Okay.
- Come this way!

1695
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,400
- I'm coming.
- Let's gather at the center.

1696
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,040
- You need to go up here.
- I'm coming.

1697
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,440
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

1698
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,500
- Come this way.
- Ji Hyo!

1699
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,770
Seok Jin, don't leave.

1700
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:13,770
Hey!

1701
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,500
- Jae Seok!
- You know how it goes, right?

1702
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,540
You know it, right?

1703
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,810
- Hey.
- Jae Seok.

1704
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,810
- Yes.
- You saw me. I'm right here.

1705
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:23,150
Hold on. I need to go up there.

1706
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:24,880
- I'm coming.
- Come this way.

1707
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,790
(Walking carefully)

1708
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,150
- Hold on.
- Where are you?

1709
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:30,330
- I'm right here, Ji Hyo.
- Right here.

1710
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,750
- I'm right here.
- Ji Hyo, I'm here.

1711
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:32,960
- Seok Jin!
- I grabbed your hand.

1712
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,060
- I grabbed Ji Hyo's hand.
- Ji Hyo!

1713
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,790
- Where are you?
- I'm right here. My left hand.

1714
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,060
(Ji Hyo and Seok Jin managed to hold
each other's hands in 25 seconds.)

1715
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,360
- I got Seok Jin.
- Seok Jin!

1716
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,900
- Come over here.
- Seok Jin!

1717
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,630
- So Min!
- Seok Jin!

1718
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,840
- Jae Seok!
- So Min, over here!

1719
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,960
(So Min, over here!)

1720
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,130
- So Min!
- Seok Jin, I'm right here.

1721
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:49,040
- Come over here.
- I'm right here.

1722
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,710
- Come here.
- Jae Seok.

1723
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:51,900
- So Min!
- We're right here.

1724
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,920
- I'm here.
- We're here.

1725
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,610
- Jae Seok, we're here.
- We're gathered here.

1726
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:55,750
I got So Min!

1727
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,520
- I'm here.
- Jae Seok.

1728
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,710
- We're here.
- Jae Seok!

1729
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,750
- Ji Hyo, we're here.
- We're close.

1730
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,360
- Let's succeed in this mission.
- It's here.

1731
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,190
- We're close.
- It's here.

1732
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:05,330
We're close. Reach out your hand.

1733
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:06,520
Don't you mess this up,
corrupt official!

1734
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,830
Reach out your hand!

1735
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:09,690
- It's here.
- Over here, Jong Kook!

1736
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:10,690
- I got you.
- We got you.

1737
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:11,830
Over here, Jong Kook!

1738
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,130
- We're here.
- The four of us are gathered.

1739
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:14,230
Jong Kook!

1740
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:15,590
- Jong Kook!
- Hey, corrupt official!

1741
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:16,940
- Be careful.
- Don't ruin this.

1742
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:17,960
Jong Kook!

1743
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,270
Over here, Jong Kook!

1744
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,230
I'm right here.

1745
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:22,230
(I'm right here.)

1746
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:24,080
- I'm over here.
- Jong Kook.

1747
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,440
- I'm with Seok Jin. Come here.
- I'm with Ji Hyo here.

1748
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,540
I'm over here. This is...

1749
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,920
Shouldn't you guys guide us?

1750
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,920
(Shouldn't you guys guide us?)

1751
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,610
- Jong Kook!
- Corrupt official!

1752
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:36,480
I can hear you.

1753
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:37,920
Let's make this work!

1754
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,150
- Over here, Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook!

1755
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:40,290
Jong Kook!

1756
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,920
(Calling for them)

1757
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,830
- I'm here.
- Jong Kook.

1758
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,520
You should tell me
if there's something in front of me.

1759
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,940
- Jong Kook!
- Jong Kook!

1760
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,170
- Yang Ssaebssaeb!
- Over here, Jong Kook!

1761
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:49,230
I can easily make it.

1762
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:50,840
- Come over here.
- Jong Kook!

1763
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,940
- I can easily make it.
- Come over here!

1764
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,980
Forget about Jong Kook.

1765
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,170
Hurry up! Come this way!

1766
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,900
- Is this So Min?
- Yes, it is.

1767
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,150
- Hurry up!
- Yang Ssaebssaeb!

1768
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:01,940
Se Chan, you should come here.

1769
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,520
(Haha and Se Chan
ran to the opposite corner earlier.)

1770
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,940
- Se Chan!
- Coming!

1771
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:06,710
- Haha!
- Yes, come over here.

1772
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:08,090
You should come first.

1773
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,690
(They come in contact first.)

1774
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:10,730
I'm scared.

1775
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:12,460
We need to join hands first.

1776
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,020
(We need to join hands first.)

1777
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:15,900
- Se Chan.
- Haha!

1778
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,000
Come over here.

1779
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,330
Tell me if it's not safe.

1780
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:20,340
(Haha is suddenly going
in the opposite direction.)

1781
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,060
- Haha!
- Come over here!

1782
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,400
Haha! Talk to me!

1783
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,310
(Silence)

1784
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:30,770
Haha!

1785
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:32,940
Why is he running away?

1786
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,080
(Why is he running away?)

1787
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,090
Haha! Talk to me!

1788
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:38,250
(Haha is going the opposite
direction without talking.)

1789
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,750
You have 30 seconds left!

1790
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:40,920
- We have only 30 seconds!
- Guys!

1791
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,250
- Haha!
- Haha!

1792
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,750
I want to succeed in this mission!
We've been doing this for 12 years!

1793
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,250
- What's gotten into you?
- What?

1794
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,400
- That was so random.
- What?

1795
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,670
What does that
have anything to do...

1796
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:51,020
- with this?
- What's wrong with him?

1797
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,670
Let's make a touching moment!

1798
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,440
Why would we do that
with this mission?

1799
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,440
Let's make this work, you brats!

1800
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,900
Hey, Haha!

1801
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,630
Corrupt official,
don't you make your move.

1802
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:01,940
- Haha!
- We need to make this work!

1803
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:03,080
Hey!

1804
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,250
- Haha.
- Over here.

1805
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,670
- Oh, gosh.
- Gosh.

1806
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:06,710
I got you.

1807
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:08,480
Jae Seok!

1808
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:11,250
(They're getting closer
to each other.)

1809
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,920
- Haha!
- We're here.

1810
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,610
- Se Chan!
- Where are you?

1811
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:15,750
Ten!

1812
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:16,860
- Nine!
- Se Chan!

1813
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,090
- Eight!
- Over here!

1814
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:19,330
- Seven!
- Let's make this work!

1815
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,020
- Six!
- Try clapping your hands.

1816
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:23,130
- Five!
- Let's make a touching moment!

1817
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:24,330
- Try clapping!
- Hey!

1818
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:26,170
- Hurry up!
- Try clapping.

1819
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:27,440
- Hey!
- Two.

1820
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,630
- Are they coming?
- Hey.

1821
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,340
- One.
- Over here. Hey!

1822
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,060
- Two,
- Are you there?

1823
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:33,210
- one.
- Here.

1824
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,380
Time's up.

1825
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,940
- For goodness' sake.
- Where are they?

1826
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,770
(Time's up.)

1827
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:39,080
- Where are they?
- Where are they?

1828
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,540
- Where are they?
- Gosh.

1829
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,110
That corrupt official.

1830
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:43,810
- Hey.
- One of them is a corrupt official.

1831
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:45,960
- All of us gathered around.
- I was at the back.

1832
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,110
You failed the mission.

1833
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,290
I wanted to succeed.

1834
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,730
- We were so close.
- Seok Jin, what was that earlier?

1835
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:53,290
"Let's make our chests go hot."

1836
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,960
Don't bet 12 years
on something like this.

1837
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,860
- Twelve years of Running Man.
- Don't do that.

1838
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,840
I really wanted to succeed.

1839
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,290
It was hard to meet him.

1840
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,360
I was at the back.

1841
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,210
- As for us...
- Don't do that.

1842
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:06,770
- I really wanted to succeed.
- All right.

1843
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:11,080
- It's Haha.
- It's one of them.

1844
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,080
- I have something to say.
- It's Haha.

1845
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,420
I called for him,
but he neither answered nor came.

1846
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,440
- It's Haha.
- Haha.

1847
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,940
- Let's go with Haha.
- It's Haha.

1848
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,310
I swear to the higher power.

1849
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:21,060
- Don't be ridiculous.
- No.

1850
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,480
- It's him.
- Hurry up.

1851
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,630
It has to be him.

1852
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:24,650
- He is strange.
- Let's take him to the bell.

1853
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,420
- It's one of them.
- It's Haha.

1854
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,590
- It's Haha.
- It's Se Chan.

1855
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:29,520
- Let's talk as we move.
- We called for you.

1856
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,000
- Why didn't you answer?
- Seriously.

1857
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,420
- I didn't hear their voices.
- I was looking for Haha.

1858
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:33,960
- You know,
- It's him.

1859
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,560
- Haha didn't answer.
- It's Haha.

1860
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:40,230
The corrupt official
shouldn't have done anything.

1861
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:41,900
- It's Haha.
- Twelve years of Running Man...

1862
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,080
- was on the line.
- Stop it, Seok Jin.

1863
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,020
- It isn't that serious.
- A chance to make our chests hot...

1864
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,170
- Why is he being so serious?
- It's so strange.

1865
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:49,690
- Twelve years of Running Man?
- We were so close.

1866
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:50,880
Running Man has been around...

1867
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,090
for 12 years,

1868
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:53,980
but you went astray
for 3 to 4 years.

1869
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:55,710
- Think about the game.
- Why would you do that?

1870
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:57,860
- All of us were blindfolded.
- Seriously.

1871
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,500
- It isn't that serious.
- "Ji Hyo!"

1872
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,590
We grabbed her.
"So Min!" We grabbed her.

1873
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:02,790
"Jae Seok came."

1874
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:04,860
"Jong Kook is right there!
Grab him! Let's succeed!"

1875
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,460
- It made my chest swell.
- Why did your chest swell?

1876
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:09,900
Why did your chest swell?

1877
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:10,940
We were so close.

1878
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,130
Are you going to pick me?

1879
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,480
Are you going to pick me?

1880
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,610
It's either you or Se Chan.

1881
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:17,670
It isn't me.

59:58,599 --> 01:00:01,369
You think it's either me or Se Chan.

1882
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

1883
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,210
- It isn't me.
- Then it's Se Chan.

1884
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:24,650
- Why?
- It isn't me.

1885
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:26,610
- It isn't me.
- Why didn't you make any sounds?

1886
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:27,710
Seriously. You kept quiet.

1887
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:30,560
- I was at the back. I was here.
- It's Se Chan.

1888
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,060
- Whenever we do this...
- Hey.

1889
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,460
(Hold on.)

1890
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,590
Hey.

1891
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:36,520
- It's Se Chan.
- Why were you there?

1892
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,670
We definitely told you
not to stay...

1893
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,630
- near this place.
- Ji Hyo, you look angry.

1894
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:43,000
Why are you so serious?

1895
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,460
- Listen.
- Hey.

1896
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:46,110
We couldn't be at the same spot.

1897
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:48,540
We couldn't be at the same spot,
but Jong Kook definitely said...

1898
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,400
that staying near this place
will shorten the distance.

1899
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,000
- That's right.
- So I went to the back.

1900
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,810
If you stayed here, it's you.

1901
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:54,880
It's Se Chan.

1902
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:55,880
It's you.

1903
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,750
- Trust me.
- Jong Kook's first hunch is right.

1904
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,460
- How did the two of you meet?
- It's Se Chan.

1905
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,590
Let's go with Se Chan.

1906
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,060
- It's Se Chan.
- It isn't me.

1907
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,330
- For goodness' sake.
- You know...

1908
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,330
You can arrest him
after the mission.

1909
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,460
Would you like to go right away?

1910
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,250
- Is there a mission?
- Let's find out.

1911
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,830
We prepared the next mission.

1912
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,060
- Let's find out.
- Go ahead.

1913
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,590
- You can do what you want.
- Give us the mission.

1914
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:15,360
I will show that
I am not a corrupt official.

1915
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,560
- Let's have a mission.
- Okay.

1916
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,710
The next mission is...

1917
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:21,340
Your Scent in an Unfamiliar Word.

1918
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,000
- What is it?
- Your Scent in an Unfamiliar Word.

1919
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,810
When we give you a person...

1920
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:27,770
and an object,

1921
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:31,420
write down what they have in common.

1922
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:32,440
(Write down
what they have in common.)

1923
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,750
You will receive points
if your answers match.

1924
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:36,980
Let's begin.

1925
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:39,830
So Min and cup noodles.

1926
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:42,420
- So Min and cup noodles.
- So Min and cup noodles.

1927
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:44,020
So Min and cup noodles.

1928
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:45,770
- They get incensed.
- Incensed.

1929
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,860
- Hot.
- Hot.

1930
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:49,560
- I was going to write that.
- My answer is similar.

1931
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:50,630
They are hot-tempered.

1932
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:51,900
Jae Seok.

1933
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:55,170
After a breakup, she cried
while eating cup noodles.

1934
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,210
Why are you spouting nonsense?

1935
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:58,670
- No.
- Yukgaejang.

1936
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,270
Why Yukgaejang?

1937
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:01,880
That's the only brand So Min eats.

1938
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:03,840
She just gave the brand name.

1939
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:06,190
- What's up with her?
- Come on.

1940
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:07,420
You can't give the brand name.

1941
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,710
None of the answers matched.

1942
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:10,590
Hot-tempered.

1943
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:13,020
- Jong Kook...
- Jong Kook.

1944
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:14,400
and doenjang.

1945
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,130
- Doenjang?
- Jong Kook and doenjang.

1946
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:18,230
- This is too easy.
- A penchant for aging things.

1947
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:19,840
- Homely.
- Poop.

1948
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,900
Poop.

1949
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:22,130
Why is Jong Kook poop?

1950
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:24,810
- That came to my mind.
- Why did you write "Poop"?

1951
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,980
- None of the answers matched.
- Why is Jong Kook poop?

1952
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:28,400
You should have answered seriously.

1953
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,670
Jae Seok and a vacuum cleaner.

1954
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,170
A vacuum cleaner?

1955
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:33,940
Ugly.

1956
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:35,340
(Ugly)

1957
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,290
- Loud.
- Loud.

1958
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,540
- I also wrote "Loud".
- There you go.

1959
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:39,610
Two answers matched.

1960
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:40,880
I wrote "Fitting pants".

1961
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:42,980
- Fitting pants?
- That's ridiculous.

1962
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:45,360
- Ji Hyo.
- I couldn't think of anything.

1963
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,690
- Ji Hyo.
- She is strange today.

1964
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:48,690
- Jae Seok, what's your answer?
- Neat.

1965
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:49,830
Come on.

1966
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,060
- Neat.
- Come on.

1967
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,360
- For goodness' sake.
- What's wrong with him?

1968
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:56,060
- Neat.
- That's absurd.

1969
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:57,400
- Neat.
- You are loud.

1970
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,940
Don't glamorize yourself.

1971
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:01,810
- Se Chan and hotteok.
- What?

1972
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,150
- Hotteok?
- Okay.

1973
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,810
- Pressed.
- Come on.

1974
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:06,380
(Pressed)

1975
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:11,020
- Ugly.
- My answer is "Ugly" too.

1976
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,810
- Ugly.
- Three points.

1977
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:15,210
You succeeded to win three points.

1978
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:17,020
(They finish the mission
after acquiring 15 points in total!)

1979
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:19,230
- Let's go with Jae Seok.
- Here comes a hint.

1980
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,590
Let me tell you
what the hint will be.

1981
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:24,790
It will be something
the corrupt official did...

1982
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:27,590
- after picking a character.
- Okay.

1983
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:30,210
(Something the corrupt official did
will be provided as a hint.)

1984
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:31,500
It would be incredible
if it's crossing the arms.

1985
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,110
The corrupt official touched...

1986
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:38,840
- the Dragon King's hat.
- The Dragon King's hat?

1987
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:44,710
(It's one of the people
who touched the hat!)

1988
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:46,360
- I didn't touch it.
- My hat?

1989
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:48,960
- I didn't touch it.
- My hat?

1990
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,090
You mean the hat.

1991
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:54,150
- Se Chan touched it.
- No, I didn't touch it.

1992
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:55,650
- I didn't touch it.
- All of us touched it.

1993
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:57,060
Jae Seok touched it.

1994
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:58,630
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo touched it.

1995
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:59,770
- I touched it.
- Ji Hyo.

1996
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:01,790
- So Min touched it.
- All of us touched it.

1997
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:03,110
- Did you touch it?
- No.

1998
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:04,730
Okay. I didn't touch it either.

1999
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:06,940
So it's someone
who touched this hat.

2000
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:09,230
Ji Hyo stood behind me and said...

2001
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:12,150
- "Two servings of jjajangmyeon."
- Jae Seok touched it.

2002
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:13,880
- I touched it. I moved the beads.
- She touched it.

2003
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,080
- So Min touched it.
- You didn't touch it.

2004
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:19,310
- I think it's Jae Seok.
- It really isn't me.

2005
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:21,980
It's suspicious that his answer
for hotteok was "Pressed".

2006
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,520
He kept insisting on
picking the answer...

2007
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,790
- that entered his mind first.
- Didn't he touch it?

2008
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,750
I didn't touch it. Think about it.

2009
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:29,520
- I didn't touch it.
- I didn't touch it either.

2010
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,670
(The two suspects insist
that they didn't touch the hat.)

2011
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:32,000
- It's Ji Hyo.
- No.

2012
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,590
- It isn't me.
- It's Ji Hyo.

2013
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:35,560
- If you pick me...
- It really isn't me.

2014
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,710
- If you pick me, it means...
- It isn't me.

2015
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:40,610
- you are being played by a spy.
- Jae Seok touched it the most.

2016
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:41,630
- That's right.
- I touched it too.

2017
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:42,880
- It isn't me.
- Jae Seok.

2018
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,710
- Ji Hyo touched it from behind.
- Yes. I admit...

2019
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:45,880
- that I touched it.
- I touched it from the front.

2020
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,810
- But it isn't me.
- It's Ji Hyo or So Min.

2021
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:49,790
- No, it really isn't me.
- To be honest...

2022
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:51,540
- It really isn't me.
- Really?

2023
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:53,860
- Jae Seok is telling the truth.
- It really isn't me.

2024
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,520
You think it's So Min or Ji Hyo.

2025
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,150
- It's So Min or Ji Hyo.
- I touched it.

2026
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:59,250
- I touched it.
- So Min touched it first.

2027
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:01,400
- I touched it.
- It's So Min or Ji Hyo.

2028
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:03,770
- It's So Min.
- It isn't me.

2029
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:05,590
- The chance...
- It really isn't me.

2030
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,560
- It's you.
- It isn't me.

2031
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:10,360
- Haha, didn't you touch it?
- I didn't touch it.

2032
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:14,440
- Maybe it's Seok Jin.
- He didn't touch it.

2033
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,040
- It might be Seok Jin.
- Right.

2034
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,580
- Maybe it's Seok Jin.
- You touched it too.

2035
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,000
- You touched it too.
- I touched it continuously.

2036
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,650
- That's right. You touched it too.
- I touched it continuously.

2037
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,170
The corrupt official has
100 dollars now.

2038
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:24,110
- We need to make an arrest.
- Let's go with Seok Jin.

2039
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:26,420
(Let's go with Seok Jin!)

2040
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:27,810
- Me?
- Hey.

2041
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:30,480
Do you want to fall
to the fiery pit?

2042
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:33,130
Do you want to fall
to the fiery pit?

2043
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,920
- That came out of nowhere.
- It's Seok Jin.

2044
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:38,060
- It's Seok Jin.
- He suddenly talked about the pit.

2045
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,040
- It's Seok Jin.
- Seok Jin.

2046
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,960
He suddenly talked about the pit.

2047
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:45,340
It's Seok Jin. I am certain of it.

2048
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,610
- It's him.
- Ring the Bell of Truth.

2049
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,900
- It's him.
- It's Seok Jin. Seriously.

2050
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,900
The prize money is 100 dollars now.
Hurry up. It's Seok Jin.

2051
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,710
I am serious. It isn't me.

2052
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:55,750
- It isn't me.
- I will give you my money.

2053
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:56,980
- It isn't me.
- It really isn't me.

2054
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:58,590
- It's Seok Jin. Go with Seok Jin.
- It's Seok Jin.

2055
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:01,880
- You could misunderstand, but...
- It's Seok Jin.

2056
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,560
You did make strange comments
during the game.

2057
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,330
- Like what?
- You did that.

2058
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,020
I thought it was strange...

2059
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:10,830
- that he brought up 12 years.
- It was strange.

2060
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:15,690
(Seok Jin suddenly shouted out
a comment about 12 years.)

2061
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,610
- He says such things...
- Would he have done it again?

2062
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:20,940
- to cover something up.
- That's not true.

2063
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,770
- But he got caught because of that.
- It came out due to nerves.

2064
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:23,840
That's right.

2065
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,380
- It's a habit.
- "I am working hard."

2066
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,170
- You know what he does.
- Guys.

2067
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:30,520
- Didn't you feel that passion?
- Listen.

2068
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,610
- You had no reason to say that.
- Didn't you feel that passion?

2069
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:33,920
- No.
- No.

2070
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,090
While wearing blindfolds,
we held hands.

2071
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:37,880
- Let's go.
- Ji Hyo! We shouted for each other.

2072
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,090
- One, two, three. Seok Jin.
- Seok Jin.

2073
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:41,330
(Seok Jin gets picked.)

2074
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,650
(Seok Jin will take
the Judgment Stand.)

2075
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,670
- Ring the Bell of Truth.
- Ring the Bell of Truth.

2076
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,190
Please sit down.

2077
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:48,040
You will fall to the fiery pit.

2078
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:51,210
I told you that I am not it.

2079
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:55,540
All right. The fourth fairy tale was
"The Story of Terrapin".

2080
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,980
- I hope we got it right.
- Who is the corrupt official?

2081
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,840
The corrupt official
of "The Story of Terrapin..."

2082
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:02,270
is...

2083
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:05,380
(The corrupt official
of "The Story of Terrapin" is...)

2084
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:07,190
It's him.

2085
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:09,290
- Not Seok Jin.
- It isn't him.

2086
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:10,730
I told you so.

2087
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:13,150
(They failed to apprehend
the corrupt official.)

2088
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:14,560
- I think it's Jae Seok.
- It's Jae Seok.

2089
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,020
- It isn't me.
- It isn't me either.

2090
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,500
- All right.
- He is serious.

2091
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,360
Who will receive 100 dollars
and avoid the penalty?

2092
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:22,900
Congratulations.
The corrupt official is...

2093
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,730
- So Min.
- I knew it.

2094
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:25,730
It was So Min.

2095
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:27,880
(The corrupt official, So Min)

2096
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,210
- So Min.
- I knew it.

2097
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,380
It was So Min.

2098
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,880
(Was it So Min?)

2099
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,880
She kept quiet.

2100
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,710
I told you
that she was overly quiet.

2101
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:38,250
- So Min.
- I told you that it was So Min.

2102
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:45,060
(So Min was the first person
to touch the Dragon King's hat.)

2103
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:49,150
(During the outdoor team mission,)

2104
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:53,860
(she hesitated
even though she heard the voices.)

2105
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:57,130
(She went in the opposite direction
on purpose.)

2106
01:07:57,130 --> 01:08:00,730
(So Min killed time
by pretending to be lost.)

2107
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,310
(When Seok Jin emerged
as a suspect,)

2108
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:07,710
(she began to corner him.)

2109
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,750
- It was So Min.
- She stayed in the back.

2110
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:14,460
I should have known
that it was So Min.

2111
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,380
You should have denied it strongly.

2112
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:17,630
What more could I have done?

2113
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:20,360
I even said that
you will fall to the fiery pit.

2114
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:22,830
You should have denied it strongly.

2115
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,500
- I did.
- You should have denied it...

2116
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,040
- strongly.
- This is so hard.

2117
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,540
- This is so hard.
- I don't know anymore.

2118
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,360
Let's pick the penalty ball.

2119
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,610
(1 out of 24 penalty balls
will be chosen.)

2120
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:33,810
We could have done better.

2121
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:34,880
I will pick a ball.

2122
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:35,930
All right.

2123
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:37,640
- Come on, So Min.
- It's okay.

2124
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,770
Let's go. Drum roll.

2125
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:41,140
(Who will receive the penalty?)

2126
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:42,310
Oh, no.

2127
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,440
(Who is it?)

2128
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,850
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Who is it?

2129
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:47,720
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Who is it?

2130
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,720
Jee.

2131
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:53,090
(Seok Jin got chosen.)

2132
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:54,760
- I really didn't.
- Fall to the fiery pit.

2133
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,830
Jee.

2134
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:57,100
Fall to the fiery pit.

2135
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:00,100
It's the penalty that suits
the Dragon King, water slap.

2136
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,690
That's good. Water slap is good.

2137
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,900
- Okay.
- That was weak.

2138
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,230
(Throwing)

2139
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:06,600
That was weak.

2140
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,640
It must be cool.

2141
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:08,680
All right.

2142
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,210
This is hard.

2143
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:13,310
You had 2 successes and 2 failures.
This is your last chance.

2144
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:14,310
(It's time for the last fairy tale.)

2145
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:17,440
The last fairy tale is
"Altair and Vega".

2146
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,350
Chapter Five
of the Running Chronicles.

2147
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:21,010
"Altair and Vega".

2148
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:25,460
The characters are
Altair, Vega, and magpie.

2149
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,330
It can't be this one.

2150
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,650
I hope I don't get chosen.

2151
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:33,560
Vega!

2152
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,300
Altair!

2153
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,040
Vega!

2154
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,300
Altair!

2155
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,080
Fall to the fiery pit.

2156
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,730
Fall to the fiery pit.

2157
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:44,010
Altair!

2158
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:45,400
- Fall to the fiery pit.
- Fall to the fiery pit.

2159
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:46,850
What's up with him?

2160
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:48,810
Why does Vega look like that?

2161
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,480
I am so annoyed.

2162
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,810
- I don't want to meet this Vega.
- Vega.

2163
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:54,390
This Vega is too ugly.

2164
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:56,260
Why does Vega look like that?

2165
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:58,290
- The fake Vega.
- How is Vega so ugly?

2166
01:09:58,290 --> 01:09:59,930
I think she got punched in the face.

2167
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:02,690
- Her face is puffy.
- Hey, crows.

2168
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:04,930
I will pull out your feathers
if you don't quiet down.

2169
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:06,520
Seriously.

2170
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,970
(This Vega has
rough looks and words.)

2171
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,040
- Altair.
- All right.

2172
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,900
The fifth corrupt official
is among you.

2173
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,040
Who could it be?

2174
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:15,140
Se Chan and Haha haven't gone once.

2175
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:17,270
- That doesn't matter.
- It isn't me.

2176
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:19,100
- Ji Hyo hasn't gone once either.
- That doesn't matter.

2177
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,640
Altair, close your mouth.

2178
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,380
- Hey.
- Vega.

2179
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:23,790
- Vega.
- My goodness.

2180
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,790
- Fall to the fiery pit.
- They don't get along.

2181
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:26,920
Close your mouth.

2182
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,310
- Are you Bbaengdeok?
- What?

2183
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:29,350
Are you Bbaengdeok?

2184
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:32,650
- Don't you know who Vega is?
- You can't be Vega.

2185
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:34,830
- The two of you are a couple.
- What?

2186
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:36,220
- Give me a break.
- A couple, my foot.

2187
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:38,190
- What's up with your skirt?
- Excuse me?

2188
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:39,600
- What's up with your skirt?
- Why? It's sexy.

2189
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,470
Who do you think you are?

2190
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,560
The two of you are lovers.

2191
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,040
- What?
- The two of you are lovers.

2192
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,470
The next mission is
Speak with Your Actions.

2193
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:49,680
We are good at that.

2194
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:52,140
Express an idiom with your actions.

2195
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,110
- Idiom?
- We got this.

2196
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:55,770
One person will give the question...

2197
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:57,980
- and two people will answer.
- Okay.

2198
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:58,980
Once the correct answer is given,

2199
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:01,480
the person who gave the question
will answer the next one.

2200
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,480
One of the two people who answered
will join the waiting area.

2201
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,350
- Okay.
- Okay. I got it.

2202
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:08,300
The corrupt official
will show strange actions.

2203
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,330
- Okay.
- The corrupt official.

2204
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:10,390
Go.

2205
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,670
Are you nervous?
You tied the skirt...

2206
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,140
very tightly.

2207
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,360
- What?
- Seriously.

2208
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,860
Hold on.
It doesn't even look like a skirt.

2209
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:22,270
- You tied it too tightly.
- There goes the detective.

2210
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:24,350
- You guys are lovers.
- You guys are lovers.

2211
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,810
- That little...
- "That little"?

2212
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:27,810
That little...

2213
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:29,770
- That little...
- Help them get along.

2214
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:33,310
Should we describe one word each?

2215
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:35,180
It's up to you.

2216
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:37,720
I think I will need to describe
one word each.

2217
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:39,890
I mean...

2218
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:41,600
Se Chan is too suspicious.

2219
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,830
- Why?
- Right?

2220
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:44,390
- I heard it too.
- Why am I suspicious?

2221
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:45,860
- I heard it too.
- You heard it, right?

2222
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:49,970
Se Chan is asking
too many questions.

2223
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:51,470
He is too forward.

2224
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:53,360
I might not understand the idiom.

2225
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,730
- For example...
- When it's an idiom...

2226
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:55,970
It isn't me.

2227
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:57,010
Seriously.

2228
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:58,080
- He is nervous.
- I was just wondering...

2229
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,640
if I should describe one word each.

2230
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:04,010
- Okay. Let's go.
- Get ready. Set, go.

2231
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:08,390
(Heart in your mouth)

2232
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:09,460
(The first syllable
is pronounced as "Jeon".)

2233
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:11,050
Turn a misfortune into a blessing.

2234
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:13,850
Turn a misfortune into a blessing.

2235
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:15,800
- What?
- Sending...

2236
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:18,670
(Her last name)

2237
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:19,890
Heart in your mouth.

2238
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,230
Heart in your mouth.

2239
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:24,670
(Jee Altair is correct.)

2240
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:26,970
- Good.
- You are suspicious.

2241
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:30,850
- Seriously.
- It's strange. Why didn't you know?

2242
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:32,510
(Detective Kim chose his target.)

2243
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:34,010
- Okay.
- Why didn't you know?

2244
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:36,010
(Ji Hyo has to describe the idiom.)

2245
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:38,390
(Studying at night)

2246
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:39,510
What's that?

2247
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,350
- A pot.
- A pot.

2248
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:43,110
What? Studying at night.

2249
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:44,790
Studying at night.

2250
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:46,760
Studying at night.

2251
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:49,150
You shouldn't speak.

2252
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:51,360
- Why did you speak?
- You shouldn't speak.

2253
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,600
- I had to prove my innocence.
- It doesn't count.

2254
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,890
- Then let me go again.
- Let her go again.

2255
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:57,670
- It doesn't count.
- Haha, why did you do that?

2256
01:12:57,670 --> 01:12:59,300
For goodness' sake, Haha.

2257
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,400
- For goodness' sake.
- Haha.

2258
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,770
- Muscle?
- Egg?

2259
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,900
- Muscle?
- Arm.

2260
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:03,940
Muscle?

2261
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:05,210
- Arm.
- Muscle?

2262
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,010
- Arm.
- Why are you answering?

2263
01:13:07,010 --> 01:13:08,140
New Year's greeting?

2264
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:09,420
- Rock.
- Paper.

2265
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:10,920
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Work without plans.

2266
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:12,390
Rock.

2267
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:14,350
- Hold on. The pronunciation...
- What you befriend will affect you.

2268
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:16,390
- That's right.
- That's right.

2269
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:18,460
- That's right. Good job.
- I am good at this.

2270
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,090
You should stay there.

2271
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:22,000
- So Min answered it.
- Good job.

2272
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Good job.

2273
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,760
- What's that?
- A gourd bottle.

2274
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:27,540
- Curves?
- A mountain.

2275
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:29,170
- Lightning?
- A mountain.

2276
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:30,400
- A mountain.
- A mountain.

2277
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,100
A well in the mountain.

2278
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:34,210
- A tree.
- A mountain.

2279
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:35,930
- A tree.
- You can't help them.

2280
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:37,640
A creek.

2281
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,300
Jeju Island.

2282
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:41,250
- Jeju Island.
- Jeju Island.

2283
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,140
- You can't speak.
- Jeju Island.

2284
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:45,790
- It's "Dainty hands".
- Jeju Island.

2285
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:47,310
- Yes.
- Jeju Island.

2286
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,960
Island.

2287
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,110
Jeju.

2288
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:51,520
Ju. Je?

2289
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,520
Island. A homophone for "Dainty".

2290
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:56,860
- Dainty...
- Dainty corn.

2291
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:58,470
What was "Dainty corn"?

2292
01:13:58,470 --> 01:13:59,890
- Dainty...
- Dainty...

2293
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:01,600
- Dainty...
- Dainty corn.

2294
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,360
("Dainty corn"?)

2295
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,880
(They can't figure out
"Dainty hands".)

2296
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,680
- Dainty...
- Dainty hands.

2297
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,580
"Dainty corn"?

2298
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:12,640
(Ms. Dainty Corn got it right.)

2299
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,810
- "Dainty corn"?
- You shouldn't make it so easy.

2300
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:16,440
- Go ahead.
- Use actions.

2301
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,640
All right.

2302
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,250
(Apple of the eye)

2303
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:20,460
It's a baby.

2304
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,220
A baby.

2305
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:24,090
Coddling.

2306
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:25,890
- What's the 1st word?
- What's the 1st word?

2307
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:27,000
He is acting strange.

2308
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,650
- What?
- He is acting strange, right?

2309
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:29,800
- Wealth.
- He is nervous.

2310
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,970
- Wealth.
- Muscle.

2311
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:33,220
Muscle. Head.

2312
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,840
- Hair.
- Head.

2313
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,340
- Hot?
- This.

2314
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:38,970
- What's that?
- Gold.

2315
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:41,100
- He is acting strange.
- Return home in glory.

2316
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:42,770
Return home in glory.

2317
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,180
- Gold.
- Gold and silver.

2318
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,470
Come on, you punks!

2319
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:46,580
Gold.

2320
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,080
Four characters.

2321
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:50,440
- Of course it has four characters.
- Yes.

2322
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,890
What's the second one?

2323
01:14:52,010 --> 01:14:53,250
Hurry up.

2324
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:54,510
Apple.

2325
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:55,610
- Apple?
- Apple.

2326
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:56,720
Apple of the eye.

2327
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,930
- That's right.
- Okay.

2328
01:14:57,930 --> 01:14:59,890
- Why...
- Hey.

2329
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:01,000
All right.

2330
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,350
- I got this.
- Go ahead.

2331
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:04,360
Jae Seok is suspicious.

2332
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,360
- All right.
- Ji Hyo.

2333
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:06,970
The first character.

2334
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:10,300
Very difficult.

2335
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,800
Why are you speaking?

2336
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:12,900
Don't speak.

2337
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:14,880
You can pass.

2338
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,440
Okay.

2339
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,210
- What?
- A sword.

2340
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:22,750
- A knife.
- A fight.

2341
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:24,590
- A fight.
- A war.

2342
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:26,310
A fight.

2343
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,150
He is suspicious.

2344
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:29,180
Why is he so bad at this?

2345
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:30,330
What's up with him?

2346
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:31,550
Fall to the fiery pit.

2347
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:34,190
A knife.

2348
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:35,630
- No.
- A sword.

2349
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:37,190
What's that?

2350
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:40,130
- Describe the idiom.
- A watermelon?

2351
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:41,190
It's him.

2352
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:43,100
It's him. I am sure of it.

2353
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,100
A cabbage?

2354
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:45,730
A radish.

2355
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:47,800
- A radish.
- A radish.

2356
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,880
- My goodness.
- My goodness. No way.

2357
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:51,080
This is ridiculous.

2358
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,440
- My goodness.
- My goodness. No way.

2359
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,550
- Why...
- Paradise.

2360
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:54,880
Correct.

2361
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,610
- Why...
- Paradise.

2362
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:58,010
Correct.

2363
01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:00,480
- Paradise?
- What?

2364
01:16:00,650 --> 01:16:01,810
Why did you describe it
with such difficulty?

2365
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:02,890
I started with a homophone,
"Radish".

2366
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:04,290
- You should have done this.
- Paradise.

2367
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:06,290
- What would you have done?
- Park Joon Hyung's comedy skit.

2368
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:07,350
- Radish.
- That's right.

2369
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:08,600
- Park Joon Hyung.
- You could have done that.

2370
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:11,430
I couldn't think of that.
I showed the shape of a radish.

2371
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:13,330
When you cut it,
it becomes kkakdugi.

2372
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:14,930
- It was hard.
- Why did you do that?

2373
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:16,540
- A swordsman is a homophone too.
- My goodness.

2374
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:17,900
- A swordsman.
- That's...

2375
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:19,510
- A swordsman.
- He is so suspicious.

2376
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:20,930
- Was that why you did that?
- Yes.

2377
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:22,770
- I didn't want to suspect him.
- That was...

2378
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:24,380
- Radish.
- That was too suspicious.

2379
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:26,850
I didn't want to suspect him,
but he is too suspicious.

2380
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:29,750
It's him. He moved around too much.

2381
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:33,590
He moved back and forth like this.

2382
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:36,460
- Let's go.
- It will be the third time for him.

2383
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:38,590
Are you suspecting me again?

2384
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:40,330
Who is grinning the most?

2385
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:41,550
- It isn't me.
- It isn't me either.

2386
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,890
- Jae Seok is suspicious.
- Jae Seok, you are suspicious.

2387
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:44,930
You are a suspect.

2388
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,220
- It isn't me.
- Dainty hands.

2389
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:47,800
It isn't me.

2390
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,860
- It isn't me.
- Haha blurted out the answer.

2391
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:51,930
It isn't me.

2392
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:53,640
He did it to sabotage the game.

2393
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,930
- How about you?
- He threw out a question.

2394
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:56,900
- That's right.
- How about you?

2395
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,550
- It isn't me.
- Are you sure?

2396
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:00,970
This is driving me crazy.

2397
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:02,550
Didn't you see me
play the game diligently?

2398
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:03,720
Remember the first question?

2399
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,220
I pointed to So Min.

2400
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,050
- Okay.
- Seok Jin was suspicious,

2401
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,050
but Jong Kook answered
with seriousnesss.

2402
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:11,550
The moment Jong Kook said,
"It isn't me..."

2403
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:13,330
(He understood right away.)

2404
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:15,190
I described it so well.

2405
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:17,330
I answered that question quickly.

2406
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:19,100
You did. Jae Seok is suspicious.

2407
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:20,800
- He didn't get that question.
- Come on.

2408
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,560
- You have a point.
- I got it right.

2409
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,340
- You have a point.
- He didn't get that question.

2410
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,430
It's suspicious
that he didn't get it right.

2411
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:28,380
- He didn't get that question.
- That's why he is suspicious.

2412
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:29,380
He is suspicious.

2413
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:30,880
- Let's go with Jae Seok.
- It really isn't me.

2414
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:35,080
You did go through
the set number of questions.

2415
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,810
- Really?
- A hint.

2416
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:38,290
- You will receive a hint.
- Give it to us.

2417
01:17:38,290 --> 01:17:39,290
A hint.

2418
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:40,460
- You will receive a hint.
- Give it to us.

2419
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:42,510
Throughout...

2420
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:46,050
the mission,

2421
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:50,630
(Throughout the mission...)

2422
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:54,190
the corrupt official
suspected other people the most.

2423
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:56,040
Who is it? Hold on.

2424
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,040
(The corrupt official
suspected other people the most.)

2425
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:59,360
(Someone who suspected
other people the most?)

2426
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,580
Throughout the mission,
someone made such comments.

2427
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:04,380
- But...
- Haha and Jae Seok.

2428
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:05,470
That's exactly right.

2429
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:07,270
Right? This person made
such comments.

2430
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:09,610
- "He is suspicious."
- Jong Kook did that a lot.

2431
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:11,250
I did that a lot.

2432
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:12,480
- Yes.
- Did you do that during the game?

2433
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,290
Yes, I did that during the game.

2434
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:15,350
I think it's Jong Kook or Haha.

2435
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:17,680
- It isn't me.
- I suspected people from the start.

2436
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,520
- Sit down.
- Let's go with Jong Kook.

2437
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,520
- Sit down.
- I admit that I did it.

2438
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,690
But it isn't me.

2439
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:24,390
- If I am the corrupt official...
- Hey.

2440
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:25,720
- I figured it out.
- Listen.

2441
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,390
- He is trying to get more money.
- No.

2442
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,900
(It's already 50 dollars.)

2443
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,860
If I were the corrupt official,

2444
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:35,040
- Hey!
- I would've overpowered him.

2445
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,140
Let me tell you the truth.

2446
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:37,750
It's you!

2447
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:38,900
(Let me tell you the truth.
It's you!)

2448
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:40,940
- It's you.
- Right.

2449
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:42,140
My gut feelings say it's you.

2450
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:44,010
- One, two, three.
- Hang on.

2451
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:45,980
Just hang on a second.
Seriously, I'm telling you...

2452
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:47,920
- Kim Jong Kook.
- Wait.

2453
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:50,310
- You can't let him get his own way.
- It's not me.

2454
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:51,890
I think it's Haha.

2455
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:54,220
- It must be Haha.
- Haha?

2456
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,930
Haha is pretending to suspect me.

2457
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:58,300
I'm sure he's hiding something.

2458
01:18:58,470 --> 01:19:00,190
- Come here.
- I swear it's not me.

2459
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:01,840
- I swear it's you.
- Do you swear to the Almighty?

2460
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,500
- It's him.
- I mean...

2461
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,260
- Is it you?
- I said it wasn't me.

2462
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:07,140
- Because he was...
- It's not him.

2463
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:08,930
- It's not Haha. It's you!
- I tried really hard.

2464
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:11,640
You should listen to me.
Just listen.

2465
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:14,050
- Seok Jin.
- He just wants to be on screen.

2466
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,880
Let's just go with Jong Kook.

2467
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,110
- It's not me.
- Listen to me.

2468
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:18,510
- I swear.
- Hang on.

2469
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:20,650
- At this moment...
- I tried really hard.

2470
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,150
I'll go then.

2471
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:23,220
Okay. You go.

2472
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:24,290
- You'll be embarrassed.
- It's Jong Kook.

2473
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:26,050
It's So Min who pointed me out last.

2474
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:27,720
All right. Ring the bell.

2475
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,020
- Look at him.
- Oh, gosh.

2476
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:30,100
- She's really...
- It's not Jong Kook.

2477
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,100
- Let's go with Jae Seok.
- It must be Haha.

2478
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,670
- It's so confusing.
- Let's...

2479
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:35,670
No, just pick me.
Let's just say it's me.

2480
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,360
Hang on. We need
some time to discuss it.

2481
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,730
- Then...
- Will you hurry?

2482
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:41,640
- Just say if it's Jong Kook or not.
- Hang on.

2483
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:44,050
- I don't think it's him.
- Is it Jong Kook or not?

2484
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:46,270
(Jae Seok suddenly says
it's not Jong Kook.)

2485
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:47,510
- Is it Haha?
- It's not Jong Kook.

2486
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:48,680
- It must be Jae Seok.
- Because...

2487
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,510
he's really trying to kill me.

2488
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:54,920
No, it's not like that.

2489
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,110
(The investigation has gone
back to where it started.)

2490
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:57,890
I'm just telling you the truth.

2491
01:19:57,890 --> 01:19:59,650
- Hang on.
- I don't mind being here.

2492
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:01,330
- Why are you ruling me out?
- Hang on.

2493
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,520
- What?
- Hang on.

2494
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,130
Wait. I just saw...

2495
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:06,020
- I said it's Haha.
- Hang on.

2496
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:07,360
- It's Haha.
- Hey.

2497
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,640
- I just saw something.
- No.

2498
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,400
- Hang on.
- I caught the spy.

2499
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,800
- No, it's not Seok Jin. Wait.
- Here.

2500
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,210
- Here.
- I saw the eyes.

2501
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:15,710
- What eyes?
- I saw the eyes.

2502
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:16,770
What eyes?

2503
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,770
- Who?
- Did you get goosebumps?

2504
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:22,580
- Who is it?
- When I was about to stop you...

2505
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:25,220
(When he was about to say
it wasn't Jong Kook...)

2506
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,640
- Did someone smile?
- I saw Yang Se Chan.

2507
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,510
- What did I do?
- Why?

2508
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:30,890
(Yang Se Chan caught
Jae Seok's eyes.)

2509
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:33,590
- Your eyes...
- What? Are you saying it's me?

2510
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:34,600
What did he do?

2511
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,330
It looked as if...
"It's almost over, but why..."

2512
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,360
- He looked like this.
- Me?

2513
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:41,000
- Your face was...
- Seriously, it's not me.

2514
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:42,860
- Do you think it's me?
- The expression on your face...

2515
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:45,100
- No, it's not me.
- You are blushing now.

2516
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:47,510
Jae Seok, it's just that he's ugly.

2517
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,100
This might put you in trouble.
It's not me.

2518
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,680
- Yang Se Chan.
- It's just that he's ugly.

2519
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,680
Seriously, it's not me.

2520
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,380
- Se Chan, it's you.
- Why at the last moment?

2521
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:55,380
Hang on a second.

2522
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:57,220
- It might be him.
- No.

2523
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:59,310
It's him, right? It might be him.

2524
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:00,760
- I don't think it's Jae Seok.
- He keeps...

2525
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,010
I don't think it's Jae Seok.

2526
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:04,290
- I saw it. I saw Se Chan.
- It's not Jae Seok.

2527
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:06,050
Just put me on the mat.
Seriously, it's not me.

2528
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:08,220
- Hang on.
- I saw Se Chan's face.

2529
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:09,220
He's standing by
with his arms folded.

2530
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:10,690
No, it's Se Chan.

2531
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:12,300
- With his folded arms...
- Yang Se Chan.

2532
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:15,100
(They all keep insisting
without listening to each other.)

2533
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,470
- Hey.
- Yang Se Chan.

2534
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:18,400
Is this what we do after
spending 12 years together?

2535
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:19,510
I'm not me.

2536
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:21,100
- It's you.
- No, it's not.

2537
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,680
- I saw you.
- What is all this?

2538
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,380
- What's this mess?
- What are we doing?

2539
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,800
- Aren't you ashamed?
- What's going on?

2540
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,640
We just suspect each other.

2541
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,880
- I'm not doing this.
- We don't trust each other.

2542
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:31,480
- We just suspect each other.
- It's Yang Se Chan.

2543
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,110
Is this all we have
after spending 12 years together?

2544
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:34,850
It's Yang Se Chan.

2545
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:35,850
You punks.

2546
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:37,520
- Put me up then.
- It's Se Chan.

2547
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:38,960
- Do you want to deceive us?
- Yang Se Chan.

2548
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,590
- You go.
- Okay. I'll go.

2549
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:42,520
- It's Se Chan.
- No, it's not you.

2550
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,850
- It's Jae Seok.
- He's just ugly.

2551
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:45,170
If it's not me, it's Jae Seok.

2552
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,670
It must be Jae Seok.

2553
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:48,190
He's just ugly.

2554
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:50,470
- I saw it.
- He just has an ugly face.

2555
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:52,210
- Jae Seok says he saw it. Go.
- It's Yang Se Chan.

2556
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:54,010
- Se Chan was like...
- Just go.

2557
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:56,640
Se Chan was standing here.
And when I saw his face,

2558
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,010
he suddenly blushed.

2559
01:21:58,010 --> 01:22:00,680
But it's not me. That's not enough.

2560
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,220
- I was suspicious of Haha.
- It's not him.

2561
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:05,110
If it's him, it goes left.
If it's not him, it goes right.

2562
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:07,720
Is it Se Chan or not? It's you.

2563
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,110
- Let's go with him.
- Let's go.

2564
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:11,850
Seok Jin, you leaned it a little.

2565
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:13,520
- No.
- He leaned it.

2566
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,100
- You threw it like this.
- Is it Se Chan or not?

2567
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,630
See? It's him.

2568
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,930
Is it Jong Kook or not?

2569
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:22,300
It's not him. This works.

2570
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:23,600
- I'm here.
- Is it Jae Seok...

2571
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,930
- or not?
- You're moving it with your hand.

2572
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:26,900
It might be Jae Seok.

2573
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,580
Is it Seok Jin or not?

2574
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:31,100
- Your hand was like...
- It could be me.

2575
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:32,880
This is strange.

2576
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:34,720
- Darn it.
- Let's just go with me.

2577
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:35,750
Let's give it a try.

2578
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,480
It's really hot in here.

2579
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:39,510
(Actually, I'm not sure about this.)

2580
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:42,810
- Actually, I'm not sure about this.
- Hang on.

2581
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:44,480
Why are you doing this
when you're not sure?

2582
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:47,330
- When you're not so sure...
- What?

2583
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:48,850
(Now they use witchcraft
and superhuman strength.)

2584
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:50,860
- When you're not so sure...
- What? It's not you.

2585
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:52,100
- It's not you.
- Why not?

2586
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,260
If you were the corrupt official,
you would've...

2587
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:55,600
I would've rang the bell right away.

2588
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,560
- We don't have time. Let's just go.
- I would've rung it right away.

2589
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,400
- And you...
- Right. We're not spies.

2590
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,270
- These two aren't spies.
- Jae Seok, you're not a spy.

2591
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:02,400
- They aren't spies.
- And I'm not a spy.

2592
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,510
- Gosh.
- We're not spies.

2593
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:05,050
Right. Why are you sitting there?

2594
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:06,680
- He's strange.
- Stand up, you punk.

2595
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:08,050
You...

2596
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:09,720
- Come here.
- He's weird.

2597
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,890
It reveals itself...

2598
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:12,920
- You can tell, right?
- over time.

2599
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:15,050
- We know it's not us.
- Right.

2600
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:16,810
- I'll go. Move over.
- You suspected him, right?

2601
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:18,130
- Because...
- Move over.

2602
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:21,430
(Haha suddenly wants to go
on the straw mat.)

2603
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:24,470
- Seriously, it's not me.
- Move over.

2604
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:27,360
(Watching them carefully)

2605
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,390
- Me?
- Seriously, it's not me.

2606
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:30,390
- It's you.
- No, I'm not the spy.

2607
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:32,470
- I told you.
- It's Yang Se Chan.

2608
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:33,930
- He is...
- It's Yang Se Chan.

2609
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:35,300
- I just saw it.
- I'll just sit.

2610
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:36,580
- I just saw it.
- He's really...

2611
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:38,510
- Did you see that?
- He seemed excited.

2612
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:40,680
- I saw it. He smiled.
- When he got up from here...

2613
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,380
- He got up right away.
- You sit.

2614
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:44,220
(Se Chan smiled
when Haha was going to sit?)

2615
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:45,940
- Se Chan was...
- Let's just do it. It's me.

2616
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:47,720
- All right. Sit.
- What if it's not me?

2617
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,850
- How could you...
- I clearly saw it this time.

2618
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:52,220
Is it Se Chan or not?

2619
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:54,330
- It's him.
- I...

2620
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:55,760
If you're not the corrupt official,

2621
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,890
- you're just ugly.
- Hey.

2622
01:23:58,130 --> 01:23:59,130
Let's just go with him.

2623
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:00,600
- Okay.
- All right. Let's go.

2624
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,040
- It's him.
- It's Se Chan, right?

2625
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,470
- Okay. Let's do it.
- All right.

2626
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:06,010
(Is Se Chan the corrupt official?)

2627
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:07,040
Ring the Bell...

2628
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,140
- Of Truth.
- Of Truth.

2629
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:09,800
Ring the Bell...

2630
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,900
(Ring the Bell of Truth.)

2631
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:13,470
All right. Chapter Five,

2632
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:16,220
"Altair and Vega".
The corrupt official is...

2633
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:17,920
(Who is the corrupt official
of "Altair and Vega"?)

2634
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:22,050
Is it Yang Se Chan?

2635
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:23,590
- Is it?
- It is.

2636
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:26,650
(Yang Se Chan is...)

2637
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:27,720
It's not me.

2638
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,630
(Yang Se Chan is...)

2639
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:32,190
- It's Yang Se Chan.
- You...

2640
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:33,930
(They successfully arrested
the corrupt official.)

2641
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:35,390
- My gosh.
- That was amazing.

2642
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:37,510
- Gosh, Jae Seok...
- I knew it.

2643
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:40,880
(Jae Seok caught Se Chan
from the look on his face.)

2644
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,400
- I knew it.
- My gosh.

2645
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:47,050
(Impressed)

2646
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:50,010
- You did a great job.
- That was impressive.

2647
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:51,680
- I said it wasn't me.
- Sure.

2648
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:52,720
Well played.

2649
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,010
It was so close.

2650
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:55,310
I saw your face at that very moment.

2651
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:57,960
He kept staring at me like this.

2652
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,720
(When Haha was being cornered
instead of him...)

2653
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,220
(Jae Seok caught the movement
of Se Chan's lips.)

2654
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:06,100
(The corrupt official couldn't
hide his joy for the moment.)

2655
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,130
That was impressive.

2656
01:25:07,130 --> 01:25:08,800
- I saw it.
- Is that right?

2657
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,500
- This is amazing.
- All right then.

2658
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,860
- I saw it.
- Now Se Chan gets...

2659
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:14,230
20 penalty balls.

2660
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:16,840
And you guys have
one penalty ball each.

2661
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,100
- It serves you right.
- Se Chan was flustered.

2662
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:20,920
Good job.

2663
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,510
- Well done.
- Okay.

2664
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:24,480
Put in the penalty balls.

2665
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,350
- It was so close.
- Well played.

2666
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,720
I will show you
what the penalty is then.

2667
01:25:29,810 --> 01:25:31,430
- What is it?
- I wonder what it is.

2668
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:32,520
This feels really nice.

2669
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:33,550
Is it gourd-breaking?

2670
01:25:34,390 --> 01:25:37,130
- It's gourd-breaking.
- Is that it?

2671
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:39,690
I don't think this will break.

2672
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:42,500
- My gosh.
- This is easy.

2673
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:43,760
I don't think this will break.

2674
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:44,760
I hope I won't pick my own name.

2675
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,510
You all have 1 ball each,
and Se Chan has 20 balls.

2676
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,040
- Really?
- Yes.

2677
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,940
Then it will be Se Chan for sure.

2678
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:52,010
I know, right?

2679
01:25:52,010 --> 01:25:53,010
Please.

2680
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:54,420
(It is highly likely that
Se Chan will get the penalty.)

2681
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:57,680
(But there can be a surprise.)

2682
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,220
- What if he picks the one ball?
- I picked one.

2683
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:02,390
- Please. Lucky.
- What if he picks the one ball?

2684
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:05,520
(Whose side will Lady Luck be on?)

2685
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:06,630
Let's go.

2686
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:09,460
- If I get picked here, I'm cursed.
- Exactly.

2687
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:12,360
You are only three times
more likely to get picked.

2688
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:15,890
- Okay.
- No way.

2689
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:17,560
(Who will do the gourd-breaking?)

2690
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,710
- Yang.
- Yes!

2691
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:21,010
I knew it.

2692
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:22,100
(Yang Se Chan gets the penalty.)

2693
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,710
I knew it.

2694
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,140
It has to be Yang.

2695
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,010
- Be careful.
- It hurts.

2696
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:28,580
- That's no big deal.
- It hurts.

2697
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:31,010
(A snapping sound)

2698
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:34,110
(The gourd makes a snapping sound
through his skull.)

2699
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:38,050
(It hurts even more
when the gourd doesn't break.)

2700
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,720
(Shuddering)

2701
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,430
- I should break it at once.
- That looks hard.

2702
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:43,550
- You should break it at once.
- Oh, no.

2703
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,360
- Die!
- It doesn't hurt anymore.

2704
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:49,840
- Now I'm scared.
- You have to do it right away.

2705
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:53,100
(He kisses the gourd goodbye.)

2706
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:54,540
I have to break it at once.

2707
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:57,850
(He successfully breaks
the last gourd.)

2708
01:26:57,850 --> 01:26:59,300
- Well done.
- Ta-da.

2709
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:02,310
So this is the end of Chapter Five
of Running Chronicles.

2710
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:04,310
- Okay.
- All right.

2711
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:06,050
- Thank you.
- Thank you all for your hard work.

2712
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:07,310
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2713
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:08,790
The last mind game
was really thrilling.

2714
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:11,330
- It really was.
- This is so neat.

2715
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:12,650
(The Running Chronicles
has come to a happy ending.)

2716
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,220
(July 2022, Sangam-dong)

2717
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,600
Excuse me.

2718
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:19,970
(The members are making
shady deals.)

2719
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,430
(Why are they wandering
around Sangam-dong?)

2720
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,100
(Hide your name!)

2721
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,880
(They can go anywhere they want.)

2722
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:29,900
(It's an unlimited
name tag hide-and-seek.)

2723
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:33,770
(They have to betray others
to keep their name tags safe.)

2724
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:37,610
(Your name can become your weapon.)

2725
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:39,290
Someone's in there.

2726
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:40,680
Did you see So Min?

2727
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:43,460
(But sometimes it can
become your weakness.)

2728
01:27:43,650 --> 01:27:46,890
(Passerby, producer, cafe staff)

2729
01:27:46,890 --> 01:27:49,800
(Or anyone...)

2730
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,130
(Anyone can become your accomplice.)

2731
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:55,640
(The Running Tag of Tails)
